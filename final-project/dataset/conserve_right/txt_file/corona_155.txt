source ap photo lynne sladky as americans debate how to reopen our society in the wake of covid 19 we seem to be breaking down into three groups first those who believe the virus isn t particularly serious and desperately want to reopen everything as soon as possible a small minority of americans by polling data second those who believe the virus is extraordinarily serious and want everything to remain closed as long as possible a significant minority of americans and third those who believe the virus is extraordinarily serious that the economic damage brought about by covid 19 is extraordinarily serious and that we will have to reopen in considered fashion the vast majority of americans while politicians on either side of the debate hope to position their opponents as advocates of either group 1 or group 2 the reality is that the honest debate is happening within group 3 so what does a considered coronavirus reopening strategy look like that question rests on a deeper question what assumptions are we making obviously we all want to reduce deaths to the lowest possible number but what assumptions are baked into our policy recommendations are we assuming a vaccine will come along in three six 12 or 18 months are we assuming herd immunity conferred at 60 of the population or 80 are we assuming therapeutic measures that would reduce the infection fatality rates by 20 30 or 100 and within what period of time we also want to reduce economic harm to the lowest possible level again we must ask what assumptions are baked into our policy recommendations are we assuming that a 75 reduction in restaurant seating will save 50 of restaurants are we assuming that shoppers will continue to socially distance six months from now are we assuming that the government will be able to shoulder trillions more in debt despite an underlying decrease in international appetite for such debt the question of assumptions is key to our policymaking that s because if we assume the worst no therapeutics that seriously knock down the infection fatality rate no vaccines for 18 months or more and an economy that simply cannot function at one quarter or even half of normal capacity then we are forced to a simple conclusion in the absence of any significant change to the status quo we must pursue a strategy of so called controlled avalanche that strategy has been coined by israeli scientists who suggest that the best strategy for reducing deaths while achieving herd immunity would be to tranche populations and then expose the least vulnerable populations to covid 19 in order to let them develop antibodies in essence performing with public health the same function ski resorts perform when they create small avalanches in order to avoid a major avalanche the simple fact is that 40 to 50 at low estimate of all deaths in the european union from covid 19 have occurred at nursing homes the same is true in california had the authorities properly protected nursing homes the infection fatality rate across the industrialized world could be half of the current rate it is also true that the infection fatality rate for covid 19 ranges widely by age as of late april of the 37 308 deaths recorded by the centers for disease control and prevention just 1 036 were people under the age of 45 and just 51 were below the age of 25 even among younger populations the vast majority of deaths were people with underlying conditions israeli scientists suggest that protecting the elderly and the vulnerable and then allowing herd immunity to develop among the least vulnerable would radically reduce overall mortality by over 40 reduce the maximum number of people in need for icus by over 60 and decrease the time required to allow freedom to low risk populations by months this is obviously not a foolproof strategy there is no foolproof strategy but it may be a better strategy than simply hoping for the best while watching the world economy implode even as we know that our deepest hopes for a deus ex machina may go unrewarded thom tillis s first tv ad of the election is a candid one townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
