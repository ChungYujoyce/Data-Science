apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing the face of dissatisfaction with china s communist party is the face of the man synonymous with it mao zedong portraits of the revolutionary leader often led packs of demonstrators in protests over japan s effort last week to bolster its hold on islands claimed by china many were hoisted by people born after his death 36 years ago mao widely revered by the chinese and praised by communist party leaders is supposed to serve as a unifying symbol but often it isn t so top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey to some he represents a condemnation of corruption and inequality under a government that long ago abandoned his radical policies more frequently this week his image was a subtle slap by nationalists who accuse leaders of being too weak in the territorial dispute mao zedong was tough he never backed down when it came to the national interests said lu lei a beijing salesman who went to the japanese embassy with his friends to protest tuesday our current government is spineless if mao were alive we would have already attacked japan mao has become a safe way for chinese to criticize a government bent on stifling dissent his giant portrait still looks out to tiananmen square in the heart of beijing and his name is etched into the country s constitution and the party s charter even if his ideology has been abandoned in practice rarely has his image been displayed in such numbers as during the protests this week rows of his portraits floated through the parades often in the company of a sea of red flags in an eerie resemblance to the scenes from the fervent days of the cultural revolution when mao was worshipped as a god mixed messages behind the scenes of the angry protests that rippled across more than two dozen cities this week runs an undercurrent of grievances many of them critical of the government protesters held up signs that touched on broader social issues such as corruption food safety and the widening gap between poor and rich some protesters even joked that urban code enforcers resented by the chinese public for their brutality against unlicensed street peddlers should be sent to fight the japanese military those messages mixed with anti japanese slogans on a rare occasion when the government tolerated and at times abetted public demonstrations this movement has multiple purposes nationalism is only part of the protests said zheng yongnian director of the east asian institute at the national university of singapore more people are angry about the current government and they wanted to use this opportunity to vent the government normally inclined to crush protests allowed these of public anti japanese fury to gain leverage in its latest tiff with tokyo over small uninhabited east china sea islands called the senkaku by japanese and the diaoyu by chinese japan controls the islands and purchased them from their private owners last week thwarting plans by tokyo s

resolving the dispute between the two asian economic powerhouses allowing the protests however carries risks for china as protesters can bend the intended message they sent a quiet critique with a

japan protests many chinese are worried about the chairman s re emergence on the scene his most ardent supporters tend to be stridently nationalistic and advocate an authoritarian populism some protesters called for the release of bo xilai the disgraced politician and a populist who was ousted from the leadership in a political scandal wang zheng a beijing teacher who has been detained for her support of mr bo said the public remembers mao as a resolute man who showed no ambiguity on sovereignty issues our government has been spineless on many things diaoyu being one of them she said the diplomatic protests are meaningless when they are not backed with actions the government has behaved the same year after year making the public more nostalgic about mao some protesters employed other methods to use the outrage against japan as a jumping off point to deliver other messages in beijing some held up signs saying they would be willing to eat unsafe food to reclaim the islands
