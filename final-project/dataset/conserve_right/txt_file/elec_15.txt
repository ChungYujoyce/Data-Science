klobuchar announced her 2020 presidential intentions i am running for this job for every person who wants their work recognized and rewarded and every parent who wants a better world for their kids said klobuchar i am running for every american and no matter what i ll lead from the heart she went on to call for a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united for passing a law that automatically registers americans to vote at age 18 for universal background checks for gun owners for sweeping legislation addressing climate change and for net neutrality for all if you don t know the difference between a hack and slack it s time to get off the digital highway said klobuchar in a cringe worth line apparently meant to demonstrate her tech savvy the 56 year old three term senator has received less national attention than fellow democratic senators like kamala harris calif and elizabeth warren mass both of whom have already announced their 2020 candidacies klobuchar could benefit from that if it means she s seen as having less baggage too but that reputation suffered last week with the release of several stories describing her as a terror to work for klobuchar demeaned and berated her staff almost daily subjecting them to bouts of explosive rage and regular humiliation within the office according to interviews and dozens of emails reviewed by buzzfeed her office had the highest staff turnover rate in the senate between 2001 2016 according to politico and then there s this from huffpost talked to a franken staffer who had an odd experience with a klobuchar staffer https t co yc7gimoifc pic twitter com sg3hzqwzd2 amanda terkel aterkel february 8 2019 liberal pundits have rallied around klobuchar anyway with many dismissing the idea that how a senator treats subordinates should matter when assessing her fitness for office some suggested it was only an issue because she s a woman but in general and especially with klobuchar campaigning as the nice midwestern anti trump her temperament behind the scenes matters blowing up at staff and driving them away at high rates don t suggest minnesota nice nor someone who may handle presidential pressure well more so than being a member of congress even head of state is a position that requires restraint and good people skills to do well aside from the high employee turnover distinction klobuchar s tenure in congress hasn t been terribly remarkable the successful legislation she s sponsored mostly falls in the category of completely useless and on occasion actively bad one of her first successful bills toughened formaldehyde emission standards for plywood fiberboard and particleboard another set up the attorney general to micromanage the disposal of drugs at nursing homes she s sponsored several bills that slightly tweak the process of adopting children from abroad and one about rural call quality some of klobuchar s worst work has been around human trafficking legislation she introduced saw that the national human trafficking hotline a federal clearinghouse for trafficking tips that provides no actual victims assistance nor investigative action but does report to federal agents could get more funding than grants going directly to victims services another klobuchar law expanded funding for the department of transportation to study and spread dubious propaganda about human trafficking she s also been an outspoken supporter of last year s federal ban on prostitution ads fosta sesta and a 2017 anti trafficking measure that was full of civil liberties concerns in september 2017 klobuchar joined john mccain in trying to get tough on online political advertising in order to address alleged election interference as scott shackford wrote at the time russian meddling is just being used as an excuse to do what politicians and federal agencies have wanted for a long time to regulate how people campaign online so far this year klobuchar has introduced legislation to strengthen federal law enforcement involvement in cases of stalking and domestic violence to ban deals between pharmaceutical companies that delay generic versions of medication coming to market and to tighten regulations on social media companies advertisement next the suv that s about to change asset forfeiture rules nationwide elizabeth nolan brown is a senior editor at reason

educated accomplished female the disaffected white nationalist incel s worst nightmare an educated accomplished female the disaffected white nationalist incel s worst nightmare from all accounts as assholish as you i do think arty is has the bigger cunt lol 1 000 000 chatter all you like wingnuts but be sure to obey your betters preferences every day culture wars have consequences especially for the vanquished at the stale fringe of society you ll have to forgive kirkland he needs to feel like his ideology is winning despite worldwide evidence to the contrary without that validation there s nothing to drown out the memory of the rectal prolapse his father developed while working for a better life for him especially when the people being shit on have had enough and when those people have all the guns and the training to use them ne afraid arty be very afraid lest you forget that there are giants in the playground if temperament doesn t matter then what s the problem with trump temperament does matter as someone who starts off positively inclined toward klobuchar these reports cost her big points with me that said i couldn t give less of a fuck about the opinion of any trump supporter with the chutzpah to criticize the temperament of pretty much any other human being on earth does that work the other way too because if so you are saying that it s acceptable for trump supporters to simply ignore the opinions of everyone with the chutzpah to support klobuchar despite her temperament seems to me that s not exactly a productive way back to civil discourse of course it works both ways if you defend your candidate over behavior for which you excoriate an opponent you re a hypocritical hack not worth engaging trump just happens to be such a mountain of vile defects that uncritical supporters sacrifice their standing to raise an historically broad range of character attacks on his opponents google paid for every week online work from home 8000 to 10000 dollars i have received first month 24961 and 35274 in my last month paycheck from google and i work 3 to 5 hours a day in my spare time easily from home it s really user friendly and i m just so happy that i found out about it go to this site for more details so i started http www topcash28 com like amy comey barrett excuse me but are we talking about the same woman i mean there are educated accomplished females this twit doesn t sound like one of them she sounds like a rotating bitch just what the democrat party needs another egomaniacal candidate with anger management issues like john lurch s cousin kerry csp all arty cares about is that she is one of the elites he has been ordered to obey and he will hold the opinions his masters have ordered him to hicklibs are always jealous of virile chads let me know when dr condoleeza rice runs for president she ll have my vote i m supposed to tell you senator klobuchar says the weather is terrible because i m bad at my job god senator klobuchar who outside of wherever this lady is from nobody gives a shit yeah don t see her getting anywhere at the kavanaugh hearings klobuchar looked better than spartacus the nutmeg rambo and people s prosecutor whitehouse but that is setting the bar so low than a granny with a walker at a nursing home could clear it never mind her horrible policies i m not voting for anyone who doesn t have enough sense not to stand around giving a speech in a snow storm klobuchar demeaned and berated her staff almost daily subjecting them to bouts of explosive rage and regular humiliation within the office according to interviews and dozens of emails reviewed by buzzfeed this sounds exactly like the kind of sexist coverage that hillary clinton endured in 2016 powerful women in this country are routinely accused of being difficult or erratic where a man would be praised for his strength or boldness it s one of the more insidious ways the misogynistic patriarchy holds women back is klobuchar my first choice no kamala harris still is but of course i ll support her if she gets the democratic nomination just like i would support any of the declared democratic candidates except tulsi gabbard you gave up on hillary this quickly i ve made it quite clear that if clinton says she s running she instantly becomes my top choice voting for her in 2016 was one of the proudest moments of my life and i would love to do so again in 2020 your taking the parody too far into absurdity the impossible dream what will you do about democrats that dissent and do not immediately kneel before the most qualified candidate ever summary execution obviously gabbard is in favor of peace refreshing so why except tulsi gabbard tulsi is being accused by democrats of being a putin agent because she opposes war in syria not kidding the user you ve responded to is a parody of said democrats you have to understand most of this afscme problem was when she was adjusting from working at a private law firm where the associates had to be smart as hell and totally indefatigable to survive to working at a county government office where one cross look at a lazy employee gets you summoned to a meeting with the diversity officer in hr no shit the staff at the county attorney office was a shock to her compared to what she was used to and all this crap you are reading is a bunch of whiny crap from afscme workers of course she is a democrat so she has to be contrite but in my mind it means she will be a whip cracking hardass running the west wing and she won t have 6 hours a day of executive time hey if you want a great college football coach are you not going to hire nick saban because he is a tool to work for and his staff turns over almost every year results matter not the whiny complaints of unionized workers imstillwithcunts anycuntwilldo why is she wearing a helmet because she s a spaceball and jonah goldberg gets one right for a change nailed it jonah goldberg tells rep ocasio cortez what to just admit about the green new deal faq backfire just admit you committed one of the greatest kinsley gaffes in decades your office obviously released what you actually think would it be nice if you people could keep your lame draconian work ethic off our bodies why should someone have to work to survive in the wealthiest country on earth don t say because without people working we wouldn t be the wealthiest country that s a universal welfare program whereas libertarians consider individual liberty to be the paramount good so what could promote individual liberty more than a ubi or something that provides for basic needs without people having to stick themselves in jobs they hate just to survive i ll leave aside the fact that an individual liberty focus is also a universal welfare scheme a national policy with specific implications for all people it would just confuse matters we ll also leave aside that right wing scum still deny scientific fact that is inconvenient to their industries they whore for tony here you are once again saying you support slavery look it sucks that there s no free lunch it sucks for everyone but that s the nature of the universe people didn t make it this way its just the nature of living in a reality with entropy someone has to pay for your lunch what s sad about you though is that you can never articulate a cogent argument as to why peter should be forced to pay for paul s lunch if paul isn t capable of doing so and now here you are saying that peter should be forced to pay for paul s lunch even if paul refuses to do so i m saying expand your mind to decouple work from virtue and virtue from deserving to eat taxpayers give death row inmates food and shelter after all an economy and the distribution of goods and services should only depend on human beings working to the extent that it needs to what if hypothetically robots did everything should we still work so that our souls are right with jesus besides libertarians with their support of cronyist and plutocratic wealth distribution policies have already decoupled work from wealth far more than even i might or do you not support letting inheritance and capital gains go relatively untaxed so i should expand my mind to encompass enslaving other people i should think not you re the only one talking about slavery and it s coming across as hysterical then how do you propose we ensure those unwilling to work why should someone have to work to survive in the wealthiest country on earth unless you re going to steal some of what they produce to give to others while taking a cut for yourself the public sector of the economy we all pay in and we get back whatever our elected representatives decide is best for either us or them now you re saying that we should take a system that already exists but can t do what you want it to do and somehow it will magically do this when it hasn t been able to do so so far so top men i see the public sector of the economy we all pay in and we get back whatever our elected representatives decide is best for either us or them everyone pays taxes and it s not slavery when politicians do it they say so themselves with law supporting yourself and doing so in excess to help others is virtue dumb fuck slaver is that why people get rich to help others you ve resorted to denying the existence of greed in order to defend your tax rates it s the other way around dullard people get rich because they ve helped others to a considerable extent everyone who bought a personal computer made available by bill gates did so willingly the enormous number of people who ve shopped at amazon com over the last twenty years did so willingly so jeff bezos made an enormous bunch of money by contrast you would force some people to work extract some of the wealth they made through their labor and give it to people unwilling to work and you think such behavior is virtuous how perfect is it that your two examples of success in capitalism are quasi monopolies i think having good manners and being kind to people are virtuous behaviors generating revenue for the purpose of funding the ceo s second home has nothing to do with virtue and should only be something people are forced to do if absolutely necessary quasi monopoly microsoft seriously with apple google linux etc in the same os market with apple google firefox opera and about 20 more in the browser market in fact edge barely has any market penetration then office 2019 360 that s a quasi monopoly with google docs apple again and multiple other productivity software developers or how about the quasi monopoly microsoft doesn t have on hardware which is the reason it has so much market penetration in the os sector because ms allows it to run on anything unlike apple how about whole foods safeway costco paramount dolci and gabana or all those also quasi monopolies just because there s only a couple hundred competitors in their markets generating revenue for the purpose of funding the ceo s second home has nothing to do with virtue i don t know about virtue but if you re talking about the worker who is helping generate this revenue i think the work is remarkably beneficial 1 the ceo gets a second home win 2 the worker gets paid win 3 the consumer benefits from the product win i think many left wingers believe that 2 and 3 are actually losers in this situation they aren t they are winners too but if you have a personal axiom that 2 and 3 are losers then i guess that s that the people who got paid to build the 2nd home win the people from whom they bought supplies equipment food etc win the states and localities in which this all takes place get a tax revenue increase guess we ll call that a win for them i suppose we could have confiscated that 2nd house money from the ceo and forced it down to foodstamp pipeline where it somehow magically produces a 7x multiplier effect that the private spending on the ceos 2nd house would not how did i know that the but think about the yacht builders argument would show up the problem with the workforce of the very rich is that the very rich are so small in number the point is misallocation of resources try to keep up misallocation of resources it s only that because you and top men think that other peoples money should be spent the way you think it should be spent not the way they thin it should be spent so you should take it from them by force to properly allocate it only tony knows the correct allocation of resources everybody this is the dumbest argument i ve heard in a while if the economy would arrive at the point where you didn t need to work then you wouldn t need to rob peter to pay paul you would simply sit there and enjoy not working if however you soon discovered that no one else was responsible for providing you with for example toilet paper you would need to find a way of getting toilet paper for yourself and you would need to do so without forcing someone else no matter how rich they might be to provide it for you in short by all means don t work if you don t want to just don t expect anything from anyone else tony you need to learn to decouple work from virtue and wealth tony you ve already decoupled work from wealth with your support of low inheritance and capital gains taxes maybe tony just maybe that means the objection to forced redistribution isn t based on they shouldn t get my money because they don t work maybe just maybe it s the far simpler they shouldn t get my money because it s my money and i should be able to control how it is used why is it your money government prints it and decides on how much to tax it it holds a monopoly over its supply if it taxes you the taxed portion is legally logically and in every way not your money ah yes keep shifting those goalposts 1 i m pointing out how a person can simultaneously be a opposed to inheritance taxes and b opposed to forced redistribution contrary to your assertion i don t think the objection to forced redistribution of property is based merely on the fact that the recipient hasn t earned the money via work it s also based on that whole non aggression principle thing that underlies libertarianism 2 you were discussing philosophical virtue and morality not legality i responded in kind by noting the objection to forced redistribution it s a philosophical objection not a legal one sweden that paragon of socialist democracy lets inheritance go untaxed so tony is saying if i want something and don t feel like paying for it that i can just come and take what i decide i need off him ok that would certainly be the case in the absence of government tony do you know how pathetic you sound you are literally advocating for slave culture so the lazy can sit back and live off the work of others you mean how you do when you want to underfund or not fund all the public goods and services that you use every single day you re still saying people only deserve food and shelter if they work i say they deserve it for being born human not luxuries but basic needs the same way you deserve enforced property rights the armed forces and the other government services you like just for being born human which public goods and don t forget that this phrase has a specific meaning and its not whatever government does am i underfunding police emergency services the military road building which ones are you paying republican tax rates then everything i m in that top 10 of taxpayers paying almost everything dummy ditto i m in that top 10 of taxpayers paying almost everything dummy in tony s eyes if you re still rich defined as not being totally dependent on government handouts for your existence you re still not paying your fair share the only point that is legitimate is that servicing debt is already enslaving people who made no decision to incur it and received no benefit from it so one can make a case that they should freely receive the income necessary to pay it off in its entirety and should not have to forced to work to do so so you re saying that the republican tax rates are so progressive that the bottom 47 of the countries earners aren t paying their fair share and are you saying roads are underfunded or police you know they guys who literally have time to chase pot smokers down they don t have enough money cops definitely have too much money add in the military and you start to get the impression that funding the shooty parts of government doesn t seem to be as politically controversial as spending on feeding and hosing people and stuff feeding and housing people aren t public goods and no one is stopping you from doing so you like to virtue signal your hipness by dissing on cops but the society you re desperate for will depend on a massively enlarged population of jackbooted thugs with guns in order to separate people from all the stuff you want to take you ve never taken a second s worth of self reflection in your entire life have you you think the military is overpaid for the work they do how about teachers are you paying republican tax rates then everything tony s too stupid to realize that revenue has never exceeded 20 of gdp regardless of the tax rate tell that to the garbage truck driver sewer line maintenance workers water treatment workers or all the other people on dirty jobs with rowe they arent doing it out of kindness dumbfuck yet you would prefer to enslave them so you can sit on your ass you re a piece of shit you people are entirely too emotional about this you re talking about how people should have to contribute to their society in order to earn their share of its benefits hello we re talking about the same thing we are all social engineers most of us think it s practical to achieve our social engineering goals using the tool of capitalism the only debate we actually have is which laws are placed on our version of capitalism hello we re talking about the same thing no we re not you re talking about how you can enslave a portion of humanity so another portion can sit on their arses all day we are all social engineers stuff that lie up your ass so you don t want to change laws that affect me likely against my will no i simply don t want to be affected by the same laws if it were possible for you to form your own legal enclave with like minded people then i would be all for you doing so all you guys could get together and figure out how you re all going to eat which one of you is going to have to do all the work so that the others don t have to i just don t want you pointing the gun at my head demanding that i be the one to support you but aggy you owe it to him for being born of course he places no real clue on personhood and would be just as happy to murder a newborn with the excuse that it s a woman s choice sounds like tony needs to move to joisey so you don t want to change laws that affect me likely against my will iow not giving is taking the parasite s motto you re talking about how people should have to contribute to their society in order to earn their share of its benefits given that you re a progressive it s no wonder you view this through the community lens viewing things at an individual level is completely foreign to you you re talking about how people should have to contribute to their society in order to earn their share of its benefits leftists can contribute to society by self immolating i say they deserve it for being born human wonderful tell that to god he s the one that made the universe the way it is god is a superstition i drink your milkshake then i suggest that you figure out how to deal with reality because with no god to appeal to the universe is going to stay as it is once you figure out how to beat entropy let us know that s how you ll get your nobody ever has to labor for existence yeah i ll bet you want to suck on all those big veiny straws until the milkshake comes out don t you tony deviant commie piece of shit better you should go drink your drano tony don t lump me in with the rest i don t won t begrudge you a trough of oatmeal in the morning and an american cheese sandwich on white bread for dinner but guaranteeing you a wage even if it s at the world bank international poverty level of 2 a day seems a little much since you could earn that in 15 minutes already at the federal minimum wage but if you are expecting any more than that why should you get almost as much as someone swapping bedpans and giving spongebaths at the nursing home and why should their taxes subsidize your lifestyle tony s organs should be harvested just like every other useless progressive you re still saying people only deserve food and shelter if they work i say they deserve it for being born human not luxuries but basic needs nope i ll be happy to give them basic needs so here s their coupons for beans and rice i ll pay for beans and rice not foodstamps or ebt card that can be spent on virtually anything in a store anything above beans and rice is luxuries not basic needs a bed in a warehouse barracks is basic needs not affordable housing a basic income that pays for iphones tattoos cigarettes beer is not providing basic needs why should someone have to work to survive in the wealthiest country on earth for that matter why should one have to be alive to get a basic income we certainly don t hire them so that they can earn an income which is blatant discrimination and we have no idea what they might actually be in need of on the other side what if they really are pining for the fjords or would pine for the fjords if we didn t stuff them in a box and bury them deep in the ground free the norwegian blue justice for the distinctly odored don t let granny starve just because she no longer moves why should someone have to work to survive in the wealthiest country on earth i don t care if you work a but then i don t care if you eat either you pathetic piece of shit why should someone have to work to survive in the wealthiest country on earth because the rest of us don t owe you shit you lazy little twat jcr except please contribute to the community pool that funds police and courts so i can have privaet property and all the other stuff i want from government because my wants are legitimate because i m special i don t see why you d quote yourself in this situation the rest of us pay our way you goddamn proggie parasite well that would be a real zinger except that the courts have decided many times that the cops i m forced to pay for have no obligation at all to protect my life or my property try again leftard jcr the dark heart of the rank and file socialist the desire not to have to make any positive contribution to their society tony dear either you are attempting satire or your meds need adjusting badly i mean seriously so what could promote individual liberty more than a ubi or something that provides for basic needs without people having to stick themselves in jobs they hate just to survive you must know that every attempt to implement this idea and it is more than a century old has been a disaster it cannot be done unless you have a large number of hard working people willing to see a lot of the fruit of their labor handed over to work shy bums and somehow such people are always in short supply so unwilling people must be rounded up with guns and somehow that always ends up with the people who actually control the guns running things and the idealists in labor camps or mass graves pretty much the whole of the 20th century was devoted to trying various flavors of socialism and that is where the ubi leads after all and the vast majority of them lead to piles of corpses socialism murdered not killed as in war dead murdered 100 million people in one century if one assumes as the left would like us to that naziism is distinct from socialism it isn t then it is less disreputable than socialism it only murdered 10 12 million people maybe many of them don t realize it but socialists are mass murder fans as long as tony benefits from the slave labor he s happy with it tony doesn t give a shit about anyone else tony is a sociopath evil is his way tony dear either you are attempting satire or your meds need adjusting badly i mean seriously so what could promote individual liberty more than a ubi or something that provides for basic needs without people having to stick themselves in jobs they hate just to survive you must know that every attempt to implement this idea and it is more than a century old has been a disaster it cannot be done unless you have a large number of hard working people willing to see a lot of the fruit of their labor handed over to work shy bums and somehow such people are always in short supply so unwilling people must be rounded up with guns and somehow that always ends up with the people who actually control the guns running things and the idealists in labor camps or mass

disreputable than socialism it only murdered 10 12 million people maybe many of them don t realize it but socialists are mass murder fans an individual liberty focus is also a universal welfare scheme wut i m becoming convinced that tony is just a parody no one could say this with a straight face no one could say this with a straight face he does and has many times he s on record as explicitly saying that freedom to him is determined by how much he can take from others he is heart and soul nothing more than a parasite but unlike most parasites he doesn t understand what will happen when he winds up killing his host tony is a true believer and a wonderful resource he demonstrates undistilled progressivism better than most would it be nice if you people could keep your lame draconian work ethic off our bodies why should someone have to work to survive in the wealthiest country on earth how old are you i seriously cannot believe you are of adult age whoa i had no idea that tony was a big fan of slavery whoa i had no idea that tony was a big fan of slavery you must be new around here welcome head of state is a position that requires restraint and good people skills to do well seems like a pretty low bar for the 2020 election minnesota nice branding belies mean streak and temper said staff will it harm her presidential chances i think her temper will affect her chances less than the fact that no one outside of minnesota has ever heard of her before head of state is a position that requires restraint and good people skills to do well i guess that leaves hillary clinton out in the cold zero accomplishments zero leadership zero appeal to voters the centerpiece of her campaign will be her appeal to voters in the same election where minnesota voters elected a republican controlled state senate she won over 60 of the vote in her us senate race and swept every single us house district in the state her whole reason for running is perceived electability minnesota voters are more like average canadian voters than average american voters she won in minnesota because she has a famous name because of press bias and because the minnesota republican party couldn t find any worthwhile candidates minnesota also voted tv comedian al franken and jesse the body ventura into statewide office also mondale it s not a state where voters make thoughtful choices on average once in a while they wake up but mostly they shuffle along with the herd not all states can send louie gohmerts roy moores david vitters and steve kings into elected office nope those states send northam and fairfax to office nice you burned that f ing troll jesse ventura the will of minnesota voters is not the will of the standard electorate they be crazy or they like to be entertained will it harm her presidential chances not among democrats00 nice typo skwerlz blowing up at staff and driving them away at high rates don t suggest minnesota nice i dunno presenting a likeable popular public image while being awful to people in private is pretty much the definition of minnesota nice garrison ass grabber keillor could not be reached for comment it s not called the land of 10 000 manifestations of passive aggressive behavior for nothing not true you have minneapolis jerk and minnesota nice minneapolis and a few of the slopped over surrounding suburbs edina richfield are uppity urbans who generally feel entitled to treat everyone like staff the rest of minnesota is in fact quite likable we are also being overwhelmed because like every other nice place the jerks who destroyed their domain are now moving into our areas and bringing their moronic lifestyles with them i caught a few minutes of the announcement literally everything she proposed sound terrible literally everything don t know how much of it was standard d fair but just one example automatic voter registration when a person turns 18 no bitch 1 registering to vote isn t hard and the idea that voting should be as easy as possible requiring as little effort as possible is idiotic and self destructive 2 why not come right out and say our entire election strategy revolves around fraudulent votes we ve been studying the ussr and various african dictatorships to find the most effective methods voter roles limited only by population estimates should help no you re the fascist cases of fraudulent voting show up in single digit numbers in statewide races it s a horeshit lie made up by politicians who benefit from fewer people voting so the solutions they propose whose motive not even they will cop to voting should be difficult distort the franchise orders of magnitude more than the bullshit fascist propaganda of voting fraud does voting should deliberately be an obstacle course and you have the nerve to criticize other fascists who just fabricate the outcome you have the same ends just with more subtle means how about the best approximation of the actual majority will of the actual people be the ideal we strive for as a democracy he s a fascist you say that like you consider it to be a bad thing this is confusing since you were up there advocating the return of slavery today i was advocating a functioning modern state that bends more toward justice than the status quo and makes the quality of life better for every human in the country but you can call it whatever you like justice is forcing others to provide for you so i guess you don t think we should have public defenders that should be great for justice tony thinking he s making one point doesn t realize he s actually making a different one it s possible i started drinking at 11 a m but public defenders are paid for by taxpayers and we have a hard enough time as it is giving justice to poor defendants as it is you are the idiots conflating the public sector of the economy with charity by rich people stop doing that public defenders no we don t have to provide those only if we want to lock people up or kill them then its incumbent upon us to pay for them but public defenders are not a public good assume we have a system in which people are subject to criminal justice proceedings for certain alleged antisocial infractions we discovered that blind justice simply cannot exist if the poor by definition cannot have legal counsel during those proceedings if you re saying you want anarchy well that might be fun not any better for the poor though we discovered that blind justice simply cannot exist if the poor by definition cannot have legal counsel during those proceedings yeah that s what i said and so if we aren t willing to pay for that then we don t try to cage people up it s possible i started drinking at 11 a m from the lies and general crap you post here i doubt you ever quite drinking where is the justice in forcing someone to labor solely for the benefit of others god you re dumb tony liberals fight any and all audits on voting nobody knows how much fraud there is due to this so in the absence of evidence you have come to a conclusion anyway http www nbcdfw com news loc 39441 html thus we should make voting harder for the elderly move those goalposts boy i did him the courtesy of not saying his anecdote wasn t the same as evidence voting restrictions should only exist if they do not distort the franchise more than the problem they re supposed to solve why is that not fair uh bro it wasn t an anecdote it is literally the definition of evidence was that really the best your 250k in student loan financed education could come up with looking like an idiot with the anecdotes aren t evidence line about actual evidence i love how stupid and desperate your posts have become it s like you can t read it s like you can t read this right here is an excellent example of projection once again the shitbag tony claims others are doing exactly what the shitbag tony is doing is that clear shitbag tony mean drunks shouldn t drunk sucks i know but i don t know if any cure for mean drunkenness and no vice is worth being a public embarrassment tony 2 10 19 11 43pm mean drunks shouldn t drunk sucks i know but i don t know if any cure for mean drunkenness and no vice is worth being a public embarrassment stupid shits shouldn t comment stupid shit if you think i somehow think of you other than my posts you re more stupid than you appear here i despise thug lefties and you are among the worst fuck off and die life must be so difficult being this emotional about things tony i m not concerned about fraudulent voting of the sort you are likely referring to i d just like a system that allows all valid voters to vote but only valid voters and that they vote once and only once specifically i d like to ensure that only legal citizens can vote because i don think that non citizens should vote i don t get to vote in china or canada or mexico so non citizens from other countries should not get to vote here similarly legal citizens of california or ohio should not be voting in florida or montana either i d like to ensure that legal voters vote in the specific district they are entitled to so that their representation is accurate i d like to ensure that they do not incorrectly cast additional ballots in other districts and ideally not in other states as a backstop whenever there s some question a provisional ballot should always be provided and allowed to be cast pending verification efforts also the current absentee and early voting by mail systems seems ripe for abuse so they need to somehow be included in the verification methods so that no one is denied a legal right to vote while preventing non citizens etc attempts to characterize failures on these front are always met with vague charges of racism and this never happens but we don t know because we re never allowed to make the effort republicans have mangled the franchise like a character in the saw franchise you ve had ample opportunity to prevent democratic constituencies from voting takes your wins and if you don t like a return to easier access then you can suck a taint because the government you want to impose on me is only legitimate if it is democratically accountable a not a republican b where did i say anything about democrats or republicans i said i d just like a system that allows all valid voters to vote but only valid voters and that they vote once and only once i don t think that s controversial at all perhaps you can expound as to why it is or why it impacts only democrats republicans have mangled the franchise like a character in the saw franchise this from someone who has expressed nary a peep about the democrats ballot harvesting in california which magically turned a reliably conservative district supposedly blue overnight just overturned the results with not even a hint of a chain of custody for those votes but assertions of fraud are all bullshit because tony says they are uh huh tony you think working for a living is an obstacle course go back to your mommy s basement and play with your games while the adults talk n kay she went on to call for a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united for passing a law that automatically registers americans to vote at age 18 for universal background checks for gun owners for sweeping legislation addressing climate change and for net neutrality for all yeah her personality doesn t count for shit so she wants to make sure only millionaires and politically corrupt parties can voice their political opinions by passing a constitutional amendment then she wants to make it immensely easier to fix votes by a lethargic population by pre registering everyone sounds like a good lil democrat oh and she hates those people who work for her a classist raging bitch yeap an elite democrat a few rumors about her being demanding and unpleasant to some of her underlings hardly scandal plagued if she were a man it wouldn t even be a story so you can point to some men that treat their aides with the same venom it shouldn t be too hard even harry fucking reid told her to stop being a bitch to her aides tom garrett is a vivid example you half educated rube and it cost him his seat you sure look smart proving his point declared major candidates and exploratory committees i don t remember reason covering julian castro s announcement to run for president in 2020 text amy to 911 is there a declared democrat candidate that s not a joke at this point nope the knee slapper is disaffected right wingers too deluded to recognize that they have lost the culture war and that republicans are roughly as likely to turn that around as melania trump is to earn a graduate degree i see you missed the point entirely asshole but given your level of stupidity that s not surprising maybe he was talking to himself so you admit that women should not have the choice to make wife and mother a career only women that bow to the socialist meme that all women must have degrees and jobs to count as a worthy human being disclosure i allow myself one response per year to tony and one to the rev donotfeedtrolls scandal plagued is a major stretch i don t think the strategy of defending her as having high expectations of workers and a blunt demeanor calm anyone s concerns it blames the victims and confirms that she s to some degree a bitch they should have gone with total denial if possible her entire appeal is her minnesota nice and this just makes her a pretender and liar in addition to a terrible bitch approaching psychopathic levels given the skill required to pull the false image off still probably my 2nd choice your second choice is a psychopath go team i want someone seasoned but not 20 years past retirement age unless it s on the supreme court or in congress his first choice clinton is the same way with her staff they crew of marine one when they had to transport her called it broomstick one they should have gone with total denial if possible notice the shitbag who claims to have some acquaintance to principles suggests out and out lying when confronted with a difficult issue registers americans to vote at age 18 why is registration necessary so that we aren t reviewing citizenship documents at the polls isn t minnesota nice defined as mean people pretending to be nice yes maybe we can thank the leftists in the state for that stereotype seriously the most proggy mn people i ve known are all a holes my favorite part about this is all the proggies on my fb feed having to pretend that any one of them is any good my proggy roommate loves harris but had no idea about willie brown etc wow there sure are a lot of democrats hoping to be picked as joe biden s veep running mate you mean hillary clinton s that would be great stillwithher sounds like an ill tempered nobody you always think people are talking about you though she s in minnesota announcing her plans to prosecute people who pay for sex if you seek amy but the important question is was she ever in blackface for a halloween costume you re a garbage poster oh look they let tulpa back into the public library again she ll be up against god emperor trump https www youtube com watch v 7ytlatkzxvs she went on to call for a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united for passing a law that automatically registers americans to vote at age 18 for universal background checks for gun owners for sweeping legislation addressing climate change and for net neutrality for all if she were pro gun rights pro deregulation pro free market anti tax fiscally conservative anti drug war and pragmatic in foreign policy would we give a shit if she had a bad personality it s almost like this is being offered up as a trade off but it isn t a trade off at all yeah she s got a bad personality but on the other hand she s also anti gun rights anti first amendment and a fucking socialist climate change too where s the upside for us she s not trump is that what you re trying to say for passing a law that automatically registers americans to vote at age 18 i will vote for that when a voter id becomes a concealed carry permit exactly i ve always said i d vote for the biggest racist asshole you can find if they end the drug war she went on to call for a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united for passing a law that automatically registers americans to vote at age 18 for universal background checks for gun owners for sweeping legislation addressing climate change and for net neutrality for all gaaak the problem with you people is you don t want to fix anything that needs fixing ooh venezuela what a cautionary tale for the united states much more important to focus on that than climate change well yeah giving power to the government has the inevitable consequences depicted in in venezuela but it ll be different when we do it with climate change 250k in student loan debt tony lol i don t know why you think college debt is an insult i happened to have earned a free ride thanks to my psat score but if i actually spend a quarter million it must have been a good school at least right nothing s different from anything idiots and psychopaths seizing power over countries happens whether we spend public money on this or that problem is a separate issue except to the extent that the leaders mental problems divert priorities in unfortunate ways build the wall tony 2 10 19 10 58pm i don t know why you think college debt is an insult i happened to have earned a free ride thanks to my psat score it s a shame some schools have such pathetically low levels of acceptance shitbag i m sure the asshole rev knows where you got your worthless paper you don t know how much it s worth the great fantabulous free market of labor tends to have what i m sure it thinks is a totally rational bias toward degree holders its worth nothing you could troll like you do with no college degree the problem with you people is you don t want to fix anything that needs fixing the problems with shitbags like you are your assumption you know what needs fixing and your immediate choice of thuggery and coercion to fix those non problems fuck off slaver oh so you don t think that anything needs fixing tony 2 10 19 10 53pm oh so you don t think that anything needs fixing not surprising that a fucking lefty ignoramus like you would assume that anyone not signing onto your pathetic claims thinks nothing needs fixing au contraire the deaths of you and your ignoramus bros would help fix a lot of problems way to bolster your point of view calling for mass death like that shitlord psycho everyone here thinks you re doing libertarianism a world of good i m sure tony 2 10 19 11 42pm way to bolster your point of view calling for mass death like that shitlord psycho mass deaths of murderous thugs is not a problem it is a solution exposing your genocidal nature only required the panic brought on by the ultimate failure of republicans to find a president who wasn t a corrupt licentious moron if only i had known that my sterling commentary wasn t the true key tony 2 11 19 12 18am exposing your genocidal nature i wasn t aware that wishing the early deaths of you and your fucking imbecilic bros constituted genocide and neither were you you fucking ignoramus nice try at claiming some victimhood not genocide at all thuggocide is sufficient and yes i propose it and hope for it the deaths of thuggish shitbags like you can only help mankind tony is right there are real problems and mere slogans don t count as solutions the solution doesn t have to be and shouldn t be more government intervention but there is a difference between i don t want government to solve problem x and i don t believe problem x is actually a problem at all chemjeff radical individualist 2 10 19 10 56pm tony is right there are real problems and mere slogans don t count as solutions tony is a fucking ignoramus who assumes a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united for passing a law that automatically registers americans to vote at age 18 for universal background checks for gun owners for sweeping legislation addressing climate change and for net neutrality for all are problems requiring fixing at all and you are a fucking ignoramus to claim he has a point note to foreign readers some commenters are unaware that misanthropic climate change was a soviet myth that survived as revealed faith http tinyurl com yyut3wv3 what does climate change have to do with medicare for all ubi labor rights that my major beef with climate change folks i personally agree that man s impact on the environment is bad for us in the long term and we should be doing things to mitigate and reverse those impacts but this crisis is for too often being used for social justice fronts rather than actual science and mitigation ottmar edenhofer un ipcc official basically it s a big mistake to discuss climate policy separately from the major themes of globalization the climate summit in cancun at the end of the month is not a climate conference but one of the largest economic conferences since the second world war but one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world s wealth by climate policy one has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy this has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole christiana figueres leader of the u n s framework convention on climate change this is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves which is to intentionally transform the economic development model for the first time in human history you know it between health care and climate change there is no place for money to hide people need care and businesses need energy it s total control or bust for the left no freedoms allowed there s a clever bit on regulated man the brexit movie that preceded the brexit vote that kind of makes the point what the un has in mind is economic dismemberment not an alleged development model former u s senator timothy wirth d co then representing the clinton gore administration as u s undersecretary of state for global issues addressing the same rio climate summit audience agreed we have got to ride the global warming issue even if the theory of global warming is wrong we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy christine stewart former canadian environment minister no matter if the science is all phoney there are collateral environmental benefits climate change provides the greatest chance to bring about justice and equality in the world david brower a founder of the sierra club the goal now is a socialist redistributionist society which is nature s proper steward and society s only hope emma brindal a climate justice campaigner coordinator for friends of the earth a climate change response must have at its heart a redistribution of wealth and resources at least a few of them are more honest about it monika kopacz atmospheric scientist it is no secret that a lot of climate change research is subject to opinion that climate models sometimes disagree even on the signs of the future changes e g drier vs wetter future climate the problem is only sensational exaggeration makes the kind of story that will get politicians and readers attention so yes climate scientists might exaggerate but in today s world this is the only way to assure any political action and thus more federal financing to reduce the scientific uncertainty researcher robert phalen s 2010 testimony to the california air resources board it benefits us personally to have the public be afraid even if these risks are trivial wow the dems really having a hard time coming up with a decent candidate not that they have one so far starbucks man schultz looks better than the others schultz not being a leech on the carcass of the dnc or rnc for that matter is the most wiling to have an actual conversation and despite having some misguided approaches i would certainly give him some listening time another day another democrat demanding the overthrow of the first amendment jcr why is it that democrats are so desperate for the vote of people who are to lazy irresponsible to get themselves a voting license maybe we should reintroduce the poll tax scandal plagued shouted the neutral and objective headline the establishment media which reason gets talking points from seems to be choosing to take a swipe at klobuchar today for whatever reason i guess it s because they ve picked kamala maybe they should be a little less confident in who they choose last time they chose their candidate trump won the election it s all in the framing a grandma helped her boyfriend register to vote she was just sentenced to prison for it the washington post n c election official sentenced for urging mexican citizen to vote in u s the washington times it s this witch hunt to sort of throw prison sentences and claim that there s voter fraud but it s never what they actually claim it s not instances of mass numbers of noncitizens claiming they can vote she said she wasn t trying to steal an election she was trying to make someone she loved feel empowered have his voice heard hardly nefarious intent a 66 year old north carolina woman was sentenced thursday to two months in federal prison for helping her boyfriend at the time a noncitizen vote even though federal prosecutors conceded she didn t check a box on his voter registration form indicating he was a citizen paige who pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting voting by a noncitizen will serve a year of supervised release after her prison sentence and pay a 250 fine she had faced a maximum prison sentence of five years and up to a 250 000 fine maga trump paul 2020 i am doing online google work at home and earn

their constitutional amendment banning aryan birth control for the next 35 years just like in ireland how many elections before democrats learn women can t have individual rights and outlaw electricity look at women s rights under luddism before there was electric power glad to see senator klobuchar join the race looking forward to see what she has to offer president trump has routinely belittled his cabinet secretaries and other white house staff in public but that s acceptable after all he is a man and men have to be tough so what if senator klobuchar s a tough boss she running to be president not the head of a day care center let s focus on her take on the issues and not worry if her staff have their feeling hurt judging by her performance in the kavanaugh hearings she ll do

2citypays com is it just me or are there too many dems in the field already i wonder if this overpopulation of zeroes is in fact a fundraising tactic to get away from hillary s money yes that would be an extraordinary event fluff campaigns usually get tossed up to create invoices to family members and run their campaign account to zero about the time polling data shows them to be a farce which dries up the money and no matter what i ll lead from the heart exactly what i look for in a president someone that leads with their emotions instead of logic and reason typical i would fully support registering all 18 year olds to vote with one additional condition pass the exam that all prospective citizens need to pass this would expose the terrible job that our schools do at educating our youngsters to be productive and educated citizens maybe this would reduce the leftward drift that we are seeing yeah but then there is the problem who gets to make the test who gets to decide what information should be required for citizenship i m not sure our lawmakers are even capable of making such an exam just look at alexandria cortez she thought congress was made up of three chambers and then corrected herself to say that our government s three chambers we re the presidency the house and the senate yeah but then there is the problem who gets to make the test there s principles for yous just look at alexandria cortez again aren t three articles daily on the good comrade already pushing it the test already exists though and neither side seems to think it needs to change significantly so it seems to have bipartisan support maybe this would reduce the leftward drift that we are seeing by introducing more red tape and bureaucracy mark max s as yet another tory posing as a libertarian ok so she is a ball buster to work for how exactly is that a scandal frankly we could use a workaholic president who manages the hell out of her staff it only makes me consider her more
