international trade despite the plans for an announcement it s not a done deal noted jeffrey halley of oanda after such an interminable wait and having being led to water before i would like to see something official in writing officially further to that point although the in principle agreement may have been agreed the legally binding text has yet to be drawn up he said since july 2018 the

to many of trump s supporters in rural america on sunday the administration was set to start taxing an additional 160 billion in chinese imports a move that would extend the sanctions to just about

agreement on china s technology policies will likely prove difficult it would require beijing to scale back its drive to become a global powerhouse in industrial high technology something it sees as a path to prosperity and international influence efforts to acquire foreign technology are a theme that runs through chinese law and government security researchers have asserted that beijing operates a network of research institutes and business parks to turn stolen foreign technology into commercial products the trump administration has been seeking a way to enforce any significant trade agreement with china reflecting its contention that beijing has violated past promises one way to do is to retain some tariffs as leverage wiseman reported from washington associ
