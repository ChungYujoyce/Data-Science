isaac but to make the case to republicans democrats and independents for mitt romney romney s wife ann offered the personal touch telling stories about the newly anointed gop nominee that only she would know in an earlier address but it was christie s job to bring the rhetorical firepower and energize a party that for months years really has been divided over romney s bid for the presidency
