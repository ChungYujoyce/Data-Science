gun shows the checks would be conducted through a federal firearm license or a newly created class of license transfer agents sellers could keep their own records of the sale though they could allow the ffl to store them while it was the first step in testing a position for mr trump and the republicans several senators said they needed more details before they could decide whether to support it their questions included details on how the federal firearm licensee system would be overhauled and operated who would keep records of sales and what enforcement penalties would be in place when asked about the new class of licensing agents sen josh hawley said he couldn t describe it because there was no text to work with it s hard to really nail it down the missouri republican said despite the questions they had about the proposal senators said it was a constructive starting point but the biggest question remained where does the president stand that s an important piece if the president doesn t support it there s no point it s not going to become law mr hawley said it was not clear what mr trump thought of the proposal with lawmakers pointing out that he hasn t signed off on it and

colleagues in the house pushed back against the notion at a press conference wednesday minority whip steve scalise and several other house republicans said democrats were rushing to push through

chairman hakeem jeffries saying they would need to see what the republicans offered before making a decision rank and file democrats agreed to wait and see rather than prepare to block a weaker
