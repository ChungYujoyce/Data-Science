apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion donald trump s trade war with china though justified by beijing s mercantilist behavior and intransigence in negotiations is headed for failure by relying on tariffs president trump is leading with america s jaw beijing is able to accuse washington of breaking the international rules it says china should better follow and impose considerably more pain on americans than the chinese will endure consider the 25 percent tariff on the first 50 billion 34 billion already implemented and another 16 billion soon to follow the president wanted to avoid hitting consumers with higher prices on tvs and toasters so he focused on chinese industrial and transportation goods and components the exact opposite of what he should be doing during his first term president obama nagged at china incessantly that its undervalued currency was bulging the bilateral trade imbalance by making chinese made consumer goods artificially cheap chinese leaders sensed democrats penchant for appeasement and called his bluff when he threatened to act if beijing didn t top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time seeking to succeed barack obama mitt romney and candidate trump both threatened across the board tariffs by failing to educate the public about the need to accept some short term pain to accomplish long term gain mr trump now sits between a communist hammer president xi s ability to pick whatever goods he chooses to retaliate against and an anvil republicans midterm election vulnerability mr xi chose to impose tariffs on u s goods that will hit red state voters hard stuff like soybeans and bourbon and mr trump s emphasis on the industrial products is disrupting supply chains in the electronics automobiles and other industries causing a firestorm of objections across american business and in the u s senate trade wars are about staying power it s trench warfare at the cash register and in the stock market and mr trump s bickering trade team could have not picked a worse opening strategy now to add folly to folly the administration is readying 10 percent tariffs on an additional 200 billion of imports from china and that has the potential to assess three times as much pain on americans as the chinese first beijing manages the value of its currency quite effectively and could let the yuan drop 10 percent against the dollar to offset the impact of the additional u s tariffs the united states exports only about 135 billion to china but beijing will have already assessed 25 percent in additional tariffs on 50 billion of those consequently beijing will have only the remaining 85 billion to target for retaliation it could assess 25 percent tariffs on all of those as equivalent to the 10 percent tariff on the additional 200 billion in u s imports from china targeted by washington in net prices of those 200 billion of u s imports from china would be about the same as before but a cheaper yuan and china s retaliatory tariffs would make all u s exports into china about 35 percent more expensive than before and it gets worse the president under u s law can hold up chinese acquisitions of u s companies but he cannot direct the federal trade commission justice department antitrust division and various other regulators to harass chinese business interests already operating here mr xi can do exactly those things to u s businesses operating in china and also organize a consumer boycott of u s goods as he has done for example to south korea when its foreign policy steps in the wrong direction there are better ways to prosecute this trade war for example by requiring import licenses for chinese goods sold in the united states simply issue to u s exporters resalable licenses to import from china in proportion to their sales in the middle kingdom the more china buys here the more it can sell here but if it retaliates it must sell less start out by issuing 3 worth of import licenses for each dollar of sales in china and then cut that ratio every three months over three to five years until trade is balanced also impose financial sanctions on chinese entities that benefit from beijing s subsidies restrictions on u s investments and pirated intellectual property similar to the sanctions imposed on north korea and russia those would get mr xi into serious negotiations but mr trump s tariffs will only result in a stalemate or shame deal that permits him to step down gracefully peter morici is an economist and business professor at the university of maryland and a national
