he tweeted no rush but i am sure we will ultimately get there mr trump isn t the only one pleased with the result the south koreans were thrilled with the optics saying it could jump start the peace process and one day move beyond the tense cold war structure at the border it showed this military demarcation line is really artificial chung in moon an adviser to south korean president moon jae in told the washington times if leaders are able to cross it with more frequency we can eventually demolish the demarcation line the historic handshake between mr trump and mr kim dominated tv coverage in seoul footage of the meeting between two blue huts in the panmunjom truce village played on a loop in the sprawling capital city while a line of pundits joined news anchors to break it all down while mr trump took a victory lap on social media mr moon the south korean adviser called it a very successful summit and threefold win for the korean peninsula and global diplomacy the north koreans seemed happy too their state operated news agency described a historic meeting that attracted worldwide attention the top leaders of the two countries agreed to keep in close touch in the future too and resume and push forward productive dialogues for making a new breakthrough in the denuclearization of the korean peninsula and in the bilateral relations the korean central news agency said according to a translated version of its statement in the u s democrats criticized mr trump s meeting saying he was further legitimizing the ruthless dictator without gaining anything in return former vice president joseph r biden the leading candidate for the democratic presidential nomination said monday that mr trump is more concerned with a photo op than with results in this case all trump achieved was a mere promise to restart working level negotiations negotiations that should have never ended mr biden said diplomacy is important but diplomacy requires a strategy a process and competent leadership to deliver after three made for tv summits we still don t have a single concrete commitment from north korea not one missile or nuclear weapon has been destroyed not one inspector is on the ground if anything the situation has gotten worse north korea has continued to churn out fissile material and is no longer an isolated pariah on the world stage the administration is considering a potential deal with north korea that would accept the country as a nuclear power if it freezes its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of the most onerous u s sanctions the new york times reported the plan would seek to prevent pyongyang from adding nuclear weapons but would not immediately dismantle any weapons or limit the north s missile arsenal the paper said but white house national security adviser john r bolton dismissed the report neither the nsc staff nor i have discussed or heard of any desire to settle for a nuclear freeze by nk mr bolton tweeted monday this was a reprehensible attempt by someone to box in the president there should be consequences sen lindsey graham south carolina republican said he was glad to see mr bolton push back hard on the narrative that the administration would accept a nuclear freeze as an acceptable outcome by north korea to president trump s great credit he has the right goal which is irreversible verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula with economic and security guarantees to north korea in return mr graham tweeted this is the only win win situation available for the korean peninsula united states and the world at large legitimizing a nuclear arsenal in the hands of an unstable erratic despot will never be an acceptable outcome describing the president s visit as an amazing event kcna went on to assert that mr trump and mr kim explained issues of easing tensions on the korean peninsula ending the inglorious relations between the two countries and making a dramatic turn and also issues of mutual concern and interest which become a stumbling block in solving those issues others went further david maxwell a retired army special forces colonel and north korea analyst with the foundation for defense of democracies think tank in washington warned that the kim regime is masterful at getting something for nothing this is only the beginning mr maxwell told reporters monday asserting that the kim regime s propaganda and agitation department is going to exploit the hell out of this meeting it is a proverbial bonanza for them he said i am not saying this to be critical of the summit but only to emphasize that everything we do will be exploited for the regime s propaganda messages what remains to be seen is whether the weekend s developments will result in tangible progress on the nuclear negotiations front north korea hawks in washington argue that the kim regime has been stalling since the first summit between mr kim and mr trump in singapore in june 2018 a joint declaration that both leaders signed in singapore said president trump committed to provide security guarantees to north korea and chairman kim jong un reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula the nearly 13 months since have failed to fully clarify whether the two sides agree on what such a denuclearization would entail the trump administration says it would mean complete verifiable irreversible denuclearization by pyongyang but some analysts argue that the north koreans are demanding the removal of the u s defensive nuclear umbrella from all of east asia as for working level talks mr trump told reporters at the dmz on sunday that u s and north korean officials will meet over the next few weeks and they re going to start a process and we ll see what happens but he stressed that we want a really comprehensive good deal speed is not the object the president said mr moon the adviser in seoul said the south koreans will wait and see what happens when stephen e biegun the u s special representative for north korea and his north korean counterparts resume talks in mid july south korea will be on the sidelines of the talks though mr moon rejected the idea that his country is overhyping its role as a key go between the very fact that we invited trump to seoul indicates that the south korean government played a very important facilitating role mr moon said he said their president could have objected to the dmz meetup with mr kim on grounds that it would threaten to overshadow his own bilateral face time with the u s president top officials in seoul said the u s briefed south korea extensively on the trump kim talks and that important contents were included in mr moon s brief conversation with mr kim at the dmz according to the yonhap news agency the south korean leader a progressive is under pressure to make progress in establishing a lasting peace on the peninsula he tied his legacy to it and domestic elections next week could empower or weaken his democratic party he wants to really make tangible progress mr moon said of his boss haksoon paik the president of the sejong institute a leading think tank in seoul said south korea s invitation to mr trump clearly paid off this perception of south koreans about the success of president moon s mediation will boost president moon s approval rate and if the u s north korea negotiation continues until the general election in south korea in mid april next year it will be one of the favorable elements that may help win the general election he said at the same time the moon administration is structurally sidelined from the u s north korean talks which south korean conservatives will be quick to point out mr moon will have to wait and see whether mr trump and mr kim make actual progress rather than make a show of continuing negotiation guy taylor contributed to this report tom h
