 sign in path is clear for socialism s triumph manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion president obama has succeeded in transforming america the constitutional republic is dead a socialist empire has been born this is the true meaning and historical significance of tuesday s election from the outset of his presidency mr obama vowed to be a transformative leader his re election shows that he has achieved his primary goal erecting a european social democracy by any objective measure mr obama s first term has been a colossal failure his signature legislative achievements the economic stimulus and obamacare are unpopular unemployment has remained chronically high economic growth is sputtering the recovery is anemic inflation is rising he has presided over multiple consecutive trillion dollar plus budget deficits he has amassed more than 5 trillion in debt the national debt is more than 16 trillion a staggering amount that threatens our economic security we are sliding toward greece and impending bankruptcy yet the electorate rewarded him with another term top stories cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni why the answer is simple and ominous because more than half the population 50 percent plus one is dependent upon government benefits for the past four years the obama administration has created a franco german welfare state whose sole purpose is to forge a majority political coalition wedded to the democratic party the stimulus the health care overhaul the redirecting of financial resources to the inner cities the explosion in the number of americans on food stamps and welfare the massive spending increases in public education infrastructure and agriculture the green energy boondoggles the bailouts of the auto industry the contraceptive mandate the federal funding of abortion support for homosexual marriage and pushing amnesty for illegal aliens all of these measures directly bought off key liberal constituencies such as unions public sector workers environmentalists blacks hispanics feminists and the homosexual community in short america has been fractured into two nations the tax producers and the tax consumers the givers and the takers those who generate wealth and those who exploit it mr obama has peeled off the larger chunk the productive classes are being harnessed into subsidizing the nonproductive elements statism and sex trump entrepreneurship and self reliance contrary to myth liberalism is not a political ideology but a pseudo religion or rather it is a substitute for traditional religion it is driven by emotion symbolism irrationality and blind intense faith its holy trinity is race class and gender its church is the democratic party and its savior its secular messiah is mr obama he has fostered a cult of personality common among leftist revolutionaries despite blatant failures he is not held accountable by his supporters like vladimir lenin leon trotsky fidel castro and hugo chavez mr obama is never blamed by his ideological followers for any mistakes or misdeeds it is always someone else s fault especially former president george w bush s obama ites have one ever present boogeyman mr bush he is the american left s devil moreover this explains mr obama s strategy playing the race card relentlessly attacking millionaires and billionaires and making phony claims of a gop war on women the only real war is the democrats ceaseless assault upon traditional america mr obama is practicing the old politics of divide and conquer his aim is to splinter and polarize society in the ruthless pursuit of power the path is clear for mr obama s complete transformation of america he has admitted that the key to his re election was the huge hispanic turnout he plans to repay the favor by pushing amnesty for nearly 12 million to 20 million illegal immigrants the new york times reports that mr obama considers comprehensive immigration reform to be his first priority in a second term the reason is obvious granting amnesty would permanently shift the electoral map in favor of the democrats pivotal states with large illegal populations such as texas arizona florida ohio and pennsylvania would become deep blue it would ensure national one party democratic rule for generations the last line of defense is the republican controlled house the senate remains firmly in democratic hands mr obama will reshape the supreme court as he fills inevitable upcoming vacancies the establishment media is his lapdog hollywood backs him the popular culture idolizes him almost every major institution is falling under his influence the president has shown nothing but contempt for the constitution he is remaking america in his own image can republicans stop him if not there will be no return from obama s america jeffrey t kuhner is a columnist at the washington times and the host of the kuhner
