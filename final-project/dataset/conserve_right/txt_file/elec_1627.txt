john brennan started claiming to colleagues at the cia that estonia s intelligence agency had alerted him to an intercepted phone call suggesting putin was pouring money into the trump campaign the tip was bogus but brennan bit on it with opportunistic relish out of brennan s alarmist chatter about the bogus tip came an extraordinary leak to the bbc that brennan had used it along with later half baked tips from british intelligence as the justification to form a multi agency spy operation given the orwellian designation of an inter agency taskforce on the trump campaign which he was running right out of cia headquarters the cia was furious about the leak but never denied the bbc s story to congress earlier this year brennan acknowledged the existence of the group but cast his role in it as the mere conduit of tips about trump russia collusion it was well beyond my mandate as director of cia to follow on any of those leads that involved u s persons but i made sure that anything that was involving u s persons including anything involving the individuals involved in the trump campaign was shared with the bureau but if his role had truly been passive the inter agency taskforce wouldn t have been meeting at cia headquarters by keeping its discussions at langley brennan could keep his finger wedged in the pie both before and after the fbi s official probe began in late july 2016 brennan was bringing together into the same room at cia headquarters a cast of trump haters across the obama administration whose activities he could direct from peter strzok the fbi liaison to brennan to the doltish jim clapper brennan s errand boy to an assortment of brennan s buddies at the treasury department justice department and white house the bogus tip from estonia led the group into its first cock up sending fbi agents to sniff around the computer server connected to trump tower after that effort flopped brennan s group had to go back to the drawing board on the electronic intelligence front it had already hatched plans for national security letters and fisa warrants someone in the group must have proposed blasting a swampy old cia source and hillary supporter stefan halper into the trump campaign orbit to see if he could catch a couple of minor campaign volunteers out in collusion halper had entered the deep state through a door opened by his father in law ray cline whose work for the cia was legendary behind that door halper found a treasure trove of jobs and government contracts making his life as a transatlantic jet setting academic possible brennan s langley group had access to halper s file and sized him up as the perfect embed a republican oriented foreign policy scholar who could plausibly interact with trump officials while serving as a nexus between the cia and brennan s friends in british intelligence halper s ties to richard dearlove a former head of british intelligence are well known and halper knows alexander downer the pub crawling aussie diplomat through a mutual association with cambridge university that halper came out of the brainstorming of brennan s group is clear from the fact that his first known meeting with carter page preceded the formal opening of the fbi s probe thewashington posthinted at the roleof brennan s group in hatching halper many questions about the informant s role in the russia investigation remain unanswered it is unclear how he first became involved in the case the extent of the information he provided and the actions he took to obtain intelligence for the fbi it is also unknown whether his july 2016 interaction with carter page was brokered by the fbi oranother intelligence agency italics added the fbi commonly uses sources and informants to gather evidence and its regulations allow for use of informants even before a formal investigation has been opened in many law enforcement investigations the use of sources and informants precedes more invasive techniques such as electronic surveillance a veteran of the intelligence community tellstasthat brennan s cia was full of hillary supporters some of whom decorated their desks with her campaign paraphernalia brennan whom the press noted would walk the halls of the cia in an lgbt rainbow lanyard encouraged this open political atmosphere while brennan knew his spying operation on the trump campaign was an exceptionally exceptionally sensitive matter as reported by journalists david corn and michael isikoff he assumed its machinations would never come to light the members of brennan s working group at langley were just a bunch of out of control idiots says a former high ranking cia official totas he finds it flabbergasting that brennan would bring cia officials and fbi officials into the same room to cook up schemes to send a spy into the trump campaign s ranks one of those schemes involved money halper paid george papadopoulos 3 000 for a phony research paper as a way of luring him into a london meeting another involved sex halper s assistant with a name out of a bad spy novel azra turk tried to coax information from papadopoulos at flirty bar outings according to the daily caller s chuck ross like brennan halper didn t bother to hide his support for hillary even as he conducted this infiltration he told the press that he feared a trump presidency as it could harm the special relationship between the united states and great britain that rationale must have figured into alexander downer s motivation for working with brennan s langley group too downer traveled in the same elitist circles as christopher steele halper and john kerry it appears he sent word of his boozy evening with papadopoulos back to brennan s groupthrough these circles either through hillary partisans at the state department or through clinton foundation channels for whom he had worked as a kind of bag man halper had come up empty so brennan s group at langley went with downer s tale as feeble as it was but it at least had the advantage of coming from a diplomat yet if congressman nunes is right and the originating document for the fbi probe doesn t even contain a reference to an official intelligence product passed to brennan from the australian government downer s hearsay must have been exceedingly flaky so flaky no one would want to be on the record treating it as evidence for something as momentous as a probe into a presidential campaign according to press accounts downer s bumptiousness caused a diplomatic row of sorts between the two countries who resolved it john kerry susan rice or
