 trump campaign manager corey lewandowski weighs in on fox news sunday this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday june 3 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace anchor i aposm chris wallace the summit between president trump and kim jong un is on but what about a trade war with our closest allies begin videotape president donald trump i think the relationship we have right now with north korea is as good as it aposs been in a long time wallace this hour we aposll discuss what to expect from the singapore summit and the pushback from canada mexico and europe to the president aposs tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum justin trudeau canadian prime minister let me be clear these tariffs are totally unacceptable we have to believe that at some point common sense will prevail wallace a live interview with larry kudlow top white house economic advisor only on fox news sunday then will president trump sit for an interview with the special counsel rudy giuliani president trump aposs attorney i aposm not going to let my client testify the president of the united states even if he wants to without those documents being produced wallace we aposll talk with corey lewandowski mr trump aposs first campaign manager and still a close advisor plus comments from roseanne barr and samantha bee both sparked outrage but very different results we aposll ask our sunday panel is there a double standard and our power players of the week share some words of wisdom for the class of 2018 all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington we begin with breaking news the new york times is the first to report a story that president trump aposs legal team sent a memo to special counsel robert mueller in january accreting broad presidential powers in the memo the lawyers argue the president cannot be compelled to testify and cannot obstruct justice because he has authority over all federal investigations and new lead lawyer rudy giuliani tells abc news if mueller tries to subpoena us we aposre going to court joining us now from manchester new hampshire president trump aposs first campaign manager and current advisor corey lewandowski corey is that the president aposs view that he could not be compelled to testify and that he cannot as the president obstruct justice corey lewandowski former trump campaign manager well chris i think look i aposm not an attorney so i want to be very clear about this but what this memo outlines and what their team has said was if the mueller team is going to potentially subpoena the president that is something that they believe is not authorized because of his position now what they are trying to do chris is they are trying to sit down and figure out if the president is going to sit down for an interview and that interview is going to be based on a narrow scope of questions that the team is trying to negotiate right now what rudy giuliani has said as the president aposs attorney is if the mueller investigators decide to subpoena this president they will take it to court and i believe the court is going to be on the president aposs side on this wallace but and this specific issue has never been adjudicated but there was a long history of the courts ordering presidents to do something and presidents agreeing to do it a subpoena is a court order thomas jefferson had to bow to a court order richard nixon had to bow to the supreme court in releasing the watergate tapes bill clinton had to bow to the supreme court when it came to testifying in the paula jones civil suit lewandowski well that aposs exactly right but you have to remember look the giuliani legal team is trying to negotiate with the mueller team to decide if it aposs the right thing to sit down and have this interview and if so they want to understand what the scope of the questions are so there aposs the potential to avoid the subpoena entirely if the teams can work together and determined that the questions that will be asked will be relevant to an investigation to prove once and for all there was no collusion and it sounds like what giuliani and his team are saying is you don apost need to subpoena route but if you do we will fight it in court the president has been very clear he has offered to sit down with the mueller investigators but he has said and the giuliani team has said this they want to understand what the scope of questions are going to be before they sit down and do that wallace i want to just try to narrow this down a little bit mueller says rather giuliani says if mueller gets a subpoena which is a court order giuliani and the president aposs legal team are going to go to court what if the court says no mr president you are wrong is the president prepared under his understanding of his powers in the executive branch is he prepared to defy a court order lewandowski look i don apost think so and i haven apost spoken to the president about it that aposs a question for his legal team but i think the president clearly respects the rule of law in the country there aposs no question about that but what they aposre doing is chris there is a way to avoid all of this there aposs a way to avoid a potential constitutional issue on this which is working with mayor giuliani and his legal team and the mueller investigators if they can come up to a resolution which is going to ask the president to sit down and have a conversation which is limited in scope present the interrogatories then the team will decide if the president is willing to do this but chris at the end of the day what the mueller investigators can do is they can write a report to congress and to the justice department and show that there was no collusion between the president and the russians and that aposs where we are so if the president is asked to sit down and discuss this he aposs going to say exactly that because i know what to be true you know it to be true and the american people know there was no collusion between the trump campaign and the russians wallace i want to talk about another part of the memo and we again should point out this was a memo that was written by the president aposs former legal team in january including john dowd was sent to mueller rudy giuliani was not part of that but as the president aposs lead lawyer he is embracing that january memo and another part of it basically says the president has the ability to pardon anybody he wants i want to look back at that because the president has been busy with his pardoning this week he pardoned dinesh d apossouza a conservative author this week going around the normal process of going to the justice department the office of pardon attorney he did it unilaterally he says he may pardoned martha stewart he may pardon former illinois governor rod blagojevich the top democrat on the house intelligence committee said even before these latest pardons that he aposs off pattern here he is begin video clip rep adam schiff d ca ranking member house intelligence committee i think the president is sending a message basically i will use the pardon power to pardon people even that have been convicted of leaking and obstruction of justice if you aposre with me i have your back end video clip wallace and long time trump advisor roger stone said this it has to be a signal to mike flynn and paul manafort and even robert mueller indict people for crimes that don apost pertain to russian collusion and that is what could happen so are you saying is the president saying is rudy giuliani saying he can pardon anybody he wants including people that are swept up in the special counsel aposs investigation lewandowski well chris the constitution is very clear in the power of the president as defined by the constitution allows him to pardon anybody he wants for federal crimes and no one is talking about the pardon of the heavyweight boxing champion jack johnson that he pardoned something the obama administration had the opportunity to do and others but chose not to and so people want to make this a political issue the pardoning of dinesh d apossouza was a one off but this president has pardoned i think 0 7 percent of the applicants in front of him which is a far lower number than any previous president at this point and so look is he going to pardon the marc riches of the world like the clintons did of course not right those are personal friends of the president back then who had crimes committed against our government that were convicted and they were pardoned for political expediency crosstalk wallace but corey if he were to pardon i got to emphasize if he were to pardoned michael flynn or paul manafort people that could conceivably give evidence against him that aposs a lot worse than marc rich lewandowski yes but chris there aposs absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the president has ever discussed having a pardon for mike flynn or paul manafort or anybody else for that matter and with all due respect to roger stone i don apost think he has any idea what he aposs talking about this is not a sign look i don apost know of the president aposs relationship with dinesh d apossouza i don apost know i had never met dinesh d apossouza so i don apost think it was a strong relationship between the president and him but if you look in that particular case saw an injustice that was done which by the way chris was selective enforcement by the previous administration for a campaign finance violation the same exact finance violation i think roseanne barr has admitted to giving too much money to candidates and we haven apost seen the prosecution of her for that and so the president pardoned dinesh d apossouza on a one off opportunity but never ever ever has this president said to the best of my knowledge he aposs even thinking about pardoning for mike flynn or paul manafort or anybody else with him wallace but you are saying that he could but you are saying that he could do it if he wanted to lewandowski well yes of course under the constitution he has the legal authority to pardon anybody that aposs a power that lies strictly with the president of the united states no question wallace all right i want to go to a couple of other subjects let aposs turn to spygate the allegation by you and others and of course by president trump that the fbi inserted a spy into the campaign here aposs what president trump said and also what republican congressman trey gowdy said after he got a classified briefing from the justice department and the fbi begin video clip donald trump president of the united states how do you like the fact they had people infiltrating our campaign can you imagine rep trey gowdy r south carolina i am even more convinced that the fbi did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got and that it has nothing to do with donald trump end video clip wallace corey that aposs trey gowdy he aposs a conservative republican he led the benghazi investigation and he is undercutting what the president and frankly people like you talk about when you discuss spygate lewandowski well chris i aposm very concerned what we don apost know unequivocally is did the fbi taken in form and it put them inside the campaign because i can tell you i never spoke to anyone from the fbi as the campaign manager for 18 months of that campaign never did they notify me of their concerns about potential russian meddling never did they notify me or anybody else while i was there of a potential spy entering the campaign never did they notify anybody that i aposm aware of that they have those concerns and what is more disturbing to me is there was only one campaign that was involved in the general election that took 5 million went out and hired a former spy to go create a false dossier to spy on american citizens and that was the clinton campaign and it doesn apost sound like they were so concerned that they put a spy into that campaign so this looks like potentially selective enforcement if this took place and if it did take place chris there had better be accountability for sending us spy now clapper says that aposs not the term we use anymore and brennan says we don apost use the term spy you call it what you want when you have a paid government informant who made a lot of money trying to solicit information from a presidential campaign without notifying that campaign that aposs called spying wallace all right one last question i want to get to because you have joined vice president mike pence aposs political action committee involved in raising money and supporting republican candidates in the midterms here are some of what president trump has been saying about democrats on the campaign trail begin video clip trump remember the term chuck and nancy they don apost want the wall they want open borders they are more interested in taking care of criminals than they are in taking care of you we are going to protect your second amendment you won apost have a second amendment if the democrats take over end video clip wallace and the president called nancy pelosi the ms 13 lover of course referring to the terrible violent gang i aposve got 30 seconds for you any of that do you believe over the line for president trump lewandowski chris it aposs a clear reminder to the american people of what happens if the democrats take control of the house of representatives and nancy pelosi becomes the next speaker not one democratic member of the house or the senate voted for the historic tax cuts this president tried to negotiate to get money for the wall and take care of the people that came to this country through no fault of their own and the democrats didn apost want to do it because they want to politicize it so this president has to remind the american people of what is at stake in the 2018 election and that is moving our country in the same direction which is the lowest unemployment for african americans and hispanics ever recorded or going back to the ways of more money in taxes and increasing your taxes under what would be speaker pelosi it aposs a clear dichotomy and i think the president is on the right track wallace corey thank you thanks for joining us today always good to talk with you lewandowski thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday panel to discuss those hateful comments from two comedians that sparked similar outrage but very different consequences this week plus what would you like to ask the panel about comments from roseanne and samantha bee this week just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip samantha bee comedian let me just say one mother to another do something about your dad aposs immigration practices you feckless expletive deleted he listens to you put on something tight and low cut and tell your father to expletive deleted stop it end video clip wallace well samantha bee aposs vile comment about ivanka trump that sparked outrage this coming just one day after roseanne barr tweeted a racist remark about former obama advisor valerie jarrett and it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume columnist for the hill juan williams and the co host benson and harf and we have them both on fox news radio marie harf and the aforementioned guy benson al right so brit the roseanne barr comment clearly hateful but i think you could argue that while the remark by samantha bee may not have been more hateful the circumstances about it were even more disturbing because it was scripted it was taped and it was run hours later by tbs your thoughts about all of this brit hume fox news senior political analyst roseanne barr aposs comment was completely out of bounds and as you say hateful but if you aposre trying to think of something to say about a woman that would be worse than what she said the use of the c word which i would say is second only to the n word the ugliest words in the temporary parlance you couldn apost do any better than what you said i mean it was misogynistic it reduces a woman to a body part you know this is a comment someone derived as hate speech and sexist so i think the two remarks were basically on par and what aposs not on par was the disparate treatment by abc news towards barr and by tbs toward samantha bee vast different and it aposs pretty hard to argue therefore there aposs not a double standard wallace all right we asked you for questions for the panel and on this specific subject we got this tweet from kaycee do networks have to respect an individual aposs freedom of speech or our network aposs responsibility and freedoms different marie how do you answer kaycee marie harf fox news analyst well private corporations can make decisions based on what they think is in their best business interests and we aposd seen a couple of businesses boycott samantha bee aposs show that may continue it may not so while both of these cases roseanne and samantha bee they are able to say these things they are also very much able to face consequences if they do so and it will be interesting to see if abc decides this is not in their corporate interest to keep samantha bee on i have a sense that they aposll keep her on wallace tbs harf tbs yes excuse me i also don apost like the idea that we aposre only outraged when people that we agree with are attacked with this kind of language we need to be outraged as a culture this is where we are now politics on the left and the right this is where things are and it aposs terrible and it needs to change on both sides wallace juan would you agree that there is a glaring double scandal here that roseanne barr within hours abc cancels her show and for samantha bee and tbs we are sorry juan williams fox news political analyst no i don apost and in fact i think it aposs regrettable and picking up on what marie was saying wallace would you say you don apost do you you aposre saying you don apost think there aposs a double standard williams no i think that i agree with what marie was saying in the sense that the cultures in this place where we use this kind of rank and vulgar language but when you think about what roseanne barr had to say in terms of calling valerie jarrett an ape a black woman this is something that aposs very deep and speaks to race in our culture dehumanizing people it speaks to oppression slavery i can go on hume you don apost think calling someone the c word is dehumanizing williams i do let me finish i think that calling two white women having an argument over immigration policy and separating children from parents and the like is as i was going to say vulgar and rank and unnecessary it does not speak to the idea of tearing apart the social fabric around the most central and difficult issue in america race and that aposs what roseanne barr not only did in this instance she had done previously with regard to susan rice another obama official and i think wallace well samantha bee has said all manner of horrible things about all manner of women yes white who were working in the trump white house williams i aposm telling you one of these items speaks to tearing at the social fabric in a way that can apost be undone and puts us all in great danger and therefore it aposs not about team sport in terms of oh i aposm a trump supporter and i aposm there to support roseanne barr or i aposm an obama supporter and therefore you know support samantha bee that aposs really juvenile compared to the seriousness of what aposs taking place you think about the nfl players you think about charlottesville i could go on you understand that they are playing your wallace let me bring in guy williams to set separating us as a society guy benson townhall com look i think that you can defend what abc did with roseanne barr and i aposm not calling for samantha bee to be fired by tbs but i am wondering will there be any consequences for samantha bee aside from a few advertisers temporarily suspending the support for the program tbs the only thing they aposve said publicly about this is applauding samantha bee for apologizing for something that she shouldn apost have said and while roseanne barr her tweet was totally unacceptable and racist it was a tweet in the middle of the night that is a different context than samantha bee aposs rant which was scripted it was in a teleprompter it was a comment that was clearly premeditated and made it through multiple layers on pre taped show and production wallace and then was taped hours later all right crosstalk wallace guys i want to move to one of the subject here and that is the russia investigation because we do have this news of the president aposs legal team back in january sending this memo brit you and i have covered a lot of scandals and they are taking a very forward leaning position on the presidential powers when it comes to obstruction of justice when it comes to having a sit down and answer to a subpoena when it comes to pardoning your thoughts about it brit hume fox news senior political analyst well i think on the question of obstruction of justice the memo may well be legally sound in a sense that the president does have broad powers over the actions of the executive branch and the special counsel is most certainly a part so that the question whether he could be charged with that i think is one thing the question whether he would have to answer process that aposs to say respond to a subpoena i think is another we do know that the supreme court has ruled that richard nixon had to produce material evidence which he ultimately did whether that would whether that would extend to sitting for an interview or being called before a grand jury has never been fully adjudicated but i think the president may be on not as strong ground there his legal team may be not as on strong ground there arguing wallace marie marie harf fox news analyst the letter also opens some very interesting questions about the trump team aposs relationship to the truth the letter made clear that donald trump himself dictated the statement that was given to the press about donald trump jr aposs meeting with russian agents this happened months ago but you have jay sekulow one of trump aposs attorneys and sarah sanders publicly on the record saying the exact opposite so by trying to put forward a legal case the trump team has opened themselves up to more questions about whether they are telling the truth on the russia and that aposs the problem wallace all right panel we aposll have to take a break here we aposll see you a little later when we come back the latest on the singapore summit as well as the effort to avoid a trade war with china and our closest allies larry kudlow the president aposs top economic advisor joins us next commercial break wallace coming up will president trump sit down with special counsel robert mueller begin video clip rudy giuliani president trump aposs lawyer if there is no evidence which i assume there is no evidence then i mean he shouldn apost testify enbd video clip wallace president trump aposs former campaign manager and current advisor corey lewandowski joins us next commercial break wallace major news today on two fronts for the trump administration first on trade commerce secretary wilbur ross is in beijing for talks aimed at fending off a trade war with china and u s allies slapped with new tariffs on steel and aluminum vowed to retaliate and second preparations are ramping up for the trump kim summit now set for june 12th in singapore correspondent kevin corke is live at the white house with the latest on both kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris there are growing concerns that a trade war between the world aposs two largest economies could be inevitable after beijing warned washington that no new deal to shrink the massive trade deficit between our countries will take effect if president trump follows through on his promise to hit china with new tariffs begin videotape corke commerce secretary wilbur ross travel to beijing with two goals in mind trim the u s aposs passive to 375 billion trade deficit with china by 100 billion and stave off a potentially explosive trade were mr trump aposs feeling on the issues spilled out on twitter if we charge a country zero to sell their goods and they charge us 25 50 even 100 percent to sell hours it is unfair and can no longer be tolerated it aposs not free or fair trade it is stupid trade an example the white house is pond of offering is that of the auto sector where china charges 25 percent on u s cars sold there the e u 10 percent while the u s charges just 2 5 percent in return the trump administration has already hit canada mexico and the e u with 25 percent aposs tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum saying it aposs in the interest of national security a notion that left our neighbors to the north gobsmacked justin trudeau canadian prime minister that canada could be considered a national security threat to the united states is inconceivable corke all against the backdrop of a week dominated by news on north korea as the north korean official hand delivered a letter to the president from kim jong un setting the stage for the june 12th in singapore where today defense secretary jim mattis warned the north will get no sanctions relief until it aposs demonstrated verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization end videotape corke mattis adding we can expect at best a bumpy road to the negotiations and perhaps the understatement of the week chris wallace it sure is kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks for that joining me now for an exclusive interview president trump aposs top white house economic advisor larry kudlow larry welcome back to fox news sunday larry kudlow top white house economic advisor thank you chris wallace let aposs start with the singapore summit because president trump it seems to me has dramatically softened what it is he is expecting and demanding from his first meeting with him here is what national security advisor john bolton said just after the summit was announced and here aposs president trump this week take a look begin video clip wallace will president trump insist that kim give up ship out all of his nuclear weapons all of his nuclear fuel all of his ballistic missiles before the u s makes any concessions john bolton national security adviser yes i think that aposs what denuclearization means donald trump president of the united states we aposre going to start a process and i told him today take your time we can go fast we can go slowly end video clip wallace so now the president is talking about a process of negotiation not what larry what john bolton was talking about which was unilateral immediate disarmament kudlow well i think at the end of that process that aposs the goal unilateral denuclearization disarming them and so forth it is going to be a process i aposm not directly involved in that my pal john bolton is of course and the president but sure these negotiations take time it aposs the same one trade all these negotiations take time everything aposs on the table during the negotiations but you can apost expect you aposre not going to change rome in a day and i think that aposs a very realistic attitude the key point is that we aposre sitting down and the second key point is that the president has been bolder on this and korea and by the way on world trade than any other recent president everybody says we you can apost do it we can apost do it the president says hang on a second we may be able to do it wallace ok well let aposs pick up specifically on that aspect because the president says the main reason that he has gotten north korea and kim jong un to negotiate was because of this policy of maximum pressure extreme sanctions from the world on north korea to really squeeze them but this week north korea is talking with the south koreans he aposs talking with the chinese he aposs talking with the russians and here aposs what president trump now says about his policy of maximum pressure begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i don apost even want to use the term maximum pressure anymore because i don apost want to use that term because we aposre getting along you see the relationship end video clip wallace hasn apost kim in effect ended his economic isolation without giving up a thing kudlow well i don apost know that i mean how has he ended it i aposm not sure i understand wallace because he aposs talking with with china and there seems to be every indication that they are going to relax economic sanctions south korea is talking about an economic partnership this is no longer maximum pressure larry kudlow i think over time over time it may be relaxed but right now i don apost think so i think the sanctions are in place are very tough very strong i think there was a moment a week or ten days back when the president was concerned about that chinese sanctions they seem to have said no no wait a minute we aposre still hanging tough this is tough economic pressure i think economic sanctions work i think the president aposs whole attitude of toughness with respect to north korea and people yelled at him or said this now you aposre too strong you aposre saber rattling everything aposs on the table including military action that stuff works over a period of time now as we head into the negotiations i think the president is being very realistic and it aposs going to take a period of time i don apost think we aposre going to let up on any of these matters that aposs not what president trump wanted to do wallace the question isn apost whether we the question is whether the chinese and south koreans in effect have already started to let up let me let aposs turn to tariffs on the president aposs decision this week to go ahead and impose tariffs on metal imports from some of our close allies canada mexico the european union you dismissed it this week as your words a family quarrel but canada aposs prime minister justin trudeau said that it is a quote turning point in relations and he went on to say this begin video clip justin trudeau canadian prime minister these tariffs are an affront to the long standing security partnership between canada and the united states and in particular an affront to the thousands of canadians who have fought and died alongside their american brothers in arms end video clip wallace sounds like a lot more than a family quarrel kudlow i don apost think our tariffs or anything to do with our friendship and our long standing alliance with canada wallace but we aposre imposing the tariff because of national security reasons kudlow that aposs correct wallace and so that is kudlow that is wallace the implication is that somehow we can apost trust canada as a reliable national security partner when it comes to supplying steel and aluminum kudlow well well i don apost i don apost think we aposre satisfied yet that they will protect or uphold all the shipments of steel coming into canada from around the world could be china could be brazil could be a lot of different places the trans shipping effort is something that has been troubling to us look the president has declared our steel industry a national security matter and he hopes through these actions to rebuild it there aposs some early signs that that may be possible but look in the communique in the announcement from the white house it said very clearly that we still welcome good faith negotiations and that aposs why i regard this as more of a family quarrel this is this is a trade dispute if you will it can be solved if people work together but but but but chris i must say this this president from day one wants to reform the world trading system it is not working and there is so much unfair trading and illegal trading practices there is virtually no reciprocity here tariff rates are not equal nontariff barriers are not equal the world trade organization which sets these rules has been totally ineffectual it has in some cases damaged the american economy damaged american workers in manufacturing and other businesses so the president aposs stepped up to the plate here and as somebody who is a free trader i aposve got to say if you don apost have a level playing field you can apost operate free trade wallace but but you aposre making it sound like this is the beginning or the midway point in negotiations in fact it represents something of a breakdown let me put the timeline up on the screen president trump first threatened to impose these tariffs on march 1st this week aposs action comes after more than a month of negotiation the e u is now imposing tariffs on 3 billion of u s goods canada on 13 billion of u s imports and for all of the talk of protecting american jobs the united steelworkers union opposes putting tariffs on canada saying that there metal exports to the u s are quote fairly traded this isn apost the beginning of a family squabble the family has broken up and has gone into separate rooms kudlow i know sometimes that happens sometimes families have disputes again good faith negotiations were part of our announcements the other day listen wallace but you this comes at the end of the months of good faith kudlow by the way i just want to say the american economy is booming right now wallace we aposre going to get to that kudlow that has to be part of the discussion here with respect to trade and confidence is also booming so that has to be part of the discussion look these matters can be solved no one said they can apost whether they will be i don apost know but again the president aposs vision here and it aposs very important he aposs a trade reformer and at the end of the day he would love to see free trade but these barriers have to be swept away unfair trading practices illegal trading practices places like china which are inaudible possible wallace we send more steel to canada than they send to us kudlow well it aposs about look it they buy our steel we buy their steel i agree with that ok but we aposre not satisfied yet that all the loopholes have been closed and there are other issues with respect to canadian u s trade discussions other very difficult issues the president himself has raised the issue of intellectual property and dairy and farming and agriculture which is very important to our farm folks so it may be it may be worked out these tariffs may go on for a while or they may not i don apost want many predictions today on the program i aposm just saying let aposs talk it through but to say that this is an attack on canada is not right but to say that we aposre going to protect the american industry wallace i didn apost say it was an attack on canada that was what justin trudeau the prime minister said kudlow that aposs right well that aposs and mr trudeau i think he aposs overreacting i don apost want to get in the middle of that as a fine friend and ally of the united states nobody denies that but the point is we have to protect ourselves wallace ok you kudlow we must protect ourselves wallace you say we need to protect ourselves kudlow yes wallace you were a tv analyst when the idea of tariffs on canada first came up here aposs what you said begin video clip kudlow we aposre already hanging by a toenail on nafta if we have to walk out with nafta or those negotiations totally breakdown then this steel thing turns in from a minor irritants to a major calamity for our economy and our stock market end video clip wallace mr kudlow that aposs where we are now the nafta talks have broken down the steel tariffs are on to quote larry kudlow from just a couple of months ago a major calamity for our economy and our markets kudlow well i hope it works out buy the buy wallace well what do you mean you hope kudlow the nafta wallace that aposs pretty cavalier you kudlow the nafta talks haven apost broken down we aposre still having those conversations and we aposre still having the steel talks with canada as i said you know take a look at the communique the white house put out or the statement good faith negotiations are welcome and we hope to continue there so i don apost think things are broken down i don apost want to be cavalier about anything these are very serious matters that could affect the economy there aposs worries about that every place so no i don apost want to deny that but i do want to say this if you cannot abide by the rules see that aposs the thing in the world trade game rule breaking is all over the place that aposs why i think that the president is right we have got to make reforms and we have to stand up for u s interests as we go along this is always you know don apost don apost blame trump blame china blame europe blame nafta blame those who don apost want reciprocal trading tariff rates and protectionism and the wallace i i want to i want to get to kudlow trump trump is responding to several decades of trade abuses here really i think that aposs wallace i want to get to something that i know you aposre going to want to talk about which is the very solid jobs report on friday kudlow yes wallace i want to put it up and 3 8 percent unemployment the lowest rate since 1969 3 6 percent for women the lowest since 1953 5 9 percent for black americans one how long can this last and two sitting here right now can you honestly say that the possibility of trade disputes trade war couldn apost jeopardize that kudlow oh it might i don apost deny that you have to keep an eye on it it aposs a very precious wallace it could jeopardize that kudlow it aposs possible absolutely i don apost think it has right now you know i think we aposre on the front end of what will turn out to be the best prosperity boom in several decades the economy is clicking on all cylinders as you noted jobs and unemployment business investment is growing everywhere money is being repatriated trillions of dollars are coming back home to the usa this is all probably 3 percent growth we aposre right on the cusp of the 3 percent growth all our critics said we couldn apost have the atlanta fed and other private forecasters are now looking for 4 percent growth in the second quarter i hope we get there i would take another 3 percent growth i think the tax cuts and the rollback of regulations has created not only new incentives to grow chris but also tremendous confidence consumer surveys business surveys small business surveys wallace ok kudlow and i think trade wallace i i want kudlow trade can dovetail into this in a very positive way if the president is able to change these trading practices and allow americans to export freely around the world wallace last last question and i aposve got 30 seconds there has been a federal directive since the reagan years the president that you worked for and where we first met that the president does not comment on the jobs numbers until at least an hour after they aposre formally announced the president at 7 30 an hour before they were announced on friday said looking forward to those numbers and the markets reacted you have said he did nothing wrong question has he agreed that he won apost do it again kudlow look by law and custom i was just doing my job and it was a great number and i got a hold of him on air force one wallace right i understand kudlow has he done anything wrong ph of course he has ph he didn apost put the numbers out yes other presidents have done this before someone reminded me president obama once did it wallace no he did it before he got the numbers kudlow he said it aposs going to be a terrible number look presidents can say what they aposre going to say there aposs no law if he had put the number out that would have been a much more difficult proposition will he do it again chris i don apost know if he aposll do it again i suppose i hope he doesn apost but you know just saying let aposs look at the jobs numbers all of america is looking at the job numbers that aposs a harmless tweet stock market futures by the way did nothing wallace the dollar went up kudlow the bond market wallace bond yields kudlow somebody said two two basis points wallace ok all right kudlow i mean come on wallace larry thank you thanks for your time it aposs always a pleasure to talk with you kudlow thank you sir appreciate it wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss prospects for the trump kim summit and the threat of a trade war with our closest allies commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states it will be a beginning i don apost say and i aposve never said it happens in one meeting you aposre talking about years of hostility years of problems years of really hatred between so many different nations but i think you aposre going to have a very positive result in the end end video clip wallace president trump expressing optimism but lowering expectations for his singapore summit with north korea aposs kim jong un and we aposre back now with the panel brit what are your thoughts now the summit is nine days away is the president giving up too much without any guarantee of what he aposs going to get from kim brit hume fox news senior political analyst well the strong ph men ph thought that for the president of the united states to sit down with some rogue dictator would confer legitimacy on that person and was therefore not a good idea to do unless it aposs in exchange for something worthy but there aposs a view in this administration and we don apost know if it aposs right yet that something really is different with the north koreans this time well we aposll find out i think the president aposs seeming eagerness for all of this to go forward is a little troubling because it may look like he wants the deal to badly which weakens your position at the same time though he does appear to be prepared for the fact that there aposs not going to be some it will not be some staggering breakthrough in this first round of discussions and that it could lead to a long process which is a realistic way to look at it and that aposs what you hope for in a negotiation like this is that the president has realistic expectations with mr trump from time to time seems not to wallace but juan i want to pick up on this with you because again i go back to what bolton and pompeo were saying in the beginning where they were talking about in effect the first meeting should be when are you going to get rid of everything juan williams fox news political analyst right wallace and if they didn apost give you a date certain you get up and you walk up now there aposre talking about a process a series of meetings negotiations given north korea aposs history where they make promises and then renege on them does this summit still make sense williams well no if you put it in those terms chris but the but brit makes the wise point which is you you know you hope that this process leads somewhere you hope that the administration aposs faith is rewarded in the end the problem is that we know historically going back to kim jong un aposs grandfather bill clinton and kim jong un kim jong il in 1994 these people lie they aposre deceitful they aposll take the concessions they aposll keep them in their pocket and then they won apost deliver so it looks like the president president trump is saying well maybe we can end the korean war that will be the big announcement at the summit or maybe we can say that we are lessening sanctions in the hope but that seems like a lengthy process and it does not seem to justify rewarding a brutal dictator with a with a position on the international stage wallace let aposs turn to the other big news this week and that is the president announcing new sanctions going into effect on june 1st against some of our closest allies the e u and canada and mexico here aposs what the president said on friday begin video clip donald trump president of the united states look the american worker agrees with me obviously the stock market agrees because when you look at what aposs going on with the stocks they aposre starting to see them ripe ph end video clip wallace guy going after china is one thing going after some of our closest allies is a very different matter guy benson townhall com yes it aposs a terrible idea trade wars generally are terrible ideas he talked about the american worker and he aposs talking about 140 000 roughly steel workers in america the wall street journal points out there are 6 5 million million americas workers in steel using industries who are going to be harmed by this and i think wallace in the auto business benson sure wallace in in beer cans benson yes i mean across across a ton of different industries so i think it is telling and unfortunate from the administration aposs perspective that you had this lengthy back and forth with larry kudlow moments ago and the amazing jobs report and state of the u s economy almost felt like an afterthought because we are discussing whether or not we should move forward with tariffs against some of our closest friends which will throw a wet blanket over the positive movement that i think is attributed to trump policies on deregulation and taxes and so forth this is a totally needless fight wallace marie let me pick up on that with you because you know international trade is not checkers it aposs three dimensional chess and you aposve now got china as we impose tariffs on some of our allies china is now reaching out to them and saying well you can do business with us and we aposre going to remove some of the barriers to our markets marie harf co host benson harf right we have not put tariffs on more of our allies than we have on china and the president i think sees foreign affairs really as zero sum there aposs winners and losers and he doesn apost often talk about things that are mutually beneficial whether it aposs trade or whether it aposs diplomacy he aposs really good at tearing things down he ripped up tpp he aposs trying to wrap up nafta wallace which is the pacific trade deal harf yes the trade deal he aposs trying to he walked away from the paris agreement he walked away from the iran deal all in the hopes he says that he can negotiate better deals whether it aposs on trade or nuclear weapons so far he aposs been good at ripping things up and not very good at building things back up or putting new agreements in place and so that aposs what will be interesting as we look at tariffs and trade as we look at nafta which the canadians are very upset about or if we look at north korean diplomacy whether he can actually make deals or just tear them up that is an open question today wallace and what i want to pick up on the last thing i discussed with larry kudlow brit and that was these astonishing job numbers lowest unemployment rate since the apos60s in one case the apos50s in another case could that be derailed if we get into a trade a serious trade dispute let alone war hume certainly could and there aposs no doubt in my mind that the president in in in putting his tariffs in place the ones just announced against our our european friends is playing with fire they they will retaliate and the all the parade of horribles may come into being however i would caution on that that this i think the president sees all this as a continued negotiation the troubling thing is we aposve been negotiating with some of these countries for some time now in hopes of a better deal and it hasn apost materialized so we aposll there aposs a way to go it aposs kind of the corollary to foreign policy where you practice diplomacy backed up by the threat of force here we aposre practicing trade negotiations backed up by the threat of tariffs but tariffs in and of themselves are almost always ruinous to both sides to all sides wallace all right we aposre going to have to end it there thank you all panel up next some surprising advice for the class of 2018 from our power players of the week commercial break wallace it aposs become an annual tradition here to sample some of the words of
