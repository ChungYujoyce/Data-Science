currently if you take donald trump out of the equation gov scott walker r wi gov jeb bush r fl and sen marco rubio r fl are the three leading contenders for the 2016 republican nomination according to recent national polling not coincidentally tested in three swing states colorado iowa and virginia against the presumptive democratic nominee a new quinnipiac university poll finds all three are also edging her in head to head match ups more from quinnipiac that s compared to the april 9 quinnipiac university poll in which she was clearly ahead in five of the matchups and too close to call in the other four one other key takeaway is that vice president joseph biden who is considering a 2016 run does better than clinton on honesty and on caring about voter needs always a key democratic strong point is it time to start panicking yet a little bit of context president obama won all three of these swing states in 2012 so perhaps democrats should feel somewhat hopeful about their chances of keeping colorado iowa and virginia blue heading into 2016 but it appears hillary clinton s rigid hands off afraid of the press campaign is rubbing voters the wrong away across the board her internals look shockingly awful in these three battleground states emphasis mine hillary clinton is not honest and trustworthy iowa voters say 59 33 percent she is a strong leader voters say 52 43 percent but she does not care about their needs and problems voters say 55 39 percent hillary clinton is not honest and trustworthy virginia voters say 55 39 percent she is a strong leader voters say 54 42 percent but she does not care about their needs and problems voters say 50 45 percent brutal in colorado iowa and virginia hillary clinton s honest and trustworthy numbers are underwater by double digits in colorado alone they re underwater by 28 points moreover a majority of respondents believe mrs clinton doesn t care about voters needs and problems which you might recall was the exact same problem mitt romney faced in 2012 and we all know how that turned out make no mistake these figures are and should be disconcerting for team hillary but are donald trump s worse the pollsters call the donald perhaps the biggest loser of the poll but that s debatable very debatable hillary clinton s look almost as bad alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
