that aposs not bad actually applause pastor andrew brunson lord god i ask that you pour out your holy spirit on president trump that you give him supernatural wisdom to accomplish all the plans you have for this country for him end video clip wallace the other big story today folks in the southeast still trying to dig out from hurricane michael one of the most powerful storms ever to hit this nation phil keating is in mexico beach florida where the storm made landfall phil phil keating fox news correspondent chris post hurricane day four just beginning and fema director brock long and florida governor rick scott just landed they are here getting a look on the ground up close the catastrophe that a near category five hurricane brings the search for the unaccounted through all the rubble continues total death toll now at 19 but that number is expected to rise today begin videotape keating shell shocked residents returning to the scene summed up in one tragic word catastrophe block after block in this town of 1 200 it looks like a bomb went off most evacuated before the hurricane but not steve ramsey and his dogs and they probably shouldn apost have survived unidentified male it came in so fast that i had to take the broom and bust his top window out and dump my dogs under i swam out so i threw all the dogs and everything in the boat and climb in the boat and rode out

tomorrow president trump flies in to panama city to take a look at this historic disaster for himself chris wallace phil keating reporting from florida phil thanks for that there was another big story this week the dramatic drop in the stock market raising new questions about the state of the u s economy joining us now president trump aposs top white house economic advisor larry kudlow larry the dow fell more than 1 000 points this week that aposs more than 4 percent and the other indexes followed suit what do you think the markets took such a hit and do you see them going up or down over the course of this year larry kudlow white house chief economic adviser well i would want to give it an investment strategy forecast today but i would like to say that these kind of corrections are absolutely normal i think it aposs about 5 percent or so 6 percent we aposre still ahead here today in the major indexes by 4 or 5 percent the economy is in terrific shape we are in an economic boom people thought it would be impossible the reality is we are clicking on all cylinders they are absolutely crushing it profits are rising confidence is up blue collar aposs are up wages are out so i think the back ground is very positive for the stock market and corrections come and go they should stay very calm over these things it aposs quite normal wallace you as you aposve just demonstrated are very bullish on the trump economy but some analysts see warning signs on the horizon let aposs go through some of those they know interest rates are rising so are energy prices the president aposs trade war with china is hurting growth and the global economy is slowing and the international monetary fund just revised its protection for u s growth down to 2 5 percent for next year 2019 question you see no cause for concern on the economy kudlow not to the american economy chris not at the present time as i said look this is a story in 2018 that most folks that would be impossible we aposve created an economic boom the president aposs policies have changed the whole incentive structure and the economy with lower tax rates for individuals and small businesses and other companies we deregulated across the board we spark a tremendous boom in energy which i think is going to continue for quite some time what we are also seeing here and i think this is very important in terms of the presidents views blue collar workers are booming right now the fastest pace of hiring for the blue collar workers since the mid 1980s when i was first there is a cub scout for president ronald reagan also another part i want to make on wages not only are wages rising at a pretty good pace but the blue collar middle and service areas typically a little slower chris they aposre actually raising faster than the white collar workers and i think this is the new face of the trump economy what i call blue collar workers in men and women who own their own small businesses as i said the incentive to change the president has ended the war on business he has entered the war on energy he aposs ended the war on success he said to people just go out there and take a rip at the ball got your back and that aposs exactly what aposs happening wallace well he may have started a war with the federal reserve he repeatedly called out the federal reserve this week for raising interest rates here aposs just one example of that begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i think the fed is far too stringent and they aposre making a mistake and is not right and it aposs despite that we are doing very well but it aposs not necessary in my opinion and i think i know about it better than they do end video clip wallace but larry isn apost that exactly what the fed is supposed to do when the economy is going strong to raise interest rates to prevent it from getting too hot and you aposre seeing a spike in inflation and whatever happened to recognizing the independence of the federal reserve as presidents have for decades kudlow well a couple of things on that by the by there is no spike in inflation respectfully crosstalk wallace no no i aposm saying that but that aposs what the fed does to try to prevent it when the economy is going strong they don apost want to see a spike in inflation look interest rates are two and a quarter percent they aposre not high kudlow well that aposs true there aposs a normalization going on look it the president is a successful businessman and an investor knows a lot about these topics and he is giving his opinion and his concern is that the fed might move too quickly and might choke off the economic recovery which is now running 3 or 4 percent ok he is not impinging on the fed independence he didn apost say i want you to change your plan he didn apost say i want you to change your strategy he knows the fed is independent crosstalk wallace he did say all of those things he didn apost order it and you could argue he couldn apost order it but he did say all of those things he said they aposre going crazy they aposre loco they aposre raising rates to high he did say that they aposre raising them too high too fast kudlow well that aposs his view again but he never said to the fed change i want you to change this or i want you to change that he respects the fed aposs independence and again what the president is raising here on the matter of interest rate timing and so forth a lot of people are discussing this people on wall street people in academia there aposs a whole of news articles some agree some disagree he aposs just weighing in there aposs nothing wrong with him weighing in i think the bigger picture is this look it the white house the president the federal reserve everybody wants this economic boom to continue everybody wants this boom to continue everybody is cognizant of the difficulties and the strategies that have to take part wallace right kudlow we aposre not giving away free money anymore but we aposre all we aposre all of similar minds on this just keep the boom going and i think that aposs what the president is saying and i don apost know can he speak his mind chris wallace well presidents generally don apost call out the fed or the fed chairman but let me move on to another subject the mysterious disappearance of journalist jamal khashoggi and concerns that he went into the saudi consulate in istanbul and was murdered the president said this week that he does not intend to impinge in any way on the 110 billion arms sale to the saudis treasury secretary mnuchin says he still plans to go to the economic conference in riyadh this next week so as far as the trump administration is concerned it aposs business as usual with the saudis kudlow well look the president several times said we want a prompt swift open transparent investigation i mean the khashoggi story is a tragedy for khashoggi and his family members as well as for everybody else terrible thing so we don apost know yet allegations are being made but we withheld our views the administration will be carefully carefully monitoring it this week i think the president wants a very prompt resolution of what exactly happened and we aposll see what actions are necessary should we find some results coming in this week regarding secretary mnuchin at the moment he is scheduled to go to a meeting in saudi that meeting is about terrorist financing and how to stop it it aposs a very important meeting but he too like the president will want to see how things go in the saudi investigation or the general investigation of the khashoggi tragedy before he makes a final decision wallace in the interview on 60 minutes tonight president trump says if it turns out that khashoggi was murdered by the saudis there will be serious consequences take a look at this clip begin video clip trump may be especially so because this man was a reporter there aposs something you aposll be surprised to hear me say that there aposs something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we aposre going to have to see we aposre going to get to the bottom of it and they will be severe punishment end video clip wallace the question is what kind of severe punishment if the 110 billion arms sales is off the table and the president has made it clear he intends to go through with that with the saudis what can you do kudlow well chris look as in every case when the president speaks when the president warns people should take him at his word obviously he is very very serious i aposm not going to get ahead of the curve he aposll decide what the proper actions are if indeed we find out that saudis were involved i don apost know that this morning probably nobody knows that just yet but take him at his word if the saudis are involved if khashoggi was killed or harmed or whatever bad outcome here he will take action and that has been his strategy believe what he says it aposs a lot like what the reverend coming out of turkey you know american foreign policy now has reclaimed what 18 or 20 hostages around the world now khashoggi is on a hostage situation i get that but from north korea and turkey and elsewhere that aposs been part of our foreign policy triad ph we will take stern action with the saudis if necessary take the president at his word wallace i went to squeeze into more questions larry first of all the saudis again today again denied that they had anything to do with khashoggi aposs disappearance and say if the u s takes actions they will retaliate does that concern you kudlow well i aposll leave it there i aposll leave it whatever that is it aposs up to the president and his foreign policy team we will see chris wallace i mean obviously they can have an impact on energy prices around the world kudlow well that aposs true by the way the united states is the dominant energy player so we are in pretty good shape in my opinion with our energy boom to cover any shortfalls that may be a small part of the story we aposll wait and see but rest assured that when the president says we will take actions if we find out if we find out bad outcomes he means it he aposs always meant it that aposs been part of his foreign policy from day one wallace finally and i got less than a minute left here we are sitting down with china aposs ambassador to the u s a little later in this program there aposs growing talk about a cold war between the u s and beijing how far is president trump prepared to go against beijing to pursue his policies not only on the economic front but military and political as well kudlow well look i aposll leave it leave it to historians about the term cold war but i will say this i aposve been very involved in the trade talks with china those talks have been unsatisfactory we aposve made our asks you can apost steal america aposs intellectual property you can apost force technology transfers just recently china issued a regulation where their police can hack into american companies in china in order to steal secrets that is not good they have tariffs and nontariff barriers you know the president said time and time again on trade and i think this works for the security issues as well we want reciprocity we want rules by the game to be observed wallace right kudlow and china has not now the president and president trump and xi will probably meet at the g20 in buenos aires argentina later in the year there aposs plans and discussions and agendas and so forth wallace right kudlow but the relationship has not been positive lately and we have to have reciprocity in all of these areas trade security military issues that aposs what aposs at stake here we have to defend american interests as the president has said many many times wallace larry thank you thanks for your time and we will watch how the markets do this week sir kudlow thank you chris appreciate it wallace up next 23 days until the midterm elections we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss how both the right and left her trying to fire up their voters commercial break begin video clip trump the democrats have become too extreme and they become frankly too dangerous to govern they aposve gone wacko end video clip wallace president trump at a rally in iowa this week pushing the post kavanaugh message portraying democrats as a mob and it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume philippe reines former senior advisor to hillary clinton julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and gop strategist karl rove well the washington post is out with a new poll today let aposs put up the numbers it shows president trump aposs approval numbers are up five points from late august but there aposs still deeply underwater and on the generic ballot question who do you support in your house district democrats lead by 11 points among registered voters 13 points among likely voters karl how do you see the midterms 23 days out karl rove former bush white house adviser republicans look good in the senate because of the map we have so many republican oriented states and so few democrat so few republican senators up for election the house is a different question take charlie cook he has 196 solid to lean republican wallace we should say he writes the cook political report kind of a bible rove yes look there are several others but they all serve in the same place he aposs got 208 solid to lean democrat seats so and 31 toss ups two democrat seats 29 republican seats the democrats can take control only need ten if they hold all of those minutes about a third of the toss up seats republicans we need to take about 71 but it aposs going to be close and it aposs going to be a long night i would suspect we aposre going to have a large number of races settled by a relatively small handful of votes governorships a lot of those up this year 36 of them republicans are likely to lose seats simply because they have so many and unfortunately there will be a couple of big state governors in there wallace julie what do you hear from folks at the white house do they feel particularly with the kavanaugh confirmation battle that they have blunted the so called blue wave of democratic advances and to the degree that they still worry about especially losing the house how worried are they about that that if they lose the house if speaker pelosi and adam schiff in terms of intelligence the impact it aposs going to have in terms of investigations and hearings and also on their agenda julie pace associated press i think they should and your first question on the wave i think they feel like they aposve been able to blunt that on the senate side there was this point coming out of the summer coming out of labor day where it actually did look like some of these senate races that did feel pretty comfortable for republicans are getting closer that seems to have shifted and we now do seem to be in a place for the senate is definitely leaning more strongly toward republicans but this question about what happen if democrats take back the house is really a big cloud over this white house because democrats will then have subpoena power in the house they will be launching as they have already said a whole raft of investigations that is not just investigations into things that we know bob mueller has been looking at they are open to going after trump aposs taxes to going after financial dealings of other people in the administration in the cabinet this is something i think would really basically dominate 2019 for the president in part because he hasn apost done a particularly good job at laying out what his legislative agenda would be in a divided government he aposs got some ideas on infrastructure and criminal justice reform but there aposs nothing proactive that he aposs necessarily pushing in the white house because they are understaffed and have been for quite some time they do not have the infrastructure in place right now to deal with a lot of democratic investigations wallace meanwhile especially after the kavanaugh confirmation fight there seems to be a push among democrats to take on donald trump on his own terms to be more aggressive and it aposs coming from some unlikely sources take a look begin video clip hillary clinton former secretary of state you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about eric holder former attorney general michelle always says that you know when they go low we go high no no when they go low we kick them end video clip wallace brit we should make it clear that later in that same speech eric holder made it clear that he is not advocating violence but this move to the left on issues on tactics do you think it aposs good politics for the democrats brit hume fox news senior political analyst well i think within the democratic party coming you see a couple of political figures they are trying to catch up a couple of beats behind the music the core base the democratic party is in a rage and they want to seem to be in a rage too they want to make sure everybody knows they aposre part of the resistance too so that aposs where i think this is i don apost think it aposs good politics i don apost think the spectacle to kavanaugh hearing and the demonstrations that surrounded it which got pretty ugly and pretty far outside your normal bounds are helpful to democrats at all and you know this kavanaugh business was a very very big deal because it went on so long it was so conspicuous let aposs remember in the middle of it the new york times came out with a story very long piece about trump aposs alleged cheating on his taxes through the years it sank without a sound practically so much so that a few days later the times ran it again and it still seems to have gotten no traction so that aposs how big a deal that aposs how much that kavanaugh controversy drown things out and i think republicans will benefit from this into the midterms whether they can match the democrats enthusiasm is entirely another matter i doubt that but republicans are in better shape because of it wallace philippe you can see the republicans on the president certainly pushing this idea they aposre dangerous don apost give a match to an arsonist they aposre loco crazy do forget the republican talking points in your view do democrats take a risk of being seen as too extreme the mob at that conceivably hurt them in the midterms philippe reines former hillary clinton senior adviser well i aposd say a couple of things first sitting here as a democrat i aposm confused because prior to a few weeks ago i was a snowflake of the party of snowflakes and suddenly we are an angry mob of terrorists so but to the point you aposre asking it doesn apost really matter at this point whether we are as rageful as billed because we been billed as rageful and i would say the notion of when we go high stay high that should have died on november 8th 2016 i aposm definitely in the hillary clinton eric holder camp the anger among the democratic party is genuine so i think in a very simple way it is good to stay with that genuine emotion whether it is the most effective tactic next month in next two years i don apost know but it aposs genuine and i don apost think it should be ignored and i don apost think i should try to be falsely mitigated and we aposre going to see unfortunately people trying to modulate or trying to out trump trump and i think in 2019 that aposs going to be a real problem for the democratic field wallace real quickly karl rove it aposs a dumb move and i hope they keep it up but look the people who would decide wallace why is it dumb rove the people who would decide this election are people who sort of like what trump is doing but don apost like how trump is acting in the last thing they want is for the next two years to be a food fight in washington so the idea of jerry nadler saying we aposre going to move towards impeachment causes these people to say the system is broken and it allows a republican a smart republican to say the system is broken wallace they weren apost over necessarily talking about impeachment they aposre saying we aposre going to match their passion with ours rove fine it doesn apost come across that way that mob around the capital during kavanaugh screaming and shouting in the violence that people have been seeing in our political system reines it aposs called protesting i mean rove great let aposs go throw paint on the republican headquarters in manhattan and say that that is normal no it aposs not normal our politics is broken and the american people are going to decide they aposre going to vote for more republicans than they should this fall because the republican is going to say i aposm going to go to washington and try to find a way to make this thing work when you have a democrat who says i aposm going to go there and create problems for the country by going after trump people are sick of it and they want to crosstalk reines if they were sick of it donald trump wouldn apost be president rove well that was because you had a canada on the other side who was the one person the democrats could nominate that donald trump could beat and she ran a lousy campaign and her comments the other day about instability i mean what is she saying i mean this is brutal crosstalk wallace all right guys you aposre stealing time for the next panel we are going to take a break here when we come back we aposre going to discuss kanye west speaking of calm forces in american politics kanye west freewheeling visit to the west wing plus what would you like to ask the panel about the political impact of kanye aposs oval office event just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday we may use your question on the air and later are the u s and china engaged in a new cold war we aposll ask beijing aposs man in washington commercial break wallace coming up kanye west puts on quite a performance in the oval office begin video clip kanye west musician there was something about when i put this hat on it made me feel like superman end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday group whether the rapper aposs support for the president will pay off in the polls next on fox news sunday commercial break kanye west rap artist trump is on his hero aposs journey right now and he might not have expected to have a crazy mother expletive deleted like kanye west run up and support let me give this guy a hug and i love this guy right here end video clip chris wallace fox anchor well that was just a taste of kanye west aposs freestyle rap at his meeting with president trump in the oval office and we aposre back now with the panel we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on twitter from troy carline who tweets does trump really think kanye west will help him gain support from the african american with the african american vote julie how do you answer troy why do you think the president invited reporters and cameras in to see him with kanye west julie pace associated press well i think it aposs pretty simple i think the president does think that this will help him with african american voters whether it actually does or not i think is a different question look i think that trump at his core is someone who really understands the power of a televised moment he understands the power of doing something that aposs a little offbeat this was certainly offbeat it was covered widely and again i do think that he looks at someone like kanye and things well if kanye aposs with me then maybe i can get more support among african american voters i actually do think he makes that connection but having covered a lot of politicians with a lot of celebrity endorsers i think that i can safely say that that really doesn apost have as much of an effect as sometimes a campaign or a white house thinks that they do wallace president trump says that he gets substantially more support from african americans than most republicans have gotten over the years but the numbers don apost back him up let aposs take a look in 2012 mitt romney got 6 percent of the black vote in 2016 mr trump got 8 percent and in a recent poll 12 percent of african americans approve of the job president trump is doing while 85 percent disapprove britt your thoughts about kanye aposs visit to the oval office and is there any political benefit brit hume fox news senior political analyst i think there aposs probably some modest political benefit look the african american vote for the democratic party have been monolithic now supports the democratic i mean they aposve been monolithic for years a republicans can only hope to cut into that a little bit because it aposs the culturally i think the black vote is so is so oriented toward the toward the democrats so this bizarre event and that aposs what it was might help a little but only a little as julie suggests wallace then there was another interesting event this week and that was melania trump aposs primetime interview on abc her first time being interviewed at length here aposs a clip begin video clip melania trump first lady i could say i aposm the most bullied person in the world unidentified male you think you aposre the most bullied person in the world trump one one of them unidentified male you aposre not the first first lady to have to deal with her husband aposs alleged infidelities has this put a strain on your marriage trump it is not concern and focus of mine i aposm a mother and a first lady and i have much more important things to think about and to do end video clip wallace philippe you have some experience here having advised hillary clinton how to deal with some of these questions how did you think melania did philippe reines former hillary clinton senior adviser it was cringe worthy her saying that she aposs one of the most bullied people in the world is cringe worthy look the the role of first lady is not a job it aposs ill defined it aposs what you make of it and what we aposve seen of you know over the last decades is that the first lady often picks a signature issue for her to pick bullying and then to sort of disregard the bullying her husband does on a daily basis and then to double down and say that she aposs the most bullied i aposm sorry that goes from bad joke to just being tone deaf and i i don apost know i aposm sure that a lot of people saw it and said you aposre absolutely right but i aposm not sure what the point of it is hume what the point of it may be as this can you imagine if she were the spouse of a democratic president the adoring coverage that she would receive and she has not gotten that she has been treated either almost completely ignored she aposs not on the cover of the big fashion magazines all the time the way a democratic first lady who looks like her would be and she aposs often mocked and ridiculed now whether that makes her the among the most bullied persons on earth i don apost know but the but her complaint is not without at least some basis reines but she gets away with a lot i mean this is a woman who only a few years ago was full on on the birther attack and she has never been pressed on that ironically she was in kenya last week the very point where her and her husband were saying that president obama was supposedly born she aposs not being pressed on that she aposs not being pressed particularly on why is your office lying and saying you aposre just wearing a jacket because you pulled it off the rack and her saying hume she is being pressed on that i aposve seen all kinds of coverage on that there was a contradiction pace but there aposs a difference between what the office said after the fact and then what she said which is which does not hume i know that and that has been and that has karl rove fox news contributor and it was hume and that has been very widely covered rove and it was four months ago pace does not help your coverage when we find these inconsistencies wallace well i wasn apost sure we were going to have much to say about melania evidently we are karl weigh in rove i have a slightly different view i thought we saw a strong independent thoughtful caring person maybe she had would have found a better way to express the negative press that she aposs gotten than bullying but i i saw i saw somebody who people could admire and appreciate clearly independent i mean this is a woman who was asked some very tough questions about her relationship with her husband and made it clear that she was in charge and she was going to do what she wanted to do and i thought it was a magnificent time and i aposm glad she did it and reines we can apost leave this segment on that note and rove no no no don apost hey don apost touch me man you aposre bullying me you aposre bullying me reines i aposm being civil it was a light tap rove you aposre bullying me wallace go ahead go ahead go ahead philippe reines when karl came into the white house he took over hillary clinton aposs office which was a big deal she had a west wing office and what was the first thing you did when you took over that office this is my favorite karl story you want me to tell it rove probably not true but go ahead reines you had an exorcism rove no i didn apost no i didn apost reines i aposm disappointed because that aposs a great story rove i mean i had i had i had a catholic priest who was a friend of mine who came in and prayed in my office and wished me the best so but somehow or another reines there were no evil spirits rove somehow or another you people try to inaudible wallace all right all right reines i aposm disappointed i thought that was a great rove everything aposs about you isn apost it about the clintons isn apost it wallace ok wait wait rove everything wallace question how is mrs trump regarded in the trump white house i mean we know how hillary was regarded we know how other first ladies nancy reagan how is she regarded is she seen are people scared of her is she seen as an important advisor to the president where is she seen in terms of weighing in on policy and staff pace she aposs done a really interesting thing where she is and this is indisputable she is an important adviser to this president but she does it in her own way she is not a first lady who spends a lot of time in the west wing she is not somebody who look a michelle obama did who developed strong relationships with certain people in the west wing and had people there who were sort of her voice this is more her to the president in their private time but she you know there aposs this effect to kind of put her in a box and and define her and i think what we have seen over these last couple of years is that that aposs really impossible to do because on the one hand she is as strongest a supporter of her husband as anyone yet she finds moments where she is willing to speak out against him in a really public way some of his policy decisions some of the things that he says on twitter and i think that that aposs what we aposre going to see from her in the next couple of years somebody who kind of has to look moment to moment to figure out where she aposs going to be but indisputably she is in line with this with this president wallace thank you panel see you next sunday next up the u s takes a more confrontational approach to china as markets drop and tensions over trade rise we aposll discuss chances for a new cold war with china aposs ambassador to the u s next commercial break wallace president trump aposs policy towards china keeps getting tougher as the world aposs two biggest economies face off not just over trade but also military and political issues earlier i sat down with china aposs ambassador to the u s cui tiankai to discuss the state of relations between our two countries begin videotape wallace ambassador cui welcome to fox news sunday cui tiankai chinese ambassador to the u s thank you wallace i want to start with vice president pence aposs tough comments about china last week here he is begin video clip mike pence vice president of the united states when it comes to beijing aposs malign influence and interference in american politics and policy we will continue to expose it no matter the form it takes end video clip wallace the vice president called out what he says is your economic aggression what he called your emboldened military and what he alleges are your efforts to interfere in the u s midterm election are the u s and china now engaged in a new cold war cui well first of all i have to say all these accusations are groundless one of the fundamental principals in china aposs foreign policy is non interference in the internal affairs of other countries and we have been consistent in this position we have a very good track record wallace you were part of a quite tough meeting with secretary of state pompeo in beijing this week in which top chinese officials said that they would take quote all necessary measures to safeguard your country how far is china prepared to go in terms of standing up to the u s cui i think it aposs the legitimate right of every country to defend its national interest and china is no exception but the talks secretary pompeo had in beijing was a very good communication at such a high level between the two sides and it aposs very timely wallace let aposs unpack some of this and let aposs start with the allegation of election meddling vice president pence says that china is specifically targeting tariffs to hurt republican voters to try to turn them away from voting for republican candidates and eventually from voting for president trump in 2020 he says that you are putting propaganda mailers in u s newspapers and this week the fbi director said that china is now the number one the greatest counterintelligence threat that the u s faces are you engaged in trying to meddle in the election in 2018 the way that russians did in 2016 cui you see chinese media they are just learning from america media to use all these means to buy commercial pages from newspapers to make their views known or to cover what is happening here this is normal practice for all the media wallace i want to turn to trade war president trump has imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods your country has responded with tariffs on 110 billion of u s exports here is president trump on the situation begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we have tremendous potential to grow incredibly when we get rid of these horrible disgusting trade deals with china over the last five six years we aposve been losing 300 billion to 500 billion a year billion end video clip wallace now i know you say that the u s started it but at this point whoever started it are the u s and china engaged in a trade war cui well we don apost have any trade war with any other country including the united states the fact is through the balance of trade between china and the united states you know how much benefit american consumers have got over the years and how much money america companies have made from their operations in china you have to look at the whole picture it aposs important to notice who started this trade war we never want to have a trade war but if somebody started a trade war against us we have to respond and defend our own interests wallace u s officials say though that china is not so innocent in all of this they say that you steal intellectual property that you force technology transfers from u s companies that invest in china to chinese companies and here is trump trade advisor peter navarro talking about china begin video clip peter navarro white house trade adviser structurally it aposs geared toward being this sort of the parasite of the world everything that it does to grow its economy often comes at the expense of everybody else end video clip wallace and just this week a top chinese intelligence officer was extradited back to the u s for allegedly trying to steal secrets from ge aviation and other aerospace companies cui i think all of these accusations about how china has developed are groundless and not fair to the chinese people you see china has 1 4 billion people it would be hard to imagine that one fifth of the global population could develop and not prosper not by relying mainly on their own efforts but by stealing or forcing some transfer of technology from others that aposs impossible the chinese people are as hardworking and diligent as anybody on earth wallace are you clear who president trump listens to on trade issues whether it aposs moderates like kudlow and mnuchin or hardliners like navarro cui you tell me wallace you have confusion about this i mean that aposs obviously part of your job as the chinese ambassador to be able to report back to beijing who has the president aposs ear cui honestly i aposve been talking to ambassadors of other countries in washington d c and this is also part of their problem wallace what cui they don apost know who is the final decision maker of course presumably the president will take the final decision but who is playing what role sometimes it could be very confusing wallace there are also military tensions a chinese warship recently harassed a u s ship exercising freedom of navigation in the south china sea and the u s is close to approving a 330 million arms sale to taiwan do you view these the u s ships in the south china sea sales to taiwan do you view those as u s provocations cui first of all i think i will have to be clear where the incident took place you were right to say it was in south china sea so it aposs at china aposs doorstep it aposs not chinese warships that are going to the coast of of california or to the gulf of mexico it aposs so close to the chinese islands and to it aposs so close to the chinese coast so who is on the offensive who is on the defensive this is very clear about american arms sale to taiwan this is a very good example of american intervention into chinese internal affairs wallace let aposs talk about another flash point north korea does china agree with north korean leader kim jong un that any steps that he takes towards denuclearization must be matched by u s concessions on the other side and what do you how do you respond to allegations even by president trump that china has relaxed its sanctions against north korea and is allowing goods to flow into north korea cui china has voted in favor of all the u n security council resolutions about sanctions against dprk and we are implementing all these resolutions wallace you have not relaxed them cui since as long as these resolutions are still enforced we will implement them faithfully wallace and do you think that the united states is right that denuclearization has to happen first or do you agree with kim that north korea takes a step the u s takes a step cui i aposm think in order to achieve or goal we have to have a coordinated phased and step by step approach wallace that aposs the kim position cui well this is the reality how can you convince him to give up all the nuclear weapons without any hope that the u s would be following a more friendly policy towards him wallace finally president xi and president trump will meet in buenos aries at the g 20 summit next month in november what do you think are the possibilities that they can turn the situation around make it less tense cui you see i was very honored to be present at the meetings between the two presidents both at mar a lago april last year and in beijing last november and it was so clear that such top level communication played a key role irreplaceable role in guiding the relationship forward and there aposs a good mutual understanding and a good working relationship between the two i hope and i aposm sure this will continue wallace ambassador cui thank you so much please come back sir cui thank you end videotape wallace up next our power play of the week what do queen elizabeth vladimir putin and benjamin netanyahu have in common they have all stayed here commercial break wallace there are some landmarks in washington that people rarely get to go inside and we got to wondering about one famous building here that aposs off limits to all but a few here is our power player of the week begin videotape matthew wendel general manager blair house we recently had korea visit wallace

the house in 1836 for 6 500 but that aposs just the start of its place in history wendel chris this is the lincoln room it aposs called that because when lincoln was president he often came over here to get advice from the blairs wallace blair house took on a new role in 1942 during world war ii when churchill used a stay at the white house wendel he would be up late at night having a drink or two waking up the president and mrs roosevelt just was had had enough wallace on camera so they bought blair house wendel yes unidentified male so now the truman aposs arrive at their new home ready to set up housekeeping in washington the presidential address is the blair house wallace voice over starting in 1948 harry truman lived here four years while the white house was under renovation wendel

and then there aposs the truman study wendel and that aposs where truman had his oval basically oval office during the renovation of the white house when he lived here wallace but in 1950 two puerto rican nationalists tried to shoot their way into blair house and kill the president unidentified male president truman continues to take his daily walks two quick shooting white house guards were wounded in the fury of gunfire that marked the phonetic assault wallace in 1977 jimmy carter gave blair house a new role every president elect since has spent the night before his inauguration in what aposs called the principal suite with two separate bedrooms but the main role of blair house is what it aposs been for 76 years to extend the nation aposs hospitality to pres
