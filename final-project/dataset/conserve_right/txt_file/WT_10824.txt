manual indicates that u s information operations will be carried out under professional military rules and legal constraints and will be conducted ethically u s military information operations have been hamstrung by legal restrictions according to military officials at the central command they said in the past plans for information warfare against terrorists were scuttled by delays caused by legal reviews that prevented timely use of many information operations in the early 2000s a pentagon plan to use strategic information warfare in the war on terrorism was abandoned after public affairs officials opposed the use of deception operations the army plans to use military deception what it calls mildec to deliberately mislead enemy decision makers whether military paramilitary or terrorist leaders the intent of mildec is to feed information that deliberately misleads the enemy decision makers as to friendly military capabilities intentions and operations and lead the enemy to take actions or inactions that contribute to accomplishment of the friendly mission the manual says deception can be a decisive tool in altering enemy actions in response to u s military operations the manual says tactical deception is used by commanders in planning operations that will cause enemies to act or react in desired ways by masking u s vulnerabilities or enhancing u s defenses counterdeception is used to prevent human and automated decision makers from being affected by enemy deception deception is also used to create multiple false indicators to confuse the enemy or adversary the army manual identifies two secret types of information operations the first is called integrated joint special technical operations ijsto that use special technical capabilities to gain a decisive advantage over an enemy or adversary a second secret category is special access programs or saps that include sensitive acquisition intelligence or operations that can be used in information warfare operations chinese use of information warfare was outlined in a military publication titled unrestricted warfare that called for using all means necessary for winning russian information warfare was outlined by russian chief of general staff gen valery gerasimov in his 2013 book the value of science is in foresight the doctrine calls for extending traditional warfare to peacetime information warfare operations such as the campaign to influence the 2016 u s presidential election google helping chinese repression technology giant google is working with china s government to produce a special search engine named dragonfly that will allow government censors to limit searches of topics opposed by the ruling communist party details about the project were disclosed in an internal speech by ben gomes google s search engine chief the july 18 speech by mr gomes mentions that politics in washington under president trump are changing rapidly and noted the strong anti russia policies following the disclosure of moscow s election meddling so at some level at our scale we need to maintain that optionality in case suddenly the world changes or he decides his new best friend is chinese president xi jinping mr gomes said mr trump has frequently referred to mr xi as a friend but as a result of ongoing trade disputes recently scaled back his praise for the chinese leaders mr gomes speech published by the anti secrecy website the intercept describes china as a new market for google and the next billion users of search engines the chinese search engine that google hoped to produce in six to nine months from july will allow the increasingly repressive regime of mr xi to block chinese internet users from searching for information about topics the government opposes that likely would include blocking search terms seeking information on the 1989 chinese military crackdown on unarmed protesters in tiananmen square human rights abuses such as the imprisonment and death of nobel peace prize winner liu xiaobo and the imprisonment of an estimated 1 million ethnic uighurs in western xinjiang province mr gomes in the remarks to google employees working on the search engine made no mention of china s information controls saying only that the project was something extremely important to the company however the executive made clear that the project is controversial he promised the assembled employees that google leaders were working to make sure your careers are not affected by this mr gomes indicated that google was seeking to enter the chinese market which he described as arguably the most interesting market in the world today we need to understand what is happening there in order to inspire us he said it s not just a one way street china will teach us things that we don t know the development of dragonfly has drawn criticism from human rights groups capitol hill lawmakers and some google employees vice president mike pence also called on google in a recent speech to cancel dragonfly more business leaders are thinking beyond the next quarter and thinking twice before diving into the chinese market if it means turning over their intellectual property or abetting beijing s oppression mr pence said oct 4 but more must follow suit google mr pence said should immediately end development of the dragonfly app that will strengthen communist party censorship and compromise the privacy of chinese customers dia on china ai warfare defense intelligence agency director lt gen robert p ashley warned recently that china is rapidly developing artificial intelligence ai for use in warfighting capabilities china is aggressively pursuing a 2025 strategy where they want to be the main driver of ai not only for their economic but for their industrial transformation gen ashley told a conference oct 8 the character of war is constantly changing and we see ai as we see some of these disruptive technologies that continue to change the character of war the complexity and the speed of human interaction our task is to understand how they operate what s the defeat mechanism what s the target system analysis and how do we find the vulnerabilities in those weapons systems to defeat them he said china also is using ai in a three phase project of human performance enhancement he said it started with the digital age it s moving into artificial intelligence with neural networks and then the next step the integration of human and machines gen ashley said china is working to integrate ai into its next generation jet fighter with the aim of achieving air superiority other ai powered weapons will include large formations of unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles space combat systems and armored vehicles china also is developing ai backed information warfare capabilities that combine influence operations with cyberattacks for use in future conflicts china s hypersonic missiles high speed maneuvering strike vehicles also will be equipped with artificial intelligence guidance and sensors contact bill g
