apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic augusta ga the pressure is already off the record breaking 14 year old masters tournament participant from china if tianlang guan fails to qualify to return to the masters in 2014 he can at least come back for the finals of the drive chip putt cham pionship typically augusta na tion al golf club is one of those timeless places where aging champions are annually feted but the first day of masters week turned into a celebration of junior golf see also masters 2013 pairings announced for thursday friday rounds shortly after tianlang the remarkably composed asia pacific ama teur champion talked about enjoying the moment before he headed out for a practice round with tiger woods augusta na tional chairman billy payne announced that the world s most renowned private club would be opening its doors the sunday before the 2014 masters to an even younger crowd the finals of next year s drive chip putt will bring 88 girls and boys ages 7 15 to au gus ta national a dream come true for any aspiring golfer imagine if you will the incredible excitement these 88 finalists will experience as they come to the site of the masters to compete in the driving and chipping on our beautiful tournament practice range and as they conclude their competition putting to win as all major masters champions have before on the 18th green of augusta national golf club payne said now imagine you re one of those 14 year olds actually getting to drive chip and putt during the actual masters in front of more than 50 000 fans and a worldwide audience that s where tianlang now sits as he prepares for a night s sleep in the crow s nest after playing through amen corner with his idol woods if you think about it he s not even in high school yet he can t even play high school golf woods said he s in middle school and he s playing the masters it s a pretty remarkable story indeed it is one that has the boy from guangzhou china walking on air in between homework assignments and boning up on his english i m really excited in the morning when i come out on the course and there s many people here and i m really looking forward to the tournament said tianlang speaking english more fluently than many adolescent american boys i think it s going to be a little pressure to me but i m not going to push myself too hard and i m going to enjoy the game so far following the advice of his mentor liang wen chong who played in the 2008 masters tianlang has been acclimating himself to augusta for three weeks playing a couple of rounds each week at the national he s gotten to know the course as well as he can but there s only so much a 5 foot 9 kid who s bulked up 12 pounds since november to 143 pounds can do on a 7 435 yard course i would say i m not long enough but i think i m still all right in this golf course tianlang said and i drive a little bit longer in thailand than here but i think i m still all right not a really serious problem his biggest challenges will be augusta s long par 4s including nos 1 and 11 he ll have trouble reaching the crest of the hill on the first leaving him about 190 yards and a hybrid to the vexing green first thing every day on no 11 he ll be back even further in the 200 to 220 yard range facing a cut fairway wood into the pond guarded green if i play good this hole is all right but it s going to play tough he said tianlang showed the strength of his youth monday he played an 18 hole practice round with two time mas ters champion ben cren shaw in the morning then went out for the late nine with woods the 61 year old crenshaw called it a strange experience at times i think all of us are asking ourselves what were we doing at 14 said crenshaw who admits at that age he had a girlfriend who occupied too much of his time you can tell he breathes golf it was fascinating to see him play in an age when more kids are pushing the envelope at younger ages tianlang is unique with his long putter which makes up for any shortages in power he won the 2011 junior world golf championship with a record 18 under total he later won the 2012 asia pacific amateur firing 66 64 on the first two days at amata spring country club in thailand then making a gritty par on a closing par 4 he couldn t reach with a driver and 3 wood to win by one shot over asia s top two amateurs that made him the youngest player to qualify for a major championship eclipsing another 14 year old from china andy zhang who missed the cut at last year s u s open tianlang is two years younger than matteo manas sero was when he first played in the masters in 2010 i want to say because i have the confidence and i know i can play well he said so i m going to play like myself so i m not going to try to do too much things outside of the favorites tianlang has been the talk of the tournament so far some conversations more admirable than others i don t think i would have handled it said nicolas colsaerts a masters rookie at age 30 you know 14 we re all busy already playing a lot of good golf but to play augusta at 14 i think everybody is almost in shock i hope for him he s going to enjoy this week as much as i am then there are guys such as charlie beljan who won last fall at disney but didn t receive an automatic invitation to the masters he bitterly tweeted can t even get in with a pgatour win but 14 year olds are welcome some people don t get it it s not a question about whether tian lang can compete with woods on sunday to win the mas ters half the field has no chance of doing that sometimes a story just needs to be marveled at for what it is remarkable as woods said as the olympic motto says citius altius fortius faster higher stronger and in the case of augusta
