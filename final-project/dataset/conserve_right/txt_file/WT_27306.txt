tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn bellinzona switzerland ap u s secretary of state mike pompeo said sunday that the trump administration is ready for unconditional discussions with iran in an effort to ease rising tensions that have sparked fears of conflict but the united states will not relent in trying to pressure the islamic republic to change its behavior in the middle east america s top diplomat said pompeo repeated long standing u s accusations that iran is bent on destabilizing the region but he also held out the possibility of talks as president donald trump has suggested trump himself had raised the idea of talks without preconditions in july 2018 although that was well before tensions had reached their current point in the 11 months since then the u s has imposed crippling sanctions on iran first in november and then again last month targeting the most lucrative sectors of its economy the action has drawn iran s ire and strong words of threatened retaliation top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties iran s president hassan rouhani said the u s must return to the historic 2015 nuclear deal which trump withdrew from in may 2018 he was quoted by iran s state run irna news agency as saying that if the u s realizes that the way it chose was incorrect then we can sit at the negotiating table and solve any problem otherwise he said iran has no choice but resistance while the latest offer may not pan out pompeo made it during a visit to switzerland the country that long has represented american interests in iran as part of a european trip aimed at assuring wary leaders that the u s is not eager for war we re prepared to engage in a conversation with no preconditions pompeo told reporters at a news conference with his swiss counterpart we re ready to sit down with them but the american effort to fundamentally reverse the malign activity of this islamic republic this revolutionary force is going to continue iran s foreign minister dismissed trump s invitation for iranian officials to contact him about possible talks it s not very likely because talking is the continuation of the process of pressure he is imposing pressure this may work in a real estate market it does not work in dealing with iran javad zarif told abc s this week separate from pompeo s remarks about iran the washington post reported sunday that the american secretary of state recently told a private gathering of jewish leaders in new york that the administration s long awaited mideast peace plan might be argued to be unexecutable and might not gain traction citing an audio recording of the remarks delivered tuesday the post reported that pompeo expressed his hope that the peace deal isn t simply dismissed out of hand the plan that trump has called the deal of the century has been delayed several times as pompeo noted to the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations downplaying expectations for finding the key to an agreement ending the conflict he told the group there are no guarantees that we re the ones that unlock it in switzerland pompeo s meeting with foreign minister ignazio cassis in the southern swiss town of bellinzona came amid concerns about the potential for escalation and miscalculation with iran a situation that has many in europe and the middle east on edge cassis whose country has been an intermediary between the two before made no secret of that nervousness the situation is very tense we are fully aware both parties are fully aware of this tension switzerland of course wishes there is no escalation no escalation to violence he said both parties are now increasing the pressure and for the rest this is a matter of worry but we cannot do anything unless we get a mandate from both parties cassis said switzerland would be pleased to serve as an intermediary but not a mediator between the united states and iran to do so however would require requests from both sides he said neither he nor pompeo would say if such requests had been made of the swiss pompeo thanked switzerland which serves as the protecting power for the united states in iran for looking after americans detained there trump administration officials have suggested they would look positively at any move to release at least five american citizens and at least two permanent u s residents currently imprisoned in iran pompeo declined to comment on whether he had made a specific request to the swiss about the detainees but he said the release of unjustly jailed americans in iran and elsewhere is a

relent in raising pressure on iran with economic sanctions despite the firm stance trump has signaled a willingness to talk with iran s leadership iranian officials have hinted at the possibility but also insisted they will not be bulled if they want to talk i m available trump said last week even as pompeo and the white house national security adviser john bolton were stepping up warnings that
