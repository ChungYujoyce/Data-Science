apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion skill can be acquired talent you have to be born with politically talent is located midway between the brain and the gut a lightning fast instinct for recognizing and grasping opportunities and an intuitive gift for spotting your opponents weaknesses and exploiting them to the hilt donald trump may not have absorbed the wisdom of the ages by reading the federalist papers and engaging in endless navel gazing he may be a political novice who launched his elective career at an age when most people are getting ready to retire and if you let his deliberately distracting barrage of tweets seemingly gratuitous off the cuff remarks and frenetic footwork distract you you might conclude that his mouth talks faster than his brain thinks that is certainly what many of his old business rivals new political opponents and baffled bitter members of the mainstream commentariat seem to have believed usually to their own cost mr trump is like a man with a laser pointer teasing a cat he calls the tune and the cat dances to it like the gods of the ancient pantheon those the donald would destroy he first makes mad this talent is demonstrated on nearly every page of political reporters alan salkin and aaron short s concise briskly paced oral history a compilation of eye witness interviews quoted by name and on the record top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens politics isn t beanbags nerves of steel and a bullet proof hide come in handy yet many politicians especially those who hail from states where their party has a virtual power monopoly have never developed either quality schmoozing pandering to a few key constituencies and basking in applause while buttering up fat cats at fundraisers is pretty much the beginning and end of their political skill set as illustrated by former vice president joe biden who failed miserably in the past when he tried to parlay these rather puny assets into a national campaign for the democratic presidential nomination by contrast donald trump went through the toughest career boot camp in the world half a century before he turned to politics surviving booms busts and vicious competition in the big apple property market he is living proof that if you can make it in new york as a generator of jobs and profits rather than as a political hack and raiser of taxes you can make it anywhere the testimony of more than 100 people who have worked closely with the president and agreed to speak on the record to the authors paints a fascinating picture of a man who may seem to be winging it but who never loses sight of his long term objectives even as he drives his opponents to distraction with spontaneous outbursts under all the theatrics there is a core consistency that can be traced all the way back to his parents as roger stone the cut throat conservative operative i once described as the son roy cohn never had reminded the authors donald was a republican for virtually all of his life both of his parents were staunch republicans in their private leanings i discussed it with both of them locally his father contributed to democrats because the queens machine controlled zoning and building if you went to his office he would have pictures of the mayor and the borough president but in his personal politics his national politics he was a subscriber to the national review he was a major donor to barry goldwater he had given to billy graham s revival in a crude age with the left in charge of a debased popular culture and the so called mainstream media donald trump has succeeded in outwitting his foes by beating them at their own game crude but catchy rhetoric reducing issues to slogans and playing identity politics but with the single largest identity group of all the descendants of the men and women who fought for independence won a war that freed the slaves and built america into the economic power house of the world and a beacon of freedom to all people including the millions of legal immigrants who have contributed to our success simultaneously he has maneuvered the national leadership of the democratic party into rallying around a handful of radical extremists who hate america want an open border would destroy free markets and generally make donald trump look like the soul of moderation by comparison no easy feat the method to the madness offers clear insight into the strengths weaknesses and inner drive of the most unusual man ever to occupy the white house aram bakshian jr a former aide to
