j inspector general issues a report critical of how the fbi conducted the clinton email investigation house oversight committee chairman trey gowdy responds on fox news sunday this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday june 17 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace president trump uses the justice department aposs inspector general report to attack the fbi and claim vindication begin videotape donald trump president of the united states i think comey was the ringleader of this whole you know den of thieves they were plotting against my election wallace we aposll discuss the fallout from the findings and what it means for the mueller aposs special counsel investigation with congressman trey gowdy chair of the house oversight committee it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive then president trump with words of praise for kim jong un after the singapore summit trump he speaks and his people sit up at attention i want my people to do the same wallace what did both sides give up and what comes next we aposll ask senator jack reed the top democrat on the armed services committee plus the president blames democrats for the separation of families at the border trump the democrats force that law upon our nation but i hate it i hate to see separation of parents and children wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about chances for a compromise on immigration and the washington capitals take the stanley cup down constitution avenue and d c aposs first major sports title in a quarter century all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace hello again and happy father aposs day from fox news in washington president trump is back from his summit with north korea aposs kim jong un and is already taking on his next big challenge the department of justice inspector general issued a report that is sharply critical of how the fbi conducted the clinton email investigation and the president says that undercuts robert mueller aposs probe with collusion and obstruction of justice joining me now from south carolina republican congressman trey gowdy chair of the house oversight committee mr chairman we get to the i g report i want to discuss how president trump and his lead lawyer rudy giuliani are using the i g report here aposs the president linking what the inspector general found in the clinton investigation to the mueller investigation of him begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i think that the report yesterday maybe more importantly than anything it totally exonerates me there was no collusion there was no obstruction end video clip wallace mr chairman does the i g report exonerate president trump rep trey gowdy r sc chairman house oversight committee well it certainly helps him chris i mean keep in mind the same people the same players that were involved in the clinton probe later move to the russia probe john brennan who said he should be in the dustbin of history jim comey who said impeachment was too good of a remedy loretta lynch who wanted hillary clinton to win and then we got peter strzok and lisa page the two fbi employees chris and this is what aposs most important to me those two presumed and pronounced hillary clinton aposs innocence before her investigation ended and they presumed and pronounced donald trump aposs guilt before the investigation even began so when you have that pervasiveness of bias yes it aposs going to help the person who is complaining about the investigation wallace on the other hand robert mueller was not part of the clinton investigation peter strzok was fired by mueller as soon as he found about those very bias and damaging texts and of course we don apost know what mueller has found in the last year in his investigation so again i have to ask has president trump been exonerated i clearly understand your point that there was bias in the fbi but has he been exonerated on allegations of collusion and obstruction gowdy well part of that depends upon what you view the mueller probe as now you mentioned collusion the only person in the universe who claims to have evidence of collusion is adam schiff and unlike any other secret he aposs ever had he aposs actually kept this one he aposs never told anyone what evidence he has so there aposs no evidence of collusion obstruction of justice chris good luck having your star witness being jim comey in any prosecution from shoplifting to obstruction of justice good luck if that aposs your start witness for me the mueller is about what russia did in 2016 and who if anyone they did it with so that aposs what i mean when i say mueller probe and i hope he does right to definitive accounting of what russian did but there aposs no evidence donald trump did it with them and jim comey would be about the starriest witness that i can imagine the prosecutor could have wallace i find this very significant because you have not been in the tank for president trump on all this gowdy i aposm not now i aposm not now wallace no no i understand that i aposm not saying you are now but are you saying this morning that donald trump is off the hook in the mueller investigation gowdy well i don apost know what mueller has i do know this that bias is so pervasive and everyone who aposs ever stood in front of a jury and had to explain it away we aposll tell you it is most miserable feeling in the world and i have never seen this level of bias so you have peter strzok who can apost think of a single american who can vote for donald trump and you got peter strzok who says we aposll stop it the campaign and the presidency we aposll stop the campaign and if it doesn apost work the day after the election he aposs talking about impeachment so how would you like that to be your lead investigator two weeks after you aposre assigned to look into what a foreign country did to us the only thing he can think to talk about is an insurance policy to keep donald trump from winning and then he says we aposll stop it i assume the we is the fbi so how would you like if you aposre bob mueller to present that case to a jury wallace you are co chairing a hearing on tuesday where the inspector general michael horowitz who issued this damaging report will appear what are the main questions you want to ask him gowdy there are a bunch it aposs a 500 page report and the good news chris is michael horowitz proved what we wanted the fbi and the doj to do which is that you can have an investigation that is fact centric and fair and even handed there are a lot of questions i have for him number one you know the hillary clinton failure to prosecute was predicated upon two things number one that her emails were not exposed to foreign actors there aposs some evidence that that aposs not true number two that there was no evidence of intent of course there aposs no evidence of intent he didn apost bother to ask her you went into the interview knowing that she was not going to be charged so i think some members will ask about that a lot of members are going to ask about the bias the same thing that exonerated her implicated him before the investigation began and i suspect some members will ask about the coziness between the fbi and the media wallace while the fbi is very critical as you pointed out and we aposre going to get into it in more detail about actions taken by comey and strzok and others here is his overall judgment on the final conclusion of the clinton investigation i want to put this up on the screen this is from the i g we found no evidence that the conclusions by the prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations rather we determine that they were based on the prosecutor aposs assessment of the facts the law and past department practice and here is current fbi director christopher wray begin video clip christopher wray fbi director this report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review end video clip wallace so when they say the final judgments yes there may have been bias but that didn apost affect the final judgments are the inspector general michael horowitz and christopher wray the current fbi director are they wrong gowdy well i aposll say this why did loretta lynch ask it to be called a matter and not an investigation why was cheryl mills in the room when the target was being interviewed why did you write an exoneration memo six weeks before she was interviewed why did you start playing in your press conference two months before the investigation was over here aposs where i depart from chris wray i don apost think it aposs my job to prove the bias impacting the investigation i think it aposs job to probe that it did not here aposs what i know they exonerated her before the interview they said she did nothing wrong before they even bothered to talk to her and the same group said donald trump should not be the president and or should be impeached before the investigation even began if that is not textbook bias which is the prejudging of an outcome i mean that aposs what bias is we are prejudging the outcome we aposre prejudging her innocence before we talk to her we aposre prejudging his guilt before you even began to look into the fact pattern that aposs bias and yes it impacted the outcome she the most important element is intent that aposs what they told us she did not have the intent to commit a crime the best way to figure that out is to talk to her but they went into the interview chris saying the only thing she aposll be charged with is maybe lying to us if you aposre donald trump or if you aposre any other defendant in the country how would you like that deal we aposre not going to charge with anything as long as you tell us the truth that is blanket immunity and everyone in the country would like that as they go into an interview with the fbi wallace now a couple of top republican leaders house majority leader mccarthy senate majority leader mcconnell are saying given all of this and given the fact that the mueller investigation is going on for more than a year it aposs time to wrap it up it clearly is putting a cloud over the president do you agree with that gowdy i think it aposs putting more than just a cloud over the president i think it aposs putting the cloud over the entire country this is a unique chris it is a counterintelligence investigation that aposs become public most of them do not it aposs a criminal investigation that has political overtones most of them do not combine the two it is a public counterintelligence investigation with political overtones this is not your traditional investigation so i would encourage bob mueller keep doing exactly what rod rosenstein hired you to do bob mueller did not volunteer we aposre here because rod rosenstein decided we needed a special counsel do the very best you can with the evidence and the witnesses you have but understand that this is being used by political enemies to hurt donald trump adam schiff wants to be the chairperson of the house intelligence committee nancy pelosi wants to be the speaker of the house they want bob mueller want to do what peter strzok and hillary clinton could not do which is beat donald trump so just be aware that you aposre being used would be my advice to bob mueller wallace i aposve got about three minutes left i want get i aposm going to ask you for quick answers should based on what you knew before and what you know now from the i g aposs report should hillary clinton have been charged with the crime gowdy i need to interview her effectively i need to ask her those questions on intent we know she lied we know she aposs concealed evidence we know they destroyed evidence those are all circumstantial markers of intent so i would need to interview her without going into it knowing i was going to clear her like the fbi did wallace should comey and peter strzok be called to testify before congress gowdy yes wallace on what issues gowdy well peter strzok you name it the highest level of bias i aposve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer and comey in the words of my grandmamma has some explaining to do he aposs having a hard time getting his histories to match up horowitz was very critical of him and deservedly so wallace finally where are house republicans in your demand your call for the department of justice to share more documents especially on this question of the use by the fbi of a confidential informant to penetrate the trump campaign and also do you believe as some of your colleagues have suggested that deputy attorney rosenstein threatened the house and threatened staffers for demanding those documents gowdy well i wasn apost in the room for that january meeting i aposve been in the room with some other meetings where tensions run really high we had a meeting friday night under the heading of minor miracles you had members of the house working on a friday night paul ryan led this meeting you had devin nunes bob goodlatte myself and everyone you can think of from the fbi and the doj and we went item by item on both of those outstanding subpoenas we either have compliance we have partial compliance or we have noncompliance and paul made it very clear there is going to be action on the floor of the house this week if the fbi and doj do not comply with our subpoena request so rod rosenstein chris wray you were in the meeting in the meeting you understood as just as clearly as i did we aposre going to get compliance or the house of representatives is going to use its full arsenal of constitutional weapons to gain compliance this is too important it was important before the i g report the i g report has even heightened the need for us to understand what happened in 2016 so the new guys can either be part of the cleanup crew or they can be part of the cover up crew and i would encourage them to be part of the cleanup crew wallace and very briefly sir the areas where you see noncompliance and you might see action on the floor this week that aposs on what area gowdy it would be fisa abuse it would be a little bit on the strzok page text we aposre a little miffed that most damning text the same time you did where we aposve been asking for it for a long time so devin aposs subpoena is largely most of the issues were with devin aposs subpoena and not chairman goodlatte aposs and that aposs fisa abuse and it aposs what led up to the russia probe and chris and rod are there aposs no ambiguity the speaker of the house was really clear you aposre going to comply or there aposs going to be floor action and i think they got the message wallace and floor action would be a gowdy the full panoply of constitutional weapons available to the people aposs house wallace including contempt of congress gowdy that would be among them yes sir i don apost want the drama i want the documents and i think that chris and rod got that message contempt of congress just means we aposre going to be talking about this six years from now i don apost want that i want the documents i don apost want the dram and i don apost want the floor fight but they need to know that we aposre willing to do it and unless they were in a different meeting than the one i have never seen paul ryan as animated as i saw him friday night he is sick and tired of the delay and he communicated that point very effectively wallace chairman gowdy thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you gowdy yes sir wallace and i got to say you had a lot to say today thank you sir gowdy happy father aposs day thanks wallace same to you sir up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the fbi aposs handling of the clinton investigation and what it means for the mueller probe of president trump commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states there was no collusion there was no obstruction the i g report yesterday went a long way to show that and i think that the mueller investigation has been totally discredited sen chuck schumer d ny senate minority leader certain actions taken by the fbi intentionally or not help the trump campaign and hurt the clinton campaign end video clip wallace president trump and senate democratic leader chuck schumer drawing very different conclusions from the i g report this week on the clinton email investigation and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove fox news correspondent gillian turner former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and chris stirewalt fox news politics editor well karl i aposve got to say that was a different trey gowdy that we have heard because for weeks for months he aposs been the one republican kind of pushing back on other republicans and certainly the trump white house or rushing to judgment the mueller is fake he pushed back on spygate today he was basically it seemed to me saying that the i g report and what it found in terms of rampant bias on the part of comey and strzok and others has blown the mueller investigation out of the water as far as it concerns president trump karl rove former bush white house adviser well i had a slightly different take on some of that i do look this was a very damaging report the i g report to comey mccabe strzok lisa page aposs lover and to generally the fbi itself but it raises questions about what the fbi did in 2016 in papadopoulos and others in the trump campaign but at the end of it we have in may of 2017 the appointment of bob mueller and when he finds out literally in matter of days and weeks later the text messages with peter strzok he essentially fires him he removes him from his position as head of the counterespionage section of the fbi and because you can apost fire an fbi agent he has some detailed to human resources i mean as about the biggest emotion as you can possibly get wallace i understand all of that but when i asked gowdy about exactly that he in effect said that the fruit of all this is poison that the launch of the investigation was poisoned that comey would be the main witness or a main witness in any obstruction of justice case against president trump is fatally flawed i mean gowdy did not leave i gave him a lot of opportunities and he didn apost want to take them rove i agree with him about comey comey is one of the biggest victims out of not only this i g report but the whole process but look there is no wallace i wouldn apost say not a victim but rove yes you aposre right laughter rove he gets what he deserves wallace yes rove but look what we do have here is look let aposs look into the question of collusion but look there aposs never been any evidence of collusion every presidential campaign leaks the trump campaign leaks than worse than any i aposve seen in my life if there was any collusion we would have heard a hint about it from somebody inside the campaign but at the end of the day mueller aposs investigation is going to be judged by the report of the mueller investigation we aposre going to make a judgment about it and my sense is is that it aposs going to clear the present of any question of collusion between his campaign and the russians and there will be people like paul manafort who have real liability and have real legal problems because of their actions unconnected to the campaign wallace i want to go back to that newly discovered text exchange between two fbi officials in august of 2016 that aposs lisa page and peter strzok let aposs put it up on the screen page trumps not ever going to become president right right strzok no no he won apost we aposll stop it congresswoman harman you don apost have to be a conspiracy theorist to say that is pretty damaging and this is coming exactly at the point when the clinton campaign is ramping down and the trump the clinton investigation is ramping down by the fbi and the trump investigation is ramping up jane harman former u s congresswoman d california well first of all happy father aposs day to everyone wallace thank you harman to my two sons and two sons in law but you aposre right and it aposs not pretty damaging it aposs very damaging and comey aposs actions all three of his press events in 2016 were inappropriate and wrong and the i g nails him on and should have nailed him on it yes he is a compromised witness if he ever becomes a witness all of that is right but let aposs understand let aposs that there are two different investigations one was the investigation and what the i g looked at with the clinton emails and things that happened in 2016 and the second is mueller aposs investigation and i agree with karl that that investigation is a different one trey gowdy went out of his way to say it should be completed most members of congress crosstalk wallace yes well wait but except he said it should be completed in terms of russian interference harman correct wallace russian interference he wasn apost talking about collusion or obstruction harman well i don apost think we know i hope there is no collusion or obstruction but i think we should let the investigation conclude and find out what mueller knows and mueller no one while some people are impugning mueller but i certainly wouldn apost and most members of congress wouldn apost he had an exemplary run as the head of the fbi and u s attorney before that he was nominated and supported by immigrants and republicans when he became fbi director right around 9 11 i worked closely with him in my role as ranking member of the intelligence committee and just the last comment about the fbi this isn apost the first strange event at the fbi i had my own event which was very strange with the fbi my view is that yes there need to be changes at the fbi but christopher wray seems to be a responsible leader and will take in a better direction wallace chris stirewalt how big a deal is this to hear trey gowdy who aposs been a pretty honest broker on all of this suddenly really change his opinion about the mueller investigation and president trump aposs potential legal liability chris stirewalt fox news political editor i suspect that trey gowdy will do the same thing with the mueller investigation that he rightly did with the inspector general aposs report which is wait for the work to be concluded and then render judgment after that fact i heard him definitely saying it was time to wrap up but i also heard a guy that said he did not express any concern about mueller but i definitely heard this anybody who aposs attached to the comey administration at the fbi the catastrophic comey administration at the fbi if you aposre of that leadership bubble up there you better not be part of what comes out at the end for mueller and mueller aposs findings have to be able to rise above the decrepitude of comey and his team it has to be better than that wallace gillian i want to pick up on another point that trey gowdy made today which i thought was news and something i didn apost know about and i don apost think has been reported that there was this big meeting on friday night between house leadership and the top leadership rod rosenstein and chris wray fbi department of justice deputy attorney general and they basically put the wood to the justice department and said you produce these documents or we aposre going to go to the floor and we are going to take serious action to force you to comply with our subpoenas gillian turner fox news correspondent that aposs right chris a quick word if i may on the strzok page texts i aposve been scouring the intelligence community all week on this story and over and over what i hear from operatives and analysts is that those few text messages that you highlighted for viewers have been more damaging than anything that aposs transpired so far in the mueller investigation and are probably going to be more damaging than anything that could come out in the future and it aposs something that i think is causing a lot of causing people to pause and reflect upon their service in the intelligence community when it comes to when it comes to the inspector general aposs report i just want to point out there aposs an uncomfortable reality buried in the inspector general aposs report for the trump administration which is that they got five of the most important national security departments and agencies unfilled inspector general positions department of homeland security department of defense the cia even white house inspector general position is currently vacant so it aposs quite every time they lob sort of criticism against the obama administration for the way they policed themselves it highlights the fact that they are choosing not to police themselves at all at least up until now wallace i aposve got less than a minute left carl your reaction to gowdy and the revelation that house republican leadership is fed up rove friday meeting didn apost need to take place wray and rosenstein and the fbi need to be responsive to the will of congress congress has oversight on the department of justice and fbi and it is astonishing to me that these request for access to documents have been stonewalled delayed ignored and the speaker was right and the house is right and i don apost understand why wray has a chance to make a clean break with comey in the past and he can do so by being forthcoming i hope to god they are forthcoming here in the next 24 hours wallace all right panel we have to take a break here we aposll see you all a little later up next president trump defends the deal he made with kim jong un saying it aposs made the world safer but democrats say he gave up a lot without getting much in return we aposll talk with senator jack reed the top democrat on the senate armed services about those concerns next commercial break wallace a look at shinnecock hills golf club in southampton new york home of this year aposs u s open the singapore summit between president trump and kim jong un produced stunning and surprising pictures but what about the substance did the two leaders resolve differences that could lead to a nuclear confrontation joining me here in washington is jack reed the top democrat on the senate armed services committee senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen jack reed d rhode island thanks chris wallace president trump says that north korea is no longer a nuclear threat his words and on friday he added this begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i have solved that problem now we aposre getting it memorialized and all question you solved the problem cross talk trump but that problem is largely solved end video clip wallace senator your reaction reed north korea is a nuclear threat the president aposs statement was absolutely in my view preposterous north korea has between 20 and 60 nuclear weapons they have missiles that they can deliver those weapons to japan south korea guam they have an intricate infrastructure of nuclear laboratories testing facilities et cetera this issue is just beginning to be dealt with it has not been solved wallace but and and in fairness it it hasn apost and the president acknowledges that although he clearly is more optimistic than you are that it aposs going to get settled north korea has suspended its nuclear bomb and missile test for months it has destroyed one of its main testing facilities the two sides are talking at the highest level would you concede that president trump has dramatically reduced tensions between the two countries reed well i think initially president trump helped elevate the tensions i mean the fire and fury the demeaning twitters about kim jong un et cetera i think the path of diplomacy that he aposs chosen is the wiser one and i commend him for that but if the meeting itself the summit was a great victory for kim jong un he got the prestige of the first leader of north korea to be literally embraced by the president of the united states his sorted record on human rights on mistreating his own people was not only ignored but frankly contradicted in many respects by the president aposs comments the sanctions regime which again the president i think and his staff did very well in putting it together will dissipate given the lack of enthusiasm for enforcement guarantees about the security of north korea which the president seemed to imply and is different than than the the maximum pressure campaign he aposs put on and then conceding with that any other quid pro quo the exercises that we conduct with the south koreans was i think a mistake indeed the president chose to call them provocative war games which are not the case at all so at the end of that summit kim jong un walked away i think with a great deal and we aposre just now beginning to try to put together put it back together wallace i just want to press on that one point here the top democrat in the senate armed services committee the president did agree to suspend joint military exercises between south korea and the united states he did however say that if north korea drags its feet on denuclearization he can always resume the games so how how big a deal is that reed it is a big deal first of all it was a complete surprise to our allies the south koreans and the japanese they are very concerned second it is part of our determined not war gaming but deterrence of the north koreans and if this goes for a long period of time operationally we aposll lose the skills that we need to collaborate with our colleagues in the region and i think also it was interesting that the chinese were among the first to report the succession of these exercises and i think they aposre going to take a great deal of comfort from that so wallace let me switch subjects on you reed yes sir wallace president trump announced friday that he is imposing now finally not threatening but imposing stiff new tariffs on china effective july 6th here he is begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we aposre just going to do 50 billion on 50 billion of high technology equipment and other things coming into the country end video clip wallace china responded quickly that it is going to respond and it aposs going to retaliate with tariffs on u s farm products on crude oil on u s cars senator are we now in a trade war with china reed it looks that way but the the president i think is right in calling out china they have abused in many respects the free trade arrangements that have been built up over generations they don apost allow american companies to compete in china or international companies as they are allowed to in other countries they have i think used the trade system to their advantage so the president i think is right in taking action the question is are these actions coordinated i don apost think so i mean he before he left for the singapore summit he had a very very difficult meeting with the g 7 so he aposs not going into this trade battle with china with the unified effort by the western powers and then second i think a lot of his judgements seem to be snap judgements he imposed tariffs on countries aiming at china and it wound up sort of hitting canada and other countries where we have not only trade relationships but very strong national security relationships so the concept i think is right to go after china the methods i think he employs just in many cases is counterproductive but to the trade war issue is we are could be dangerously approaching such a trade war wallace i want to switch to one other subject which is gaining interest and concern by the moment and that is the issue of families at the border being separated let aposs put up some statistics in the first six weeks after the administration launched its zero tolerance policy we now find out that 1 995 minors were separated from 1 940 adults coming across the border illegally here is president trump aposs explanation begin video clip donald trump president of the united states that aposs the law and that aposs what the democrats gave us and we aposre willing to change it today if they want to get in and negotiate but they just don apost want to negotiate end video clip wallace your reaction to the policy and the impact it aposs having in terms of separating these families reed it aposs not the law it aposs the president aposs policy in fact he has stated and it aposs been reported in the press that he aposs using it as a negotiation tool he aposs using it to intimidate families so they don apost come across the border he aposs using it as a political ploy so it aposs not the law and to say it is law is just misrepresenting misrepresenting the fact dramatically wallace let let me let me ask you about two aspects of that one in terms of trying to deter families from coming across the border they aposre coming across illegally what aposs wrong with that reed we should have and we aposve tried in the past on a bipartisan basis to develop comprehensive immigration reform which would secure the border we we can apost have a border that is open but it also would recognize one the individuals that are here for many years and two provide a much more effective process if people are seeing asylum if people are trying legitimately to to come into the united states we have to protect our borders but it is i think repugnant to most americans when you have people like dr franklin graham condemning these family separations as abhorrent to the core american values that aposs wallace franklin graham the the son of billy graham reed billy graham wallace let let me ask you about the other aspect of it because it has been suggested some people in the white house are saying this is a negotiating poly and the argument is that the president has suspended the daca program although the courts have stopped that and he has imposed this policy to try to bring democrats like yourself to the table to create a kind of grand bargain yes he aposll stop this policy he aposll provide some protection on for the dreamers but in return you the democrats will give him the border wall and limits on legal immigration things like the visa lottery and chain migration reed i don apost think americans would like to see children two years old four years old torn away from their parents as a negotiating poly in washington d c i think that aposs the american view of this there are other ways to negotiate between republicans and democrats using children young children as political foils is abhorrent wallace but as you saying that you will not agree to a deal that has this as an element in it reed i aposm i am just saying that this is repugnant to most americans and when you have leaders of the community leaders like dr graham speaking out that sends a strong strong signal there are ways we can negotiate we had a few months ago we thought a deal with the president with respect to some enhancement of water border security including stretches of the wall in return the daca the dreamers would be allowed to stay at the last moment that blew up that was a fair comprehensive bargained negotiation and he just sort of walked away from it but to use children in this way to me is something that frankly you know that aposs not what we aposre about in this country wallace senator reed thank you reed thanks chris wallace thanks for coming in always good to talk with you sir reed yes sir wallace coming up our sunday group returns to discuss the showdown over immigration will the party aposs resolve their differences on separating families and the dreamers and border enforcement commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we had good chemistry you haven apost had any rockets shot up in the air for seven months unidentified male right trump you haven apost had any research they just blew up there test site sen bob menendez d nj ranking member foreign relations committee this is the weakest statement i have ever seen come out of any engagement with north korea end video clip wallace the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee bob menendez questioning president trump aposs positive assessment of the nuclear deal he struck with north korea aposs kim jong un and we aposre back now with the panel congresswoman harmon how do you assess the singapore summit what are the pluses for the u s what are the minuses jane harman former u s congresswoman d ca well it was a made for tv moment and let aposs understand that there were two big images one was at the g 7 with trump aposs sitting like this glaring at angela merkel and the second one in the exact same timeframe was shaking hands with kim jong un and slightly later saluting in return to his salute a north american a north korean general how do i assess it i think it aposs a short term propaganda win for kim he got almost everything he wants jack reed just said that senator jack reed on your program but i think if he just makes no more threats and doesn apost test again he aposs gotten away with becoming a nuclear nation being recognized by the world and i think there will be more economic advantages to him i think china will trade more and we won apost punish china for trading with north korea and i think that you know yay him just one other comment there are two winners here short term i think one is china which now has much more of an advantage in asia now that we aposre suspending our exercises and possibly reducing or eliminating our troops in south korea but the other is russia because of what we did with the g 7 and the new tariff plan let aposs not call it a war europe is destabilized and that gives russia huge advantages with respect to ukraine and in the middle east because were renounced the iran deal it seems to me russia has more free reign in syria and parts of the middle east wallace gillian as someone who worked on the national security council for president bush and president obama president trump seems confident he got a deal from kim to give up his nuclear weapons even if that isn apost spelled out in the final agreement the joint agreement that they signed do you share the president aposs confidence gillian turner fox news correspondent i share the president aposs hope and optimism not necessarily his confidence because i think no matter what is said now truly only time will tell one thing to point out that you know a lot of in the wake of of this summit it seems to be that the response is breaking down along political lines much like it did to president obama aposs overtures to the iran regime but when it comes down to policy matters here there aposs one major challenge the trump administration aposs facing that president obama didn apost really have to deal with back in 2012 apos13 and apos14 and that is north korea aposs continued super aggressive gray zone warfare in cyberspace i aposve been speaking to cyber expert and tech experts this week who say that during the lead up to the summit even as the summit was ongoing north korea sponsored hackers were infiltrating u s banks financial institutions and carrying out attacks on them and this is something that they aposve not yet dealt with they might be able to get to some kind of a de neutralization deal without addressing that but it will ultimately fall apart unless the trump administration confront this head on i hope they aposre doing it behind the scenes through covert channels wallace let aposs turn to the other subject i discussed with senator reed and that aposs the separation of families coming across the border which i think it aposs fair to say is sparking growing outrage as we now learn that almost 2 000 miners were separated from their adult parents as they came across the border in the first six weeks after the president and his administration announced a zero tolerance policy here was the president on this this week begin video clip donald trump president of the united states they aposre all saying about separating the families and that aposs a democrat bill that aposs democrats wanting to do that and they could solve it very easily by getting together but they think it aposs a good election point end video clip wallace karl what do you think of this separation of families the zero tolerance and what aposs come from it what do you think of it as policy and what do you think of it as it apparently is being used by the trump administration as leverage to get the democrats to negotiate a bigger deal on immigration karl rove fox news contributor well let aposs let aposs take the politics of it first and then go back to the policy if you take a look there aposs a new harvard harris poll that that says give the dreamers a they can remain here and have a path to citizenship in return for which there is increased use merit rather than family connections you eliminate the diversity lottery and you provide funding for the border wall and in that poll that deal gets better than two to one so at the end of this wallace in favor of it rove in favor of it and so at the end of this the president aposs position i aposll give you the dreamers and a path to citizenship in return for these three things has the support of the american people so the administration aposs on firm ground the president aposs not on as firm a ground when it comes to his description of the of the detention of minors and separation from of families this is being driven by a decision by the justice department for zero tolerance that is to say anybody who comes across the border is now going to be charged it used to be to the policy that if you came across the border if you were a mexican you were immediately removed out of the country now apparently they aposre going to charge the mexicans with an immigration violation that makes it impossible for them to enter the country legally in the future to work or become a u s citizen so the administration had taken the zero tolerance policy and rather than taking you know otm aposs we would hold them and move them out of the country within 30 or 35 days now you have to hold these people until the whole process of charging them litigating in a court finding them guilty or not and then processing them out of the country takes place and we only have two facilities in which you can put families intact a small one in inaudible new mexico and another one in dilley texas we used to have a big facility in taylor texas but the courts have made us in essence restricted and then obama closed it down wallace so where so where are we on the idea that somehow this policy which is sparking a lot of growing outrage is going to be an effective tool for the trump administration to use to bring democrats to the negotiating table rove look my hope is is i know the president said it aposs a negotiating tactic i hope the democrats will not get stuck on trying to win that argument with the president they aposre not going to convince him that this was the wrong thing to do they ought to find a way to resolve the situation which is provided an opportunity for the dreamers to to and this is also incumbent upon the republicans in the house the dreamers get a path to citizenship and get to remain here and there are other changes on the other side including money for the border wall look we have a border we have a wall along i think 600 miles of the board it needs to be replaced and upgraded that aposs primarily what the president is talking about he has given up on the notion of of building a wall at the top of the canyon in santa elena canyon in texas which where the u s border is 1 500 feet in the air he aposs finally given up on that notion so he aposs talking about a limited wall wallace ok rove maybe a couple of dozen miles more than we now have but upgrading it to make it modern and repairing it wallace chris let me bring you into this because it strikes me that the president is in the kind politically risky position here one to the degree that he keeps the separation going and i aposll ask you does he get blamed for this or do democrats get blamed and if he were to get a deal which would include what karl says the amnesty or citizenship for the dreamers and a lot of hardline conservatives are going to call that amnesty chris stirewalt fox news political editor right wallace that has some downside for him too stirewalt so he is in a box and he aposs in a box with his own base and he aposs in a box because republicans can apost agree on anything their real problem here is they can apost come to terms amongst themselves about what does acceptable immigration legislation look like paul ryan they just totally faced paul ryan paul ryan did a deal he avoided a discharge petition that would have been basically rebellion among the members of the house you know how rare that would be so paul ryan defeats this and he says ok boys hang together because we aposre going to come out with legislation next week and then the president goes and dumps on it no we aposre not going to do that now later the white house comes back and tries to clean it up and say well what the president meant to mean was this wallace but in any well wait but in any case the president 5 30 tuesday is going up to capitol hill to talk to house republicans to try to work this out stirewalt they aposve got to do a deal until republicans can agree on what they think immigration policy should look like amongst themselves the democrats are off the hook they are totally getting away scot free because republicans have to finish their own work first rove and remember quinnipiac 64 percent of republicans believe that dreamers out to be allowed to remain and allowed to apply for citizenship sixty four percent of republicans seventy seven percent of independents 92 percent of democrats 79 percent of the americans overall republicans ought to do it absent the democrats wallace so we aposve got less than a minute left will democrats be forced to deal to try to end the separation of families or do they actually see this as a political benefit for them as heartless as it may be harman inaudible shame on anybody who wants these kids to be pawns it aposs the wrong policy the right policy was something mike pence and john kelly when he was the head of homeland security tried to pursue in florida where they had a summit on helping central american governments the push factor comes from central america mexico should police its southern border better but these kids and migrants are coming from central america where there aposs rampant corruption and danger to their families that aposs why they aposre coming through wallace so clean up the situation at home harman yes wallace thank you panel see you next sunday when we come back lord stanley comes to washington finally commercial break wallace while our trip last week to singapore was fascinating the downside was we missed being here in d c for the washington capitals victory celebration on tuesday the streets here rocked the red as the newly minted district of champions held a parade it aposs washington aposs first major sports title in 26 years days before alex ovechkin and the capitals made franchise history beating the vegas golden knights in game five of the stanley cup finals ovechkin and his teammates hoisted the cup along constitution avenue headed for a rally in front of the capitol some 100 000 fans celebrated the victory 44 years in
