apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic tehran iran ap taha shakouri keeps finding remote corners to play in at a tehran children s charity hospital unaware that his doctors are running out of chemo medicine needed to treat the eight year old boy s liver cancer with iran s economy in free fall after the u s pullout from the nuclear deal and escalated sanctions on tehran prices of imported medicines have soared as the national currency tumbled about 70 against the dollar even medicines manufactured in iran are tougher to come by for ordinary iranians their cost out of reach for many in a country where the average monthly salary is equivalent to about 450 iran s health system can t keep up and many are blaming president donald trump s maximum pressure campaign for the staggering prices and shortages the sanctions have hurt ordinary iranians sending prices for everything from staples and consumer goods to housing skyward while raising the specter of war with the u s top

worker and this is a very costly disease the iranian rial has plunged from 32 000 to 1 at the time of the 2015 nuclear deal between tehran and world powers to around 120 000 rials to the dollar these days highly affecting prices of imported medicines the nuclear deal had raised expectations of a better life for many iranians free of the chokehold of international sanctions the landmark accord lifted international sanctions in exchange for curbs on iran s nuclear program but now the deal has all but unraveled and new and tougher u s sanctions are in place while the united states insists that medicines and humanitarian goods are exempt from sanctions restrictions on trade have made many banks and companies across the world hesitant to do business with iran fearing punitive measures from washington the country is cut off from the international banking system last week health minister saeed namaki said budget cuts because of the drop in crude exports have dramatically affected his department the u s sanctions have targeted all classes of iranians he added the american claims that medicine and medical equipment are not subject to sanctions is a big and obvious lie namaki said our biggest concern is that channels to the outside world are closed said dr arasb ahmadian head of the mahak children s hospital which is run through charity donations and supports some 32 000 under 16 children across iran the banking sanctions have blocked transactions preventing donations from abroad he said transfers of money simply fail including those approved by the u s treasury indeed we are losing hope said ahmadian medicines should be purchasable funding should be available and lines of credit should be clearly defined in the banking system official reports say iran produces some 95 of the basic medicines it needs and even exports some of the production to neighboring countries but when it comes to more sophisticated medication and medicines for costly and rare illnesses and medical equipment iran depends heavily on imports and though the state provides health care for all many treatments needed for complicated cases are simply not available many prefer to go to private hospitals if they can and avoid long waiting lists at state ones long lines form every morning in the 13 aban pharmacy in central karimikhan street where people come looking for rare medicines for
