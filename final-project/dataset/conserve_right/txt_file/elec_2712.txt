national review the october democratic presidential primary debate finally brought a genuine surprise in that a pair of second tier candidates who were in danger of being forgotten woke up smelled the coffee and brought their a games amy klobuchar and pete buttigieg considering how other second tier candidates have turned in good performances in past months and seen little movement in the polls this may not be a turning point in the race for either candidate but in a way too long often boring debate that was stuck in the middle of an otherwise jam packed news environment klobuchar and buttigieg managed to stand out where has this klobuchar been all this campaign she was lively common sense and pugnacious particularly with warren most of the other candidates are now in the state where they re terrified of telling any primary voters anything they don t want to hear so they promise all things to all people and that none of it will require any sacrifices or offsets the corny humor and jokes about nagging her daughter would probably work in a general election battle in the midwest and when klobuchar went after warren you would have thought the massachusetts senator was a staffer who had fouled up klobuchar s lunch buttigieg has always turned in well prepared performances if his previous nights had any problem it was that they were smooth to the point of slickness he still has that vibe of listening to a presentation from mckinsey consulting but if tonight was the pressure night for most of the second tier with other candidates eager to promise the moon buttigieg seemed like the relaxed voice of reason he also appears to be the lone candidate in these debates to tangle with tulsi gabbard veteran against veteran on the issue of the middle east and national security and live to tell the tale every candidate tries to tell personal stories about what shaped their values but buttigieg does this better than most with his discussion of growing up in south bend and serving in afghanistan tonight most of the rest of the field took shots at elizabeth warren a subtle shift of strategy that effectively declared she s now the de facto front runner warren seems convinced that she can get all the way to election day without saying that her health care plan would require raising taxes on the middle class warren has probably one of the better defenses in response to the attacks she largely ignores the criticism and just reiterates her argument more emphatically you get the feeling that the other candidates get irritated when warren makes it sound like she s the only candidate willing to take the tough stands even the billionaire isn t standing up for billionaires klobuchar noted to her one of the night s rare genuinely funny lines referring to tom steyer warren probably won t lose much ground because of tonight but this is the treatment she can expect from here on out joe biden had a relatively quiet night but when you re still arguably the front runner maybe that s okay he didn t handle an early question about hunter biden well focusing on his usual high dudgeon about president trump criticizing his family and adding my son made a judgment i m proud of the judgment he made hunter biden earlier in the day said in retrospect look i think it was poor judgment on my part but biden s really lost a step since he departed the vice presidency his answers often devolve into word salad less a sign that he s mentally losing it than the fact that you can see him jumping from one point to the next without finishing the first one no look demonizing wealth what i talked about is how you get things done and the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now the idea we have to start rewarding work not just wealth i would eliminate the capital gains tax i would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39 5 percent i would double it because guess what why in god s name should someone who s clipping coupons in the stock market make in fact pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is like i said the a schoolteacher and a firefighter it s ridiculous and they pay a lower tax nr s afternoon roundup of the day s best commentary must read analysis everybody s glad to see bernie sanders upright and seemingly well and in fact he was pretty feisty and impassioned and well his usual loud self only a few weeks after having a heart attack and surgery to implant a stent i suppose that s most of what he can do to reassure the public although making his doctors more available to answer questions would be nice but you wonder how many people at home were watching him and wondering if god forbid one day between now and election day he would need another emergency trip to a hospital thanks to saturday night live now every time kamala harris uncorks or reuses a rehearsed line like i have looked at more autopsy photos than i care to tell you and i m done i just picture maya rudolph turning to the camera and declaring kamala sundays at 9 on tnt in the third hour harris bizarrely chose banning president trump from twitter as her hill to die on the california senator tried to pick a fight with warren over her disagreement warren had the better argument declaring she was trying to get trump out of the white house not off of twitter harris has a campaign that briefly entered the first tier and then crashed and burned like icarus tonight did not do anything to fix that tulsi gabbard asked warren if she wanted to get all u s troops out of the middle east and warren agreed before the debate was over her campaign was walking that back emphasizing that she didn t mean to include non combat bases in the united arab emirates qatar bahrain presumably kuwait as megan mcardle observed gabbard is neatly exposing the contradiction between the desire of democratic candidates to reassure their base they hate and will end middle eastern wars and their desire to hammer trump on pulling back in syria at the end of the age question gabbard wanted to ask warren if she felt she had the right experience to be commander in chief cnn cut to commercial while i disagree strongly with gabbard in some key areas she s clear and crisp in her quasi isolationist quasi supportive of dictators stances she pokes at the softer parts of the democratic foreign policy consensus and that makes her a valuable contributor in these debates cory booker is in an odd spot he s rarely had a bad moment on these debate stages and he had another solid night tonight he s younger than the big three he keeps trying to hit these notes of sunny optimism and he keeps lamenting that other democratic candidates have the audacity to try to debate with each other at a democratic presidential primary debate he s never that bad and he might match up better against trump than the septuagenarians wouldn t hurt to boost african american turnout in those key states right yet none of his debate performances seem to move his numbers andrew yang continues to be an interesting guy full of ideas who probably shouldn t be president but who would be a useful addition to some president s council of economic advisors yang spends a lot of time thinking about issues that most politicians don t worry about automation children staring at computer screens protecting social media users privacy and personal data as someone observed on twitter sometimes he sounds like the only person stage who isn t trying to bs you one of the advantages of not spending his life in politics and running for office beto o rourke had another bad night and he has turned into the candidate that other candidates enjoy jabbing the most buttigieg had a stinging moment when he declared that he didn t need any lessons about courage political or otherwise from o rourke the former congressman believes that he can personalize every issue by describing someone he met on the trail who s suffering some terrible problem thus every answer from o rourke sounds the same last week i met eduardo who s a learning disabled laid off union pan flute player with three kids and his insurance company told him it wouldn t cover his insulin because it wanted higher profits this is a violation of our values as a country and i m running for president to make this country work for people like eduardo julian castro also seems to think that he can connect with the audience by connecting every issue to growing up poor and raised by a single mom in san antonio it s the fifth debate we re past the introduction stage of the campaign tom steyer was a waste of space and time get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
