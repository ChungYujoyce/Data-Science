apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap political nerds start your streaming devices you ve got a big saturday night of programming ahead first president donald trump rolls out his complete and total exoneration tour in battleground wisconsin his first campaign rally since the release of the mueller report and an early look at his 2020 re election strategy next up is the annual white house correspondents association dinner which strained what remained of civility between the press corps and the administration a year ago and now is designed to be a decidedly more scholarly affair top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens boring is how trump describes it one reason why he s never attended the event as president but the dinner is apparently interesting and politically profitable enough for trump that he s mocked it from the rally pulpit the past two years here s a look at what to watch from trump s rally at 8 p m edt and the correspondents dinner at 9 30 p m edt both expected to be carried by c span the state of things on the night of the press dinner in 2017 trump mused from a rally stage in harrisburg pennsylvania that he might consider attending the event the next year it was not to be ditto in 2018 from the dais in michigan but trump said no thanks for the third time the dinner is so boring and so negative that we re going to hold a very positive rally instead he said earlier this month trump also told members of his administration not to attend boring isn t what the correspondents association is aiming for but the organizers are shifting the tone this year after a sharply anti trump comic michelle wolf delivered a performance last time that some thought was too harsh against white house press secretary sarah sanders who was seated onstage at the time instead the featured speaker will be historian ron chernow a pulitzer prize winning author chernow like many of his fellow historians strongly opposed trump s candidacy in 2016 and labeled him a demagogue association president olivier knox said in a statement we re looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the first amendment and great journalists past present and future a big one the release of the redacted mueller report seemed to have infused trump at first with triumph he declared america the greatest place on earth and tweeted no collusion no obstruction complete and total exoneration he promised the saturday rally in wisconsin would be a big one and began testing messages and slogans in a possible preview for the rest of his 2020 re election bid the special counsel found no evidence that trump or his campaign conspired with russia to influence the 2016 presidential election but it did reveal details of the president s efforts to thwart the investigation fire mueller and get other people to lie for him democrats are agitating for more investigations and a few want to begin impeachment proceedings trump vowed to not let any aides testify to congress he turned some of his anger on the new york times suggesting they get down on their knees beg forgiveness post mueller message trump s darker tone signals an approach to the rally that s different from the positive plans he had described trump has issued clues to his approach all week including a trimmed for twitter version of the mueller report s findings no c or o that s shorthand for no collusion or obstruction in fact mueller did not make a recommendation on obstruction instead laying out what many democrats see as a road map of evidence and anecdotes to build their own case look too for trump to describe the mueller investigation as an attempt to destabilize the administration on friday speaking to the national rifle association in indianapolis trump said his political enemies tried for a coup didn t work out so well and i didn t need a gun for that one did i the friendly audience applauded the quip but trump wasn t done he said he s seen corruption at the highest levels a disgrace spying surveillance trying for an overthrow the 2020 presidential campaign and his need to energize his core supporters and convince wobblers to vote for him again is very much on his mind you better get out there and vote he told the nra it seems like it s a long ways away it s not why wisconsin and michigan the numbers tell the story of how trump s rally at the resch center in green bay is designed to reach two states that he swiped for republicans in 2016 after solid democratic wins since the reagan administration in wisconsin trump defeated democrat hillary clinton by less than 1 percentage point but the rally is in brown county which trump won by more than 10 percentage points and the green bay media market stretches to the upper peninsula of michigan where trump won by tenths of a percentage point the resch center seats as many as 10 500 people according to its website creating the potential for the crowded visual trump loves bernie trolling sen bernie sanders isn t expected to campaign in wisconsin on saturday his campaign says but his supporters like other democrats in the race are determined not to take the state for granted as many believe clinton did earlier in the week sanders supporters took out a front page ad that ran in friday s green bay press gazette that says trump lied to wisconsin voters about bringing back jobs amid layoffs at big companies the ad also promotes 52 sanders campaign organizing events around the state on the day trump speaks associated press writers scott bauer in madison wisconsin and
