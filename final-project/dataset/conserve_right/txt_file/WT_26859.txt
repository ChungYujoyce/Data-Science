tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion democrats running for president in cahoots with the new york times have managed to bring up justice brett kavanaugh s name in a negative light calling for impeachment based on supposedly new accusations of sexual harassment that aren t at all new but in fact already addressed denied and dismissed but on this as on so many things with the left the truth doesn t so much matter as the amount of damage that can be inflicted and with kavanaugh democrats are looking long term reading political tea leaves about their chances for taking control of both the white house and congress and running with a backup plan that goes like this let s scare away any future judicial picks the gop might have opportunity to make top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning think about it if president donald trump nominated you to the u s supreme court or to any high ranking judicial office for that matter would you seize the moment and say yes after watching the takedown of kavanaugh both part one and now the emerging part two no doubt those who would have grabbed at that chance are now thinking twice after all nobody has a 100 percent clean and clear past nobody has a closet that s free of all skeletons so the question in today s vicious political climate brought to you courtesy of the democrats is whether or not you as an otherwise esteemed member of the court system and community in which you live could properly address all the skeletons that would be dragged for all to see from your closet the question is whether you could suffer the absolute hate that would be unleashed during the nomination process and not just at you at your family as well this is the giggling democrats long range plan this is the message they re sending with their baseless smears of kavanaugh the new york times has finally admitted that the premise of its much hyped story about an alleged incident with kavanaugh was false as the alleged victim of the alleged sexual harassment says she has no recollection of the incident in question the federalist reported but not until the damage was done not until kavanaugh was raked once again over the coals for sexual harassment allegations he s already addressed already denied and for which the country minus the left have already dismissed and decided unfounded democrats running for the white house took to the national airways post new york times report to call for kavanaugh s impeachment to low information voters everywhere the past 24 hours of media circus generated by the skewed new york times report has shown one thing and one thing only kavanaugh is guilty and he s guilty enough to be impeached whatever happens from here is shoulder shrugging to democrats because their mission has been accomplished their messaging has gone out future judicial picks from the gop have been set on notice if trump wins a second term which at this point seems very likely and if trump gets an opportunity to nominate another supreme court justice which again at this point seems very likely the picks he d like to name may not quite possibly would not say yes the picks he d like to name may say thanks but no thanks out of fear of being kavanaughed cheryl chumley can be reached at emailprotected or on twitter
