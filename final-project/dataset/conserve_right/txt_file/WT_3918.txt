apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic kyiv ukraine ap two political supporters of u s energy secretary rick perry secured a potentially lucrative oil and gas exploration deal from the ukrainian government soon after perry proposed one of the men as an adviser to the country s new president perry s efforts to influence ukraine s energy policy came earlier this year just as president volodymyr zelensky s new government was seeking military aid from the united states to defend against russian aggression and allies of president trump were ramping up efforts to get the ukrainians to investigate his democratic rival joe biden ukraine awarded the contract to perry s supporters little more than a month after the u s energy secretary attended zelensky s may inauguration in a meeting during that trip perry handed the new president a list of people he recommended as energy advisers one of the four names was his longtime political backer michael bleyzer top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens a week later bleyzer and his partner alex cranberg submitted a bid to drill for oil and gas at a sprawling government controlled site called varvynska their proposal was millions of dollars lower than their only competitor according to internal ukrainian government documents obtained by the associated press but their newly created joint venture ukrainian energy was awarded the 50 year contract because a government appointed commission determined they had greater technical expertise and stronger financial backing the documents show perry likely had outsized influence in ukraine testimony in the impeachment inquiry into trump shows the energy secretary was one of three key u s officials who were negotiating a meeting between trump and the ukrainian leader the sequence of events suggests the trump administration s political maneuvering in ukraine was entwined with the big business of the energy trade perry made clear during trips to kyiv that he was close to bleyzer a ukrainian american investor and longtime perry supporter who lives in houston and cranberg a republican mega donor who provided perry the use of a luxury corporate jet during the energy secretary s failed 2012 presidential bid perry s spokeswoman said wednesday that the energy secretary has championed the american energy industry all over the world including in ukraine what he did not do is advocate for the business interests of any one individual or company said shaylyn hynes the press secretary for the energy department jessica tillipman who teaches anti corruption law at george washington university said even if perry did seek to influence foreign officials to award contracts to his friends it is likely not illegal my gut says it s no crime she said it s just icky zelensky s office did not respond to requests for comment in a statement to ap bleyzer denied that perry helped his firm get the gas deal i believe that secretary perry s conversations with ukrainian government officials if they in fact took place did not play any role in ukrainian energy winning its bid bleyzer said tuesday he said the process was competitive and transparent and will hopefully serve as an example of how the ukrainian energy market can be opened for new investments amy flakne a lawyer for cranberg s company aspect holdings said wednesday that perry and other u s officials supported a fair competitive process to bring foreign capital and technology to ukraine s lagging energy sector aspect neither sought nor to our knowledge received special intervention on its behalf flakne said freedom gas as trump s energy secretary perry has flown around the globe to push for u s exports of liquefied natural gas which he calls freedom gas he s made multiple trips to ukraine and other former soviet bloc nations where shipments of american gas and drilling technology take on strategic importance as a potential alternative to continued dependence on imports from russia ukraine has long suffered from a reputation for political corruption particularly in its oil and gas sector in the chaotic days following the breakup of the soviet union the newly independent ukrainian government sold off many state owned businesses worth billions to a cadre of well connected oligarchs who amassed immense fortunes as ukraine sought economic and security support from the u s and other western democracies those countries pressed it to put in place a more open and transparent process for awarding oil and gas exploration rights on state land at the urging of western partners ukraine s government created a process requiring that exploration contracts be put out to bid and awarded following review from a selection board appointed by the president s cabinet of ministers the board recommends the winners pending final approval from the ministers those western partners also advised ukraine to appoint an independent supervisory board at naftogaz the state owned energy company as a guard against corruption and self dealing in february the ukrainian government opened up bidding for nine oil and gas blocks encompassing 4 428 square miles 11 469 square kilometers of land ukrainian energy the joint venture between bleyzer s investment firm sigmableyzer and cranberg s aspect energy submitted a single bid for the largest block which covers 1 340 square miles 3 471 square kilometers under the contracts the winning bidder is awarded exclusive rights to extract petroleum for up to 50 years after the initial costs are recovered the company and the government split the profits an internal review of the proposals by the ukrainian ministry of energy and coal mining obtained by the ap show they were not the highest bidder the only competing bidder ukrgasvydobuvannya known by the acronym ugv offered more than 60 million for the first phase of the project compared with 53 million from bleyzer and cranberg the document shows ugv is ukraine s largest domestic gas producer and is a subsidiary of naftogaz the state owned company where perry sought to replace board members despite the lower upfront investment the selection board gave the americans higher scores for technical expertise and overall financial resources according to the document reviewed by ap of the nine gas deals awarded on july 1 bleyzer and cranberg s bid was the only one of the winners that didn t include the participation of a ukrainian company ugv won four of the remaining bids two members of the board that helped select the bid winners told ap that the process is designed to be hard to improperly influence because it is a mix of government representatives and industry experts roman opimakh a commission member who is the head of the state service of geology and subsoil of ukraine said the government was looking for foreign investment particularly u s and the board considered that as a factor he said it s an advantage if a company is well connected in washington but added that he saw no indication that u s officials influenced the process perry who served 14 years as the governor of texas has publicly championed the potential of u s hydraulic fracturing technology to boost oil and gas production in ukraine and pressed for the bidding process to be opened up to u s companies at an energy industry roundtable in kyiv in november 2018 perry said the potential for oil and gas development in ukraine is staggering ukraine he declared had a chance to become the texas of europe at the same event which was co sponsored by the nonprofit u s ukraine business council perry plugged cranberg s expertise both cranberg and bleyzer were in the room along with several american and ukrainian energy industry officials you know alex cranberg who has been in this business a long time can attest to this probably as well as anyone sitting around the table that we have the potential to change the world perry said according to a transcript released by the u s embassy in kyiv during the same 2018 trip perry had a private meeting with then ukrainian president petro poroshenko where they discussed deepening the ties between the two country s energy industries according to a u s embassy summary of the meeting records suggest perry has also met regularly with bleyzer visitor logs released by the energy department through a public records request show bleyzer entering through the vip check in desk at the building where perry s office is at least three times most recently on may 8 less than two weeks later perry was on a plane to kyiv to attend the inauguration ceremony for zelenskiy who had defeated poroshenko in an april election it was during that trip that perry presented his list of recommended advisers that included bleyzer and remarked on their long friendship according to a person in the room who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation attendees left the meeting with the impression that perry wanted to replace an american representative on the naftogaz board with someone reputable in republican circles according to the person who was there bleyzer said tuesday that he had been included in what he described as a brainstorming session with energy department officials about creating an informal group knowledgeable about ukraine s energy industry to help develop u s strategy but he had no idea his name would be forwarded to the country s new president i was not aware at any time that my name was recommended by secretary perry to the ukrainian government to act in any capacity bleyzer said perry s work in ukraine places him at the center of the house impeachment inquiry into efforts by trump and his personal lawyer rudy giuliani to press zelensky to open an investigation into biden and his son hunter s business dealings with burisma another ukrainian gas company perry who announced last month that he is resigning by the end of the year has refused to cooperate with the congressional probe in an oct 4 interview with the christian broadcasting network perry said that as god as my witness he never discussed biden or his son in meetings with ukrainian or u s officials but perry was at the white house for a key july 10 meeting where senior ukrainian officials were told continued u s support was conditional on zelensky s government opening investigations into democrats and burisma army lt col alexander vindman an aide on trump s national security council testified last month texas ties bleyzer and perry s ties go back at least a decade as governor perry appointed bleyzer in 2009 to serve

ceo morgan williams who is also listed as the government affairs director for sigmableyzer the council which sponsors events that feature senior u s and ukrainian government officials pushes for

according to the webpage of the state geology service days after the government in ukraine posted the gas blocks for bidding in february visitor logs show williams accompanied bleyzer through the vip entrance at the energy department on may 28 the day the bids were due in kyiv williams again accompanied bleyzer who photos show was sporting a western style shirt with a stars and stripes pattern to the offices of ukraine s energy ministry to submit their company s bid on june 5 while bleyzer and cranberg s proposal was under review williams met with a key zelensky adviser oleg ustenko and told him that significant expansion of oil and gas production in ukraine could only be achieved with investments from private companies including ones from the united states according to a summary of the meeting posted on the business council s website in an apparent dig at the company competing against bleyzer and cranberg for the gas deal williams also told ustenko that the participation of the state monopoly player undermined the chances of private companies to win according to the summary what the council s media release failed to mention is that like williams ustenko serves dual roles in

website describes its mission as promoting private sector investment in ukraine less than four weeks later ukraine energy was named the winner of the varvynska block over the naftogaz subsidiary bleyzer would not say whether he considered it a conflict for his employee to simultaneously be leading the international trade group while also advocating for his private business interests he said the u s ukraine business council is just one of many organizations that strongly support the participation of foreign companies in the bidding process as one of the key factors in helping ukraine achieve its energy independence from russia as with bleyzer cranberg also has longtime ties to perry a graduate of the university of texas in austin cranberg was appointed by perry in 2011 to serve a
