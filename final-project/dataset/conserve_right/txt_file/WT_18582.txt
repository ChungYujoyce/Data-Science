apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic a senior u s counterintelligence official recently said publicly what many officials and experts have been warning privately for years china is using its large student population in the united states to spy bill evanina director of the national counterintelligence and security center a dni agency said recently that china poses a broad ranging foreign intelligence threat that includes the use of academics students cyberespionage and human agents to steal secrets from the government and private sectors i look at the china threat from a counterintelligence perspective as a whole of government threat by china against us mr evanina told a conference last week at the aspen institute top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey we allow 350 000 or so chinese students here every year he said that s a lot we have a very liberal visa policy for them ninety nine point nine percent of those students are here legitimately and doing great research and helping the global economy but it is a tool that is used by the chinese government to facilitate nefarious activity here in the u s mr evanina said the trump administration is more engaged in counterintelligence than the obama administration based on the fact that many current leaders had more experience in the private sector a particular concern driving greater counterespionage against china is beijing s spending of 80 billion annually on investment in the united states he said i believe our administration now due to the makeup is more interested in that number and how that impacts across the u s country than the previous administration mr evanina said if the chinese government is buying up key aspects of our critical infrastructure and our technology base is that a long term national security threat for our country i believe it is michelle van cleave a former counterintelligence official testified to a house subcommittee earlier this month that china poses the most significant threat to steal advanced american technology from universities and other research centers it s not just that there are a lot of chinese nationals working in american companies or laboratories or studying or teaching at american universities picking up whatever happens to come their way ms van cleave said no as the defense department has reported china has a government directed multifaceted secret program whose primary task is technology acquisition michael wessel chairman of the u s china economic and security review commission also told congress that china in 2006 launched two programs seeking to recruit up to 4 000 foreign specialists mainly among ethnic chinese in such programs as project 111 and thousand talents program mr wessel said about 20 percent of the staff at the berkeley artificial intelligence research bair lab at the university of california berkeley which conducts research in advanced machine learning are chinese nationals at the university of maryland s bing research group 30 of the 38 postdoctoral researchers and graduate students are from china mr wessel testified north korea statement the announcement last weekend from north korean leader kim jong un outlining a plan to close the country s underground nuclear test site and halt nuclear and long range missile tests left many korea watchers in and out of government hopeful that pyongyang will agree to give up its nuclear arsenal after the upcoming summit between president trump and mr kim a careful reading of mr kim s six point announcement however reveals troubling signs that the kim regime has no intention of giving up its newly developed ability to target the united states with nuclear tipped missiles the announcement carried by the official kcna news agency makes clear that pyongyang s development of nuclear warheads small enough to be launched on icbms was a great victory in fact mr kim declare d solemnly that the nuclear missile program was achieved through great struggle involving nuclear tests miniaturizing and reducing the weight of nuclear warheads and building an ultra large nuclear weapon and the means to deliver it those steps sequentially and faithfully realized the nuclear weaponization mr kim stated additionally the north korean leader said pyongyang would limit the use of its nuclear arsenal to counter a nuclear threat or nuclear provocation and will not transfer nuclear weapons abroad u s intelligence agencies estimate that north korea has 20 weapons the references to nuclear weapons use and a promise not to transfer the arms are widely viewed by skeptical analysts as indications that the north korean leader has no intention of giving up the weapons despite renewed negotiations with the united states and south korea mr trump on tuesday said his efforts to pressure north korea are bringing results specifically in talks on denuclearization and some concessions by pyongyang this should have been resolved by other presidents and by other leaders of other countries a long time ago mr trump said with that being said i think we re doing very well meetings are being set up and i want to see denuclearization of north korea the president also said the talks with north korea may fail so the end result is we ll see he said maybe good things will happen and maybe we re all wasting a lot of time but hopefully it will be good for everybody concerned pacom nominee on chinese submarines adm philip davidson nominated to be the next commander of the pacific command said in prepared testimony this month that china is advancing its submarine warfare programs but still lags behind the navy the united states maintains a significant asymmetric advantage in undersea warfare but the pla is making progress adm davidson said of china s people s liberation army according to the four star admiral china has put a priority on developing advanced submarines and capabilities to counter u s submarines including building underwater drones the chinese are investing in a range of platforms including quieter submarines armed with increasingly sophisticated weapons unmanned underwater vehicles new sensors and new fixed wing and rotary wing submarine hunting aircraft said adm davidson who was confirmed by the senate armed services committee on tuesday and is awaiting a vote by the full senate ultimately this is a perishable advantage for the united states he added absent sustained consistent investment and constant innovation the pla will catch the united states in this critical regime the pentagon s latest annual report on china s military power made no mention of china s underwater drones the report said in june 2016 that a chinese national pleaded guilty to illegally acting as a chinese agent in supplying u s components to the harbin engineering university for use in developing unmanned underwater vehicles remotely operated vehicles and autonomous
