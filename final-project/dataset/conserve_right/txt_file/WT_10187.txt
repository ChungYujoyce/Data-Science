ndicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion for the past few years fear of china s predatory mercantilism has been growing steadily in america both among the public and in privileged business and political circles but last week for the first time one could discern the genuine possibility that america might actually do something about it even if it means a trade war it s not that anything new has been revealed about china s practices but rather that something new has emerged about the nature of washington s opposition to it last week a bill to force u s retaliation against china s currency manipulations passed in the senate with 63 votes including 16 by republicans there is nothing new about most democrats supporting what some might consider protectionist legislation but 16 republican senate votes is new and revealing there was no ideological or regional pattern to the votes the yea voters included ohio s rob portman a solid senior member of the republican free trade establishment who served as president george w bush s trade representative and director of the office of management and budget maine liberals olympia j snowe and susan m collins conservative southerners such as jeff sessions and lindsey graham and colorado s conservative mike crapo top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey also last week mitt romney the very model of a republican financial man and free trader wrote in a conspicuous washington post column if i am elected president i will work to fundamentally alter our economic relationship with china it got tougher after that while he firmly defended free trade he made the argument actually doing something about china s cheating makes some people nervous not doing something makes me nervous we are warned that we might precipitate a trade war really china is selling us 273 billion per year more than america is selling china why would it possibly want a trade war whether mr romney is right or wrong about that what is politically fascinating is that he is not afraid to talk about the threat of a trade war yes he is running for president so it could be just political but he may well be the next president so campaign rhetoric may become presidential policy and given his deep support in the internationalist gop business community he must have a sense that he is not outraging those supporters by his strong stand equally revealing of the changing mood of washington on china trade policy was the washington post column last week by solid centrist free trade supporting highly regarded robert j samuelson no one should relish threatening china with a 25 percent tariff it would be illegal under existing wto rules to save the postwar trading system we d have to attack it this would risk an all out trade war just when the world economy is already tottering the policy s only recommendation is that it might be slightly better than the alternative condoning china s ongoing assault on our industry there s already a trade war between them and us but only one side is fighting it is startling to read that the washington post s senior economics columnist is willing to engage in a trade war with china as the world may be sinking into recession it s not so much what is being said as who is saying it that makes one sense that washington may be getting ready to reverse 75 years of post world war ii trade policy it is particularly striking when the opposition to the china currency bill has explicitly compared this moment to the 1930s when a financial crisis lead to the smoot hawley trade war which led to a decadelong world depression yet these and other prominent free traders are embracing not running from the threat of trade war of course these are only the opening shots the wall street journal stands stoutly against such policies house speaker john a boehner came out against the senate bill expressly because he worried it might start a trade war if he permitted a vote the house would pass the bill at veto proof strength with upward of 100 republican votes for the bill president obama has not yet revealed whether he would sign or veto such a bill if it got to his desk but the doubt about letting abstract free trade principles deter an aggressive u s response even at the risk of a trade war has been building for years in a december 2007 column i assessed the political fact back then that hillary rodham clinton and mike huckabee were both questioning blind adherence to free trade i wrote classic free traders may impute such words by both hillary and huckabee to cynicism populism and demagogy but it is just possible that the american people may sense a real danger that the elites heavily invested in the globalization project cannot see yet now four years on some of those very elites are beginning to express the same doubts about the utility of relying on abstract free trade principles and they are willing to consider the risk of a trade war rather than endure more of the same trade imbalances weak as our economy is now our gross domestic product is still about three times the size of china s if we have to push back against abuse of free trade principles better now than five years from now when if we continue current policies we are not likely to be nearly as strong when the real world fears and judgments of the washington political and journalistic establishment begin to line up with the same sentiments in the broader public it may be the beginning of a historic trade policy shift tony blankley is the author of american grit what it will take to survive and win in the 21st century regnery 2009 and vice president of the edelman public relations firm
