wednesday to commerce secretary wilbur ross u s companies should not be assisting in the expansion of china s systems for surveillance detection and detention or be complicit in what are gross violations of internationally recognized human rights occurring daily in xinjiang shin jhang the letter said top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning
