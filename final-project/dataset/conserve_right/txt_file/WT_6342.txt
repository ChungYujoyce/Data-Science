apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic taipei taiwan ap taiwan s top diplomat said tuesday that his government stands with hong kong citizens pushing for freedom and democracy and would help those displaced from the semi autonomous chinese city if beijing intervenes with greater force to quell the protests speaking to the associated press in taipei foreign minister joseph wu was careful to say his government has no desire to intervene in hong kong s internal affairs and that existing legislation is sufficient to deal with a relatively small number of hong kong students or others seeking to reside in taiwan but he added that hong kong police have responded with disproportionate force to the protests he said that any intervention by mainland chinese forces would be a new level of violence that would prompt taiwan to take a different stance in helping those seeking to leave hong kong top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal

the international community to provide necessary assistance to those who are displaced by the violence there he said chinese paramilitary forces have deployed to the chinese city of shenzhen just outside hong kong since the protests began in june neither they nor the thousands of chinese military troops garrisoned in hong kong itself have been deployed to confront the protesters so far the people here understand that how the chinese government treats hong kong is going to be the future way of them treating taiwan and what turned out in hong kong is not very appealing to the taiwanese people wu said china s communist party insists that taiwan is part of china and must be reunited with it even if by force modern taiwan was founded when chiang kai shek s nationalists who once ruled on the mainland were forced to retreat to the island in 1949 after the communists took power in the chinese civil war beijing has suggested that taiwan could be reunited under the one country two systems model that applied to hong kong after the former british colony was returned to china in 1997 that agreement allowed hong kong to keep its civil liberties independent courts and capitalist system though many in hong kong accuse beijing of undermining those freedoms under president xi jinping taiwanese president tsai ing wen has said that the one country two systems model has failed in hong kong and brought the city to the brink of disorder government surveys earlier this year showed that about 80 of taiwanese citizens oppose reunification with china wu spoke a month before

strait we ll continue to send out goodwill gestures to china wu said we want to make sure that the chinese have no excuse in launching a war against taiwan taiwan known officially as the republic of china lacks a seat at the united nations it counts on its 15 official diplomatic allies which are mostly small and poor to help bolster its claims to international legitimacy safeguarding diplomatic relations with those remaining countries is a top priority for the ministry of foreign affairs wu said i think our relations with these 15 countries are quite strong at this moment and we don t worry that much he said taiwan also has unofficial relationships with several other countries including the united states which does not support its independence but is bound by law to ensure its defense

very senior trump administration officials that their relations with taiwan is independent of relations with any other country and t
