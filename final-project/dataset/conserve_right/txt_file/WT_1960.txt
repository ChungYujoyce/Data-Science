any statements on climate change on his way in trump quipped he was a big believer in the environment and during his address announced the u s would support a wef backed one trillion trees initiative but nearly all of his speech was focused on economics jennifer morgan the executive director of greenpeace said the focus on growth was an anomaly in this climate emergency the habit of giving priority to gross domestic product over the well being of citizens has got to stop angel gurria head the organization for economic cooperation and development praised a very positive and constructive

strength of the u s economy were true what s true is that the u s economy has done well he said it wasn t doing badly when he came in that s not true but i think it s done better than most of this

referring to efforts to drastically cut emissions in the near term thunberg accused leaders of cheating and fiddling around with numbers by talking about cutting emissions to net zero emitting no more carbon than is absorbed by the planet or technical means by 2050 responding to those who have accused her of doom mongering thunberg said her message was simply based on scientific facts not irrational fears my generation will not give up without a fight she said 1 05 p m nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz has slammed u s president donald trump s speech at the world economic
