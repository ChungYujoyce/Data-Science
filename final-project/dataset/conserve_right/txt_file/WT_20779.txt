apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic democrats have redoubled their efforts to force president trump to release his federal tax returns by threatening to keep him off the 2020 ballot in deep blue states to which he might say so what seventeen states have seen bills introduced this year that would require presidential candidates to turn over their tax returns as a condition for ballot access and such measures have cleared one legislative chamber in at least four states for the trump campaign however there may be worse fates than being left off the ballot in liberal enclaves like california hawaii and illinois where the mandatory tax return bills are making headway given that no republican presidential contender is likely to prevail there top stories sex at birth hungary bans

survey in theory he trump could really push this and he could be disqualified from the state ballots and it wouldn t necessarily affect the electoral college vote at all said university of denver political science professor seth masket because those were states he wasn t going to win anyway before that happens the bills must first win passage and with many legislative sessions winding down no such measure has reached a governor s desk in washington state the senate passed a bill last month requiring presidential contenders to release five years worth of tax returns before appearing on a primary or general election ballot but the measure died without house approval when the session adjourned at midnight sunday other states still have time to wrestle this year with whether requiring presidential hopefuls to disclose their form 1040s represents a commonsense transparency measure or a politically motivated attack on mr trump certain to be struck down the courts josh blackman associate professor at the south texas college of law said the bills are inconsistent with supreme court precedent as a general matter states cannot impose additional requirements for federal officers mr blackman said for example states cannot impose term limits on members of congress or require that the president be 40 years old instead of 35 as the constitution requires the only way to mandate tax returns would be through a constitutional amendment to article ii requiring ratification of three fourths of the states said jenna ellis a fellow in constitutional law at the centennial institute neither congress nor the state legislature can unilaterally add a requirement and bind the electoral college said ms ellis a member of the trump 2020 advisory board then again states typically require federal candidates to clear some sort of bar before their names are placed on the ballot such as submitting a certain number of valid signatures from voters or paying a filing fee my impression is that constitutionally this is defensible said mr masket the constitution gives pretty broad discretion to the states as to how to run their own elections and how to qualify for the ballot if states can require filing fees and signatures he said then it would seem like a tax disclosure isn t a problem even so the specter of states adding ever more qualifications for candidates was enough to convince then california gov jerry brown to veto a mandatory tax return bill in 2017 saying he worried about setting a slippery slope precedent today we require tax returns but what would be next he asked in his veto message five years of health records a certified birth certificate high school report cards and will these requirements vary depending on which political party is in power former new jersey gov chris christie nixed a similar bill the same year calling it politics at its worst senate democrats haven t given up however approving in february a bill requiring five years of tax returns and also prohibiting electors from voting for a candidate who refuses to do so voters must know unequivocally that the person they vote for is invulnerable to blackmail coercion or intimidation of any kind due to financial liabilities said new jersey senate majority leader loretta weinberg in nj com not surprisingly the state measures have split along party lines with democrats backed by progressive advocacy groups like indivisible in favor and republicans against it s clearly unconstitutional it s clearly targeted at the president of the united states illinois state sen dale righter a republican told the illinois news network he pointed out that the bill which passed the state senate april 13 has no such requirement for gubernatorial or legislative candidates in a state dominated by democrats notice that the bill doesn t require the disclosure the release of tax returns by let s say a candidate for governor or a candidate for house speaker or a candidate for senate president mr righter said i think that s a not very well veiled attempt to keep president trump off the ballot hawaii legislators have approved a similar bill in the state senate while a reintroduced california measure has cleared two state senate committees in mr trump s home state of new york democrats are trying a different approach with a bill that would authorize the state department of taxation and
