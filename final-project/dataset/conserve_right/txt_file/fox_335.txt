to enjoy all the benefits of our website the former vice presidenthas dented sanders momentum but his rise may have come too late for him to winthe nomination get the new statesman s morning call email joe biden widely reported as the political equivalent of the walking dead rose lazarus like last night to emerge as the decisive winner of the south carolina democratic primary his revival powered by a 60 per cent african american electorate casts serious doubt on what was expected to be a victory march for the radical vermont senator bernie sanders sanders who is polling strongly in california and other super tuesday states remainsthe favourite but in a powerful and emotional victory speech last night biden hit all the right notes in his bid to become the moderate choice for the anti trump movement most americans don t want the choice of revolution he said in words clearly targeted at his democratic opponent they want more than promises they want results obama s former vice president received 48 4 per cent of the vote 255 662 to sanders 19 9 per cent 105 070 with all the other candidates in single figures biden s speech and his landslide victory owed much to the emotional endorsement of his candidacy by jim clyburn thehouse chief whip and the most senior african american democrat in congress who has a large personal following in the state but only 48 hours remain until super tuesday when candidates will do battle in 14 states for delegates to the party s national convention in milwaukee wisconsin in july sanders who graciously acknowledged his rival s victory appears strong in states includingcalifornia and texas which send approximately 15 per cent of voting delegates to the convention david axelrod obama s chief strategist and a biden supporter admitted on television last night sanders s strength in california is unreal he s got the money and the grassroots organisation furthermore biden s surge may be too late under local laws californians can vote up to 29 days before the deadline and by yesterday 40 per cent had already done so another factor that will influence tuesday s contests is the fate of the also ran candidates such as massachusetts senator elizabeth warren upstart 38 year old south bend mayor pete buttigieg and senator amy klobuchar of minnesota logic might suggest that it would be best for both democrat frontrunners for all three to step down in the knowledge that their races have finally come to an end but some biden strategists believe that it might be preferableif they stay in the race until at least super tuesday taking delegates from sanders in several states above all the surprising scale of biden s victory will trouble the campaign organisers for billionaire media baron michael bloomberg for him a better result would have been one more evenly balanced between biden and sanders begging the question who can stop a blowhard president and a self declared democratic socialist bloomberg who has not yet formally entered the race beyond spending a remarkable 500m on advertising must now fear that the vacancy for a moderate alternative to sanders has been filled after two lacklustre debate performances pressure will now mount on the three time new york mayor to withdraw in favour of biden few believe he will for sanders reassurance will comefrom his high support among hispanic voters strongly represented in both california and texas the black vote around 20 per cent of the national total will now be seen as biden s natural constituency last night s outcome will add to the growing excitement over a presidential election campaign which is proving to be more unpredictable than anticipated in normal times it is thought that an incumbent president is almost impossible to beat not least when the main economic indicators are all positive but these are far from normal times all three leading candidates are in their seventies with biden now 77 and sanders aged 78 both would be older than america s oldest president to date ronald reagan who left office after two terms younger than either would be upon entering it donald trump himself is 73 as he seeks re election trump s

coronavirus outbreak has thrown all that in doubt with the largest stock market falls since 2008 last night biden whose campaigning and ground operation has been widely deemed lacklustre appeared newly energised his apparently unscripted victory speech displayed a passion and a vigour unseen until now at the same time while biden looks set to become the candidate of the democratic establishment sanders has other strengths the self described socialist s promise of medicare for all along with his pledge to introduce free college education and redeem all student debt has made him the champion of the young biden s pitch must be rooted in his experience and his status as the grown up in the room but whether he has the ruthlessness and above all the stamina to take on trump and
