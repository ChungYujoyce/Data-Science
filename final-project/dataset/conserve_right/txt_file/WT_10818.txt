 persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion it was not clearly understood by many americans what president obama had in mind when he stated in his 2009 inaugural that the time had come to start remaking america in effect transforming america as we have now seen one of the key transformations is the unilateral disarmament of our military forces is it a belief held by mr obama based on his marxist upbringing that views american power as historically regressive because it is capitalistic hence imperialistic therefore the erosion of american power should be seen as historically progressive clearly eroding u s military capabilities at a time when we are being challenged by a multitude of increasing military threats is unconscionable with the middle east in turmoil the potential for hostilities breaking out in the western pacific between our allies and china owing to china s imperialistic actions in the south and east china seas is real these threats are magnified by the decline in u s military power brought about primarily by our self imposed draconian budget cuts strategically our main military threats emanate from china and russia but we cannot overlook their proxies north korea and iran further we cannot fail to address the islamic threat represented by the muslim brotherhood s silent jihad in which they have been able to penetrate virtually every key government agency involved in national security including the joint chiefs of staff such penetration has enabled influencing our policies and war fighting strategy to the net disadvantage of our fighting forces top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots russia despite its economic weakness clearly represents a serious strategic challenge to america russia has underway modernization programs for its conventional strategic and theater nuclear forces its stated goal is to modernize virtually its entire strategic missile force by 2021 president vladimir putin announced that russia would procure more than 400 new intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms by 2020 further even the obama administration has acknowledged that russia will deploy several substantially mirved new strategic missiles including the mirved ss 27 icbm and new borey class missile submarines carrying 10 mirved bulava slbms the obama administration has also confirmed the deployment of a new russian kh 102 long range nuclear air launched cruise missile russia has announced the development of a new b 2 like stealth bomber and a fifth generation ballistic missile submarine aside from russia s strategic modernization programs moscow follows the soviet practice of arms control violations that go unchallenged by the obama administration russia consistently disregards treaty obligations that interfere with achieving its nuclear weapons objectives they also conduct no notice strategic force exercises in violation of treaty commitments for example they conducted no notice simulated bear h bomber missile strikes against our facilities in alaska california and guam during the period of feb 17 to 21 russia conducted the largest strategic and tactical nuclear weapon transportation exercise in 20 years which involved a heightened alert status of their nuclear forces it is not known if advanced notice was provided the exercise just happened to coincide with the visit to russia of rose gottemoeller acting undersecretary of state for arms control and international security it is unclear if she raised the subject of the exercise besides the russians we must recognize the greatest long term threat to the united states comes from china which has been modernizing and expanding its strategic nuclear and conventional forces for most of the past 20 years in november 2011 principal deputy undersecretary of defense james miller estimated china s nuclear inventory to be a few hundred weapons mark scheider from the national institute of public policy believes it to be between 400 and 500 today the former director of russia s strategic forces gen viktor esin stated that moscow thinks china has between 1600 and 1800 warheads with more than 3 000 miles of underground reinforced tunnels for china s fixed and mobile icbms russia s estimates appear to be more realistic remember how at the end of the cold war we greatly underestimated the size of the soviet strategic forces we know from department of defense reports that china has a wide variety of advanced strategic missiles including the df 31 and df 31a mobile icbms that are now being deployed as well as the slbm jl 2 carried on the type 94 ssbn the new class 96 ssbn is under development and can be expected to carry mirved missiles not to be overlooked is the fact that china has a large force of medium range ballistic and cruise missiles including the anti ship ballistic missile that is clearly targeted against our attack carriers many of these missiles have nuclear options china s no first use declaration is carefully worded and in fact commits china to nothing according to some experts china will use nuclear weapons if its leadership thinks it is in its interest to do so both china and russia have considered limited nuclear attack options including employing electromagnetic pulse as the primary means of attack with the modernization of russia s and china s strategic nuclear and conventional forces we clearly are headed in the wrong direction mr obama s june speech at the brandenburg gate proposed further reductions in u s nuclear forces to about 1 000 deployed warheads while the offer was subject to mutual reductions by russia mr obama has not ruled out unilateral reductions incredible the house armed services committee chairman howard p buck mckeon stated the president s desire to negotiate a new round of arms control with the russians while russia is cheating on a major existing nuclear arms control treaty strains creditability so does not including china in any future strategic arms treaty with our unilateral disarmament we are jeopardizing our national security is this how we want america
