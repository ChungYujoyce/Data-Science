angeles designer and distributor of houseware goods says it would have to extend a hiring freeze and delay plans to expand into a larger warehouse the administration in the midst of the trade war it began with beijing had asked for comments on its plan to extend 25 tariffs to everything china ships to the united states it s getting an earful hundreds of businesses trade groups and individuals have written to complain that the additional import taxes would drive up prices for consumers squeeze profits and leave u s companies at a competitive disadvantage to foreign rivals that aren t subject to higher taxes on the vital components they buy from china they re pleading with the administration to rethink the tariffs or at least spare the particular imports they and their customers rely on some will appear in person to air their grievances in seven days of hearings in washington that begin monday a common theme in their pleas is that american businesses not china as trump often asserts must pay the import taxes the president is imposing on chinese goods and in the end many of these companies will pass their higher costs on to their customers trump has already imposed 25 tariffs on 250 billion in chinese imports the goal is to pressure beijing to stop stealing american technology forcing u s businesses to hand over trade secrets and unfairly subsidizing chinese tech

less margin to absorb those increased tariff costs a report commissioned by the national retail federation found that american consumers would pay an additional 4 4 billion a year for clothing 2 5 billion more for shoes and 1 6 billion more for household appliances more broadly economists say the tariffs could weaken a u s economy that appears to be on shakier footing mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics said the higher import taxes would leave the united states with 900 000 fewer jobs than it would have had otherwise the u s economy will be flirting with recession later this year and early next zandi said jeffrey pratt leader of the supply chain practice at the accounting and consulting firm bdo called the looming tariffs a bit of gamechanger for his clients many can t afford
