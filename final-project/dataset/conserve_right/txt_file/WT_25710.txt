ther for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn he once said his chances of becoming prime minister were as good as the chances of finding elvis on mars but rumpled boris johnson a former mayor of london a former foreign secretary and an unapologetic supporter of britain s exit from the european union is now the odds on favorite to succeed theresa may when the votes of conservative party members are counted next week mr johnson is considered such a strong favorite over jeremy hunt the current foreign secretary that the speculation has moved on to what the change of leadership in london will mean for the trans atlantic relationship and whether the mutual admiration society between mr johnson and president trump will bring major changes to the now rocky u s british relationship as the next prime minister mr johnson argues he would usher in a new era of camaraderie in bilateral relations with washington top stories cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning i ve got a good relationship with the white house and i have no embarrassment in saying that i think it s very important that we have a strong relationship with our most important ally mr johnson told voters at a campaign rally thursday night mr trump who has shown no reluctance to weigh in on domestic british politics has made clear what he thinks of the candidate who shares his views on brexit and his skepticism of the european union i think boris would do a very good job i think he would be excellent mr trump told the british newspaper the sun in june just as mrs may was preparing to formally step down he has been very positive about me and our country nile gardiner director of the heritage foundation s margaret thatcher center for freedom said in an interview that he expected a strong and robust partnership between mr johnson and mr trump they re both very charismatic figures they re both leaders who have broken the political mold he said they re both figures who challenge conventional wisdom and are big picture politicians freddy gray deputy editor of the conservative british weekly the spectator said that after brexit the potential of a trump boris alliance is arguably britain s biggest hope the two men have a chemistry that goes beyond their unusual hairstyles and appreciation of younger women mr gray wrote in an analysis last week both grasp that a profound shift is taking place in politics one that has propelled people like them to power they also sense in the way that macho beasts often do a certain destiny in each other trump likes britain brexit and boris it s that simple mr gray added focused on brexit mr johnson s top priority will be brexit he was one of the most prominent leave voices in the shocking 2016 national referendum and has said he is prepared to take britain out of the european union whether or not an exit deal with brussels is reached by the oct 31 deadline mr trump has repeatedly dangled the prospect of a bilateral trade deal with the u k once it leaves the bloc the more determined we are to pursue no deal the less likely we will have to deploy it mr johnson told parliament recently i do not want it but to have an orderly exit from the eu it is vital you prepare mr trump appears to agree he resorted to twitter again last week to criticize how mrs may handled the brexit talks and to fault her for failing to follow his advice what a mess she and her representatives have created mr trump tweeted i told her how it should be done but she decided to go another way an explosive diplomatic furor in the middle of the johnson hunt leadership fight has mr johnson s critics in britain claiming he will be too friendly to the u s and too deferential to mr trump in the vaunted special relationship mr trump responded angrily after the leak last week of a series of cuttingly critical cables on his temperament and his administration by british ambassador kim darroch mrs may and mr hunt condemned the leaks but defended the career diplomat saying he was doing his job in giving his candid assessment of the country where he was posted who chooses our ambassadors is a matter for the united kingdom government and the united kingdom prime minister and i have made it clear if i am our next prime minister the ambassador in washington stays because it is our decision mr hunt said in a candidates debate last week in london mr johnson was far more equivocal he declined to say whether he would allow the ambassador to stay on if he is elected and said the u s relationship is of fantastic importance and that mr trump had been dragged into a british political debate mr darroch made the matter moot by resigning his post thursday but mr johnson s stand sparked controversy in britain mr johnson said his debate comments had been misrepresented to mr darroch leading him to resign but critics said the incident could be a sign of things to come johnson s kowtow to trump before he has even entered downing street is likely to be the first of many acts of abasement as britain wakes up from the dream of brexit to the bleak reality ahead denis staunton london editor of the irish times wrote in an opinion piece last week differences on iran not all may go smoothly between mr trump and mr johnson however while mr trump has slammed the 2015 iran nuclear deal and last year withdrew the u s from the international pact britain under mrs may has joined other european powers in an effort to preserve the deal and to find a way for iran to get around harsh new u s economic sanctions mr johnson told reuters news service last week that although he saw disruptive behavior from iran he remained an advocate for the deal i continue to believe that engaging with iran and persuading iran not to go forward with a nuclear weapons program is the right way forward for our country and for the region he said mr gardiner predicted that a prime minister johnson would start moving britain away from mrs may s staunch support of the iran deal i expect with a new british government you re going to see a different approach taken towards the iran deal i think that britain will increasingly move away from eu policy positions he told the washington times he said ms may is very attached to the iran deal an eu initiative and a foreign policy that he doesn t expect to align with the next u k government mr trump and mr johnson also share a skepticism of immigration and open borders the u k mr johnson has said must be tougher on those who abuse our hospitality and a major thrust of the pro brexit campaign in 2016 was support for british reclamation from eu control of its immigration and labor policies sounding much like mr trump mr johnson has said of immigration we must be much more open to high skilled immigration such as scientists but we must also assure the public that as we leave the eu we have control over the number of unskilled immigrants coming into the country mr gardiner said the bilateral relationship could flourish under mr johnson because he is an unabashedly pro american politician at a time when that sentiment is not widely shared among many in the top levels of british government i think that boris johnson as prime minister will result in a reinvigorated u s u k relationship mr gardiner said johnson has already established a good rapport with
