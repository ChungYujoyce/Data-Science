machinations it s pretty clear now with enough members here to pass the bill that pelosi and mccarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of congress from accountability biggest spending bill in the history of mankind and no recorded vote swamp he tweeted after the voice vote massie accused pelosi and mccarthy of trying to shield their members from the political ramifications there apos s a big cover up in there massie said as he exited the capitol emotions ran hot on the house floor all morning friday before the vote on the 2 trillion stimulus bill rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y started her impassioned floor speech by noting 13 people died in one day at queen s elmhurst hospital and medical professionals still don t have enough ventilators and personal protection equipment she ripped the senate for fighting for corporate bailouts that will contribute tothe income inequality gapin order for families to get crumbs what did the senate majority fight for one of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in american history shameful ocasio cortez said on the other side of the aisle rep scott perry r pa said he s distressed by the hobson s choice lawmakers face of having toaccept unrelated spending sprees in order tosend relief no more billion dollar bailouts for things that are unrelated no more policies that are long standing for a short standing issue that needs our critical attention perry said in a bizarre and seemingly unnecessary point of drama rep haley stevens d mich refused to stop speaking when her time ran out on the house floor even though majority leader steny hoyer d md was willing to let her finish if she had just paused to let him officially grant her more time instead stevens continued yelling and held up her hands clad with pink surgical gloves in an apparent homage to front line healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic even though her mic was cut as the presiding officerwas pounding the gavel and ruling stevens out of order stevens screamed do not be afraid republicans who are trying hard to flip the freshman rep s seat in november immediately pounced on the outburst as a meltdown the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire 4 trillion plus annual federal budget the 2 2 trillion estimate is the white house apos s best guess of the spending it contains the legislation would provide one time direct payments to americans of 1 200 per adult making up to 75 000 a year and 2 400 to a married couple making up to 150 000 with 500 payments per child unemployment insurance would be made far more generous with 600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of july states and local governments would receive 150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis the legislation also establishes a 454 billion program for guaranteed subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to 4 5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses states and municipalities all would be up to the treasury department apos s discretion though businesses controlled by trump or immediate family members and by members of congress would be ineligible there was also 150 billion devoted to the health care system including 100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of covid 19 caseloads frustrations were already hot as lawmakers had to return to washington in a panic aftermassie r ky threatened to upend plans for a simple voice vote with as few lawmakers as possible to you who oppose this bill please please stand down rep fred upton r mich pleaded on the house floor we can apos t wait another day to help don apos t add to this disruptionby in fact being a disruptor be a leader lawmakers spoke passionately about how covid 19 is hurting the health of their communities and how the widespread shutdown of the economy is crippling families and businesses yet many openly grappled with voting in favor of bill they believe will be helpful while it s chock full of other provisions that they disagree with this is ripping my heart out because there s things in this bill that just don t belong there i consider them rep david schweikert r ariz said stoppinghimself midsentence well i can t say that word in front of a microphone schweikert however argued congress must do the right thing by passing the legislation however rep ken buck r colo said
