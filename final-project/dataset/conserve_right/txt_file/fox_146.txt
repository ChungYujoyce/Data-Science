ican congressman from texas previews president trump s decision on the iran nuclear deal potential summit with kim jong un this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday may 6 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace new legal troubles for president trump after rudy giuliani reveals mr trump reimbursed his personal lawyer for hush money paid to a porn actress begin videotape rudy giuliani president trump aposs lawyer that money was not campaign money sorry funnel through the law firm and the president repaid it wallace and new questions about whether the president will sit down with special counsel robert mueller donald trump president of the united states i would love to speak i would love to go nothing i want to do more because we did nothing wrong wallace how strong is the case against the president we aposll ask former u s attorney joe digenova a strong trump supporter and lanny davis who served as special counsel to bill clinton then trump we are really doing well with north korea i won apost use the rhetoric now i aposm trying to calm it down a little bit wallace we aposll discuss the likely summit between president trump and north korean leader kim jong un and the deadline this week whether to stay in the iran nuclear deal with mac thornberry chairman of the house armed services committee plus unemployment is at a 17 year low but there aposs a threat of a trade war with china we aposll ask our sunday panel about where the economy is headed and our power player of the week rye barcott co founder with honor their commitment to actually get things done and put the country aposs interest first wallace the founder of a group looking to get veterans elected in the hopes of breaking the gridlock on capitol hill all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington well this could not be a bigger week for president trump aposs foreign policy initiatives the white house is expected to announce soon where and when he will hold his summit with north korean leader kim jong un and the president faces a deadline next saturday whether to stay in the iran nuclear deal but in washington today the spotlight is squarely on the president aposs legal troubles we aposve now seen the four dozen questions special counsel robert mueller wants to ask mr trump will the president agreed to sit down with mueller a federal judge has challenged the scope of the special counsel aposs mandate and when did the president know about that hush money payment to stormy daniels joining us now to discuss all this former u s attorney joe digenova a key trump supporter and lanny davis who served as special counsel to president clinton and has a new book out the unmaking of the president 2016 gentlemen welcome back lanny davis former white house special counsel hi chris joe digenova former u s attorney good to be here wallace let aposs start with rudy giuliani aposs statements this week joe did they help or hurt the president aposs legal case digenova well i think they are irrelevant what matters here is that the payment was legal it was for personal reasons to protect the family and i think discussion of it serves really no useful purpose in terms of the facts of it but as far as i aposm concerned it aposs a nothing burger wallace all right we aposre going to get into that payment and a second but i want to ask you lanny because some trump advisors fear that in all his comments this week about what the president knew and when that rudy giuliani has waived his attorney client privilege and that he could be asked about his discussions with donald trump in court are they right davis i think they are possibly right he aposs a crisis manager by his own description and he committed three cardinal violations of crisis management which i also do number one is don apost make matters worse for a client and i think by what he said on television he has exposed president trump to possible prosecution for those two crimes secondly i do believe that he aposs waived attorney client privilege to the extent that he mentioned conversations with the client that aposs a waiver and third don apost underestimate your adversary i know bob mueller and i know ken starr and to paraphrase a famous expression bob mueller is no ken starr he aposs not holding press conferences with a cup of coffee every morning and you are going to get a much different conduct pattern from bob mueller then you had from ken starr wallace all right one of the big issues that we touched on at the beginning is why daniels was paid that hush money was it a campaign expenditure and i think it aposs fair to say that rudy giuliani was on both sides of that issue this week take a look begin video clip rudy giuliani president trump aposs attorney it wasn apost for the campaign it was to save the marriage their reputation imagine if that came out on october 15th 2016 in the middle of the you know last debate with hillary clinton end video clip wallace joe given the fact that this payment to stormy daniels was finalized 11 days before the election isn apost it hard to argue that this wasn apost a campaign expenditure digenova no i don apost think it is in fact the law on this is pretty clear that if it aposs a purely personal matter which this clearly has to be it doesn apost matter what its relationship was to the timetable in a campaign but let me just say as well to something lanny said a lawyer cannot waive attorney client privilege only the client can waive the attorney client privilege so whatever rudy may have said he didn apost waive the attorney client privilege for the president of the united states but by that i aposm going to say wallace wait let me ask is he right davis he aposs absolutely right the client owns the privilege but because rudy giuliani mentioned a conversation he could be subpoenaed and forced to testify and he aposs a fact witness and has to recuse himself in fact the only good news for donald trump is that by his words on television i think rudy giuliani has to be replaced because he is now going to be a fact witness and has to respond to a subpoena for what he said to the president on issue of factual dispute as to what the motive was of the loan wallace do you think rudy giuliani already is going to have to be replaced davis i think there aposs at least an argument that by speaking publicly about a conversation with the president he becomes a fact witness on a crucial question was the personal loan that now president trump admits that he gave to michael cohen and was reimbursing michael cohen is a word that rudy giuliani used that aposs a fact that needs to be questioned in front of a grand jury on the issue of whether it was a political wallace do you think that aposs possible that he aposd digenova i do not believe that mr giuliani is going to get a subpoena from anybody and if they do i think it aposs one it aposs another example of how this process is completely out of control that is not to say that someone a private lawyer representing a litigant might not try to do that but i think it will be remarkably unsuccessful wallace i want to stay on this question of whether or not the payment to stormy daniels was a campaign expenditure to try to protect candidate trump or a personal expenditure to try to protect donald trump from what he says in any case it was a completely unfounded claim by stormy daniels prosecutors lanny brought a similar case against john edwards in 2012 saying that money that was spent to hide one of his affairs was a campaign expenditure his defense argued no it was a personal expenditure to hide an affair from his wife the jury didn apost buy the argument and john edwards walked i mean if it worked for john edwards why wouldn apost that work for donald trump davis so the keyword is jury there is an indictment to determine fact disputes that juries have to decide there could be two reasons rudy giuliani stated one reason on fox friends he said well imagine if it happened during the debate and it would have hurt the campaign and michael cohen did his job that aposs one view another view is that it was about his marriage that aposs up to a jury to decide but i think my friend joe would say there aposs enough probable cause on that fact dispute for there to be an indictment digenova i don apost know who would be indicted but it wouldn apost be the president of the united states at any rate and the bottom line is is that the when there is a history of crisis management inside of a business like there was in the trump enterprise there was all sorts of crisis management going on there were settlements all the time for various disputes involving businesses financial transactions and personal relationships all of those predate any campaign and have and in fact the allegations here are from 2006 so the notion that this is somehow related to the campaign requires an unbelievable stretch of prosecutorial authority wallace ok let aposs get off of all that digenova thank you wallace and let aposs get to the central case which is the special counsel aposs investigation of donald trump in terms of collusion in terms of potential obstruction of justice this week a federal judge in alexandria virginia raised serious questions about whether the special counsel aposs case specifically against paul manafort falls outside the special counsel aposs mandate i want to put this up on the screen federal judge t s ellis told prosecutors you don apost really care about mr manafort aposs bank fraud what you really care about is what information mr manafort could give you that would reflect on mr trump or lead to his prosecution or impeachment lanny is it legitimate for the special counsel to go after manafort in a case that aposs supposed to be about the election and actions after the elections for what manafort allegedly did back in 2005 davis i don apost know but i have my doubts i think paul manafort aposs attorneys have a point that there is a limit to what an independent counsel in my case with ken starr with president clinton and a special counsel really the same issue i don apost know whether that line has been crossed i certainly think there aposs a question to be raised about what bank fraud has to do with russian collusion and that aposs something that needs to be addressed by the court wallace joe how damaging were the questions we should make it clear that judge ellis while he raised the question did not rule in the case and did not say he aposs going to throw out the manafort indictment how damaging was it to special counsel mueller digenova judge ellis did something very important on friday he started a national civics lesson about what the constitution is about and about what the powers of the special counsel are judge ellis may very well not dismiss the case but he could also exclude from evidence anything seized in that outrageous rate of paul manafort aposs house at 3 00 in the morning taking mr manafort and his wife out of bed in their nightclothes handcuffing mrs manafort i mean outrageous conduct in a case that is as absolutely no significance bob mueller should be ashamed of himself to allow that to happen on his watch the answer is the judge probably won apost dismiss the case but he may very well exclude all the evidence from that raid wallace ok i want to get now to perhaps the central issue which is whether or not the president is going to after all of the back and forth end up sitting for an interview with the special counsel here aposs what president trump said this week about that begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i would love to speak i would love to go nothing i want to do more because we did nothing wrong if i thought it was fair i would override my lawyers end video clip wallace joe after all the negotiations are done should the president sit for an interview with the special counsel aposs team and if he refuses can mueller subpoena the president digenova the president will not sit down for an interview because this investigation has now reached the level of bad faith this is no longer a good faith investigation the tactics in terrorem tactics mueller has used against michael cohen against manafort demonstrate a lack of good faith wallace ok let aposs get crosstalk digenova the president will not sit down because other the law wallace wait let aposs get to the second issue digenova he can apost be the president cannot be indicted that aposs number one wallace no i aposm asking if he can be subpoenaed digenova the answer is he cannot be subpoenaed and the reason for that is because under article ii all executive power rests in the president of the united states mr mueller cannot subpoena the president because the only way a president can be held accountable for anything whether it aposs allegedly criminal or not is through impeachment wallace ok digenova impeachment nothing else wallace i want to bring lanny in because there aposs never been a case exactly like this but doing a little bit of quick history lesson this week over the course of our history thomas jefferson richard nixon and your client bill clinton have all been forced to submit to court orders can president trump be subpoenaed to testify davis so first of all mr justice digenova who i aposve known him for many years and have a great deal of respect for i don apost want to hurt his career is just simply we don apost know what the supreme court will do and it will ultimately be a supreme court question number two president clinton decided to accept voluntarily so there was never a test of that and president nixon did resist the subpoena but it was about documents not testimony so this is brand new in my opinion president trump as the president as a political elected official representing all the american people should not resist a subpoena but should voluntarily do exactly what president clinton did wallace let me ask you in the paula jones case didn apost the court ruled that the president wasn apost above the law and that he had to get involved in the paula jones civil suit davis yes and in the the answer is yes he was forced to testify in a civil suit you don apost have a test of whether he can be subpoenaed but in the language of nixon versus united states there is language that goes beyond documentary production and testimonial production that even in a criminal case the president is quote not about the law i think he will have to testify wallace i aposve got one and a half minutes left i want to get to one final question and that is the question of credibility because president trump apparently misled the american people on air force one in april when he denied knowing anything about this payment to stormy daniels take a look begin video clip reporter mr president did you know about the 130 000 payment to stormy daniels trump no what else reporter then why did michael cohen make it if there was no truth to the allegations trump well you aposd have to ask michael cohen michael aposs my attorney and you aposll have to ask michael reporter do you know where he got the money to make that payment trump no i don apost know end video clip wallace joe how damaging is that to president trump and to his political support on this issue digenova it aposs not damaging at all because in fact the people realize that this part of the investigation is why the whole thing is off track under article ii this relates to what lanny was saying earlier the reason mueller wants to talk to the president is not to investigate a crime it aposs to send a report to the deputy attorney general for impeachment a use of a grand jury subpoena to get testimony from a president about the official act of firing the fbi director is unconstitutional illegal and the president should fight it all the way to the supreme court wallace but the president clearly misled the american people with what he said there digenova no he didn apost wallace wait wait wait he was asked did you know anything about the payment and he said no he did digenova we do not know the full context of when the president learned everything about this we have no idea and first of all that aposs on an airplane in the middle of an important trip wallace oh there aposs an airplane exception digenova no but there is an exception to a kind of goofy reporter aposs questions that get asked at specific times and the president is entitled to make a mistake he knows what he knew or didn apost know wallace well lanny you aposre not off the hook here either because the president that you worked for lied to the american people take a look begin video clip bill clinton former president i did not have sexual relations with that woman ms lewinsky end video clip wallace the fact was you love seeing that again president clinton was able to survive it so i mean will donald trump davis so look we didn apost have a lawyer contradicting a president and basically calling him a liar rudy giuliani contradicted that statement and said that aposs what the president told him and now the president wallace but the facts contradicted bill clinton and a dress davis we certainly have an unusual situation where a lawyer contradicts the president and then the president the next day says he doesn apost know what he aposs talking about this is unusual and mr justice digenova may be right but the supreme court i think is going to uphold nixon versus the united states as it applies to testimony mr trump is going to have to defy a grand jury subpoena which is what we call a constitutional crisis wallace ok digenova he won apost defy it he aposs going to take it to the supreme court that aposs defiant wallace if he loses davis but if he loses i think he will say that aposs the supreme court as president andrew jackson once said they issued a decision let them enforce it wallace ok gentlemen thank you both thanks for your time this was not only entertaining i learned some stuff there so let aposs have you back davis thank you wallace and we will continue to follow the twists and turns of this remarkable story up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the fallout from rudy giuliani aposs media blitz and what aposs the president aposs legal strategy is now commercial break begin video clip trump rudy knows it aposs a witch hunt he started yesterday he aposll get his facts straight he aposs a great guy end video clip wallace president trump trying to gently walk back some of the comments from his new lawyer of the rudy giuliani about money paid to stormy daniels it aposs time now for our sunday group guy benson of townhall com and host of benson and harf which debuts tomorrow on fox news radio i aposll be listening to it columnist for the hill juan williams jonathan swan who covers the white house for axios and fox news correspondent gillian turner jonathan there aposs a difference of opinion in reporting about how president trump feels about his new lead lawyer rudy giuliani after this media blitz this week what are your sources telling you about giuliani aposs standing with his boss jonathan swan national political reporter axios so it aposs a bit of a black box for people in the west wing the one certain fact is that whatever president trump and rudy giuliani have conducted over the last few days it aposs been entirely without any coordination with anybody in the white house so they aposve been watching like us like spectators senior people in the west wing have literally been watching tv oh i wonder what he aposll say now and that aposs including the white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders so they have no earthly idea and in fact a lot of people in the west wing were comparing it to the days of anthony scaramucci his 11 days in the white house where again it was sort of this wild ride watching statements made on tv and not knowing whether there was a grand strategy behind it or not there were a lot of people who were relieved when they saw president trump come out and rebuke rudy giuliani and suggests that he had to pull it back there were a lot of people from the west wing who found that a source of relief wallace guy whether are you hearing anything about whether the president at the end of the week is pleased or displeased with giuliani and what are you hearing about the this question which is the first one i asked our two lawyers did he help or hurt the president aposs case this week guy benson townhall com oh on the latter point i think that you have to say that he hurt because when your job is to come in and get your arms around a problem and put out a new story with new information to the american people and within 24 to 48 hours you are doing damage control of your own damage control that aposs not good putting out a memo saying actually this is what i meant to say when i went on television four different times now he aposs back on television this morning and again last night with judge jeanine on fox news channel so i don apost think that you can get an a to that performance i aposm not sure how the president feels about it based on his public comment my suspicion is he aposs happy to have someone in his corner who aposs a fighter and who aposs pushing back harder against the mueller team than some of his other lawyers have been able to do in the recent past but because of his sort of smirking comment about getting the facts straight eventually he probably understands that rudy overstepped hence the clarification memo wallace i want to pick up on the new strategy and the idea of more of a fighter because it seemed clear to me this week that the president along with giuliani has decided on a new strategy which is to go after special counsel robert mueller more aggressively and make this more of a political issue watch president trump begin video clip trump this country is right now running so smooth and to be bringing up that kind of crap and to be bringing up witch hunts all the time that aposs all you want to talk about let me tell you folks we are all fighting battles but i love fighting these battles really cheers end video clip wallace gillian clearly hiring rudy giuliani who can be a pit bull and basically letting him off the leash is a dramatic change of strategy for this president gillian turner fox news correspondent it is i agree with you he was going in one direction for several months the president which was as much as he may have disagreed with mueller disagreed with the premise of the investigation he was going to let it play out now with the hiring of giuliani he sends a signal this week that he perhaps and doubling down on the witch hunt theme i might add hiring giuliani and doubling down on the witch hunt theme indicates he is going to go political on the investigation but a cautionary note there in the hiring of emmet flood emmet flood is one of the folks who came in at the end of the george w bush administration to clean up some of the mess that was left with the congress in the wake of the iraq war the financial crisis he joined the president aposs staff on white house counsel back then to try and help deal with the overwhelming number of subpoenas that were just crushing the administration in its waning days he aposs more of a sort of professionalizer so may be sending mixed signals this week wallace juan the president seems to have decided the reason for this change in strategy is that mueller is coming after him and whether it ends up in court or whether it ends up in congress with an impeachment proceeding that he needs to discredit whatever mueller finds and to rally his political base do you agree with that juan williams fox news political analyst absolutely i think that aposs why you see the president talk about witch hunt why you see rudy giuliani saying this is a garbage investigation and i think the hiring of emmet flood who someone who helped president clinton with his impeachment issues suggests that he is looking for that skill set and the skill set is now i am not about cooperating what i aposm seeing is the possibility of a subpoena the possibility of this going to the supreme court or if the democrats are to win congress and the midterms that the democrats might try to impeach me so here comes emmet flood and i think the absence of people like ty cobb john dowd i think maybe we could measure it in those terms those are people who thought that if you cooperate you could in fact limit the investigation get it to end more quickly let aposs get beyond this that aposs why they were making promises to the president that never came true swan i actually don apost think there aposs been a fundamental change in the legal strategy i think this is just going to play out exactly as it would have ty cobb and john dowd didn apost want the president to sit down with bob mueller neither does emmet flood nobody in their right mind does and guess what he aposs not going to what they are doing now is they aposve got a very competent lawyer emmet flood behind the scenes and a bunch of people like rudy giuliani who are very good at muddying the waters and performing political attacks on an investigation and so you have a dual track strategy you have to discredit the investigation make it partisan in the same way that democrats did with the bill clinton situation inaudible ken starr and we aposre going to have the same thing again here crosstalk swan and their bet their bet is that bob mueller will not issue a subpoena that is the beat internally is that he won apost have the guts because it aposs going to be a long drawn out legal process could end up in the supreme court and even if he does that will whip up their forces to discredit benson or the costs he may not have the cost to issue subpoenas too right it aposs not necessarily just about guts wallace why would it be about the cost it seems to me there are a lot of questions i mean for instance take on obstruction of justice what was in your mind when you did that benson well we aposre not exactly sure who wrote those specific questions i know we are all talking about them as if they were mueller aposs questions they were written by trump aposs legal team in response to a conversation that he had with someone in mueller aposs office so it aposs an extrapolation of what the mueller team special counsel team might want to ask the president wallace but i want to just let me pick up this we got less than a minute left do you agree with jonathan that in the end donald trump will refuse to sit down benson i do and i think that the president saying that he wants to sit down i aposd love nothing more only if it aposs fair that aposs his way i think of signaling rhetorically to the american people i aposm not afraid of mueller because i aposve done nothing wrong so i think wallace but mueller is unfair it aposs a witch hunt so benson so no crosstalk turner i think the president genuinely does want to sit down with mueller i think he believed so fervently in the power of his own interpersonal skills and his ability to sway people he aposs doing that with kim jong un at the moment he believes he can get the deal because he aposs going to have a one on one with him wallace on the flip side jonathan you say you don apost think that mueller will have the guts to subpoena him swan i think that aposs what wallace but if mueller does decide to that aposs high risk for mueller it aposs also high risk for the president i mean because if the supreme court goes and decides you know what you are liable you are open to the subpoena and does he refuse williams that was my point to you and that aposs why i think that trump even as a political issue wants to be able to say i did nothing wrong i aposm glad to talk about it he defied john dowd on this point which is why i think he was very difficult with cobb and emmett flood will say to him don apost test i think a good lawyer will say that but trump some instinct to pick up on gillian aposs point believes in himself that he thinks to sit down his backers will believe him or crosstalk swan shot him with a tranquilizer dart laughter wallace let me just say i am glad that we all came to an agreement on this laughter wallace i have a feeling this is what goes on in the white house all right we have to take a break here panel we aposll see you a little bit later up next we turn to the big news on the president aposs foreign policy we aposll sit down with the chair of the house armed services committee mac thornberry to discuss the upcoming trump kim summit and whether the president will pull out of the iran nuclear deal commercial break wallace coming up anticipation grows as we wait for word of the date and location for the summit between president trump and kim jong un begin video clip trump the good news everybody wants this it has a chance to be a big event end video clip wallace we aposll talk with the chair of the house armed services committee mac thornberry next on fox news sunday commercial break chris wallace fox anchor as the world awaits the historic meeting between president trump and north korea aposs kim jong un president trump aposs self imposed deadline to decide whether to stay in the iran nuclear deal is also fast approaching joining me here in washington the chair of the house armed services committee congressman mac thornberry mr chairman welcome back to fox news sunday mac thornberry r texas chairman house armed services committee thanks for having me wallace here was president trump this week talking very positively about what seems like an almost certain summit with north korea aposs kim begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we aposre having very substantive talks with north korea and a lot of things have already happened with respect to the hostages and i think you aposre going to see very good things the trip is being scheduled we now have a date and we have a location we aposll be announcing it end video clip wallace you have expressed serious reservations about the possibility of this summit how concerned are you that the north koreans may be trying to play donald trump the way they have played previous u s presidents thornberry i think the history of these negotiations through several administrations shows that they tried to manipulate world opinion for their benefit and it may also be that they have conducted enough nuclear test enough missile tests that they aposre pretty confident with their capabilities but at the same time because of sanctions because of chinese pressure because of the president aposs rather unconventional rhetoric they may feel a need to have a pr offensive and i have no doubt their hope is to divide us from our allies in south korea to ease some of the sanctions to ease the pressure coming from china so that they are not so isolated in the world it aposs it aposs so there aposs a military aspect and then there aposs a world opinion aspect of what aposs going on here wallace so so when there aposs talk about complete denuclearization and according to the trump camp we had john bolton on last sunday that would mean shipping all of the of the nuclear bombs out all of the fuel all of the missiles you don apost think they aposre going to do that thornberry i aposm i aposm very skeptical what it also means is inspections to make sure they do not restart a program so i think you can hope for the best but we have to prepare for the worst and that means beefing up our ability to defend against missile attacks modernizing our own nuclear deterrent increasing our defense for ships and other military capabilities in that region so we have to go into this clear eyed but also understand this other battlefield of world public opinion which is one of the things the president has his eye on wallace the new york times reports that the president has asked the pentagon for options on not eliminating but reducing the 28 000 troops who are now in u s troops that are now in south korea while the u s denies that that is part of any negotiation now as part of the summit if you were to get a peace deal between the two koreas wouldn apost a reduction in troops naturally follow thornberry it at the end of the day maybe and the president may be dangling a carrot out there to try to entice the north koreans i think the the wisest thing i aposve ever heard though on this topic came from former senator phil graham where he said if the lion and the lamb are to lie down together we have to make sure that america is the lion so maybe every everything will history is wrong that maybe everything will come together they will voluntarily permanently verifiably give up their whole nuclear program i aposm a skeptic if that happens we can talk about troop reductions but in the meantime we have to be militarily strong wallace i want to switch to another very hot topic the president has a deadline next saturday as to whether or not to re impose economic sanctions in iran and pull out of the nuclear deal israeli prime minister netanyahu and u s defense secretary jim mattis had very different takes this week on the merits of the deal take a look begin video clip benjamin netanyahu israeli prime minister the iran deal the nuclear deal is based on lies it aposs based on iranian lies and iranian deception james mattis defense secretary it is written almost with an assumption that iran would try to cheat so the verification what is in their is actually pretty robust end video clip wallace should president trump pull out of the iran nuclear deal next saturday by next saturday even if the europeans decide to stay in it and continue to do business with tehran thornberry i i would counsel against it i was opposed to the iran deal i thought it was a bad deal iran got most of the benefit upfront with relief of sanctions and a plane load of cash that president obama sent over there so we aposve lost a lot of our leverage but the key question is ok now we are where we are what happens next if the u s pulls out do secretary mattis talked about the inspectors that are in there does iran kick those inspectors out so that we lose what visibility we have there the europeans are not going to re impose sanctions so where does that leave us and iran so i aposm not necessarily opposed to sticking with this deal forever but you need to have a clearer idea about next steps if we are going to pull out and especially given the larger context of iran aposs aggressive activities in the middle east wallace well so let aposs pick up on that because the french and the germans and the british are all basically pleading with president trump stay in the iran deal and we will add some toughening side agreements that we aposll agree on unilaterally without going to the iranians and these side agreements would be to limit iran aposs ballistic missile program sanction regional aggression and end the 2025 sunset clause when iran can start resuming some of its program i guess the question is is the iran deal fixable and if so should the president stay in it if he can get these add ons with his european allies thornberry well i think these add ons would be very important is it possible it aposs hard to say until you try so maybe the best thing is for the president to delay a bit more his deadline of this month and put the french and the british up to the test about whether it is possible to get this other sort of agreement i think one of the key things going on here and and prime minister netanyahu aposs exactly right the iranians always cheat and lie one of the other things they aposre doing is they are shipping in arms to hezbollah right on israel aposs doorstep and and the temperature is being turned up there the possibility of conflict is probably greater than it aposs been in quite some time and it will be very important for the international community to be united to prevent that conflict which is another reason staying with our allies and trying to curtail all of these aggressive actions from iran is important right now wallace all right i aposve got two minutes left i want to get into one last issue with you a delegation of top u s officials has just returned from trade talks in beijing and the chinese at the end of the talks said that quote big differences remain how concerned are you about a possible trade war with china thornberry i believe a lot of countries are very concerned about chinese trade practices and working with them i think we have the best chance of pushing back against a lot of what china is doing one example in the defense world is china is stealing and obtaining through all sorts of ways critical intellectual property that they are going to use for their defense purposes we have to close the door on that what i worry about is that the steel and aluminum tariffs have alienated some of our friends that we need to work with to push back against the chinese trade tactics so again we aposre we to be more effective we aposve got to have allies and we need to not alienate allies in order to push back on china wallace so so so briefly i want to pick up on that because the president is talking about imposing tariffs not just on china but other countries around the world including the european union how how concerned are you about the fact that the president has apparently decided to use tariffs in general as part of his trade policy thornberry well i believe that we are better off with free and fair trade i also have seen firsthand what china is doing around the world i was in east africa not long ago as they are extending their tentacles out to all sorts of places we have to have a group of allies working together to push back against what china is doing and so that comes from having folks on the same page not alienating our friends i hope the president follows through in in his statement that he would like to consider getting back into the trans pacific partnership because those sorts of trade agreements are the most effective way we can push back wallace chairman thornberry thank you thanks for joining us always good to talk with you sir thornberry thank you sir wallace up next more on the president aposs moves this coming week are north korea and iran plus what would you like to ask the panel about the summit between president trump and kim jong un just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states there aposs something that i like about it because you aposre there you aposre actually there where if things work out there aposs a great celebration to be had on the site not in a third party country end video clip wallace president trump this week suggesting the dmz between north and south korea would be a good spot for his landmark summit with kim jong un and we aposre back now with the panel jonathan what aposs the latest about where and when the summit will be held and for all the president aposs talk about if kim isn apost serious about this i aposm going to just walk right out of that summit do you get the sense he aposs getting swept up in the excitement and the hype over the fact that this summit is taking place jonathan swan national political reporter axios well the first thing i should say is we do not yet know the location and the exact date but what i aposve been told by sources internally is that it aposs going to happen after the south korean leader moon visits at the may 22 i believe he visits the white house it will be sometime after that likely late may or early june and it looks like they aposre signaling it could be on the demilitarized zone between the two koreas the momentum is with it trump wants to do it even though he aposs got people like john bolton his national security adviser who has never thought that meeting and talking is a good idea trump really wants to do it and so that aposs driving the momentum wallace and do you think that he aposs getting swept up in this and swan he aposs i aposm told the idea the notion of a nobel prize has definitely occurred to him wallace yes when the crowd started i guess it was last weekend swan nobel nobel wallace yes that he didn apost he didn apost say no no no don apost don apost do that all right we asked you for questions for the panel and on reports that the president is at least considering the idea at some point of drawing down the number of u s troops in south korea we got this on this tweet from deva who writes are we preparing to pull troops and weapons out of south korea gillian how to answer deva gillian turner fox news correspondent i answer the question by saying it aposs not news it aposs not news that the pentagon that the state department aposs policy planning office would have contingency plans for an eventuality where if some kind of peace deal is struck between the north and the south we draw down our troops presence from from the border region that is not news i think what happened this week is that john bolton really didn apost like the fact that this was leaked prior and this was being made you know a deal out of this was being made in the media before wallace that this would be part of the summit turner right it aposs really a question of timing and is this something the administration is considering putting on the table in advance of the meeting with kim and the answer is a straight up no there aposs nobody in the administration and not and no reporter that would really tell you that this is something the president is thinking of offering to kim in advance i mean that that would violate every cardinal trump rule wallace but could that be part of a negotiation turner i think i think it could be not part of the negotiation it could be part of a contingency plan for if a deal is struck it aposs not going to be something the president is bringing up with kim in these negotiations it violates every trump cardinal rule from we won apost broadcast national security plans in advance so we won apost make concessions before we sit down at the table wallace let aposs turn in what a normal week might be the headline on this show very good economic news and that is the unemployment rate for april fell to 3 9 percent the the first time that it has fallen below 4 percent since late in the year 2000 president trump not surprisingly was celebrating it here he is begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i thought the jobs report was very good the big thing to me was cracking four that hasn apost been done in a long time you aposll tell me how long but it hasn apost been done in a long time we aposre full employment end video clip wallace juan republicans are counting on a strong economy and jobs numbers like this to help them keep control of congress in november juan williams fox news political analyst absolutely they would hope but you know it just hasn apost boiled down to it yet and you don apost hear president trump reiterating this point remember ronald reagan was saying to me and maybe you too chris the you know the tenth time i aposm saying is the first time the audience is hearing it and trump is attempting i think to push hot buttons like trade and immigration instead of staying on the message about the value of economic progress and the value of his tax cuts now i must say marco rubio didn apost help this week when he said the tax cuts really haven apost done much for the working people in america has not bumped up wages hasn apost started the economy in the way we had hoped he was immediately rebuked he tried to walk it back a little bit but the polls back up marco rubio on this in pennsylvania 18 what we saw was when the tax cuts and the economy were used by the republican candidate it didn apost move the needle and the democrat won the race and so when you ask the american people about it even republicans concerned about the deficit spending implicit in the tax deal it aposs only half of republicans who say yes this tax cut was a great thing and if you ask americans the plurality 36 percent say it was a bad thing so i think that he may be right in saying the midterm are going to be a referendum on donald trump and donald trump is going to stir his base by pushing these hot button issues in addition to occasionally coming back on message and talking about the tax cut and the good of the economy wallace guy how strong are these economic numbers can they be used to actually mobilize voters and persuade voters and i guess the question i have why on earth does president trump ever talk about anything else except the tax cut and these good economic 3 9 percent i mean maybe it was that way in 2000 i didn apost remember it that aposs an astonishingly low number guy benson townhall com it aposs a great number ggp came in just a couple days ago beating expectations so part of me thinks that it might be a great idea for the president basically to spend most of his time at mar a lago do some golfing watch fox you know tweet a little bit come out once a month with a giant billboard of economic numbers and just point at it and say look at these terrific tremendous numbers and then go back inside because the economy is booming under president trump and his policies the counterpoint to that however goes back to the other subject of our topic here which is north korea if not for all of the tweeting and sort of things that were seen as crazy in this city that he shouldn apost be doing i aposm not sure kim is paying attention to trump i aposm not sure kim fears trump the way he does and we may not be in the position that we are in north korea i would still recommend that the president spend a lot more time talking about tax reform talking about these economic numbers because even as we all talk about stormy daniels and robert mueller and all of those things the president aposs numbers have been ticking up slowly but surely over the last few weeks because most americans are looking at their bottom lines and smiling wallace and and how much frustration among republican candidates and republican really leaders in that building behind me that the president doesn apost stick to these numbers benson a good amount of frustration obviously but at this point it surprises zero people this is who he is it aposs how he operates and the idea that there aposs going to be some top down effort for him to be a disciplined messenger if that is still your hope about donald trump you aposve been in a coma for two years wallace do agree with that in we aposve got 15 seconds that he just won apost stay on message swan i don apost need 15 seconds i agree with what he said but you know trump trump doesn apost stay on message that aposs not his style it aposs not the way he operates wallace all right that aposs 15 seconds thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week how one group is trying to fix washington by sending more of our nation aposs veterans here commercial break wallace partisanship in congress may be at an all time high while the presence of military veterans is near a record low one man thinks that aposs no coincidence and he aposs our power player of the week begin videotape rye barcott co founder with honor we want to change the the paradigm which is essentially this record high level of polarization and dysfunction in congress and we think the way to do that is through veterans wallace rye barcott is head of with honor a political action committee working to elect more veterans to congress in november in the hope they can break the gridlock and get things done why veterans barcott when i served in the marine corps i had no idea what the you know political party was in the people that were serving to my right or left we had a common mission and the focus was on doing the mission and doing it well dan crenshaw i knew that i would never stop searching for another way to serve my country and make an impact and do what aposs right for texans and do what aposs right for the american people wallace dan crenshaw is one of the republicans with honor is backing he served two tours in iraq and one in afghanistan where he was almost blinded by an ied crenshaw whether you have a democrat veteran or a republican veteran at least we both know that the first thing we did in life was serve our country selflessly wallace barcott aposs group hopes to endorse about 35 candidates running for congress this year split evenly between the two parties younger vets who enlisted after 9 11 and are willing to take what aposs called the pledge barcott co sponsoring a piece of legislation with someone from the other party once a year meeting with someone once a month from the other party wallace on camera that doesn apost sounds like it aposs so remarkable barcott it sounds absurd that that aposs necessary but when you talk to members they actually say yes yes this is necessary m j hegar i aposm m j hegar i aposm a texan a mother a veteran and i aposm running for congress in district 31 wallace voice over hegar served 12 years in the air force as a helicopter pilot including three tours in afghanistan she is a democrat hegar instead of seeing each other as the enemy but seeing the problems that are facing our country as the enemy that aposs exactly why i aposm going there wallace back in the 60s veterans made up more than three quarters of congress now it aposs less than 20 percent barcott hopes to raise 30 million this cycle they have about 10 million so far to support candidates they screen for character more than policies barcott we interview veterans that actually served with them in a unit under duress how did they act you know how did you act when you were under fire tim kane serving in uniform was the greatest honor of my life will you help me continue that service as a new leader in congress wallace tim kane was an air force intelligence officer he aposs in a republican primary runoff in ohio on tuesday kane democrat republican is what too many people see first i want to see american first wallace barcott hopes to elect enough vets they aposll have their own cross partisan caucus in congress next year by 2020 he wants to back 100 candidates running for the house as well as in state and local races barcott you know you want to join the marine corps it aposs when you see something happening that aposs a problem around the world and your initial reactio
