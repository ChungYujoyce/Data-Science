vote for donald trump no hillary clinton no they are not trustworthy they push bad ideas fortunately we have another choice libertarian candidate gary johnson and his running mate william weld but most americans don t even know they exist it would be good if the two ex governors were allowed to join next month s presidential debates but the commission on presidential debates will allow that only if johnson reaches 15 percent in a select handful of polls he s at about 10 percent now he tried to get the commission to relax its rules but they would not you can still get a feel for what these candidates offer by watching my show friday i ll do a libertarian town hall my studio audience will grill johnson and weld about well whatever they want i assume marijuana prohibition will come up it s prohibition says johnson that kills people legalizing marijuana will lead to less overall substance abuse because marijuana is safer than all the other substances out there that appeals to liberals but libertarians offer much to conservatives too johnson recognizes that government is too big it spends too much money it taxes too much he proposes a 20 percent reduction in federal spending to do that you ve got to include medicaid medicare military spending that s responsible budgeting but some libertarians say johnson and weld are not libertarian enough i ll confront the candidates with those criticisms for example johnson sides with judges who say government must force christian bakers to bake cakes for gay weddings if you discriminate on the basis of religion that is a black hole johnson said you should be able to discriminate for stink or if a customer is not wearing shoes but if we discriminate on the basis of religion that s doing harm to a big class of people it might but this is not a clear headed way to think about the role of government discrimination hurts but discrimination is part of life we discriminate when we pick our friends jobs where we live in private life discrimination is constant government discrimination is wrong jim crow segregation was very wrong it is good that the civil rights act ended that but barry goldwater was right 52 years ago and rand paul right in 2013 when each said that two of the nine parts of the civil rights act were wrong the two parts that reach into privatelife i suspect johnson defends the rules because he fears the ignorant media won t acknowledge the difference goldwater s comments helped end his presidential hopes and the media bullied rand paul into silence but libertarian candidatesshouldexplain the difference not cave in to the anti discrimination mob no christian photographer should be forced to photograph a gay wedding no black student association should be forced to accept whites no jewish baker should be forced to put swastikas on a cake every private business should be allowed to refuse service to whomever they want outlawing all discrimination perpetuateshatred by driving it underground hatred festers when people don t know who the bigots are yes it was cruel when lunch counters turned blacks away but today there are many places to eat lunch or buy wedding cakes if a restaurant refuses blacks others will profit by serving people the racists reject many of us will boycott the racists and give money to the inclusive businesses that s a better solution than government trying to forcepeople to act against their beliefs government should respect that difference between public andprivatelife that issue notwithstanding johnson and weld are much better than clinton or trump they favor free trade work visas for migrant workers and entrepreneurial innovation the future johnson says is uber everything get government out of the way hillary clinton by contrast threatened a crackdown on uber if it didn t behave more like a regulated unionized employer donald trump calls johnson a fringe candidate and claims the route to prosperity is threatening trade partners with tariffs i ll grill the fringe candidates this week gary johnson and bill weld understand markets government and freedom much better than their rivals do alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
