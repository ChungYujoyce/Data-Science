to enjoy all the benefits of our website the wealthy and powerful without symptoms are able to get tested others even medical professionals are told there are not enough tests for them in times of crisis we americans try to tell ourselves stories about who we are and what we are doing in this particular crisis we have told ourselves that local and state leaders are stepping in where the federal government is failing there has been more than one national news article dedicated to the good job done by the new york governor andrew cuomo whose state has been worst hit by the virus and who has responded with measured and informative daily press briefings and an increasing series of measures such as closing all non essential businesses and directing a 90 day moratorium on residential or commercial evictions some have noted that businesses have stepped up for their employees some restaurants have stayed open for takeaways and said that all the money made will go to furloughed staff americans that have raised money for their fellow citizens crowd funding to help laid off bartenders and waiters have also been praised there is the story of how in this moment of national crisis some are seeing that what was previously dismissed as socialism is actually the basic social safety net that a government should be expected to provide for its citizens on 16 march the republican senator mitt romney of all people floated the solidaristic idea of giving every american 1 000 the problem is that in response to each of these more positive tales one could tell another different story yes cuomo has emerged as a hero of the pandemic but it is arguably the behaviour of other governors that has put people at greater risk florida s governor ron desantis for example in refusing to close beaches put floridians and foolish spring break tourists in danger some businesses such as united airlines have threatened lay offs if they are not given a government bailout while for a few weeks at least it looked as though republicans would embrace bold progressive policies to help americans get through the epidemic the senate bill for an economic stimulus which failed to pass a congressional vote on 22 march fell short of that optimism in the words of massachusetts senator and former presidential candidate elizabeth warren the proposed legislation represented a slush fund for the big guys
