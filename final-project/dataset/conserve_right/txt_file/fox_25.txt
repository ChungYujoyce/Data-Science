s a rush transcript from fox news sunday march 26 2017 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i m chris wallace president trump suffers a major setback on his first big legislative initiative what does that mean for the rest of his agenda begin videotape rep paul ryan r wis speaker of the house i don apost know what else to say other than obamacare is the law of the land president donald trump bad things are going to happen to obamacare there aposs not much you can do to help it it aposs imploding and soon will explode and it aposs not going to be pretty wallace we ll discuss prospects for tax reform trade and immigration as well as mr trump aposs image as a dealmaker with white house chief of staff reince priebus it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive then congressman jim jordan founding member of the conservative house freedom caucus on why they oppose the president this time and whether they will again plus isis claims responsibility for the deadly attack in london we will discuss the war on terror here and abroad with one of our key allies iraqi prime minister haider al abadi only on fox news sunday and the house intelligence chair faces backlash for taking reports on surveillance of the trump transition directly to the white house rep devin nunes r calif intelligence committee chairman i felt like i had a duty and obligation to tell them because as you know he aposs been taking a lot of heat in the news media wallace we ll ask our sunday panel whether nunes move undermines the committee s credibility investigating alleged links between the trump team and russia all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington obamacare is here to stay house gop leaders facing a revolt by republican members pulled their plan to repeal and replace it the result a damaging defeat for donald trump a consummate dealmaker in the first big negotiation of his presidency in a moment we ll drill down into what went wrong and what it means to the rest of the president aposs agenda with white house chief of staff reince priebus and congressman jim jordan and leader of the house freedom caucus but first let aposs bring in fox news correspondent kevin corke at the white house kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris it certainly makes sense for the white house to move on to what could best be described as political low hanging fruit jobs regulatory reform and we certainly expect to her great deal more about those issues this week as the white house tries to reassure the president s rattled base following friday s setback on health care in fact the president seemed to look forward in a tweet he had just yesterday talking about obamacare as you said saying that it would ultimately explode and that he would eventually get together with just his party and perhaps even others who might want to be involved in all that and try to come up with a plan to repeal and replace for the people he said do not worry and that was the message taken to west virginia by his vice president mike pence he met of course with business leaders on saturday and he said the fight to repeal and replace is not over yet begin video clip vice president mike pence even though congress isn apost ready to do it yet president trump will not rest will not relent until we repeal and replace obamacare end video clip corke meantime treasury secretary steve mnuchin will be in the headlines this week as he tries to tackle the next page of the trump white house playbook that s tax reform the u s corporate tax rate among the highest in the world the president has said he d like to cut the corporate rate down to 15 percent from 35 percent and he aposs repeatedly promised to reduce the tax burden on the american families but chris it s also important to point out that there is some concern among gop lawmakers that given friday s fiasco on obamacare the road ahead on tax reform could ultimately be even more complicated especially when you consider the incredible number of competing stakeholders that can make what happened last week look like child aposs play moving forward chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks for that joining us now president trump aposs chief of staff reince priebus reince welcome back to fox news sunday reince priebus white house chief of staff hey good morning chris wallace president trump reacted to the defeat of repeal and replace on friday by blaming democrats here he is begin video clip trump we had no democrat support we had no votes from the democrats they weren apost going to give us a single vote end video clip wallace but reince the president never reached out to democrats he never offered democrats a compromise so how can you blame democrats for this priebus well i mean look obamacare as we know is imploding and it is exploding and every other adjective you can provide it aposs going south and it would be nice to get the democrats on board but you re right at the end of the day i believe that it aposs time for the party to start governing and i think that aposs important i think that democrats can come to the table as well and if you look at what the president said in the oval just after that comment he said you know perhaps it aposs time for us to start talking to some moderate democrats as well and come up with you know a bipartisan solution i do think that there are republicans this weekend chris that are scrambling i think there are people in the freedom caucus in the tuesday group and for those listeners that aposs the moderate group that are starting to talk about what the next steps are in order to prevent an implosion of obamacare but the president has also said that when obamacare does ultimately explode which it will we are going to be prepared to lead again and if democrats come on board with a plan down the road we will welcome that wallace ok i want to talk about that in a second but the president i don apost know if you even know this has been tweeting this morning and i want to put up the tweet as i see the look in your eye priebus no i ve seen crosstalk wallace he said this morning democrats are smiling in d c that the freedom caucus with the help of club for growth and heritage two conservative think tanks have saved planned parenthood and obamacare so he seems to be putting it right on the right wing the hard line conservatives in your own party priebus well i think the president is 100 percent correct and he hits the bull aposs eye in that tweet like he often does we can t be chasing the perfect all the time i mean sometimes you have to take the good and put it in your pocket and take the win and we only have we have a two party system in this country you know we re not italy we don apost have 12 different parties where you have the super conservatives the kind of conservatives the moderates and everyone else in between and everyone fits nicely into one package we have one party republican party and one democrat party and republican party came up with a package the president met with over 120 members of the house there was more love shown to outside groups by this white house whether it aposs vice president pence mick mulvaney tom price steve bannon myself mark short i mean the point is the diverse group of people working the halls of congress including the leadership in congress i think it aposs time for our folks to come together and i also think it aposs time to potentially get a few moderate democrats on board as well wallace i m going to get to the democrats in a second but i want to talk about this issue priebus sure wallace obamacare because the president and you this morning have said that obamacare is on its last legs here aposs the president on friday priebus sure begin video clip trump i ve been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we can do politically speaking is let obamacare explode it is exploding right now end video clip wallace but mr trump has also said he doesn apost want to hurt the millions of people who depend on obamacare right now so the question is will he do something as you have problems with obamacare will he do things to prop it up to stabilize it in the meantime or is he just going to let it explode priebus well it s going to be a decision on the line mainly driven by acts of congress as you know i mean there aposs funding issues coming up soon i believe in the next couple months in regard to obamacare wallace but you can do things to try to protect those people crosstalk priebus and it aposs a possibility chris i don apost think the president is closing the door on anything in regard to the issue of health care but if you look at this bill and you look at what it provided i mean the tax relief the largest entitlement reform in modern history you look at the fact that we were almost to the point where we would be defunding planned parenthood or we were to the point where we were defunding planned parenthood the fact that some of these members took that and decided not to move forward with it i think is a real shame and i think the president is disappointed in the number of people that he thought were loyal to him that weren t that all being said i want people out there to understand that this president is not going to be a partisan president this is a president that wants to provide and you are right he wants to make sure that people don apost get left behind he wants to make sure that there s competition in the marketplace so that rates are lower and people can choose their doctor so if those three things are incompatible with some members of the republican house then it aposs going to be incompatible and then we need to work with moderate democrats to make sure that that happens we will leave no one behind we want to make sure that people are covered they pick their doctor and they pay less and we enforce competition in the market crosstalk priebus by the way that aposs what this bill provided wallace i want to get to that because this is like the third time in our brief conversation that you ve talked about reaching out to democrats is the lesson president is taking away from this defeat that he aposs got to change his legislative strategy that you don apost have a governing majority in the house that the freedom caucus never seems to get to yes and that he aposs got to be more of a bipartisan president and reach out to democrats and try to pick up some votes because he can apost count on republicans to give you the majority priebus well i don apost know if he agrees with everything you just said but what i do think is that everything is on the table we ll give these guys another chance and it s not that aposs not really the point if we can come up with a bill that accomplishes the goals of the president with republicans alone then we ll take it and we ll move forward with it but we aposre moving on the tax reform we ve got the budget coming up i think it aposs more or less a warning shot that we are willing to talk to anyone we always have been and i think more so now than ever it aposs time for both parties to come together and get to real reforms in this country whether it be taxes whether it d be health care whether it d be immigration whether it d be infrastructure this president is ready to lead and sort of you know over with the games in the legislature wallace ok yesterday morning the president tweeted this and i want to put it up watch judge jeanine on fox news at 9 00 p m now we all love judge jeanine on fox news priebus i do love judge jeanine wallace but we were curious as to why she would call her out here was the start of her show last night begin video clip justice with judge jeanine judge jeanine pirro host my opening statement paul ryan needs to step down as speaker of the house end video clip wallace does the president want paul ryan to resign as speaker priebus well first of all i will go on record we do love judge jeanine and so does the president i think it was more coincidental chris i wallace oh come on priebus i did not talk to the president about the tweet i m just telling the truth there is no preplanning here the president crosstalk wallace why would he say watch her and then that aposs the first thing out of her mouth priebus because he loves judge jeanine and he wanted to judge jeanine a favor wallace so does he want paul ryan to step down priebus no he doesn apost and he s talked to paul ryan yesterday for about an hour he believes what he said in the oval office on friday he doesn apost blame paul ryan in fact he thought paul ryan worked really hard he enjoys his relationship with paul ryan thinks that paul ryan is a great speaker of the house wallace ok priebus so none of that has changed i think this is more of a personal relationship the president helping out a friend wallace i assume the friend was judge jeanine not paul ryan priebus both of them are wallace ok but in terms of helping out crosstalk priebus but as to the tweet yes wallace ok priebus and wallace now i want to pick up on somebody else priebus sure wallace here aposs what the new york times reports today about the president aposs reaction to his defeat i m sure you aposve seen this this morning in a search for scapegoats he the president asked his advisors repeatedly whose fault was this increasingly the blame has fallen on reince priebus the white house chief of staff who coordinated initial legislative strategy on the health care bill with mr ryan and this is a comment similar to that in the washington post today so obviously people are saying it are you in trouble priebus i m not in any trouble i ve got a great relationship with the president we talk all the time in fact just before coming on the set he gave me a call this is gossip columns and you know it aposs always going to happen and i don apost really care about it i m looking forward to accomplishing the president aposs agenda moving forward and working with anybody in the legislature to make sure that that happens wallace ok let aposs talk about some items moving forward and that is tax reform that which the president says that aposs the next big thing that he s going to tackle that aposs even more complicated that health care reform because it involves every industry and not just one industry and you ve also got a big split within the republican party because speaker ryan wants this border adjustment tax which would tax imports not exports and there are a lot of republicans who say no way so the question is does the president have second thoughts after health care on following the lead of paul ryan particularly when it comes to the border adjustment tax and tax reform in general priebus no i don t not at all chris i think that moving forward the president aposs vision on lowering taxes for every american is what s going to unite not just the republican party but i think some of those democrats are going to come on board as well if we can provide one of the biggest middle class tax cuts in the history of this country i think that aposs important i think another point that aposs important to the president as a potential border tax that we start evening up the playing field between our country countries around the world wallace but he s not backing off of that priebus he aposs not backing off of that it s something that s very important to him and if you go back and watch president trump aposs interview from the 1980s the 1990s the early 2000s and recent years he has been talking about this agenda his entire life i think now more than ever i actually think the president is even more embolden to stick to his guns and his heart and the things and the convictions that he aposs laid out to the american people for decades wallace ok priebus and he aposs not going to turn his back on his core principles i think his core principles have broad admiration in both parties wallace finally and i want to do this quickly if we can because we are running out of time let aposs turn to the house investigation of alleged links between russia and the trump campaign and also the allegations that the obama administration swept up surveillance and leaked it to try to undercut the trump presidency let aposs do a lighting round priebus ok crosstalk wallace quick question quick answer i promise these are going to be very easy priebus sure wallace does the president accept the conclusion from all sides that president obama did not wiretapped trump tower during the campaign and is he ready to apologize priebus ok well first of all well the answer is no but wallace no he doesn apost accept it priebus no and i don t accept it i mean the reality is is that number when people say obama i think it aposs really clear obama administration wallace no no no i just no priebus number two crosstalk priebus look at this headline this is in the new york times it says wiretapped data this is the new york times i think it aposs safe to say wallace but that aposs nothing about trump tower priebus wait a second you asked me a question i think it s well people working at trump tower i think it s safe to say crosstalk wallace about trump tower there were also surveillance of foreign parties ph priebus i think it aposs safe to say that when people use the word wiretapped they are talking about the president you know hooking up wires in the telephones wallace nobody is saying that nobody is saying that priebus the fact is reports have come out for many many months now that people on the trump campaign transition team were surveillance ph by potentially some intelligence group whether they were inadvertently swept up whether the names were unmask chris you don apost know the full answer to that question and i don apost either wallace that s a crosstalk priebus but the people in the trump transition were unknowingly surveillance and illegally unmasked on documents which is what is being alleged out there i think it aposs a big problem and i think ultimately president trump is going to be proven correct that this wasn t wallace ok let me priebus this wasn apost right crosstalk wallace now my second question does the president believe that this was a concerted effort by the obama administration to sweep up this intelligence and to leak it to undercut the current presidency priebus well there aposs two things there one the links are apparent i mean it aposs obviously all over the place i ve been on your show before and i ve had people in my office at the highest levels of the intelligence community that volunteered i didn apost do anything wrong they came into my office shut my door and told me that these stories about russian contacts and collusion were ridiculous so there are leaks out there that are injuring the president it aposs wrong and people should be prosecuted now as to whether or not to the first party of your question that there some sort of broad conspiracy there aposs potentially something very wrong here but i m not going to go any further than that other than to say that i think the documents that the intelligence committees have apparently asked for from all over these different agencies that there collecting and reviewing wallace all right i ve got one last priebus to tell the story wallace i ve got one last question for you again quick answer does chairman nunes coming to the white house and briefing the president before he briefed his own committee did that undercut his credibility and does that open the door to an independent investigation priebus well first of all that aposs not for me to answer it s for chairman nunes to answer but it was his decision he made we don apost calculate the decisions that they make and whether they aposve briefed someone or not we had no knowledge crosstalk wallace and what do you think with the idea of an independent investigation priebus i think we let the house committee do its job and see what they come up with i mean by the way they re not going to come up with anything we aposve already been told i mean i have been on the show i m not making this stuff up every single person has been briefed by the intelligence community has come back to the sticks ph and told the press we have been told that there aposs no truth wallace we should say sticks is a reference to michael crosstalk priebus there is no truth to the allegation that there is some sort of collusion between the trump campaign and russia wallace reince thank you priebus thank you sir wallace better than last time right priebus yes crosstalk wallace you didn t call us an enemy of the american people it went well it s always good to talk with you priebus all right thank you chris wallace please come back priebus you bet wallace up next one of the leaders of the house freedom caucus who played a big role in blocking the gop health care plan we ll ask congressman jim jordan whether conservative hardliners want to govern or keep opposing their own leaders commercial break wallace house republicans had more than enough members to pass the obamacare repeal and replace bill but once again the house freedom caucus of hard line conservatives bucked its leaders in this case president trump and speaker ryan to block a major gop initiative joining me now congressman jim jordan of ohio a founding member of the group congressman welcome back to fox news sunday rep jim jordan r ohio good to be with you wallace so paul ryan and nancy pelosi agreed on the one thing friday both for here is line on the defeat of obamacare repeal and replace here it is begin video clip ryan obamacare is the law of the land it s going to remain the law of the land until it s replaced we did not have quite the votes to replace this law and so yes we re going to be living with obamacare for the foreseeable future rep nancy pelosi d calif minority leader it s pretty it s pretty exciting for us yesterday our anniversary today a victory for the affordable care act more importantly for the american people end video clip wallace we ll be living with obamacare for the foreseeable future isn t that on you and your fellow members of the freedom caucus jordan chris in the last segment i think you blamed the freedom caucus or people blamed the freedom caucus the heritage foundation the club for growth wallace i didn t crosstalk jordan you blame the speaker of the house and even people are blaming the very guest you had on before reince priebus instead of doing the blame game let aposs get to work let aposs do the responsible thing let get back to work and do what we told the voters we were going to do remember this bill 17 percent of the country approved this bill maybe the fact that we opposed it we did the country a favor because this bill didn apost repeal obamacare this bill didn apost do what we told the american people we were going to do so let aposs be responsible let s get back to work and do what we told the american people we were going to accomplish which is repeal obamacare and replace it with a patient centered health care program wallace but and here aposs the concern of the president and ryan and a number of other people there were a number of conservative provisions in this bill i want to put some of them up on the screen here aposs just a few first major reform of medicaid ever repeal individual and employer mandates defund planned parenthood now in large part due to the opposition of you and other members of the freedom caucus all of that goes away jordan but you re forgetting the overall legislation even did the bill repeal obamacare no even krauthammer said it didn t it was obama he called it obamacare light not me so it didn t obama did it bring down premiums no even the cbo said premiums are going to continue to rise for the foreseeable future for at least three years wallace and then it goes jordan yes and did it unite the republican party of course it didn apost we saw every major conservative organization in the country oppose this you saw conservatives and frankly moderates in the house and senate oppose this legislation so it didn apost unite our party so why didn apost we just do there s been talk about moving the goalpost moves you know when the goalposts were moved when they didn apost start with the legislation we all voted for 15 months ago the same bill i introduced two weeks ago which said let s do clean repeal in one piece of legislation and then let s do a separate piece of legislation to replace obamacare with patient centered healthcare wallace ok but wait wait let s talk about this question of clean repeal if you would have done and you could have done it under reconciliation there would be no jordan and we did 15 months ago chris wallace there would be subsidies to help people buy insurance or pay for their premiums or deductibles there would be no expanded medicaid let me finish there would be no expanded medicaid to help those people the result of a clean repeal is that millions of people who currently have health insurance coverage wouldn apost jordan no the result of the claim repeal is we get rid of obamacare wallace right but that has the subsidies and has the expanded medicaid jordan and there would be two year wind down and then you replace it with things that are going to bring back affordable insurance again this is just crosstalk wallace the flaw with that is that to get that through you re going to need democratic votes jordan we were going to need democratic votes for this plan wallace no you weren apost jordan look at phase two and phase three wallace i understand but not for the repeal and replace crosstalk jordan we had two to ours and ours was actually consistent with what we told the american people we were going to do wallace would you agree that clean repeal would have left just clean repeal would have left millions of people without health insurance jordan there s nothing that said you couldn t start with our clean repeal bill and also put in some other things that would help but the focus is we want to bring back affordable insurance the left always defines success by signing people up for obamacare signing people up for medicaid conservatives say no no a better approach is to get back to market oriented health care let s bring down the cost of premiums so that middle class people will be able to afford a plan in the private sector that actually fits their families needs not a one size fits all mandate from washington that aposs the difference and that aposs what our plan would have accomplished wallace the wrap on the freedom caucus is that you refuse to take yes for an answer the president i don apost know were you in the meeting on thursday jordan yes wallace so one of the things that you guys were demanding was you wanted the essential health benefits removed and the president agreed to remove a number of the essential health benefits mandates on what has to be on coverage things like maternity care and mental health coverage and you pocketed that and then you said no no we need more we need you to remove the protection for people with pre existing conditions jordan we were consistent all along and that narrative is just not accurate we were consistent all along we want those regulations and mandates placed on that industry that drove up the cost of insurance we want those to go so that premiums actually come down wallace wait a minute crosstalk wallace wait wait so you want people who have pre existing conditions to no longer have protection jordan no we were talking about community rating guaranteed issue we wanted those revisions in that in those age bands in that in those groups we wanted those things remove so that you would actually bring down premiums that s what crosstalk wallace bringing down premiums if you only if you only insure healthy people you re going to have really low premiums my point is one of the things that you got wanted jordan chris we crosstalk wallace wait wait you wanted them to remove the provision that would protect people that would require insurance companies to ensure people with preexisting conditions jordan we want to remove the regulations that drive up the cost of insurance for middle class and working class and we crosstalk wallace protection for pre existing conditions or not jordan even the speaker said this on friday at his press conference there aposs money in the bill to set up the high risk pools additional dollars wallace but you were taking away that and you were also taking away the jordan no we were for that wallace no you were taking away the pre existing conditions and you were also taking away jordan we were taking away those mandates that drove up the cost wallace some people would look at this and say what aposs good about you are going to away maternity care you are going to take away mental health jordan what s good about obamacare which we ve driven up the cost of insurance for every single family across the country what s good about that that s what we re trying to change that s what the election about in 2010 was about chris that s what the election in 2014 and in large part the election in november 8 2016 was about getting rid of this law that has driven up the cost of insurance for every single working class and middle class family across this country that s what we re focused on doing and until you go after those regulations that drive up those cost you will not solve the problem this bill didn t do it and that aposs why wallace but the result is jordan chris that s why 17 only 17 percent of the country approved at the legislation wallace but the result is you aposve still got obamacare and the president offered a huge concession on thursday on the enhanced health benefits you wouldn apost take it you refused to vote for the bill and the result you cut the legs out from under president trump and paul ryan on the first legislative initiative jordan this is about the american people and what we told them we were going to do there is no way this legislation was consistent with what the american people sent us here to accomplish no way it was consistent with what we told them we were going to do and that aposs why you saw members oppose it and that aposs why the freedom caucus opposed it in large part because of that simple fact wallace final question so what s is your play going forward when it comes to tax reform when it comes to trade when it comes to immigration are you still going to say it aposs do it our way or we are not going to vote and as a result what happens if the president as you heard reince priebus say goes for moderate democrats instead jordan chris this is real simple do it the way we told the american people this bill didn t do that so let aposs do tax reform like we told the american people we were going to let s make sure we actually secure the border build a wall like we told the american people we were going to let s focus we make this job way too complicated do what we told the people we were going to do that aposs what that s what our that s what our the freedom caucus was created to do to fight for those simple principles we re we re happy to get to yes if it aposs accomplishing what the american people sent us here to accomplish wallace congressman jordan thank you it aposs always good to talk with you i i enjoy the back and forth jordan thank you wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss the continuing controversy over the trump campaign s alleged links to russia plus what would you like to ask the panel about the president s defeat on his first big legislative initiative just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up congressional democrats celebrate president trump aposs health care defeat begin video clip pelosi today is a great day for our country it s a victory what happened on the floor is a victory for the american people end video clip wallace we ll ask our sunday panel whether the two parties can work together to prevent an obamacare breakdown next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip ryan moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains and well we re feeling those growing pains today pelosi rookies error donald trump he may be a great negotiator rookies error for bringing this up on a day when you clearly are not ready end video clip wallace speaker paul ryan taking his licks and house democratic leader nancy pelosi taking a bow over the defeat of the gop s plan to repeal and replace obamacare and it s time now for our sunday group bill kristol from the weekly standard and bill welcome back bill kristol the weekly standard thank you chris good to be here wallace we aposve missed you charles lane of the washington post susan page washington bureau chief of usa today and former speaker of the house newt gingrich speaker let me start with you what went wrong what should president trump and his team do differently next time and what about speaker paul ryan newt gingrich fox news contributor well look ryan s a brilliant policy guy this is his first really big effort to put together a legislative package i hope that this will be a moment in the trump presidency when they realize that they can t win an inside game trump aposs great strength is in the country as reagan s great strength was in the country it took reagan until august to pass a tax cut which is a pretty easy thing it took us until august of 96 to pass welfare reform which is a relatively easy thing first ground rule is simple don t set up an artificial deadline to fail the second ground rule is equally simple start with the country understanding what you re doing and then try to do it in washington but they re here with a with a fake score from cbo and the absurdity of the senate reconciliation bills trying to explain a process that is hopelessly complicated to the average american and then saying in the age of donald trump trust us we re going to fix it all in the second and third phases it was just profoundly miss designed wallace and is there one person you blame for it gingrich no i think i think it was i think the congressional leadership still wants to behave as though though they re in a pre trump world and i think trump frankly trusted them and up until what five days out they kept telling him they had the votes wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and we got a number on this question of the first big defeat for the trump presidency kevin henderson tweeted the congressional gop has six years to come up with a decent alternative what were they doing this whole that whole time and michael lodge sent this on facebook why do you think the american people will accept failure of not repealing and replace obamacare after eight years of telling us they would bill how do you answer those questions and who do you think s responsible for this failure kristol they ll have to revisit reforming and repealing parts at least of obamacare over the next year and a half there aposs plenty of time as newt said i do think just going for some huge comprehensive bill on the toughest thing to tackle something that the clinton administration didn t succeed with in 93 94 they never got even a vote on their health care bill and that barack obama took 15 months of arm twisting with bigger majorities to get through to begin with that was a little crazy there s a lot of low hanging fruit he could do some of it bipartisan i thought reince priebus was interesting in his talk with you they could do some stuff some conservatives won apost like and get democrats on board of bringing some prescription drug prices down if i were trump now i would do some easy things there s a continue resolution in a month say i want the wall funded now in 2017 not 2018 i m not a big fan of the wall but if you re a trump voter you like the wall right i want the defense supplement now i m building back the military he has three or four things he could do over the next month he could pivot away from this which will be medium sized victories for him which is what you can get in the first hundred days wallace let aposs talk about the other big story this week and that was the continuing investigation into alleged ties between russia alleged ties between russia and the trump campaign and it s also the question of the surveillance of the trump team and whether there was an effort to surveil and to leak this information to undercut the trump presidency one of the big developments this week was that the chair of the house intelligence committee devin nunes rushed to the white house to brief the president here he is begin video clip nunes what i had read bothers me and i think it should bother the president himself and his team rep adam schiff r calif ranking member house intelligence committee the chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the trump campaign and the russians or he s going to act as a surrogate of the white house end video clip wallace chuck did nunes make a mistake going to the white house briefing the president before he briefed his own committee and does this open the door and this is a question i asked reince priebus does this open the door and increase the demand for an independent investigation charles lane the washington post well on the second part of your question obviously it aposs increasing the demand for an independent investigation both in the media and elsewhere on capitol hill if i m not mistaken i think john mccain piped up about that again this week and for good reason that here you have a house body obviously whose chairman feels it aposs his duty you know the minute some new development takes place in the middle of their investigation to run over to the target in effect of the investigation and tell him what aposs going on on the point about whether or not it aposs a mistake i guess it depends on what his goal was if his goal was to remain in good graces with the trump administration it was probably a very successful venture on his part but it doesn apost seem to me at least consistent with sort of separation of powers 101 and politically i think it obviously has backfired on him wallace susan susan page usa today well you still you do have democrats calling for an independent commission or a special counsel but you don apost really see anybody in the republican leadership going that way and it seems to meet you need some explosive new disclosure to really propel an independent investigation beyond i mean now i think democrats will focus more on the senate intelligence committee that has not had the kind of partisan breach that we saw this week on the on the house intelligence committee and of course the fbi investigation is going to continue no matter what so this is going to be an issue that we know from monday aposs testimony just on monday it seems like so long ago just on monday from the fbi director that this is going to be with the chairman called a big gray cloud over the trump administration for at least months wallace and speaker i want i want to give you a thought experiment assume that adam schiff the ranking democrat was the chairman of the committee and he raced to the white house to tell president obama about some information he had gotten on benghazi let aposs say before he told his committee wouldn t you have been among the first people to cry foul on that gingrich we would have been deeply shocked horrified and called for an independent commission wallace meaning what that this is just we re rounding up the usual suspects gingrich meaning meaning meaning he did his job as a partisan and we would have done our job as a partisan i mean wallace yes but kristol inaudible newt i mean this is where paul ryan was talking about being a governing party he is chairman of the committee gingrich right kristol he has a pretty good staff in that committee he could actually investigate these things it seems ridiculous for the chairman of the it s one thing for a back bencher and a minority to say i have no recourse i aposm having a press conference i aposm going to go tell people and scream and yell he aposs chairman he can actually investigate this why is he running to the white house gingrich oh i think he s lane yes the standard is not what your average partisan would do that aposs not our standard gingrich the fact is this whole thing is so overblown and i think what nunes was saying to trump which the media doesn apost want to accept is that in fact he has some reason to believe they were under surveillance now trump got the he got pounded on by the media for weeks and all of a sudden nunes says wait a second what if it turns out he was right well i think he probably was was stunned at the idea that after all of this lynch mob mentality in the media it may well turn out donald j trump is right and everybody in the establishment is wrong and i think that aposs why he went up to see him lane and again this this is not all about at least from the point of view of what good governance and what the american people need it aposs not sort of like what proves the establishment wrong or right in the course of one 24 hour news cycle he s supposedly the chairman of a committee doing a serious investigation and gingrich but the the news media is willing to prove donald trump wrong within a half hour so don t talk to him about 24 hour news cycles lane but but but we re the news media that guy has an oath he s chairman of a committee wallace hey guys i m not going to talk to you about 24 hours or 20 minutes i am talking about a commercial though thank you we ll see you sunday coming up the terror attack this week in london increases fears over the threat of isis we ll ask the leader of iraq how soon his country will destroy the jihadists and how he compares president trump aposs war on terror to president obama aposs that s next commercial break wallace as london dealt with a deadly terror attack outside parliament this week leaders of 68 nations met here in washington to assess their strategy to destroy isis or daesh and we sat down for an exclusive interview with one of the leaders of the war on terror the prime minister of iraq haider al abadi begin videotape wallace mr prime minister welcome to fox news sunday haider al abadi iraq prime minister welcome to you wallace let aposs start with the terror attack in london which at the very least appears to be isis inspired what are your thoughts about what europe the u s the west can do to prevent these kinds of attacks al abadi i think at the moment we are at very important juncture where daesh is on the retreat we in iraq has has been killing daesh removing them from our land and we are killing their aim so that recruits are at minimal at the moment so what they re trying to do now they re trying to attract more recruits by doing these acts criminal acts we should be focused we should be concentrated to remove this ugly dangerous terrorist organization wallace but you re saying that the success in the middle east is spawning these attacks in the west al abadi yes for simple reason it s like like somebody who s dying who s trying just to flex his his muscles at the last moment so knowing your way forward is to kill their hope just to finish them then they will not be have any hope to commit such criminal acts wallace in your meetings this week with president trump with the summit of nations that s fighting isis was there any agreement on a new strategy to fight and destroy isis in the middle east al abadi i don apost think there aposs a final version of us agreeing on on like a plan but i ve seen that there s commitment from the u s especially from the administration of course from congress to continue to support iraq and to continue to stay focused on eliminating daesh wallace president trump at various points over the last year has talked about having a secret plan to defeat isis did he share that with you al abadi well i don apost think he would share his secret but i think my belief as i understood that plan is not ready yet it is still in its draft format and still is not is not there wallace how close in iraq in syria how close is isis to defeat al abadi well in iraq it s there i think the defeat is sure it s definite we finished the job in a very short time it is within our reach wallace by one al abadi within the next few weeks wallace within the next few weeks daesh isis will be gone from iraq al abadi yes militarily we are defeating them militarily as a terrorist organization as i said before they will try so that aposs where we need the efforts of others to flush them out and see there ph and other places wallace there are now 5 000 u s troops in iraq and the chairman of the joint chiefs general dunford talks about wanting to keep troops in your country for a long time general joseph dunford joint chiefs chairman we have as has nato become a dialogue about a long term commitment to groom capacity maintain a capacity of iraqi security forces but no decisions have been made yet wallace how many u s troops do you want in iraq and for how long al abadi we are concentrating on training logistical support and intelligence cooperation and gathering these are three important elements which i think we need some u s troops to stay in iraq to continue the task wallace so if we now have 5 000 troops there to complete the kind of mission you aposre talking about to train and assist how many u s troops would you al abadi i think much less than the existing one of course with the war done and the inaudible will be much less than at the present so we ll be looking at much at at a lower number than inaudible wallace on thousand al abadi i think it s a bit more fighting terrorism is a priority it s a priority for us it should be a priority for everybody i know it aposs a priority for the united states but we should be on the same chapter on this wallace i want to follow up on that do you see a difference between president trump aposs determination to destroy isis and president obama aposs al abadi i can see a very powerful determination to defeat daesh wallace but more determination with president trump then president obama al abadi well i yes i can see that determination president obama didn t want to get involved in the first place he just want to just forget iraq but i think coming back to iraq was sort of inaudible because of daesh and what they have done by crossing the syrian iraqi border and occupied about 40 percent of iraqi land i mean slaughtering people so there was a lot of pressure on president obama to set to to come to the help of iraq while i think at the moment there is understanding that iraq is an ally and we should keep on working with iraq to support iraq to stand against terrorists wallace during the campaign and even as president mr trump has talked about taking iraq aposs oil as a way to repay the u s for all the money we have spent in your country trump the old expression to the victor belong to spoils you remember i always used to say keep the oil so we should have kept the oil but ok maybe we ll have another chance wallace one what do you think of that and two did you tell the president directly in your meeting al abadi yes i did i told mr president iraqi oil is are is for iraqis there aposs no question about that wallace did it upset you that he was suggesting that the u s could take your oil al abadi well of course it upset every iraqi it upset every citizen i don t think one should say that this is the wealth of the country the wealth of the people it s not right for any foreign country to take over the wealth of another country wallace one of the reasons that you came to washington is because you would like continued u s support as you try to rebuild iraq after the war after the attack by isis but president trump announced in his new budget that he aposs cutting foreign aid by 30 percent al abadi we are not begging we have been fighting on the ground fighting isil daesh with our own blood with our own sacrifices and this is a danger to the whole world but we need much more to win the piece rather than winning the war after winning the war and this i think is what s inaudible of all all our partners it shouldn apost be just fall on iraq because this terrorism is not from iraq alone it aposs from all over the world wallace but president trump talks about cutting foreign aid al abadi this is not aid this is something else i think to preserve your own national security it s completely different terrorism is a threat of to all to the whole of the world wallace iraq was one of seven largely muslim countries that was included in the president s original travel ban and after you raised strong objections iraq was taken off the list but i wonder what do you think of the travel ban in general is it a good policy and have other arab leaders been as upset about it as you were al abadi as to do with iraq because we are allies we are we are victims of terrorism it was like it is not acceptable to us especially when you have u s soldiers u s officers working with iraqis in iraq i was really tough for them to tell the iraqis i aposm working with you inaudible a threat to the u s i think that aposs a major point which was raised and was rectified and i aposm very thankful which indicates that the u s administration inaudible wallace after 14 years in iraq america wonder what aposs going to happen to your country and one of their big concerns as this can you guarantee that iran will not have undue influence or even control over some parts of iraq al abadi see iraq is for iraqis iraqis are nationalist they don apost accept anybody controlling them they will object it and they will fight for their wallace but but iran plays a big role in the shia parts of the country al abadi well iran playing a role being a neighbor and other neighbors play a role we are looking at the good side and we want to prevent the bad side no country accepts another country controlling it and definitely in iraq we don t accept it wallace finally ever since we toppled saddam hussein it seems that the different parts of the country the sunni section the shia section the kurdish section have each pursued different interests and a somewhat different future how comfortable are you that iraq will remain a stable and democratic nation al abadi it s happening in iraq i mean there aposs freedom of expression there s a freedom of election we we hold elections every four years this is going on despite all our difficulties yes this is new since democracy very infant it needs support and we are supporting it and i think it was worth it to remove saddam hussein from power he was a dictator he killed the people he oppressed the people and people are seeing the new iraq as a democratic iraq wallace mr prime minister thank you al abadi than
