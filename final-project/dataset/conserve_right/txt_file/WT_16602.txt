apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic while the worlds largest economies yammered through the night at last weeks group of 20 summit in seoul the european unions common currency headed toward a new crisis these euro developments threaten the european project a drive toward continental unification to prevent war and encourage prosperity they could also frustrate worldwide recovery crippling the worlds largest 20 trillion combined market and affecting 4 trillion in trans atlantic sales for all the hyperbole about emerging markets and intra asian trade the 27 nation eu and the u s represent half the worlds gross domestic product even if recently they have not been a source for global growth but its clear why no g 20 palliatives were forthcoming what seoul exhibited was a cats cradle of conflicting interests unlike the productive working alliances of the post world war ii era and to continue our metaphor there will be no flip of the wrist to bring the tangled strings back into geometric order of course there were lots of g 20 coteries one based on the belief that international payments imbalances are the root of all current world economic evil found the deficit countries led by the u s naming china as public enemy no 1 but other export led surplus economies japan south korea and even germany were having none of the remedy proposed by u s treasury secretary timothy f geithner washington was leading the pack too for greater market access especially against beijings restrictions and the u s found allies in protectionist india whose own rapidly increasingly bilateral china trade is stung by cheap imports and in german french and british exporters but the american led front ran up against the great stonewall of china with beijing going into the meeting with a record trade surplus despite ailing foreign markets for its goods top stories gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time it was the federal reserves efforts to reverse domestic deflation with another 600 billion stimulus that made it the butt of all and sundry in seoul the feds global critics fear any american market growth would be offset by a cascade of liquidity into their coffers china worries about hot money now sitting in real estate waiting for an inevitable re evaluation that beijing now adamantly rejects south africa fears inflows would produce inflationary noncompetitive prices for its exports and brazil already has thrown up surtaxes to fend off speculators punishing investors fed chairman ben s bernanke might be pooh poohing inflation possibilities but the peoples bank of china with questionable success was trying to stave off higher prices particularly in food as was india the mideast oil producers worried that the fed action would reduce further the value of petrodollars as speculators bid up oil along with gold copper and grain in what looks like a looming world shortage and that in turn has upset china as its world factory is the globes second biggest oil importer and largest customer for iron ore and other raw materials but beijing already grimly absorbed by succession struggles at home nevertheless exhibited a level of hubris unseen since the japanese were perceived as ready to dominate the international economic system in the 1970s chinas boasting over its record of growth and stability was contagious a hong kong
