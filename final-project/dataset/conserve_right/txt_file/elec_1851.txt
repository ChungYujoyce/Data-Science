hillary clinton just secured the democratic nomination making her the first female presidential nominee for a major party and once and for all proving that a rich powerful well connected liberal woman married to a former president who has been groomed by a team of political professionals for the past 25 years can achieve great things mattwalsh social instory the media has predictablygone to great lengths to explainwhy this is one of the happiestand most important moments in american history it s historic we re told hillary has shattered the glass ceiling she s done the impossible she s a champion for women everywhere she s changed the game for girls she s a hero she s a goddess she literally radiates light i must admit that there is something historic about hillary s nomination more than one thing in fact democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton arrives onstage during a primary night rally at the duggal greenhouse in the brooklyn navy yard june 7 2016 in the brooklyn borough of new york city clinton has secured enough delegates and commitments from superdelegates to become the democratic party s presumptive presidential nominee she will become the first woman in u s history to secure the presidential nomination of one of the country s two major political parties drew angerer getty images googletag cmd push function googletag display div gpt ad in content 300x250 102 first i believe this makes her the first person to ever be nominated for president while currently under an active fbi investigation second thismarks only the third time a person named clinton has been nominated by the democrats since 1992 third she s most likely the first nominee to wear 13 000 dollar armani coats while giving lectures on income inequality fourth i m guessing she s the first major party nominee to have spent the last several decades intimidating and silencing herspouse s alleged rape and abuse victims fifth she is as far as i know the first nominee to have run a foundation that accepted millions of dollars in donations from corrupt foreign governments while she was secretary of state the list goes on and on history has truly been made but she s also as you may have heard the first nominee to possess a uterus it s this point that s supposed to cause us to swell up with pride even though according to liberals her possessing a uterus has nothing to do with her being a woman infact her being a woman has nothing to do with her being a woman liberals want us to view the nomination of a woman as some landmark occasion but at the same time they want us to view womanhood itself as entirely subjective and malleable once again feminism and transgenderism crash violently into one another liberals can t decide which contradictory narrative should win so they just go with whichever serves their purpose inthe moment today womanhood is a unique and splendid thing defined by both the soul and the body tomorrow perhaps it will go back to being nothing more than a state of mind but for now we re meant to cheer the triumph of hillary clinton because she is a woman and today at least that means something i m informed by the media that it especially means something for thedaughters of america who should feel inspired and uplifted by hillary s accomplishment social mediahas been filled with proclamations from parents who are very excited about the message this sends to our girls as the father of a young daughter i ve been thinking about that message quite a bit myself and call me sexist but i don t look at my little girl and think i hope you grow up to be just like hillary clinton i shudder at the thought that any parent would wish such a fate upon their precious child if anything i see hillary clinton as a vivid illustration of the exact sort of personi don t want my daughter to become it s not that i don t wantherto be successful i just don t want her to achieve success the way hillary achieved it nor do i want her to define success the way hillary and much of the rest of the culture defines it so what specifically might a young girl learn from hillary clinton if your daughter wished to follow in hillary s footsteps what sort of person would she become what would she have to do in pursuit of her goals here s the list as far as i can tell 1 lie and deceive if your daughter s taking her cues from hillary clinton the first thing she s learned is that you have to lie to get ahead in life you have tolie all the time constantly about everything hillary the great inspirational woman is such a liar that liar is the first word that comes to the mind of most people when the name hillary is mentioned polls have shown that a large majority of americansdo not believe her to be honest or trustworthy which apparently is the kind of reputation some parents wish upon their daughters hillary lies habitually about all things big and small she lies over the important matters and the trivial she lies when she wants to cover up her illegality and wrongdoing like when she lied about her emails or about the benghazi terrorist attack that killed four americans and she lies when there doesn t appear to be any coherent reason at all like when she claimed that she took sniper fire in bosnia or that she was dead broke after she left the white house or that all of her grandparents were immigrants former secretary of state hillary clinton testifies before the house select committee on benghazi ap carolyn kaster hillary s entire career in government has been one long twisted traitorous lie she has treated every position only as a means to climb to the next one and to enrich herself and her cronies along the way hillary used her power as secretary of state to do favors in exchange for payment at one pointhelpinga swiss bank get out of a bind with the irs in exchange for1 5 million dollars to bill clinton in the form of speaking fees i don t know if i d call that a simple lie so much as a crime but it s certainly deceitful either way even more interesting 20 foreign governmentsmade large donations to the clinton foundation after hillary approved weapons shipments to their countries hillary s whole career is filled with fascinating little morsels like these i d say that hillary has turned this kind of deceitfulness and dishonesty into an art form but that would give the false impressionthat she s a talented liar indeed the saddest thing is that she lieswith such regularity and such confidence yet she s still so fantastically bad at it which is why all of her lies are recognized as lies almost immediately hillary is a con artist in the same league as the guy who gives pyramid scheme seminars in the conference hall of your local comfort inn the only difference is that she s married to a former president so her lies have gotten her to more lofty heights if your daughter plans to follow the hillary model she should realize that her lies might only take her as far as the comfort inn not necessarily the white house 2 mistreat people the second thing your daughter will learn from hillary is that you have to be nasty cold and miserable to everyone if you want to achieve your dreams people that have worked for hillaryhave confirmed this about her describing her as volcanic and disdainful and abusive among other flattering adjectives a secret service agent wrote a book detailing how staff lived in fear of hillary and even witnessed more than one violent outburst on the part of the first lady another secret service agent revealed that hillary is rude to almost everybody and treats people like they are beneath her queen hillary would not permit the staff to speak to her and if they did even just to offer a friendly greeting she was known to respond with a hearty f k off hillary is such a miserable entitled brat that most secret service agents view it as a punishment to be assigned to her if your daughter learns from hillary maybe one day everyone will hate to bein her general vicinity too to every little girl who dreams big yes you can be anything you want even president tonight is for you h pic twitter com jq7fklfwgv severalentirebooks have been written confirming what most of usalready assumed about hillary she s callous cruel petty and vindictive perhaps nobody knows this better than her husband s various alleged assault victims and mistresses they reportalmostunanimouslythat hillary enabled bill s behavior and intimidated them into silence so that their abuse would not interfere with her own political ambitions despite hillary s recent claims that all sexual abusevictims deserve to be believed she responded not by listening to her husband s accusers but by destroying them if your daughter wants to be like hillary she ll have to remember that people are not people they re stepping stones on the path towards success and sometimes if a stone appears in an inconvenient place or at an inopportune time it must be crushed and thrown into the incinerator 3 ignore the law finally hillary teaches your daughter that the laws and the rules should be seen as mere suggestions hillarysent thousands of classified documents through her private server lied about it and then tried to delete the evidence that sa crime she s a criminal if some mid level pentagonemployee had done the same he d be sitting in prison right now but she s hillary clinton and if your daughter has been paying attention she knows that the law doesn t apply to hillary clinton democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton celebrates victory in the new york state primary on april 19 2016 in new york city clinton won the new york primary galvanizing her bid to win the democratic nomination for the white house afp timothy a clary photo credit should read timothy a clary afp getty images from hillary s perspective if she could get away with all of the crimes and scandals i ve listed above and many that i do not have the time to list like when she illegallyobtained fbi files on herpolitical adversaries for example then why should she bother taking the law into consideration at all after decades of living above the law why not send classified documents through a private server jeopardizing national security and putting lives at risk in the process it takes some minordegreeof honestytofollow the law when you know you can break it and get away with it but as we ve covered hillary clinton is not an honest person she is not a good person by any reasonable measure she is a narcissist a tyrant and a crook and that s what your daughter will become if she emulateshillary clinton so if you want your daughter to sacrifice her integrity on the altar of ruthless ambition you won t find a better example for your little girl than hillary if you wanthertocompromise her character in order to accumulate personal wealth and accolades hillarysends the right message if you want hertobe vain and petty hillary has certainly blazed a trail that she ought to follow if you want her to be conniving and vicious hillary will light the way if you want herto pursue success at any priceat all and to destroy whoever stands in her way and then to finallystand atop the mountain alone and bitter and vengeful and ungrateful then look to none other than hillary rodham clinton but if wewant our daughters first and foremost to be honest honorable virtuous and decent then weshould point to hillary as a cautionary tale not a role model for us hillary is not an example of success she is an answer to the question posed by christ in the gospel of mark what good is it for someone to gain the whole world yet forfeit their soul in the process to request matt for speaking engagement contact clint or matt at outreach speakers email events outreach
