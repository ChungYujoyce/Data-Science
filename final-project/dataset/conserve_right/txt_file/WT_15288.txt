el flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic tens of thousands of chinese workers are killed in workplace accidents each year because the communist nation relies on local authorities to enforce national safety guidelines which companies and local governments routinely ignore for the sake of production they ve been very casual toward life said richard cooper an international economics professor at harvard university noting that chinese workers can always be replaced to the businesses life is cheap for instance 5 000 of china s 5 million coal miners are killed on the job each year a death rate of one in 1 000 on average by comparison an average of nine of the 83 000 miners in the u s die each year a death rate of one in 10 000 top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century chinese construction sites and factories also have high numbers of fatal accidents such as the explosion in nanjing last week that killed at least 13 workers as china prepares to overtake the united states as the world s top manufacturer the safety conditions of its 600 million strong work force could give a short term competitive edge over the u s and other developed economies it s a labor cost borne by the workers said steven lewis a research fellow at the james a baker iii institute for public policy at rice university mr lewis noted though that the competitive advantage is slight given china s low wages the exact number of annual work related deaths in china is unknown as even beijing acknowledges that it is much more cost effective for coal mine owners to buy off the families than risk closure by reporting an accident leaving many deaths overlooked according to a report by china labor bulletin a group that promotes workers rights the problem does not lie with china s safety regulations analysts say in fact the communist nation has some strong workplace safety laws especially for a developing economy chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of legitimate rights of workers yang wenxu a spokesman for the chinese embassy in washington said in an e mail beijing has made great efforts including formulating relevant rules and regulations as well as taking concrete measures to implement labor protection laws there are some good laws on the books but implementation has been spotty and haphazard at best said phelim kine an asia researcher with human rights watch in new york william nee a spokesman for china labor bulletin said china does not have enough labor inspectors leaving many aspects of worker safety largely unchecked the government can t be sure its policies are being implemented he said obviously it is cheaper for companies to ignore regulations and businesses to make decisions based on profit and productivity mr nee added responsibility for enforcing labor laws falls to the ministry of human resources and social security which has local bureaus across china it is the equivalent of the u s labor department but with the ministry s local bureaus severely understaffed such laws become nearly impossible to enforce mr kine said local governments usually have to fill in but this opens the door for collusion he said labor regulations are often seen as costly frills mr kine said adding that businesses and local governments have no incentive to enforce them the economy in china is decentralized he explained so each local government needs to attract investment to its area usually by enforcing fewer regulations what you have is a system that emphasizes production mr kine said what this creates in most localities is big companies with strong relationships with local governments which can then ride roughshod over safety regulations harvard s mr cooper said the local governments attitudes reflect an ancient chinese adage the emperor is very powerful but he is very far away last week in nanjing construction workers dismantling an abandoned plastics factory accidentally damaged a gas line and set off an explosion so massive that locals mistook it for an earthquake the blast destroyed nearby buildings and left 13 dead and 300 injured even chinese officials said the accident resulted from lax safety standards during the operation and detained the responsible officials according to chinese media compensation for injuries or death also remains minimal according to a 2008 report by the congressional executive commission on china a human rights watchdog central government directives encourage local governments to pressure bereaved families into signing compensation agreements which is cheaper than going to court mr nee provided an example china labor bulletin recently spoke with a worker who got a finger caught in some equipment and was sent to a hospital it was cheaper for the company to compensate the unconscious worker for a lost hand than to surgically repair his finger when the worker woke up in the hospital his hand was gone mr nee said china has no independent unions so workers are essentially helpless to have a voice mr kine said the all china federation of trade unions the country s sole trade union sides with the state and employers in most cases he said mr nee said workers can vote with their feet and move to better workplaces but job opportunities are limited especially in rural areas analysts have noticed some improvement in recent years the congressional executive commission on china noted the strength of labor laws put into effect in 2008 including some that used input from u s laws mr kine also said there is hope for change with the new generation they are more aware of their legal rights and more vocal in asserting them he said which means companies will have to be more attentive to workpl
