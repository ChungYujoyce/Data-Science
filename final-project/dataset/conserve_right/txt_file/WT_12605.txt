obama they will closely watch and listen for direction from the unpredictable new leader of the free world in eight months in office mr trump has demonstrated his willingness to use american military and economic power missile strikes on syria get tough trade measures on china and threats of fire and fury against north korea have many world leaders wondering what s next the world is still trying to take the measure of this president world leaders still wake up in the morning if they happen to be a friend of the president of the united states and they also wonder what does it mean to be a friend of the president said jon alterman senior vice president of the center for strategic and international studies a washington think tank for a number of leaders this is going to be their first chance to see him to judge him to try to get on his good side the grueling schedule will test the skills and endurance of mr tump who like most other first year u s presidents arrives at the united nations as a novice in international diplomacy the tightly choreographed weeklong event also poses a unique challenge to mr trump who has a propensity for going off script and delights in upsetting convention the president will do some surprising things at the general assembly some of which people will think are amazingly positive and some which people will think are amazingly negative said mr alterman hard to imagine him being scripted for the whole week the president has a packed scheduled for the four day event in new york including his hotly anticipated speech to the assembled

year last year he tweeted that the u n had great potential but had become a club for people to get together talk and have a good time so sad budget cuts mr trump has proposed major cuts to the u n budget and a reorganization of its sprawling bureaucracy the u s is the largest contributor to the united nations paying 25 percent of its regular operating budget and nearly 30 percent of the separate peacekeeping budget we basically have the president headlining a u n reform effort which would really support the secretary general said mrs haley who has emerged as a leading foreign policy voice in mr trump s administration but the impressive part is we asked other countries to sign on to their support of reform and 120 countries have signed on and will be in attendance that s a miraculous number later mr trump meets with leaders of france and israel for wide ranging discussions that likely will include how to confront iran s destabilizing actions across the middle east he

assembly aides said he will emphasize the need for states to promote peace and prosperity while upholding sovereignty and accountability as indispensable foundations of international order the stress on sovereignty is seen as a signal of mr trump s pledge to more aggressively defend u s national interests against the more globalist foreign policy of mr obama he will urge all states to come together to address grave dangers that threaten us all if nations meet these challenges immense opportunity lies before us said white house national security adviser h r mcmaster providing a preview

very clear that putting extreme pressure on north korea is very important said white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders but mrs haley said sunday that the crisis with pyongyang may no longer be in the hands of the security council despite a series of increasingly tougher economic sanctions the north tested ballistic missiles and a nuclear weapon in the face of international sanctions the u s ambassador said the u n security council has run out of options on containing north korea s nuclear program and the united states may have to turn over the matter to the pentagon we have pretty much exhausted all the things that we can do at the security council at this point ms haley told cnn s state of the union adding that the north korea problem may now be one for the pentagon to resolve mr trump may also face some uncomfortable moments over his sharp criticism of the iran nuclear deal administration officials are hinting strongly that mr trump will seek to end or renegotiate the deal but will likely face resistance at a meeting with foreign ministers of the u s partners in the deal russia china france britain and germany when asked friday what moscow s message would be for
