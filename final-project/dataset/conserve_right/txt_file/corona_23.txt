some outlandish rumors about covid 19 the disease caused by the new virus sars cov 2 still persist and continue to percolate on the internet to some it s a dastardly bioweapon designed to wreak economic armageddon on the west a left wing conspiracy to damage the reelection prospects of president trump a virus that leaked from a wuhan laboratory such paranoid speculation is at the very least unhelpful health professionals say and only serves to politicize a global public health emergency and distract from potentially life saving measures to contain and or slow the spread of coronavirus after reportedly jumping from animals to humans at a food market in wuhan china in early december or before conspiracy theories politicize a public health emergency and distract from potentially life saving measures as the world struggles to come to terms with the prospect of covid 19 changing the way we socialize and work people are left wondering whether the financial markets have had a massive overreaction to yet another virus that will eventually fizzle out or whether it s time to buckle down and heed warnings of the disease s seriousness issued by governments and health authorities here marketwatch breaks down the facts and fiction of the global pandemic dispatches from a pandemic a survival guide to food shopping in new york the epicenter of coronavirus every time i hear an ambulance i wonder if it s related to coronavirus are there more emergency calls in the city or am i noticing every distant siren airborne transmission is plausible according to a study published in the print edition in the peer reviewed the new england journal of medicine last month from scientists at princeton university ucla and the national institutes of health the researchers concluded that the virus could remain airborne for up to 3 hours post aerosolization the scientists found that sars cov 2 the virus that causes the new disease covid 19 was detectable in the air for up to three hours up to four hours on copper up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel for those reasons officials recommend washing hands cleaning surfaces and social distancing in public spaces it s recommended that you remain at least six feet apart from other people especially indoors experts say studies have looked at how far spit and little droplets fly and that s the magic number said luis ostrosky vice chairman of internal medicine at mcgovern medical school in houston dispatches from the front lines of a pandemic they ve likened it to a war where the number of casualties just keep on coming italians find solidarity resilience and music during the coronavirus lockdown the covid 19 virus is capable of causing infection and severe disease in all people of all ages said dr maria van kerkhove head of who s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit the data that we ve seen from a number of countries is that the majority of children that are infected are experiencing mild disease she said adding that there has been a handful of childhood fatalities while there s no question that the elderly and those with underlying conditions have been affected much more than other age group younger people are not immune 20 of deaths in korea were people under the age of 60 and 15 of people in intensive care units in italy were under 50 years of age said dr michael ryan who s top emergencies expert in new york state where 50 of the u s cases are located gov andrew cuomo a democrat said last week that roughly half of hospitalized coronavirus patients were between 18 and 49 among the latest fatalities a 36 year old public school principal from new york city where there were more than 3 048 deaths from coronavirus as of monday morning it s not certain how long the virus that causes coronavirus survives on surfaces but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses the world health organization said studies suggest that coronaviruses including preliminary information on the covid 19 virus may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days higher temperatures based on earlier coronaviruses are likely to degrade it but experts caution that as spring arrives in the northern hemisphere which usually marks the end of the traditional flu season this novel coronavirus may not necessarily go away in warmer weather it is from a different family of viruses than the flu and it is highly contagious its life span will also vary depending on the type of surface temperature and or humidity bathrooms are a welcoming environment for coronaviruses previous coronaviruses can remain viable in cold moist surfaces up to nine days ostrosky said so if you are sharing a home with someone who has coronavirus he strongly advises against sharing the same bathroom in flight oxygen is probably of higher quality than the air in your home if you have an infected person in the front of the plane and you re in the back of the plane your risk is close to zero simply because the area of exposure is thought to be roughly six feet from the infected person according to charles chiu professor of laboratory medicine at university of california san francisco ventilation rates provide a total change of air 20 to 30 times per hour the who says most modern aircraft have recirculation systems which recycle up to 50 of cabin air the recirculated air is usually passed through hepa high efficiency particulate air filters of the type used in hospital operating theatres and intensive care units which trap dust particles bacteria fungi and viruses president trump last month said he was marshaling the full power of the federal government by suspending travel for non u s citizens from europe to the u s for 30 days later extending it to the u k and ireland a measure aimed at stopping sick people spreading covid 19 we made a lifesaving move with early action on china now we must take the same action with europe he said how covid 19 is transmitted men do tend to be more affected than women and their symptoms are often more severe ostrosky said estrogen has a protective effect when scientists block estrogen production in animals they become more susceptible to coronaviruses and they get worse symptoms he added but please don t take estrogen injections or pills if you are a man they will not help you in italy the average age of those who have died from covid 19 in italy is 80 3 years old and only 25 8 are women according to silvio brusaferro legal representative at the istituto superiore di sanit italy also has the oldest population in europe but u s health professionals also warn that people in their 20s 30s and 40s and up have been hospitalized with covid 19 is there a gender difference when it comes to influenza no with the flu it s pretty even ostrosky said the two illnesses have similar symptoms including a sore throat and coughing coronavirus is a type of virus common in humans and animals and causes mild to moderate respiratory illnesses but in very severe cases it can travel through your body and damage other organs face masks help prevent patients from spreading the virus but they are not as effective as protecting the healthy the centers for disease control and prevention says on april 3 it recommended the use of cloth face masks saying they were useful for preventing the wearer from passing on the virus if he she was asymptomatic it reversed that stance citing new evidence some previous studies have concluded that face masks have helped reduce contagion by reducing droplets being sprayed into the air during flu season another japanese based study says this works when paired with vaccination not an option in this case it may be that they work in a small amount of cases and or just wearing them helps to promote healthy behaviors also see you can never make things perfectly safe with zero risk how can you choose between saving the u s economy and saving lives this study says n95 medical grade masks do help filter viruses that are larger than 0 1 micrometers one micrometer um is one millionth of a meter the coronavirus is 0 125 um these products can help block large droplets expelled by the wearer but also have been shown to have efficacy at filtering smaller particles and are designed to fit tightly to the face it said face masks are needed for health care professionals n95 masks are tighter fitting than surgical masks and protect against small particles and large droplets according to the cdc health and human services secretary alex azar said that there are only 30 million n95 masks in the national stockpile and as many as 300 million masks are needed in the u s for health care workers new york gov andrew cuomo on wednesday ordered all new yorkers to cover their faces in public when they can t maintain a proper social distance you re walking down the street alone great you re now at an intersection and there are people at the intersection and you re going to be in proximity to other people put the mask on you don t have the right to infect me recommended how much exercise is ok during the coronavirus pandemic and in paris the french scramble to make sense of a chaotic situation with paperwork no seniors have a higher risk of getting severely sick and or dying from covid 19 italy has the oldest populations in europe and that s one reason some observers say it s had such a high fatality rate health professionals say people should remain at least six feet apart from other people because that s roughly as far as the virus can travel in a cough sneeze or when someone is talking whether you re on a plane or a train you are at risk of contracting coronavirus especially if you are seated near an infected person and or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face without properly washing your hands however who says there s no difference between sitting in a restaurant office or movie theater if you re near an infected person you re at risk while you can t do much about being seated next to an infected passenger on a plane at 30 000 feet you can exercise responsible social distancing ostrosky said the more people who are in that enclosed space with you the higher the risk you have of being exposed to someone who is sick he added if we had to rank them there is an increased risk in larger groups the average person should not worry about their clothing sarah fortune a professor and chair of the department of immunology and infectious diseases at the harvard t h chan school of public health told marketwatch in an email if you are a health care provider and potentially subject to a high density of virus the answer is different but for most of us it is all about our hands and face coronaviruses in general last a lot longer on a solid nonporous surface compared to porous fabrics juan dumois a pediatric infectious diseases physician at johns hopkins all children s hospital in st petersburg fla said he suggested they would survive better on artificial fibers such as polyester than on cotton health professionals suggest washing your hands after you take off your face mask and gloves if you ve touched any surfaces door handles and or products in a store some health professionals say washing gloves or putting them in a high tumble dryer may also help guard against the virus heat at 56 c can
