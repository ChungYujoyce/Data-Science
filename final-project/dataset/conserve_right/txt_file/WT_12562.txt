northrop group to provide an air defense system russia s rosoboronexport and a consortium of chinese defense manufacturers also bid for the contract triad won but the state owned china precision machinery import export corp cpmiec applied enough pressure to derail the multimillion dollar deal according to defensa com a trade magazine that cited unnamed peruvian officials this contract cancellation shows that the chinese contractors are becoming more sophisticated players in the latin america arms market said r evan ellis an assistant professor at national defense university in washington they are applying tactics such as legal protests against winning bids long used by sophisticated western defense contractors in procurement battles over major weapon systems asked about
