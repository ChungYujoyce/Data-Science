secution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion america is watching a massive cover up of the results of a major government operation only this cover up is being carried out by the left wing media in an attempt to hide from the american people the remarkable achievements of president trump and his task force in dealing with the covid 19 crisis in march the trump administration was focused on two things one was the death toll projections from the various models predicting a worst case of 2 2 million americans dying from covid 19 and the other was the collapse of the health care system in italy watching what was happening in italy and the astonishing number of deaths among older italians the administration quickly realized that we had to make sure that we did not allow our health care system to be overwhelmed as everyone should recall the italian health care system was so quickly overwhelmed that italian doctors were forced to triage patients sending tremendous numbers of critically ill older patients home to die mr trump and his task force were determined to not let that happen in america top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk the actions taken by mr trump and the task force achieved great but underappreciated results first by flattening the curve so quickly our health care system was not overwhelmed second not only did their actions flatten the curve they reduced the number of deaths to a fraction of what the early models predicted by a combination of imposing travel restrictions implementing social distancing and stay at home protocols and by giving doctors the flexibility to use therapeutic drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and other off label drugs in that regard enormous credit should be given to the doctors nurses and other frontline health care workers who worked countless hours many to the point of exhaustion to save lives the american people need to know and appreciate what mr trump has done to get our nation through this crisis a crisis not of our own making in the first weeks of the covid 19 outbreak house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer and their allies in the left wing media criticized mr trump for overreacting and accused him of xenophobia and racism for stopping travel into and out of china as america began to feel the impact of the crisis they accused him of not acting quickly enough now they are claiming that he mishandled the crisis and is responsible for thousands more deaths yet two months ago the nation was expecting hundreds of thousands even millions of deaths and the eminent collapse of the american health care system mr trump and his task force made sure that didn t happen while we mourn the loss of more than 80 000 people to this horrible virus we also need to step back and take stock of what has been accomplished and give the credit that is due to mr trump and his task force and get behind them as we move to the next phase it is imperative that we focus on expanding testing especially serological testing to identify the people who have the antibodies so that we can get our economy going again while protecting people we should continue to work toward an effective vaccine as well as identify therapeutic drugs to treat people so they can recover at home rather than in a hospital getting these things in place will allow our economy to recover much quicker and help americans regain a sense of safety and security mr trump took action to save american lives and save our health care system i have no doubt that he will engage with the same energy and determination to restore our economy and complete the job of making america great again gary palmer represents alabama s 6th congressional district in the house of repres
