and missile defense tracking the senior pentagon official was asked if he was concerned that china and russia would oppose pentagon plans to deploy missile defense interceptors in space to counter hypersonic missiles when you have russian president vladimir putin getting on tv and bragging about how his multithousand kilometer hypersonic nuclear strike weapon and when you have a track record that in the last decade the chinese have now done i will just say several dozen successful hypersonic strike tests that s the great power competition mr griffin said when you have north korea bragging about its successes and iran working vigorously to produce its own capabilities somewhere well down on my priority list is caring about what other people think he added and we just cannot afford to do that and by creating a geopolitical policy environment where those kinds of considerations are surfaced by even allowing ourselves to be drawn into that discussion we do ourselves and our allies and partners a disfavor until the disclosure the number of flight tests of the chinese high speed glider known as the df zf was publicly stated as around seven the dozens of tests mentioned by mr griffin is an indication the chinese are rapidly fielding the weapon that u s intelligence has said could be armed with either a nuclear or conventional warhead gen john hyten commander of the strategic command testified to congress this spring that the chinese hypersonic glider will be deployed in the next few years mccain era ends in senate senate majority leader mitch mcconnell announced wednesday

networking site linkedin to try to recruit americans with access to classified information that s the conclusion of william evanina director of the dni counterintelligence and security center who told reuters recently that linkedin was alerted to what he termed china s highly aggressive agent recruitment efforts the senior counterintelligence official a former cia counterspy said linkedin should follow the example of twitter google and facebook and purge fake accounts connected to iran s and russia s spy agencies i recently saw that twitter is canceling i don t know millions of fake accounts and our request would be maybe linkedin could go ahead and be part of that mr evanina said china recruited kevin mallory a retired cia officer who was convicted in june of conspiracy to commit espionage related to china after he was contacted through linkedin by a chinese national linkedin is a very good website according to mr evanina but it makes for a great venue for foreign adversaries to target not only individuals in the government formers former cia folks but academics scientists engineers anything they want it s the ultimate playground for collection contact bill g
