apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion president donald trump confounds the world gets derailed by a smooth talking emmanuel macron and leans into his chaotic style at the group of seven summit in france according to the leftists and elitists in the media that is and now to return to a more truthful assessment the reality is trump brought his america first game to a party hosted by globalists and in the eyes of the snooty mcsnoot faces who think they run the world and who truly believe that they should be running the world there s no cardinal sin like a call to sovereignty top stories cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump going in was destined to tick off and on that mission accomplished maga hats for everybody sorry it s the way i negotiate trump confounds the world at wild g 7 is how politico put it in a story that went on to detail how trump first said this then said that then flipped and went back and said this again if that had been former president barack obama the media would ve called it diplomatic but since it s trump the media spins it as confounding it was typical trump on display on the world stage refusing to be boxed in by anyone on anything politico wrote and what s wrong with that the president s meandering statements and conflicting remarks left aides and allies alike guessing at his intended course of action and his critics reviving questions about his fitness for office politico went on yawn elitists in the media reporting on elitists reactions to a president who makes no apologies for looking out for america first that s so campaign 2016 how trump s g 7 agenda was derailed by a smooth talking emmanuel macron was nbc news headline but was it was it really nbc s premise was that trump s goal was to stir tension with france and on that because of macron s smooth talking tongue he failed unlike last year s meeting nbc wrote the american president failed to create chaos in france in large part because of macron s intense and adroit diplomatic efforts trump failed to blow up the conference as he did after last year s session in charlevoix canada nanny nanny boo boo that s at least a little bit funny not to be outdone cnn weighed in with this criticism trump leans into his chaotic style the story went on to suggest that u s voters are wearying of the cacophony of the trump era that was on display at the g7 summit the type of which included head spinning policy reversals lying as a matter of course perpetual cultural warfare and widening national divides that s just a drop in the bucket of what s out there buzzing around the media blasting trump s behavior at the g 7 the criticism runs deep the criticism runs long but the fact is the critics are largely of the same establishment wing that hates trump that s always hated trump and that always will hate trump the critics are globalists and elitists and self interested types who disdain america s independence and america s exceptionalism and who rail against america s refusal to cower and capitulate and play nice in the foreign affairs game by selling out america for the greater good of the world these are the type of people americans fought in the revolutionary war these are the type of people who think the united nations knows best so trump didn t give enough straight answers at their party he didn t do enough butt kissing to stroke their egos and buoy their images of self importance too bad so sad it s a great thing for america that trump doesn t mind putting them in their place cheryl chumley can be reached at emailprotected or on twitter
