it will act to draw private enterprises into government control it will enter the market to subvert the market beijing s foreign direct investment has focused so far on energy and raw materials to support its expanding industries china would prefer to import from itself owning its overseas supplies to assure security and avoid market fluctuations importing at the internal cost of production rather than a price set by rising global demand will give china s industry another global edge top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes

settle for minority stakes administered by front companies like the blackstone group into which china s new agency poured 3 billion just before blackstone launched its initial public offering in the longer run a state run agency with such enormous reserves will likely try to use those funds to advance broader national objectives than merely a few extra percentage points of return on capital on

promised by president hu jintao at a beijing summit with african leaders in november chinese state oil companies have expanded aggressively on the continent signing deals in nigeria angola and sudan
