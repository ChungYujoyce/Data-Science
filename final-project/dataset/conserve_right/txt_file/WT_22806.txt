apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap president donald trump on saturday delayed a nationwide immigration sweep to deport people living the united states illegally including families saying he would give lawmakers two weeks to work out solutions for the southern border the move came after house speaker nancy pelosi called trump on friday asking him to call off the raids

difficulty managing the border crisis the number of people crossing the u s mexico border has risen dramatically under trump despite his tough rhetoric and hard line policies balancing a white house eager to push major operational changes with the reality on the ground is a constant challenge for the department of homeland security trump gave the first public word of the planned sweep earlier this week saying in a tweet that an operation was coming up and the agency would begin to remove millions of people who were in the united states illegally later leaks to the media included sensitive law enforcement details such as the day it was to begin sunday plus specific cities and other operational details on saturday ice spokeswoman carol danko criticized the leaks in context of their potential impact on ice personnel saying in a statement that any leaks telegraphing sensitive law enforcement operations is egregious and puts our officers safety in danger pelosi called trump on friday night and the two spoke for about 12 minutes according to a person familiar with the situation and not authorized to discuss it publicly she asked him to call off the raids and he said he would
