 in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion in several press conferences president trump sternly reminded the media and the american people about this little known concept we call the separation of powers between the federal government and the individual state government perhaps as a direct result of civic lessons not being taught in public school settings most americans don t fully understand the proper role of government be it at the local state or federal level in this country we don t have kings and queens we don t bow down to dictators and totalitarian regimes our founding fathers original intent was that states would govern most matters themselves they never intended the office of the president to swoop down and play god the president was intended to be an executive not a micro manager the concerns of shortages in essential supplies needed to treat covid 19 is real and must be resolved immediately but as the president rightly stated it s really for the local governments governors and people within the state to resolve the issue of shortages it s their responsibility first and foremost not the federal government and specifically not president trump this is the proper chain of command in a constitutional republic top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender unfortunately we re living squarely in the age of abdication why take on personal responsibility for our actions when one can simply kick the can down the road to the next chump most of us don t want to spend time debating whose responsibility it is to fix the problem especially when lives are being lost we just want the problem fixed and our way of life maintained however freedom is never a topic of convenience especially in the midst of a crisis freedom isn t a topic that can be picked up and discussed after it has been trampled over in order to fix the more pressing issue in our case the more pressing issue is covid 19 it s not the federal government s job to purchase ship and manage the movement of necessary ppes in every single hospital in every single state even during a devastating crisis such as the one we re contending with it s not the federal government s job to make sure every request for a ventilator is fulfilled that would be the responsibility of each state s governor and legislature for example in 2007 new york state convened its first task force on life and law to address a wide range of issues that could arise in the event of a crisis in 2015 the task force updated an earlier draft of its findings to include an expanded analysis titled allocation of ventilators in an influenza pandemic the new york state commissioner of health wrote in his opening letter that during flu season we are reminded that pandemic influenza is a foreseeable threat one that we cannot ignore the report went on to explain that during a severe 6 week outbreak 89 610 influenza patients will require ventilators in new york state and there will not be enough ventilators in the state to meet the demand in fact the study modeled that in the event of a flu like pandemic on par with the historic 1918 outbreak peak ventilator need could reach around 18 619 machines leaving the state with an anticipated shortfall of 15 783 ventilators it was known in 2015 that in the event of an overwhelming burden on the health care system new york will not have sufficient ventilators to meet critical care needs despite its emergency stockpile armed with this information back in 2015 what did new york gov andrew cuomo choose to do according to new york post columnist betsy mccaughey leaders like mr cuomo chose not to prep for the pandemic according to ms mccaughey in 2015 the state could have purchased the additional 16 000 needed ventilators for 36 000 apiece or a total of 576 million notably that s a lot of money but hindsight is 20 20 spending half a percent of the budget to prepare for this pandemic would have been the right thing to do gov cuomo chose not to granted new york is not alone in being ill prepared for covid 19 to be fair governments everywhere stockpiled a little too late most americans would be content to say lesson learned but there appears to be a concerted effort by liberal democrats and a complicit media to cast the blame of not preparing adequately solely at the feet of president trump or as house speaker nancy pelosi quipped on cnn what did the president know and when did he know it she went on to accuse the president of fiddling around while people died of the new coronavirus not only is this unfair it s also constitutionally inaccurate similar to mr trump holding the highest office in the land governors hold the highest office in their respective states the buck stops first at the desk of each state s governor before proceeding onto the president s desk so the next time a media pundit political avatar or your neighbor begins their rant on why president trump wasn t prepared with an adequate number of ventilators ppe s staff and the like remind them about the proper role of government specifically discuss the topic of federalism with them to be sure the federal government has a role to play this is a crucial fact the president has not denied or skirted around for that most americans are grateful that the federal government did not leave states to figure this unprecedented pandemic out on their own setting the proper precedent matters we would all do well to remember that hard won freedoms must be preserved even in the midst of a pandemic even when it s unpopular to do so covid 19 has taught us many things not least among those lessons is that elections have consequences be determined to choose well kathy barnette author of nothing to lose everything to gain being black and conservative in america is running for u s congress in the 4th
