trump asked new ukraine president volodymyr zelenskiy to investigate political rival joe biden and ukraine s role in the 2016 u s election at the same time the u s was withholding military aid to the country like previous witnesses the two describe their concerns about the call and a gradual understanding that the aid and the investigations were linked that connection is at the center of the

democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots takeaways from the hill and vindman transcripts drama unfolds in the white house both hill and vindman describe a july meeting in the white house before the call in which trump s e u ambassador gordon sondland told ukrainian officials that trump would hold a meeting with zelenskiy if they launch the investigations hill said sondland essentially blurted out that he had an agreement with acting chief of staff mick mulvaney trump s national security adviser john bolton stiffened and abruptly ended the meeting sondland then convened a second meeting downstairs with the ukrainians to which bolton sent hill to find out what they re talking about as she walked in sondland was trying again to set up the meeting and mentioned rudy giuliani trump s personal lawyer hill cut him off vindman said that sondland discussed an investigation into the bidens in the second meeting which he also attended my visceral reaction to what was being called for suggested that it was explicit vindman said there was no ambiguity bolton s alarm hill reported back to bolton about sondland s attempts bolton told her to tell a national security council lawyer what she had heard and to make it clear that that i am not part of whatever drug deal sondland and mulvaney are cooking up on this she said she had also discussed with bolton the may dismissal of marie yovanovitch the u s ambassador to ukraine which came at trump s direction he said his reaction was pained bolton told her that rudy giuliani is a hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up mulvaney s role according to both vindman and hill sondland linked the trade for a white house meeting to mulvaney he just said that he had had a conversation with mr mulvaney and this is what was required in order to get a meeting vindman said of the july discussion with the ukrainians vindman added that sondland was talking about the 2016 elections and an investigation into the bidens and burisma a gas company linked to biden s son hunter biden he said sondland had a tendency to just go directly over the nsc folks and rather than working with national security council staff would go over the directorate and either reach directly to ambassador bolton or go to the chief of staff s office he had a pipeline impressions of the call vindman who listened into the july conversation between trump and zelenskiy said the call was dour and there was no doubt in his mind that trump was asking for a probe of the bidens in exchange for a meeting hill did not listen in on the call but said she was shocked when she read the rough transcript that was released in september she said it was blatant i was also very shocked to be frank that we ended up with a telephone conversation like this i sat in an awful lot of calls and i have not seen anything like this hill told the lawmakers and i was there for two and a half years so i was just shocked transcript was edited vindman filled in lawmakers about what was left out of the rough transcript of the july call when it was released by the white house in september among other changes he said it was edited to remove a reference to burisma the energy company with ties to joe biden s son vindman said that zelenskiy specifically referenced looking into the situation with burisma the company linked to hunter biden he said the rough transcript was edited to read the company he said though that he didn t think there was any malicious intent in leaving the words out vindman also said the editing process for the rough transcript of the call went through a different more secure system and he had a difficult time logging into the system and had to get a hard copy and make edits on paper he said it could be justified to put it in the more secure system because if it went out it could harm our relationship with ukraine vindman out of the loop vindman testified that he began to be excluded from ukraine related issues after he had taken his concerns to a lawyer for the national security council he said he was given conflicting reasons for why he was not included on a trip to ukraine by then national security adviser john bolton and then had difficulty in obtaining readouts from various meetings i would ask for readouts and i wasn t able to successfully obtain readouts of those trips he said adding that he eventually received the information needed to do his job from contacts at other agencies there was that period of time where i guess you know where i felt i wasn t having access to all the information and not attending the things that i would typically be participating in ukraine s role in the 2016 election both hill and vindman said there was no evidence to suggest ukraine meddled in the 2016 u s presidential election a theory that both trump and giuliani have espoused hill described the idea that ukrainians were looking to mess with democratic systems in the united states as fiction she said that other national security officials had tried to explain to trump that it wasn t plausible she said officials were disheartened to see the president suggest it to ukraine s new president when they spoke vindman said he was unaware of any authoritative basis for the theory friction among advisers hill said she had a good relationship with sondland until a blow up with him in june when he told her he was in charge of ukraine you re not she replied and then sondland got testy with her she told lawmakers when she asked sondland who was in charge of ukraine he said the president well that shut me up because you can t really argue with that she said she described sondland as someone who was frequently around the white house under unclear circumstances ambassador bolton complained about him all the time but i don t know whether he tried to rein him in because sondland wasn t in bolton s chain of command she said she said he felt sondland has just gone off the road no guardrails no gps at one point she told him he was in over his head hill is not anonymous though she was not asked about it she told lawmakers that she is not the author of a forthcoming book by an anonymous author identified only as a senior official in the trump administration the person is highly critical of the president i did not leak and i was not anonymous she said i am not the whistleblower the whistleblower another person whose name is not publicly known triggered the impeachment probe with a complaint about the july call associated press writers colleen long matthew daly
