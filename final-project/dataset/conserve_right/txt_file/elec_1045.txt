a foreign policy heretic and laments the bipartisan panic against online speech well it sounds funnier in the original russian hillary clinton asked to leave costco after repeatedly accusing sample lady of being a russian asset poor babylon bee no matter how hard they try truth is stranger than fiction because fiction has to sound plausible hillary clinton wouldn t know a costco from a hole in the ground she probably hasn t entered a grocery store since she was a teen if asked where here majordomo orders the victuals from she d probably guess harrods or selfridges https www thedailybeast com russian media cheers trump moves in syria putin won the lottery via desktop source reddit putin won the lottery it s disgusting isn t it but that s what happens when the president of the united states has been a russian intelligence asset since 1987 the silver lining is the democrats have something else to run on in 2020 their nominee should promise to reverse drumpf s disastrous foreign policy decisions by strengthening american military presence abroad libertariansforglobalmilitarypresence nothing plays in peoria like new and endless wars i don t live in peoria but literally all my progressive friends are outraged by drumpf s cowardly cut and run strategy trump could cure cancer and those assholes would suddenly be pro cancer being outraged is all they have but you have no answer as to how to stop 1000 illegal border crossers in russian military uniform and armed goes with open borders you re arguing with a parody account because it would be impossible to close borders or do anything else about it if an army is threatening to invade syria has been a russian client state for over 60 years you can t win something you already had your talking points are idiotic who would want syria anyway there is nothing there you fucking moron they weren t my talking points why don t you read the article if you were to read it you d hear the perspective of russian lawmakers their media figures and their military leaders they think trump is a joke who weakens american power and they are only too happy to help elect him to a second term and what s your view on obama and kerry inviting russia to be in control of syria s chemical weapons what got larger cheers syria or the taking of crimea or how about hillarys deal to give russia us tech to kick start skolkovo russias silicon valley that now uses the tech in their weapons programs or delayed lng shipments to eastern europe under obama to make eastern europe dependent on russian exports need i go on dumbfuck if you weren t so fucking stupid this would be funny there s nothing funny about tulsi gabbard or any other russian asset as keith olbermann explained we are at war with russia i don t know about the rest of you but i take war very seriously especially when the enemy is controlling members of our government including the president trumprussia gabbardrussia libertariansforgettingtoughwithrussia keith who no wonder you re still withher she s your age demographic she must be if you re still paying attention to keith oldermann huh i ve said many times 2016 was the first presidential election i was old enough to vote in you re part of a sting operation aren t you do you work for the sarasota police department even if they are the lewds weren t anything to write home about don t bother what s so funny about tulsi gabbard she is still an obama liberal on domestic policy the funny part non interventionist on foreign policy but interventionist on domestic policy reason would like to dismiss the latter on the basis they support the former they would there is only pain and hatred and misery her first name tulsi it s a funny name it s russian for comrade according to just give me a minute according to wikipedia backwards it s i slut kinda makes you wonder you re on to something finish that thought i slut drab bag she s secretly wants to boff hillary ew gabbard isn t funny too kiss sucks it can t be said enough people a tad more serious like former reasoner kerry howley have grappled honestly with gabbard s unusual personality life history and issue set including some off putting enthusiasms for aggressive nationalists like indian prime minister narendra modi everything i know about tulsi i ve seen from tv from tulsi herself i know nothing of her unusual personality or life history she s the only one that seems capable of having an conversation without spinning off into unhinged platitudes and virtue signaling she also seems to be the only one who s willing to reach across the aisle on numerous issue but when i read the words unusual personality and life history the first person that comes to mind is beto o rourke yes her and yang are the only to democratic candidates who seem like normal people you could stand to be around the rest are just broken freaks yeah there s definitely something off about mr o rourke her family and political history is pretty interesting her father is what passes for a conservative in hawaii and was the one behind the anti gay marriage campaign there when it first became an issue at some point he switched parties to democrat because being a republican in the hawaii legislature means no one pays any attention to you i believe tulsi started out a lot more traditional conservative on gay marriage and abortion and has evolved her dad family and friends were members of a cult how did you miss that zeb is very selective about things after all zeb still equates libertarianism being simpatico with anarchism nevermind that libertarianism is okay with tiny and limited government based on rule of law are you really going to let that asshat assert that muh russians hacked the dnc without challenge wtf his name was seth rich which asshat made that assertion and i guarantee you all of them believe that they all marinate in a stew of beltway bullshit is there something a little off about tulsi compared to who compared to the average lunatic who takes a look around at a fucked up world and thinks to themselves oh yeah give me a few years and i ll have this shit fixed right up do you realize how damn insane every single one of them is who has worked this damn hard and sacrificed so damn much to get where they re at without yet figuring out nobody gives a shit and nothing they do really matters what the hell has tulsi managed to accomplish as a congressman that makes her think she can do more and better as president and yet here she is quite confident she s the perfect answer to a question nobody fucking asked well she s got you calling her tulsi just like all the cool kids do then there s bernie and beto and mayor pete cute names for people with vicious ideologies the cool kids call her mommy compared to the other lunatics she s a much better option yeah that s about it she s not fucking nuts she s still a left of center democrat some day presumably there will be a democrat president again i certainly hope whoever that is is more in the mold of gabbard and not like the nut parade we are otherwise seeing this time around shes a socialist shes fucking nuts she is literally supporting a political system that enslaves people democrats have been doing that for over 200 years you heard it here zeb the supposed anarchist is okee dokey with a socialist it was fun watching certain reason folks spew garbage while i travelled outside the usa left of center donkey i remember when that meant favoring a social safety net now it means a social safety straight jacket show trials see impeachment inquiry mueller kavanaugh etc and gulag do you realize how damn insane every single one of them is who has worked this damn hard and sacrificed so damn much to get where they re at without yet figuring out nobody gives a shit and nothing they do really matters considering that you could ask the same question concerning every writer at reason i am going to say no they don t realize that gabbard s more dangerous than sanders et al because she s a moderate but she flatters to deceive whereas sanders wears his authoritarian credentials proudly the likes of gabbard affects to be the voice of reason when in fact she s the archetype third way politician no firm principles other than pragmatism and that pragmatism defaulting to a big state mindset you can argue with a sanders a gabbard just slips like slime through your fingers you seem to have her confused with harris i don t know she seems to at least understand that what a president or government in general can do is constrained by both the constitution and reality not as constrained as we would like it to be but at least she sees some limits to what can or should be done with government force she sees some limits to what can or should be done with government force only overseas here it is to the camps still getting the impression that gillespie is annoyed by suderman how can one not be makes sense since suderman is annoyed by gillespie and everyone is annoyed by gillespie and suderman reasonagrees with you tulsi is no libertarian democrat like jared polis bill richardson brian schweitzer or howard dean https reason com 2009 03 02 the liberaltarian jackalope this was for obl wait did suderman just say that podesta s email was hacked by russian intelligence has that been definitely proven or is fancy bear merely linked to russian intelligence it s the usual well the dnc said so and that s good enough for us nonsense thank you nick for calling out the media in the awful way in which they ve covered and structured the debates and the general election coverage wow i just read howley s article and though i ll still say that she s probably the tallest midget in the dem primary that s only because i really want to insult the dem candidates gabbard being the midget not howley here s something that should seem strange even for reason commenters who thinks all religions are equally stupid and evil politically speaking attacking a really tiny cult is easier than taking on a bigger religious group and gabbard s tiny cult with which she still seems much involved is open to a lot of criticism so my point is that you d think the establishmentarians who hate her would focus on the creepy cult which scarcely any voters belong to angle voters are turned off by small creepy cults to which they themselves don t belong or know anyone who belongs but in perhaps a baffling moment of honesty the establishmentarians choose to ignore the cult angle and hammer on what really interests them that despite her cult membership gabbard still isn t crazy enough to support open ended wars we can t afford so my point is that you d think the establishmentarians who hate her would focus on the creepy cult which scarcely any voters belong to angle these establishmentarians are smarter than you give them credit for they re focused on russia which has long been a focus for the elite russia being the only power that could conceivably threaten us domination of europe russian intelligence will probably use gabbard to further their aims they re using democracy as a weapon against america i can t say how effective their game is but it s on gabbard is no more an russian asset than black lives matter texas independence the alt right crowd or any of the other fault lines in the american democracy that america s enemies might find worth exploiting last year two russian facebook pages organized dueling rallies in front of the islamic da wah center of houston according to information released by u s sen richard burr a north carolina republican heart of texas a russian controlled facebook group that promoted texas secession leaned into an image of the state as a land of guns and barbecue and amassed hundreds of thousands of followers one of their ads on facebook announced a noon rally on may 21 2016 to stop islamification of texas a separate russian sponsored group united muslims of america advertised a save islamic knowledge rally for the same place and time suppose there s a foreign country where the dominant party wants war with america and some dissenters organize to oppose such a war don t you think the u s would want to help those dissenters even more blatantly than russia helps our dissenters and of course the dissenters would be dismissed as american assets except the russians don t give a damn about american dissenters who come and go with the seasons the russian game is a long one and their aim is to weaken american prospects in areas of conflict sowing social discord rather than supporting any dissident america is much the same support for a group like the kurds can disappear overnight but presumably long term goals rarely change the ussr has funded peace groups in the past though i doubt the red role amounted to much in the way of influencing them as americans had perfectly good reason to oppose the vietnam war or cold war or whatever without the bolsheviks adding their two cents this facebook stuff has the classic russian intelligence fingerprints all over it low budget relying on western stooges though there s also the possibility of it being just a smoke screen to hide a deeper more dastardly cia operation you can never be certain how many layers the onion has or for that matter gabbard could have convincted putin to do a deep fake to convince conspiracy theorists that only the cia could be responsible for the supposed russian bots the ussr has funded peace groups in the past though i doubt the red role amounted to much in the way of influencing them lee harvey oswald lee oswald was not funded by the ussr influenced during an infamous visit and beyond would what s so funny about tulsi gabbard for the benefit of any millenials out there they just called tulsi gabbard peace love and understanding beats belonging to the gop cult that wants to spend 800 billion on the dod rathole accidents will happen you guys forgot to mention that tulsi gabbard s democratic rivals have all sides with her this isn t 2016 where the clinton crew was in charge if she had any chance of winning team gop here would be telling us that hawaii really isn t a state and that anyone having a hindu wedding is suspect as it is i take their support as trolling you really suck at this at what team gop tulsi gabbard wouldn t be so bad the problem with voting for any democrat is that there s no telling if a semi reasonable democrat could bring herself to veto the insane legislation the democrats pitch as president of the united states when the democrats are openly advocating the authoritarian socialism of the green new deal and medicare for all it s not enough to not be on the authoritarian socialist bandwagon we need someone we can depend on to veto all of their stupid shit the other problem gabbard has vis a vis trump is that he s proven in practice to be as anti foreign adventure as anyone could reasonably expect gabbard to be by being anti war trump has done to gabbard what he s done to the rest of the democrat field by being anti trade with china they can hardly pretend to be more anti trade with china than trump has been and gabbard can t make much of a case that she d do a better job of pulling out of syria than trump either if gabbard could find some way to assure me that she s going to crush the green new deal and medicare for all the hopes and dreams of democrat primary voters then maybe i d start taking her seriously the fact is that if she were president she d be a lightweight defense against the authoritarian socialism of the rest of the democratic party so fuck the democrats and fuck tulsi gabbard too by being anti war trump has done trump anti war yemenis might disagree gabbard has consistently denounced us participation in that war trump on the other hand is so anti war that the fucker vetoes a measure to end us participation there not to mention increasing troops in various foreign meatgrinders since gaining office yeah trumps anti war rhetoric is awesome but i m still waiting to lesson the wars and have fewer troops abroad when does that happen i liked obama s rhetoric too i guess trump is really the new obama of war that she is so low in the polls kinda belies the whole russia helped trump win the election doesn t it if she had any chance of winning i think the democrats seem keen on running another woman candidate so if gabbard can raise a billion dollars over the next 12 months or so she will definitely be in the running or a billion rubles here s something that should seem strange even for reason commenters who thinks all religions are equally stupid and evil commenters who thinks all religions are equally stupid and evil something kind of
