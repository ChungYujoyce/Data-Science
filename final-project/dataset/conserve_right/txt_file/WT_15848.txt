ecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic bogota colombia this nation that lost its isthmus to u s backed separatists a century ago has long dreamed of creating an alternative to the panama canal which has given its neighbor so much strategic heft and wealth in shipping tolls so when president juan manuel santos recently said colombia and china were working on building a dry canal to connect the pacific ocean and caribbean sea by railway colombians wondered is it for real or is it just another of many pipe dreams to rival panama s crossing in an interview with the financial times last month mr santos called the plan quite advanced top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century what he did not explain is that the plan remains largely conceptional senior government officials chinese diplomats and industry authorities told the associated press in a recent interview transport minister german cardona called the proposed railway a rough draft an idea floated by the chinese four or five months ago he said he is also unfamiliar with a project mr santos mentioned in a new york times interview published this month to build a related city for 250 000 people on the caribbean coast another senior government official speaking on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly told the ap the entire railway scheme is at this stage a chinese story a spanish idiom for a tall tale no letter of intent has been signed and there are serious doubts it would be environmentally wise or economically feasible to construct a railway through or near the darien gap swamp laced virgin jungle where leftist rebels still roam according to mr santos china s railway engineers intend to connect an unspecified pacific port to the new city to be built near cartagena there the chinese would assemble products to be sent to the united states and elsewhere the trains would carry back colombian coal and other china bound raw materials the executive director of latinports an association of more than 20 port authorities in the americas said he has only heard about the project from media reports what we don t know is how real this is said the official julian palacio or how feasible to think it could compete with the panama canal the general manager of the port society of buenaventura colombia s only major pacific port domingo chinea said it is a joke to think a rail line could compete with the panama canal transporting by rail the cargo that a single ship can bear across the panama canal would require about 80 train trips he estimated plus buenaventura can only handle ships of up to 40 tons compared to the 100 000 ton vessels that can move through panama whether or not mr santos is sincere heather berkman a latin america analyst with the eurasia group says it smacks of political brinkmanship colombian frustration over the u s congress failure to ratify a free trade deal is growing and few things rattle congressional nerves like the threat of losing more trade and investment opportunities to china mr santos statement was mr berkman said only natural as a political strategy to pressure the u s congress if you re not here then china s going to come and start building things and we re going to do more trade with them the u s government response has been muted asked for reaction the u s embassy in bogota said it was aware of the reports and we look forward to learning more about this project the chinese embassy s commercial counselor in bogota zhou quan said the railway project is in its formative stage and is among several proposed projects in colombia being considered by china s state rail construction company there is a project for a railway that connects the atlantic coast of colombia with the pacific coast but the fact is that they chinese agencies are still discussing it he said the idea of alternatives to the panama canal is not new but none has proven worthwhile to investors guatemala honduras and costa rica each have considered the idea nicaragua repeatedly has announced plans for a rail road or even water link and mexico has been working on the idea since the mid 19th century in the 1990s colombian president ernesto samper floated a plan for an interoceanic canal that quickly evaporated critics said he was trying to divert attention from having received campaign funds from drug traffickers colombian proposals have never solved the matter of the darien gap a region so wild it is the one missing link in the pan american highway it also is home to the los katios national park a 278 square mile preserve that is a unesco world heritage site the region is swampy and where the land is firm it is in many places covered by 10 meters or more of vegetation said jose fernando isaza a former minister of public works and transport alberto aleman the panama canal s administrator meanwhile questioned why anyone would invest in a costly alternative given the canal s success and current expansion he says a 5 3 billion project to widen the 55 mile long waterway expected to be ready in 2014 will double its commercial cargo capacity to 600 million tons a year salomon kalmanovitz dean of the economics faculty at jorge tadeo lozano university and colombia s former chief central banker called any dry canal plan untenable panama he said remains the lone op
