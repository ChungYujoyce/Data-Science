wheels coming off the trump presidency begin videotape sen jeff flake r ariz they are chaotic weeks and then there is this week wallace from the shutdown showdown president donald trump it aposs a really democrat shutdown because we aposve done our things sen chuck schumer d n y senate minority leader they are not getting the wall today next week or on january 3rd wallace to the worst week in the market in ten years unidentified male what is going on with stocks once pristine and going up up up and away they are slip sliding away wallace controversial moves in the middle east sen lindsey graham r s c it is in our national security interest not to withdraw at this time this is akin to surrendering wallace that led to a stunning resignation rep nancy pelosi d calif house minority leader i am shaken by the resignation by general mattis and what it means to our country to the message it sends to our troops wallace we aposll discuss the current state of the trump presidency with incoming white house chief of staff mick mulvaney then we aposll get perspective from a washington veteran former secretary of defense leon panetta and is president trump opening himself up to a possible 2020 challenge we aposll talk with ohio aposs republican governor john kasich a frequent trump critic plus we aposll ask our sunday panel about news blitz between the president and the gop on capitol hill all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington we are in to day two of a partial government shutdown with no end in sight but that aposs just part of a turbulent week in washington even by trump standards the shutdown aposs main sticking point funding for president trump aposs border wall the financial markets rattled by uncertainty over the shutdown trade tensions with china and rising interest rates and then there aposs the fallout from mr trump aposs decision to pull troops out of syria and afghanistan that led defense secretary james mattis to resign in a moment we aposll speak with the president aposs new chief of staff mick mulvaney but first let aposs get the latest from doug mckelway here in washington doug doug mckelway correspondent good morning chris this morning the capital is quiet and mostly empty after members scurried home late yesterday when it became clear there was no prospect for a deal before christmas begin videotape mckelway late saturday leaders of both chambers decided to adjourn until thursday the day had begun with only a faint hope of finding common ground on a deal to fund nine remaining federal departments and a border wall hopes were further lifted when the white house announced a luncheon with members but the list of invitees showed only republicans most of them immigration hardliners mark meadows r n c the president is prepared for a very long government shutdown albeit a partial shutdown mckelway that while senate minority leader chuck schumer was signaling his disdain for any bill that contained funding for a border wall schumer the senate is not interested in swindling american taxpayers for an unnecessary ineffective and wasteful policy what we do support democrats and republicans is real effective border security but not a wall mckelway meanwhile more pentagon departures are expected following defense secretary mattis and special envoy brett mcgurk and rattled by the stock markets precipitous dive the president has said to be infuriated over the fed aposs decision to raise interest rates even asking aides if he can take the historically unprecedented step of firing fed chief jerome powell as members of congress rushed home for the holidays president trump tweeted i will not be going to florida because of the shut down staying in the white house maga end videotape mckelway yet one of the attendees at yesterday aposs white house luncheon senator richard shelby of alabama described the president aposs mood as exuberant chris wallace doug thank you joining me now white house budget director and the president aposs incoming chief of staff mick mulvaney mick welcome back to fox news sunday mick mulvaney white house budget director chris good morning and merry christmas wallace thank you same to you what is the latest on talks to end the shut down and with congress now out at least until december 27th how long is this going to go on mulvaney this is what washington looks like i saw the intro and said it was chaos in washington this is what washington looks like when you have a president who refuses to sort of go along to get along you are seeing a fight over border security just like we had a fight over taxes a fight over deregulation a fight over trade a fight over syria we aposll talk about that in a little bit so this is what it looks like i met yesterday with the vice president and mr schumer met throughout the day as your story indicated there were some republican members to talk about where we were in the discussions we had given an offer a counteroffer to mr schumer late yesterday afternoon and immediately i think thereafter the senate went into recess until at least thursday that doesn apost mean a week ph before thursday until we hear something back but i don apost think things are going to move very quickly here the next couple of days wallace so are we talking a week are we talking until the new congress comes in on january 3rd mulvaney yes a couple of different things it aposs sunday right now and government shut down mostly on a sunday anyway government shut down tomorrow anyway because it aposs the federal holiday and tuesday is christmas again another federal holiday so wednesday is really the first day that this kicks in the paychecks importantly will go out on the 28th i want everybody to understand no one is working without getting paid paychecks go out on the 28th the next pay period that is impacted is january 11th i think that is it aposs very possible that the shutdown will be on the 28th and into the new congress wallace democrats are talking about 1 3 billion for border security but none of it for the wall here is senate democratic leader chuck schumer on the subject begin video clip schumer if you want to government you must abandon the wall plain and simple end video clip wallace first of all what aposs going on in the democratic side best you can see mulvaney a couple of different things that aposs an important line because it aposs important that everyone understands a language that everyone is using the president tweeted out a picture yesterday the steel fence the steel slated fence with a pointed top and so forth that aposs what we want to build and the democrats apos mind that is not a wall so they have offered this 1 3 billion to build the barrier that we want but then they go on tv and say there aposs no money for a wall we aposve already told the democrats we want to build what the president tweeted out it doesn apost have to be a 30 foot high concrete wallace so you think that they would approve 1 3 billion to build this deal picket fence mulvaney exactly well the steel barriers that the president tweeted out wallace right mulvaney so here aposs the problem of course is that as recently as two weeks ago they had offered us 1 6 billion for that same thing so they aposre moving in the wrong direction i think it aposs a really good question as to whether or not this deal can be cut before the new congress comes in i think there is an implication here for nancy pelosi aposs election for the speakership i think she aposs in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker if that aposs the case again there aposs a chance we go into the next congress wallace so you are suggesting or maybe you aposre outright saying that nancy pelosi and her effort to ensure that she is a speaker may hold this up until she is elected speaker mulvaney i should have said that aposs the dynamic we have been talking to mr schumer the leader of the democrats in the senate a bill right now is in the senate the ball is in the senate aposs court of course keep in mind any bill that comes out of the senate on this topic will have to have 60 votes have to have democrats support but i certainly think the speaker aposs dynamic is in play here wallace all right let aposs look at it from your side the president aposs 5 billion what aposs his bottom line does it have to be 5 billion or there aposs talk from republicans who had lunch with the president yesterday he might accept 2 3 billion mulvaney again i aposm not going to say what our bottom line is and i don apost know you don apost expect to do that wallace yes inaudible i like it mulvaney yes i will tell you this they aposre in 1 3 yesterday we are at 5 billion a couple of days ago and the counteroffer that we give them yesterday was between those two numbers wallace but 2 3 mulvaney we moved off of the five and we hope they move up from their 1 3 wallace all right president trump has been all over the place on this whole issue with the shutdown here aposs where he was two weeks ago and where he was on friday take a look begin video clip trump i am proud to shut down the government for border security chuck so i will take the mantle i will be the one to shut it down i aposm not going to blame you for it it aposs up to the democrats so it aposs really the democrat shut down end video clip wallace so if the president is quote proud to shut down the government and is ready to take the mantle why is he suddenly calling it the democrat shutdown mulvaney first of all he is proud to be having the fight let aposs make that very very clear he is proud to sort of point out that chuck schumer has actually voted for the exact wallace he said he aposs proud to shut down the government mulvaney i get to that in a second but you know he is proud to have this fight wallace ok mulvaney as to where we are on the back and forth again the ball right now is in their corner we made them an offer yesterday afternoon so the senate democrats have the ability right now to open the government and agree to the deal that aposs where the back and forth is wallace so you don apost see them flipping when he says i aposm proud to shut down the government and he aposs mulvaney they come back with something in the ball is on our court it aposs a different dynamic but right now the democrats the ball into their court as to what they come with wallace you have your own record when it comes to immigration and the border wall you knew i was going to ask you this here aposs what you said as a congressman 2015 mulvaney sure begin audio clip mulvaney the defense doesn apost solve the problem is it necessary to have one sure would it help sure but to just say build the darn fence and have that be the end of the immigration discussion is absurd and almost childish for someone running for president to take that simplistic view end audio clip wallace if building the wall is childish and simplistic as a solution for the immigration problem why is it worth shutting down the government mulvaney it has to be part of a comprehensive wallace but it isn apost mulvaney border wall absolutely is part of border security wallace but you aposre not saying it aposs part of it you aposre not saying it aposs part of a comprehensive immigration plan mulvaney i think in the quote you just read wallace that aposs what you said but that aposs crosstalk wallace but that aposs not what the president is saying mulvaney a border wall is necessary we aposve known this since reagan reagan agreed to amnesty in exchange for border security he gave away the amnesty never got the border security everyone is aware of that we don apost want to make the same mistake a border wall is absolutely necessary which is why we are having the battle so too by the way are changing our policies on immigration i think one of the biggest stories that didn apost get reported this week was the agreement that we reached with mexico to have mexico agreed to keep people seeking asylum in the united states in mexico so they come to the border right now or at least before this week they were allowed to stay in this country pending their decision now mexico will keep them in mexico that aposs going to have a tremendous deterrent effect on people coming to the border wallace all right mulvaney we need a comprehensive solution to border security and a border barrier steel slat fence has to be part of that wallace one of the reasons that i think people here in washington are so rattled this week is because the shutdown comes exactly the same time as the president made a dramatic decision on pulling troops out of syria and drawing down troops in afghanistan which led to resignation of defense secretary james mattis i went to put up the resignation letter from mattis in which he writes this my views on trading allies with respect and also being clear eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues so secretary mattis is saying that he quit because his views on treating allies with respect and being clear eyed about our enemies do not align with president trump mulvaney i don apost think it was a dramatic decision keep in mind this has been something that the president has been working on since he got to office crosstalk wallace wait one second it aposs the first time a defense secretary has ever resigned over policy in the history of the country mulvaney i don apost believe that to be the case i think chuck hagel resigned for the same reasons wallace i don apost believe that he did resign over a matter of policy mulvaney i thought policy over isis as a matter of fact but again this it leaked out this week in fact it leaked out apparently from the defense department this is not something that was done sort of at the drop of a hat the president has been working on this for two years so it aposs unfortunate that it came out the way that it did but this is not a snap decision and it aposs not a surprise to anybody because exactly what the president said he was going to do now as to mr mattis apos resignation if the cabinet secretary simply has such a misalignment with the president aposs priorities that he cannot serve him that is the right reason to leave you asked wallace i completely agree with you but the point is he aposs saying the reason he left is because he believes that allies should be treated with respect and we ought to be clear about our enemies and he clearly doesn apost think that president trump feels the same way mulvaney i don apost read the letter that way look let aposs be honest with each other i think the relationship between these two men have been fraying i think the president no longer relied on mattis to be able to deliver the president aposs vision the president has to know i don apost have to agree with the president on everything he asked me to do in fact we aposre not going to i think he hires people who disagree with him because he likes that different input ok but i aposm physically incapable completely incapable of doing what he wants me to do just because i don apost believe it i cannot serve him well and i need to leave and i think that aposs what happened wallace it aposs a very honorable thing but let aposs look because it wasn apost just mattis i want to put up the u s envoy to the coalition to fight isis and the chairman of the joint chiefs who both in recent days had expressed were they thought about u s troops in syria here they are begin video clip brett mcgurk u s envoy to anti isis coalition even at the end of the physical caliphate is clearly now coming into sight the end devices will be a much more long term initiative joseph dunford chairman of the joint chiefs of staff we still have a long way to go and so i would be reluctant to affix a time end video clip wallace they both said that this month and we learned yesterday that the envoy brett mcgurk has just quit because he also disagreed so strongly with the president aposs policies a couple of questions the president says in a tweet he didn apost know brett mcgurk how is it possible that the president doesn apost know the envoy who has been representing the u s to the coalition for the last two years mulvaney well i think that aposs easy because the president is dealing with the secretary of state the secretary of defense i mean that despite what people think the white house is not grand central station not anybody in the administration gets into see the president so the president gets briefed by general dunford wallace so here aposs the question if he run against the recommendations of mattis mcgurk dunford the chairman of joint chiefs apparently pompeo and bolton who is he listening to mulvaney here aposs the president listens to a bunch of different people including the people wallace that aposs his national security team mulvaney including the people who live here and ordinary americans the people he promised when he ran for office that he was going to lead we recognize the fact that this is unpopular within the beltway we recognize this fact it aposs unpopular within the defense department it aposs very popular with ordinary american people the people who ran when donald trump wallace with all due respect to democracy and i agree with you about that do they really know what do they really know what the stakes are of pulling u s troops out and leaving the syrian defense force to the turkish slaughter and what the impact is going to be on iran i mean really we are going to make this a plebiscite mulvaney ordinary americans have no idea about those things they elect a president so that he does and he has a complete understanding of what you just laid out and the decision is his we serve the president i am not the president of the united states jim mattis is not the president of the united states and our job is to get him the information from all sides and believe me he sees information from all sides you can imagine on spending what he sees from me and he makes the final decision the fact that his decision is now popular to some people is more their problem than his wallace i aposve got one more question and i aposve got a minute for it the stock markets have just had their worst week since the great recession in 2008 at least two top national security officials resigned this week and there is talk about more resignations from the pentagon congressional republicans are now breaking with the present whether it aposs on syria or saudi arabia or even some of them about how the shutdown happened does the president understand that there is growing concern in washington even among some people in his own party that his presidency is in crisis mulvaney no i don apost think there is concern the presidency is in crisis i thought you aposre going to ask me if these things are unpopular people worried about them this as i said at the outset this is what having a president who is nontraditional who aposs a different kind of president who looks like he is not going to be an ordinary president and that aposs not what people wanted when they elected him as to the things you just mentioned the fundamentals of the economy are still great yes the stock market is down we both know it goes up and down unemployment is still at historic lows capital investment still high business confidence is high gdp is still solid so the fundamentals are still good is it going to be a rocky road with the president who is willing to mix things up to change washington to benefit folks back home yes wallace mick thank you thank you for your time especially this holiday weekend i hope you and your family gets a least a little time to celebrate christmas and congratulations on your new job as chief of staff i hope you will be more willing to come on and talk to us than your immediate predecessor was mulvaney merry christmas to you thanks chris wallace merry christmas to you coming up we aposll assess what the resignation of defense secretary mattis means for u s relations with allies and adversaries former defense secretary leon panetta joins us next commercial break wallace with everything aposs that going on in washington we want to get the perspective from someone who aposs worked in this town since the nixon administration leon panetta was bill clinton aposs chief of staff then served as cia director and defense secretary under barack obama secretary panetta joins us from california and welcome back sir to fox news sunday leon panetta former defense secretary nice to be with you chris wallace you lived through the uproar over vietnam you lived over the crisis of watergate how much trouble is the trump presidency in right now panetta it aposs one of those moments if you aposre in the white house where you really have to look at the situation and try to do what you can to try to provide a little better stability for the country there aposs just too much chaos too many crises going on i think it aposs very upsetting for the country for our economy for the world i just think i think this is a moment where the president really has to focus on what steps need to be taken in order to provide a little better stability for the country wallace we aposre going to drill down on each part in a moment but when you look at the broad picture the government shutdown the freefall in the markets the real disarray and now resignations when it comes to national security have you ever seen this particular kind of combination on all these different fronts panetta well chris as you know i aposve been in politics over 50 years in a number of positions and working under nine presidents i aposve never seen a situation like this in which almost every important area that is key to this country is confronting crisis or confronting crisis in terms of our national security i think the obviously the staff to suddenly withdraw those troops from syria has sent a terrible message to the world about where the united states stands i think we aposre seeing the economy wracked by a crashing stock market in the sense that the stock market is not quite sure what aposs going on and we have the shutdown of the federal government all occurring at the same time and raising real concerns about whether or not this instability is going to shake the country in terms of our security wallace well let aposs talk about the national security component of it first in your last job as secretary of defense we have had these abrupt shifts in policy pulling out of syria drawing down in afghanistan the resignation of defense secretary mattis but president trump did campaign saying he did not want to be engaged in these endless wars in that sense isn apost he keeping the campaign promise panetta well the question the president has to decide is whether he upholds his oath of office as president of united states to protect our security or whether he aposs simply going to move forward and fulfill campaign promises i think the more important responsibility is to protect this country and to protect our security and that should come first you know a lot of presidents make campaign promises but when they become president of the united states their primary responsibility is to protect our country wallace but sir let me crosstalk panetta and to do what aposs necessary crosstalk wallace let me panetta and to protect our national security wallace let me just push back on that a little bit because we aposve been afghanistan for 17 years and we aposre certainly still not winning in syria the people that are now criticizing a lot of them especially democrats are criticizing president trump for pulling out of syria are the same people who were criticizing president obama for failing to put troops in i mean you could argue that maybe this is the best option panetta well again i think the fundamental question is are we going to deal with the threats to our country nine eleven was an attack on the united states of america we lost 3 000 people over 3 000 people that day we went to war as a result of that confronting al qaeda bin laden and now isis we have made good progress in that fight but it aposs not over and so to suddenly declare victory when we have no victory we aposve made good progress no question about it we aposve made tremendous gains but this is not a time when you aposre dealing with terrorist groups who can reorganize and threaten the security of our country this is not a time to back away from that responsibility and that i think is the message that concerns me if we aposre sending a message to isis that somehow they can come back they can be resilient they can at some point come back and attack us and have us vulnerable to another 9 11 attack that aposs unacceptable wallace let aposs talk about the shutdown you aposve worn a lot of hats during your time in washington and you were a budget director for bill clinton back in the apos90s the border wall five billion dollars for the border wall the democrats are saying well they aposve give 1 6 billion for border security president wants five billion for the border wall i mean a couple of questions here how much of this is politics how much of this is policy and when i said politics i mean policy on both sides and as someone who lives in california and knows about the difficulty of trying to control illegal immigration what aposs wrong with a border wall panetta well i aposve never quite felt that an 18th century solution applies to the 21st century in terms of building a wall i do think it aposs important to have strong border security i do think it aposs important to develop in many ways the technology and the other steps necessary to create what there should be a virtual wall but the idea of spending five billion dollars to build a wall when as we know any wall is vulnerable to the highest ladder that goes over that wall it aposs just politics i realize he made a promise on this but what aposs playing out now in washington is a political confrontation between the president and the democrats and the american people are paying the price for that i mean there are innocent people now as a result of the shutdown who are being hurt innocent men women children families at christmastime why take it out them the challenge for the president and the leadership and the congress on both sides of the aisle is to sit down and resolve these issues and to deal with it and yes you know i understand the different positions but what aposs missing in all of this is a comprehensive approach to immigration that aposs what aposs needed that aposs what aposs always been needed you can apost just solve this problem with a wall you have to deal with every element that is broken now in our immigration system wallace finally sir and i aposve got less than a minute left i know that you have a lot of disagreements on policy and probably on behavior conduct with this president but after this week and what you aposve seen whether it aposs the shutdown or the abrupt 180 degree turns on syria and afghanistan do you have any doubts about donald trump aposs fitness to be president panetta you know chris i believe deeply in the office of the presidency and regardless of who aposs president i want that president to succeed because if that president does not succeed the country pays the price so what i would like to do is to see president trump recognize the chaos and crisis that we aposre in right now this period of tremendous instability that is hurting the country in terms of our security and our economy and take steps appoint a strong chief of staff and not just an acting chief of staff appoint a strong secretary of defense wallace right panetta abide by the policy making process that is important to the white house do what is necessary to be a strong president of the united states that aposs what i want him to do wallace secretary panetta thank you thanks for sharing your weekend with us and sir to you and to your family merry christmas panetta and a merry christmas to you chris and to all of your viewers wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss one of the wildest weeks of the trump presidency plus what would you like to ask the panel about what the resignation of defense secretary mattis means for the trump white house just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up the shutdown is just part of the story in washiongon schumer president trump is plunging the country into chaos pelosi government must work even if you aposre golfing for two weeks end video clip wallace we aposll ask your sunday panel about the president aposs damaged relations with democrats and his own party commercial break begin video clip trump let aposs get out let aposs work together let aposs be bipartisan and let aposs get it done them schumer this may have been the most chaotic week of what aposs undoubtedly the most chaotic presidency ever in the history of the united states end video clip wallace well president trump and the senate democratic leader chuck schumer striking very different notes about the events this week in washington and its time now for our sunday group katie pavlich from townhall com mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service susan page of usa today and fox news correspondent gillian turner katie i aposm going to start with the same question that i asked leon panetta how much trouble is the trump presidency in right now katie pavlich editor townhall com well i think we tend to take weeks and blow them up into the entire trump presidency now was this week a tough one for for the white house sure the president has made a number of very difficult decisions with serious risks and consequences potentially both on the government shutdown and in in syria but when it comes to blowing it out of proportion and saying that his this is going to the end he aposs not going to be re elected the government shutdown is going to affect the next election i think is overblowing it quite significantly there are serious questions for both ends of the aisle on his decision to pull out troops in syria just ten days ago brett mcgurk was saying look this is not wallace the the u s envoy that pavlich right wallace apparently president trump did not know pavlich correct but he was saying 10 12 days ago that look we have gained significant ground in syria but isis is not defeated and we need to make sure that we sustain the gains that we have made so the are not for nothing and so you aposve seen lindsey graham come out obviously talk about the consequences of this and there have been republicans who are questioning whether we need to be leaving now eventually they do you want to leave and they understand that president trump made this promise on the campaign trail but they look at history and that shows that barack obama also made a campaign promise that he was going to take troops out of iraq which of course let us to this point now and so wallace and of course and of course president trump hammered obama for doing exactly that pavlich right wallace let me switch to mo there have been a lot as as katie points out a lot of disruptive weeks in his presidency and you heard acting chief of staff mick mulvaney just say that aposs why people elected him to be a disruptor so why or maybe you don apost believe it is is this week different mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public service because we aposre actually seeing what what the trump brand of disruption actually means and i think for a lot of people it aposs it aposs disconcerting at best i mean we aposre seen it both on the national security front with general mattis his departure mcgurk aposs departure and a pretty a pretty difficult decision vis a vis syria we aposre seeing it on the economy with the stock market really taking a nosedive and it aposs not just this week that that aposs been happening there aposs been a negative trend there which is conversed to what aposs happening in china and that all began with his trade war so we aposre beginning to see some of the impact of chaos and it aposs it aposs it aposs disconcerting look i agree with katie that we do have a tendency to take a look at a week take a look at a snapshot in time and try to extrapolate what it means and we should caution against that the problem is every week is chaotic and every week feels disconcerting this one particularly bad but but that cumulation is going to is having a real impact on both politics and policy wallace we have had other shutdowns and we aposve had other bad weeks or even bad months in the stock market but what clearly set this week apart and sets a lot of people here in washington aposs teeth to rattling was the sudden abrupt shift on pulling troops out of syria drawing down in afghanistan and that led to the resignation of first secretary mattis and then now the special envoy brett mcgurk we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of mattis quitting we got this tweet from troy carline no current military officers with mattis apos experience will be aligned with a nationalist america first president so where does trump go to find a replacement gillian as a former staffer on the nsc for both bush 43 and for obama and how do you answer troy gillian turner correspondent well there is an option already on the table in place ready to go and that aposs patrick shanahan who is mattis apos current deputy he aposs somebody who aposs been tightly aligned with president trump on most military matters he views he aposs a business guy like the president he views his mission as filling the president aposs vision he supported the space force which most folks at the pentagon top military brass did not support so there will be a secretary of defense there aposs not going to be a crisis of no leadership at the pentagon the question is is he going to find a republican that is going to get in line with his agenda because the drawdowns he aposs been talking about lately sound more like they aposre coming from joe biden you know drawing down from afghanistan and syria all in one go wallace let aposs pick up on this issue of republicans because the other thing that set this week apart was this was the week when a lot of congressional republicans sharply and publicly broke with the president whether it was on precipitating the shutdown and especially over pulling troops out of war zones here is republican senator lindsey graham begin video clip sen lindsey graham r s c in this war you will not win it by quit by giving up if this an akin to surrendering end video clip wallace susan how much trouble do you think the president is in right now with clearly he satisfied some republicans with his decision to shut down but that also ticked off a lot of republicans who felt that they had gotten an assurance from mike pence that he was going to sign the clean cr just to kick it down till february how much trouble do you think the president is in with congressional republicans susan page usa today you know he aposs pretty isolated and you can see by the members of congress he invited to have lunch with him yesterday to talk about the shutdown not only no democrats the congressional republican leadership wasn apost there it was really the most conservative forces in the republican party and congress who met with him and i think that contributes to the sense of isolation i think one of the things that concerns people watching the president and not just people who wish him ill is that he seems isolated both in who he aposs talking to who he aposs listening to and the policies that he aposs pursuing and one big problem the president has his two big safety nets for the past two years seem about to go away one has been the good economy and the second has been republican control of congress wallace let me just pick up on that katie we got about a minute left because the president reportedly agreed to what was going to be a clean cr we aposre just going to fund this until february 8th and and mike pence the vice president told republican senators that and and you got john cornyn the number two republicans senator who said he aposs going to sign the cr and then he took this huge deluge of criticism from rush limbaugh and other talk radio hosts and also from the house freedom caucus that move was that basically about i aposm going to shore up my core base here pavlich well they aposre i don apost think it aposs only that democrats were also saying that they were getting a lot out of the president in this deal that they never thought that they could president trump in march was promised that this border wall funding would then be available at the end of the year and here we are now and he can apost even get 5 billion after he aposd been promised that he would never have to sign something again without it and the point is wallace i aposm talking about the shift though and we aposve got like 30 second pavlich right but but to have the wallace but the shift from where he was early in the week ph pavlich if anybody is if anybody is surprised that donald trump changed his mind at the last minute you haven apost been paying attention to how he operates and when it comes to leverage he aposs obviously using the government shutdown as leverage at a last minute when he knows he aposs if he doesn apost get the border wall funding now it aposs certainly not going to happen when there aposs a democratic house because they can apost even negotiate with nancy pelosi and chuck schumer at this point in time to get 5 billion of fencing which they voted for before wallace all right well the bad news is we aposve got to end this panel the good news is that we aposll probably still be talking about the shutdown next sunday thank you panel see you next sunday have a merry christmas all of you pavlich you too wallace up next outgoing ohio republican governor john kasich on his political future will he take on president trump in 2020 commercial break wallace the fallout from the midterm elections will hit washington in the new year as democrats take control of the house and within weeks we aposll be into the presidential campaign with democratic candidates starting to announce but how certain is it president trump will be the republican nominee joining me now ohio aposs outgoing republican governor john kasich a trump critic whose name has come up as a potential challenger in 2020 governor welcome back to fox news sunday gov john kasich r oh thank you chris wallace so you aposve heard what we aposve been talking about this hour the shutdown the markets resignation over the president aposs foreign policy shifts what do you make of those situations in washington right now kasich well chris it aposs so much dysfunction you know and i i was just saying to one of the people with me this morning as governor you know what if my communications director my half of my cabinet start or even significant numbers of my cabinet started to leave it would create great chaos we would have great difficulty getting anything done and it would communicate chaos throughout the state and in the legislature whatever so it aposs it aposs it aposs very disturbing and you know the the implications of what all this means long term for our foreign policy for our domestic agendas is really up in the air it aposs it concerns me a great deal wallace but president trump campaigned on building a wall he campaigned he promised the american people that he was not going to keep troops in fact he was going to pull them out of endless wars like afghanistan isn apost he doing what he told the american people he would do kasich well chris as you know a president just can apost get everything they want any more than a governor can get what he or she wants and the fact of the matter is i don apost understand why he didn apost make a deal in other words give me a couple billion for the wall which was more than you know than they had previously been agreed to and in exchange for that we we allow the daca people to stay and the people who didn apost come here any other way but on their own to be able to stay in america and not be given the threat of being deported that aposs a deal that maybe they could get that he would get and i don apost know why he hasn apost done that that makes an awful lot of sense to me in terms of syria and troops i think what everybody is objecting to is the precipitous nature not informing your allies not talking to the people who critically we need in this world and but let aposs also face in syria the fact that that whole operation has been a mistake for many years the obama administration ignoring the redline was a disaster we aposve lost influence in syria but the precipitous nature of that withdrawal without finally defeating isis or making sure they can apost reformulate is a terrible mistake wallace all right let aposs get to the main course here there aposs a lot of speculation on whether or not you aposre going to take on president trump in 2020 and here aposs what the president had to say about that begin video clip unidentified female i aposm going to bring up john kasich and i aposm going to bring up arizona senator jeff flake because they say they may run against you in 2020 trump i hope so unidentified female what do you say to a kasich or a flake trump i think we ph have the greatest base in the history of politics end video clip wallace so will you run against president trump either as a republican in the primaries or as an independent kasich chris as you know all options are on the table and we look every day i have a team of people who look every day at the factors that go into a consideration like that and i you know we access it and at some point i will make a decision and i aposll give folks full disclosure about how i arrived at a decision and what it is but at this point again all options are on the table i want to finish my job as governor i only have a few weeks left and and then we aposll see what develops you know in terms of the politics and our nation look what i aposm most considered about chris is is having a voice you know when you look at secretary mattis apos letter i have been saying this now for almost two years you can apost ignore your allies you can apost just do things on your own america first i aposve been saying for two years that it doesn apost make any sense to just engage in trade wars particularly with our friends i mean a lot of the things you aposre beginning to hear from other republicans now are things that i aposve been saying for almost two years and what i aposm really concerned about is the division in this country i don apost like that i know people have very serious problems i grew up in a neighborhood where i understand the problems of people who have been left behind but you can either tell them that they aposre the victim of somebody else or you can tell them yes you have a problem and we can fix it let aposs think about ohio for a second you know the republicans lost in illinois they lost in wisconsin they lost in michigan and pennsylvania and they won everything in ohio because we aposve had a program of hopefulness up jobs including people who have traditionally been ignored that aposs the road map and so i aposm positive about the fact that we can help people including the people that live in lordstown where gm announces a plant closure i give them i try to give them the hope that we can see a better tomorrow wallace all right we aposre we aposve got we aposve got a couple of minutes left kasich yes wallace and i want to do like a lightning round kasich sure wallace would it be fair to say that the idea of running for president is under active consideration kasich yes wallace you can go on a little longer than that so active kasich oh well look we we just have to access it and whether my voice can help this country and like i say all options are on the table but i aposm a republican i aposm proud to be a republican i aposm concerned about my party they got smashed in the midterms because i think they moved away from the road map that my team created here in ohio wallace ok kasich so yes we are actively thinking about it but i can apost tell you when exactly we aposll make a decision but we aposll let you know wallace will it be would you run as a republican or might you run as an independent kasich if all options are on the table chris that means they aposre all on the table and we just have to see the development here that aposs that aposs the only thing i can tell you at this point i aposm not trying to be coy we are seriously looking at it my folks talk and meet every week about it the people that are involved with me politically and you know at the end i aposll make a decision wallace do you think that you could possibly beat donald trump in republican primaries he aposs got tremendous approval among people in his own party kasich yes well chris look one thing that we know from your panel is every week it aposs a new story we don apost know what things are going to look like in the next month or the next two months or the next six months we just don apost know how that aposs all going to work so the way we might look at it today is well frankly you can apost look at it today you aposve got to think about what it aposs going to look like somewhere down the road wallace well you say down the road and that aposs my last question in this area which is is there a drop dead date that you feel you have to make a decision kasich no we don apost feel we don apost feel that there is one we aposve we have to see with the circumstances are and again it aposs about my being able to have a positive impact if i assess that i would have a significant positive impact in helping the country that aposs one thing if i assess it and think well maybe i won apost then then it leads to another decision but it aposs way off at this point we don apost know wallace ok kasich ok wallace less than a minute less than a minute left and right now you aposre in a veto fight with your own republican legislature you vetoed a bill that would aposve allowed abortions when people can hear a fetal heartbeat you also vetoed a bill that would have given gun owners more rights which raises i think the bigger concern about you politically which is are you too moderate for today aposs republican party kasich well look first of all i aposve signed a lot of pro life legislation in this state so that aposs a fact number and i don apost want to see pass something that i think would probably be ruled unconstitutional secondly i aposm for the second amendment but let me tell you this chris if you see somebody who aposs unstable in your business or your family and you think they pose a threat to people around you wallace right kasich and you can go to court then i think their guns should be taken that is not against the second amendment that aposs common sense and i can apost get that done and i aposm not signing anything else until i can get that done wallace governor kasich got to leave it there thank you kasich thanks merry christmas wallace thank you sir kasich happy holiday see you soon wallace you took it all away for me thank you same to you and your family kasich all right sir inaudible up next our power player of the week honoring america aposs veterans this holiday season plus another visit from the wallace grandkids commercial break wallace it aposs a christmas tradition here to share the story of how one family has found a way to express the meaning of the holiday season it aposs a moving example of love for our country and personal generosity once again here is our power player of the week begin videotape morrill worcester founder wreaths across america we wouldn apost have the opportunities if it wasn apost for the people that fought for us and how gave their lives for us wallace it aposs that plainspoken wisdom that has driven morrill worcester for years on a mission that has touched americans heart each december worcester places wreaths at arlington national cemetery and thousands of volunteers are there to help him worcester i think a lot of people think like i do and they just want to you know they appreciate the veterans and they want to show it wallace this story begins back in 1962 when worcester then a 12 year old paperboy from maine won a trip to washington what impressed him most was arlington it aposs beauty and dignity and those rows and rows and graves worcester everyone represents a life and a family and a story they aposre not just tombstones i mean those are all people wallace thirty years later in 1992 worcester was running his own wreath company in harrington maine but as christmas approached he had a bunch left over worcester these wreathes were real fresh and right just made and i just didn apost want to throw them away wallace he thought of arlington and all those graves when the cemetery approved he and a dozen volunteers drove the wreaths down and laid them on the headstones and so it continued for years until a few christmases back when an air force sergeant took this picture which ended up on the internet worcester it kind of struck a nerve and people e mailed it to each other and it really went around the world wallace we were there the next year as he and his workers at the worcester wreath company loaded up 5 265 wreathes then they embark on what worcester calls the world aposs longest veteran aposs parade a 750 mile journey that at some points attracted more than 100 vehicles and when they got to arlington so many people wanted to participate unidentified male the ceremony you are about to witness is an army wreath laying ceremony to be conducted for the worcester wreath company wallace for years worcester paid for all of the out of his own pocket and he started wreaths across america sending hundreds to cemeteries and war memorials around the country but he will need help to reach his new goal worcester i think around 2 7 million graves and that aposs a tall order to decorate 2 7 million graves so wallace on camera but you aposd like to do it wouldn apost you worcester i really would yes sometime i don apost know how but hey you know wallace how long are you going to keep doing this worcester i aposm going to keep doing it for as long as i work and then i know my family is going to continue so it aposll be here for a long time end videotape wallace this is the 27th year morrill worcester has taken on his christmas wreath project this month volunteers placed 1 8 million wreaths on veteran aposs graves at over 1 600 locations in all 50 states including in the rain and cold at arlington and for the first time they placed american made wreaths at the american cemetery in normandy france and now another christmas tradition here aposs a look from the last few years at the wallace grandkids as they keep getting bigger and bigger and here they are again but something feels different this
