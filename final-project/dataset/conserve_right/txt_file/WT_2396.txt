apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic hunter biden said in a new interview he regrets that his position on the board of a ukrainian energy company has created political fallout his father is now dealing with on the presidential campaign trail but he insisted he didn t do anything unethical in accepting the lucrative post in his first public comments on the issue the younger mr biden defended his past 600 000 a year job on the board of burisma holdings and said he didn t make one cent from a separate deal with a chinese backed company president trump and republicans have hammered former vice president joseph r biden for weeks about hunter s apparent sweetheart deals in foreign countries while his father was in the white house top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches did i make a mistake well maybe in the grand scheme of things yeah but did i make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse absolutely not hunter biden told abc in an interview that aired tuesday still he acknowledged that his name and his father s political clout landed him the job i think it is impossible for me to be on any of the boards without saying i m the son of the vice president of the united states he said the elder mr biden a leading contender for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination also has denied wrongdoing at tuesday s democratic presidential debate the candidate defended his son and said the focus should be on mr trump s corruption my son did nothing wrong i did nothing wrong mr biden said i did my job hunter biden said in the interview that he doesn t regret serving on the board of burisma holdings a position he obtained while his father was the point man for obama administration efforts in ukraine what i regret is not taking into account that there would be a rudy giuliani and a president of the united states that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea he said the elder mr biden bragged last year about threatening to withhold 1 billion in u s loan guarantees from ukraine if its leaders did not get rid of a top prosecutor in the country who reportedly was eyeing corruption in the country including at burisma i carried out the policy of the united states government in rooting out corruption in ukraine and that s what we should be focusing on he said at tuesday s debate the former vice president and his son also made a trip together to china aboard air force two in 2013 which preceded a 1 billion deal hunter biden s firm struck with a chinese bank that later expanded to 1 5 billion according to author peter schweizer s recent book secret empires mr trump mr giuliani who is the president s personal attorney and other republicans have attacked the sweetheart setups as products of nepotism and corruption he reaffirmed his commitment that he would not serve on the boards of foreign companies or entities if his father is elected president after he had announced through his attorney this week that he would step down from the board of bhr the chinese backed firm by november hunter biden said he has not received one cent from the china deal though he does still hold a 10 stake in the company according to his lawyer i made a mistake in retrospect as it related to creating any perception that was wrong and so therefore i m taking it off the table and i m making that commitment hunter biden said mr trump whose own dealings with ukraine are the subject of an impeachment inquiry in congress said tuesday that hunter biden was really bad in the interview now sleepy joe has real problems reminds me of crooked hillary and her 33 000 deleted emails not recoverable the president tweeted mr trump s reelection campaign said the interview failed to clear the air and raised more questions hunter biden admitted he wouldn t have gotten his sweetheart gigs if his dad weren t joe biden so the question remains what did his employers and investors think they were getting for their money said tim murtaugh communications director for the trump campaign if there was nothing wrong with it why does he have to promise not to do it again the timing of the interview which aired hours before tuesday s democratic debate raised questions about the biden campaign s judgment analysts said they just didn t anticipate they were slow on the uptake said ross baker a distinguished professor of political science at rutgers university new brunswick it really does bring up a subject about how you can prosper by simply having the right last name mr baker said it s just in the nature of suspicions that people in power just have the ability to do things for family members some of the points the younger mr biden made in the interview didn t pass the smell test including that he had only a passing conversation with his father on the ukraine issue said richard vatz a professor of rhetoric and communication at towson university in maryland biden apparently via his resignation recognizes that he received a sweetheart deal because of his father mr vatz said his claim that he never talked to his father about his ukraine business dealings defies credibility democratic strategist brad bannon said he s a bit surprised hunter biden waited so long to handle the issue given the relentless gop attacks it probably would have made more sense to deal with it this way when it first came out as opposed to waiting a week mr bannon said but mr bannon predicted the situation will boost mr biden in the end because the impeachment inquiry is examining mr trump s asking ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to dig up dirt on the bidens it gets people thinking about ukraine and i think that trump s likely to suffer more from the zelensky call than biden is from the deb
