r persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion donald trump has been saying things about himself and others lately that are untrue suggesting that he has a tendency to make up his own reality as he goes along in an interview with cnn s john king mr trump cited a cnn poll that he said showed him statistically tied with president obama that he has been a loyal republican for a long while and that the united states gets no oil from libya while china is libya s biggest customer let s take these one at a time top

that trump was mocked for mentioning cnn denies that it has ever conducted a head to head poll between mr obama and mr trump though other polls showed him trailing the president by double digits a more recent nationwide gallup poll found that more than six in 10 registered voters 64 percent said they definitely would not vote for mr trump in 2012 forty six percent said that about mr obama a mere 7 percent said they would definitely vote for the real estate magnate versus 31 percent who said that about mr obama mr king challenged mr trump s statement but mr trump stuck to his claim that cnn said he was tied with mr obama saying yes you have i think you re wrong we also rechecked with our polling department and our polling director specifically mr king said on cnn the trump people never got back to us and this is why we re positive positive cnn never conducted such a poll mr trump s claim to have been a very strong republican for a long while is open to substantial doubt too in the last decade he was a registered democrat between 2001 to 2008 according to ace washington post fact checker glenn kessler moreover he did not vote in primary contests for more than two decades according to a search of his voting record by ny1 a new york news channel in the 2008 presidential election mr trump said he supported barack obama adding that he has a chance to go down as the greatest president what does that tell you about mr trump s political judgement deeper doubts are raised about his claims of party loyalty when you look at the long list of liberal democrats mr trump has supported financially from senate democratic leader harry reid of nevada to former obama chief of staff rahm emanuel who got a whopping 50 000 to bankroll his successful run for mayor of chicago a majority of the candidates who benefited from mr trump s deep pockets 54 percent of them were democrats and far left ones at that including then sen hillary rodham clinton of new york sen john f kerry of massachusetts rep charles rangel and sen charles e schumer of new york and the late sen edward m kennedy and then there was mr trump s claim that china is libya s biggest oil customer and that the united states gets no oil from libya in truth mr kessler found the united states does get a small share of libya s oil only 3 percent but china is far from its biggest customer the department of energy says libya s customers are italy 28 percent france 15 percent china 11 percent germany and spain 10 percent each then there were mr trump s attacks on whether mr obama was born in the united states he is claiming vindication now for elevating the issue in numerous interviews a tactic that catapulted him into the news and drew attention to his presidential ambitions clearly forcing mr obama to produce his official birth certificate this week after three years of ignoring the issue mr obama signed a letter to hawaii state officials friday requesting a copy of his official birth certificate it was delivered tuesday night but early on mr trump said he had hired investigators digging into the birther issue in hawaii and based on their reports was convinced that the birth certificate didn t exist now that mr obama has produced a copy mr trump is touting this as a big political achievement mr trump certainly forced mr obama s hand by lifting the issue beyond the second tier attention it has received but it s an issue among a relatively small segment of voters that he could have sidestepped saying that it s not among the top concerns on most voters minds but worse than his tendency to make things up is his off the cuff sometimes bombastic comments about how he would handle major issues like the budget deficit skyrocketing oil prices and blaming china for all our economic ills on libya he would go in presumably militarily and get rid of col moammar gadhafi and seize the oil fields if the saudis would pay us the 5 billion it would cost plus a cut in their oil supplies on overall oil prices he would call up arab opec leaders and tell them you ve had your fun but it s over he talks tough about going in and seizing oil fields which is a frightening prospect for a country still embroiled in two wars and now libya china is a hot button issue for candidates to demagogue when they do not have a domestic economic plan to boost growth and jobs in america china is not responsible for our weak jobless economy excessive tax levels and unprecedented 14 3 trillion debt mr obama s failed anti growth economic policies are to blame a shallow sound bite campaign that invents facts to fit his own reality threatens the arab world pushes china around and brags how easy it is to fix the fiscal mess we re in without the hint of a well thought out plan may play with some voters but this is not a presidential contender who has serious answers to the critical economic and fiscal issues we now face mr obama s birth certificate will not create a
