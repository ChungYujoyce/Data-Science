at the national summit on education reform in washington d c ap jeb bush s announcement this week that he s considering a 2016 presidential run appears to have dropped the starting gate on the gop primary with other potential republican hopefuls like kentucky sen rand paul and dr ben carson following with their own telltale moves the facebook announcement tuesday by bush a former florida governor that he is actively exploring a white house bid was followed within hours by two google ads buys from paul s leadership political action committee the first rand pac ad appeared in the search results of those who google searched bush s name the second appeared more like an attack ad considering it included the line we need leaders who will stand against common core the national school curriculum standards supported by bush but opposed by conservative minded supporters of state autonomy and less government later that night paul who says he s still a few more months away from making a 2016 decision said on fox news the kelly file that most of us believe in less federal government and more decentralized government particularly with education for jeb bush to run in the primary will be very very difficult david payne a republican strategist and a senior vice president at washington d c based vox global gave a mixed review of what he called the digital shadow boxing suggested gop 2016 hopefuls will have to do more and better facebook is a part of the established media landscape payne told foxnews com jeb bush wasn t breaking any new ground with his announcement on this platform he ll need to be a lot more innovative to get republican primary voters interested in him he also said paul s counter punch was intelligent but the expectation from the relatively tech savvy paul followers it s critical for the candidates to get smart about their balance of digital versus traditional media payne also said republicans running for president merely have to glance at the online campaign of barack obama in 2012 for the sobering reasons to significantly raise their investment in digital and social media the effort to get carson elected also got in the mix before the end of the day the national draft ben carson for president committee said it will on saturday open an office in iowa which historically holds the first caucus of the presidential election cycle then followed by the new hampshire primary we are so far ahead of the pack in iowa and new hampshire john philip sousa iv the superpac s national chairman told foxnews com on wednesday still sousa insisted that the announcement wasn t prompted by bush s big news saying his group had been looking for months for office space political strategists argue that if bush indeed triggered a starting gun it was the one that forced big donors to get their money off the sidelines particularly those waiting to see if bush new jersey gov chris christie or 2012 gop nominee mitt romney would try to become the party s establishment candidate if you re going to run go do it robert t grand an indiana based republican donor who was one of the leading donors to george w bush s 2004 campaign told the new york times i think you ve got a short period of time this announcement triggers the start still other strategists argue that bush s announcement was not a 2016 turning point in large part because he also plans to open a leadership pac which will help him travel around the county to speak but is not a full fledged campaign pac two others top 2016 gop hopefuls also appeared to use bush s announcement to draw attention to their own efforts texas gop sen ted cruz told fox news special report that bush is a good man but said he would wait until bush officially decides in the coming months before assessing his potential impact on the gop primary still the first term firebrand senator subtly staked out his turf ahead of a potential run it is not a surprise that washington fights hard against anyone trying to change the culture he said but i can tell you outside of washington people are frustrated with politicians who say one thing and do another a spokesman for florida gop sen marco rubio another potential white house candidate told reporters marco has a lot of respect for governor bush and believes he would be a formidable candidate however marco apos s decision on whether to run for president or re election will be based on where he can best achieve his agenda to restore the american dream not on who else might be running get all the stories you need to know from the most
