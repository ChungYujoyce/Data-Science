nal battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion after nearly two decades of armed conflict americans are war weary candidate donald trump saw this plainly in 2016 that s why he advocated for disengagement from afghanistan and iraq while insisting that the united states reset its relationship with allies and nations dependent on u s military forces he was correct to do so we have expended much blood and treasure in recent years many americans know a family who lost a loved one in combat or a friend or relative who lives life as an amputee the suicide rate attributed to post traumatic stress disorder ptsd serves as a grim reminder that for some war never ends it mercilessly haunts our veterans yet president trump has shown his dexterity in grasping the double edged sword that is his responsibility as commander in chief of the u s military as well as his role as presidential promise keeper once determined to withdraw u s forces quickly from iraq and afghanistan he has come to appreciate that precipitous withdrawals like the naively gormless actions of his predecessor make things worse indeed requiring the re entry or reinforcement of u s ground troops to secure victory top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick unfinished combat rarely produces an efficacious result but rather elongates the struggle likewise the president has not withdrawn from vital alliances like the north atlantic treaty organization nato or extracted u s forces from south korea standing opposite a dangerous and aggressive north korea moreover the president has done impressive work in reviving resetting and re arming the american military he has embraced peace through strength nonetheless it would be a mistake to think mr trump has abandoned his promise to disengage from endless wars or reforming alliances that take our money for granted while neglecting their own obligations reality has settled in when it comes to the maintenance of power and the necessity to finish work with certitude ask isis if mr trump has the will to keep his promises he does president trump has seen firsthand that a multi polar world is multi dangerous one need look no further than our persistent rivalries with china russia north korea and cuba along with the circumambient threat of terror that is the middle east to say nothing of newer ones like venezuela for mr trump this has been a rendezvous with reality and he has shown that he understands that his eagerness to disengage must be moderated by the will to stay engaged that reality is about to be dramatically played out with the almost certain military conflict hovering near and around iran mr trump correctly sees iran for what it is a terror state committed to nuclearization and dominance of the middle east region it is a profound threat to our most trustworthy ally in the region israel iran is also openly hostile to saudi arabia and its gulf neighbors desirous to assert influence in iraq and stubbornly rooted in syria and lebanon with pestilential militias actively sowing the seeds of violence and terror mr trump s indefatigable opposition to iran s hostile geo political designs coupled with crippling sanctions he has implemented poses an existential threat to the mullahs who rule the persian state iran is now postured to lash out as their oil revenues dry up and turn to dust recent news reports reveal the united states is positioning an aircraft carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the gulf region amid clear indications iran and its proxies may be planning an attack on our deployed forces there the president s action demonstrates that he has embraced another lesson of leadership see things as they are not as you would wish them to be armed conflict with iran looms the conditions are ripe and don t be mistaken iran has set the stage through their aggression and support of terror in the world when that conflict comes to a head and it may soon the united states must engage quickly decisively and in a manner that makes clear to the iranian people that our dispute isn t with them but with the terror mullahs who are bringing ruin on their state iranians are being deprived of peace and prosperity by the ayatollahs and their islamic revolutionary guard corps irgc satraps the latter properly categorized as a terror organization by the trump administration it s time for both to go but the iranian people not the united states must overthrow their oppressors if armed conflict is required america s role in that effort should be the use of crippling military force against strategic targets thereby setting the conditions for iranians themselves to extinguish their tormentors nation building is the iranian people s province not ours however we must never grow weary of our role in fostering the conditions for justice freedom and enduring peace as president harry s truman put it our goal must be not peace in our time but peace for all time that s a promise worth keeping too l scott lingamfelter a retired u s army colonel combat veteran and middle east foreign area officer served in the virginia general
