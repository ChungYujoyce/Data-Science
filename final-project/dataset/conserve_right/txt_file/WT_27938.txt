york times on tensions with iran june 14 what can be said with certainty about the explosions that rocked two oil tankers in the gulf of oman on thursday is that attacks on civilian targets are reprehensible iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps is a likely culprit and a video taken by a united states navy surveillance plane demands an explanation it shows what american officials say was a revolutionary guards patrol boat pulling up alongside the kokuka courageous one of the damaged tankers several hours after the initial explosion and removing a mine iranian officials denied involvement and the japanese owner of the kokuka courageous said friday that the tanker was struck by a flying projectile not a mine so there are unanswered questions about what happened not just on thursday but also last month when american officials blamed iran for similar attacks against four tankers on the same waterway which links to the persian gulf and carries almost one third of the world s petroleum the incident is the latest evidence that the united states and iran are on a collision course at a moment in which hard liners on both sides have little interest in any diplomatic off ramp after withdrawing from the 2015 agreement that restrained iran s nuclear program in fanciful pursuit of a better deal president trump embarked on a campaign of maximum pressure against tehran the united states has imposed crushing sanctions and more are planned with a goal of shutting off iran s oil exports the country s main source of revenue administration officials say this strategy is working because iranian financing for its proxy forces like hezbollah in lebanon has been reduced but iranian leaders were never going to just capitulate to american demands and they continue working to thwart american objectives in syria iraq and elsewhere across the region iran is also edging toward exceeding the limits imposed by the nuclear deal announcing plans to increase its stockpile of reactor grade nuclear fuel and it may well be that the revolutionary guards corps which wields important military and economic clout in iran and has often been at odds with the country s more pragmatic political leadership intends to safeguard its own interests by threatening the oil transport on which the world s economy depends iranians understand how damaging a conflict with the united states could be but officials have long signaled that if they cannot export their oil and maintain their economy no gulf state will be allowed to do so the trump administration s lack of a coherent strategy for dealing with iran has resulted in a series of conflicting messages all of which contribute to a growing sense of foreboding and unpredictability while the president has said he wants to extricate america from foreign wars he also ordered a carrier group into the persian gulf last month and he has sometimes raised the possibility of military action mr trump continues to rely for advice on leading hawks the national security adviser john bolton and secretary of state mike pompeo who on thursday went beyond the tanker incidents to accuse iran of several other attacks without offering proof at the same time mr trump has dangled the possibility of talks with the iranians and however inept his international deal making has previously proved to be that approach is far preferable to the escalation apparently favored by some of his advisers but he seems to be backing away from that course it is too soon to even think about making a deal he wrote in a tweet on thursday iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei was if anything more adamant about not even talking when prime minister shinzo abe of japan who was visiting tehran when the tankers were attacked presented a message from mr trump the ayatollah according to iranian state media responded i do not see trump as worthy of any message exchange and i do not have any reply for him now or in future it may be too soon for a deal but it is not too soon to chart a course out of this turbulence once american and allied intelligence agencies thoroughly investigate the tanker attacks the data should be presented to the united nations security council it may be necessary for the united states and its partners to reflag and escort oil tankers in the persian gulf as happened in 1987 and 1988 during the iran iraq war dialogue between the trump administration and iranian government would be wise though iran may prove unwilling to talk unless sanctions are eased and the united states rejoins the nuclear deal meanwhile attacks against civilian shipping in one of the world s most vital international waterways which sent crude oil prices up more than 3 percent on thursday have to stop every new provocation will make it harder to avoid a new regional cataclysm online https nyti ms 2iloueg the auburn citizen on ethics oversight in new york june 13 we support the growing chorus of voices calling for a complete overhaul of ethics oversight in new york and we urge the legislature to approve amending to the state constitution to make it happen the joint commission on public ethics established in 2011 to investigate ethical misconduct has never been able to achieve the results new yorkers deserve and it could never be fully trusted to do so anyway because its members are all political appointees the agency s commissioners are appointed by the assembly senate and the governor and each of the three executive directors the agency has had so far have had close ties with gov andrew cuomo the agency s current director recently announced that he would be stepping down this month and a number of reform groups this week urged jcope to hold an independent search for a replacement that will be independent in both reality and appearance the next executive director the groups argue should have no close connections with government or lobbying and not be chosen from among current members of jcope or the legislative ethics commission reinvent albany citizens union the new york city bar association and other groups surveyed other states and reported last month that new york s public accountability is among the very weakest in the nation they have called on cuomo and legislative leaders to create an independently appointed commission to replace jcope and the legislative ethics commission though a constitutional amendment amending the constitution can t be done overnight and that s one good reason to start the process as quickly as possible jcope has been operating ineffectually for more than eight years it s past due time for a public integrity agency in new york that operates with independence and transparency in the meantime we see an open and independent executive director search as a good short term step the long term solution is a totally revamped ethics oversight system online https bit ly 2fjaecc the plattsburgh press republican on national unity june 19 some people love president trump others hate him that has been true to varying degrees of every president with the possible exception of george washington unfortunately for the sake of the unity of our country the traits and habits that the haters hate most seem to be the ones the lovers are most proud of again unfortunately one of the primary duties of the president is to unify the nation to help us all overlook what we perceive as a failing here a weakness there and to meld our individual opinions into one big stew of national determination that is almost surely the one duty president trump can t seem to embrace to the unrelenting despair of most according to the polls of his constituents he d rather be right than president or rather be president than right compounding this personal peccadillo in his own character and personality are political opponents schumer and pelosi who have taken the bait along with certain members of the national media who continue to dig away at the national divide by furiously arguing for their side which only fortifies the wall between us it s no wonder average citizens avoid talking politics these days to someone whose views they don t know it might ignite a ferocious debate or even violence the reaction to the robert mueller report was a classic example of how rather than trying to find common ground with each other people tended to read into it something that satisfied a need to prove dissenters wrong the republicans pounced on the fact that the report cited no direct culpability of trump for collusion or obstruction the democrats rejoiced that it specified that if the investigation had found him not complicit in these transgressions it would have said so trump undeniably set the tone for this kind of discord himself by insisting he was in every instance right about everything and refusing to give credit to anyone who ever disagreed with him we have all been infected with at least a touch of that quality and the president doesn t civilly disagree he is hostile his tweets are bitter rebukes rather than encouragements for greater understanding he gives the impression of being more sympathetic and engaging toward america s most dangerous enemies than toward any countryman who dares to criticize him clearly something needs to be done to change our own individual and collective tone we would encourage our congresswoman republican elise stefanik to try to express this notion to her peers in congress and the president himself instead all we can ask is that each of us avoid the name calling trump the other day called potential presidential opponent joe biden a dummy and insulting attitudes ourselves in hopes that a ground up cleansing will wash over washington but we acknowledge it s doubtful online https bit ly 31fuaue the middletown times herald record on allowing undocumented immigrants to get drivers licenses june 18 by becoming the 13th state to allow undocumented immigrants the right to get a driver s license new york has improved safety on the roads that is important to keep in mind because the aftermath of this contentious decision is likely to be as divisive as was the debate that came before the close vote in the state legislature monday night before the law was passed thousands nobody knows just how many but nobody disagrees that the number was substantial of immigrants without papers were on the roads because they had to be whether it was driving to work or taking a child to school going shopping or taking a relative to a doctor s appointment the trips were necessary and because most of the state does not have extensive mass transit most likely to be in private vehicles before the law those vehicles might or might not be inspected before the law those drivers would not have had the kind of training that we assume all people behind the wheel have would not have passed the tests we assume all have passed would not be carrying even the minimum insurance that we assume all have this legislation makes our roads safer even those who voted in opposition and those who still believe that this was the wrong decision will be hard pressed to dispute that but they do have other complaints ones that we need to take seriously and act on they have to do with the broader question of citizenship and immigration the long held belief that we have failed to tackle the root cause of a dilemma in which a license to drive was only one detail so who are these people who will now be on the roads legally some findings from the pew research center analysis of government documents last week show the changing nature of illegal immigration and indicate what needs to be done at the peak there were 12 2 million undocumented immigrants in 2007 and that declined to 10 5 million in 2017 mostly because of a decline in migrants from mexico the big change the one that should be driving public policy shows up in another figure whereas the undocumented population in 2007 was evenly split between newcomers and those who had been here more than 10 years that is no longer the case newcomers make up only 20 percent of that population while those who have been here 10 years or longer make up more than 66 percent they are people who live in our neighborhoods whose children go to school with ours who work in our communities and who have done so for decades while struggling to get around now they can get a license drive a car get insurance all while they wait for congress to do what those on both sides of this issue want pass comprehensive immigration reform if congress had made the move it was so close to making a few years ago and passed a package of comprehensive immigration legislation many of those who have lived here for years even decades without documentation would be able to start an
