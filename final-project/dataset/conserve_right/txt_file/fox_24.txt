mexican immigrants calls on congress to protect the dreamers as a federal judge blocked the administration aposs rollback of daca it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive plus the president imposes new sanctions on iran but decides not to blow up the nuclear deal for now we ll ask our sunday panel what happens next in u s relations with iran and our power player of the week which is tougher politics or football unidentified male i was born to play football and now be having a transition from the field to the hill wallace how an nfl star wound up working for the speaker of the house all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington on this martin luther king holiday weekend the nation aposs capital is still reeling from president trump aposs incendiary remarks about immigrants from africa and haiti his comments have reignited the debate of whether the president is a racist and they have also derailed progress on a bipartisan deal on immigration a setback that could lead to a government shutdown midnight friday joining me now for an exclusive interview the new secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen welcome to fox news sunday kirstjen nielsen homeland security secretary thank you my pleasure wallace before we get to immigration let aposs discuss that false alarm in hawaii yesterday just after 8 00 yesterday morning people across the state got this alert ballistic missile threat inbound to hawaii seek immediate shelter this is not a drill people were understandably terrified for 38 minutes before they got the all clear now it turns out it was a state official who hit the wrong button but as the head of federal dhs what have you learned about the state of emergency preparedness in that state and across the country nielsen you know i think this is a very important topic and i just want to encourage everyone first and foremost not to draw the wrong conclusion so i would hate for anybody not to abide by alert warnings coming from government systems they can trust government systems we test them every day this is a very unfortunate mistake but these alerts are vital seconds and minutes can save lives so first i would encourage everyone not to draw the wrong conclusions secondly from a dhs perspective we are looking with state and locals to ensure not only that the messaging is clear but what to do next is clear as well how we can best support them and work with them as you know they are on the first lines and they are the first responders unfortunate situation but we are all working together to make sure it doesn apost happen again wallace but you know this raises questions not only about emergency alerts and as you say generally we can we can trust him it also raises questions about civil defense you know i remember as a kid in the apos50s we d all gone ph to public school we d get under desk and repair for the nuclear attack when looking back on it it aposs laughable we don apost have bomb shelters today we did not have that kind of civil defense god forbid if this were a real attack if the north koreans or somebody else had fired a missile over the horizon at an american city what should folks on the ground do nielsen it s a good it aposs a good question of course it depends on where you are and what the particular type of threat is so in this case citizens who are in that could be affected should look at any guidance and advice that comes out from the government fema has a whole variety of measures and preparedness of things they can do sometimes it aposs shelter in place sometimes as you saw in hawaii if you are in a car they asked you to get out of the car and lay flat on the ground so it just depends but the government has provided tremendous amounts of information we should all seek it out and make sure we know what we need to do as citizens wallace is it true that the trump administration has not conducted a full scale exercise to plan for this kind of an event and if so how soon are you going to order a full scale exercise among all the principals and the government nielsen so when we look at response we all act under something called the national response framework we test that very frequently we use different scenarios we did have what aposs called a deputies committee so that aposs the deputy secretaries of the department exercised in december specific to this threat and we had already planned to have that principal cabinet level exercise if you will early next month we will continue on that but the national exercise program is very robust as well as it should be we need to both provide action after a real event and of course prepare for events unfortunately might befall us wallace let aposs turn to that meeting at the president held with a half dozen members of congress on thursday they were discussing immigration from africa and according to democratic senator dick durbin the president said this begin video clip sen dick durbin d illinois that s when he used these vile and vulgar comments calling the nations they come from expletive deleted holes the exact words used by the president not more not just once but repeatedly end video clip wallace secretary you were in that meeting in the oval office did the president say that nielsen i don apost recall him saying that exact phrase i think he has been clear and i would certainly say undoubtedly the president will use continue to use strong language when it comes to this issue he feels very passionate about it i think what was frustrating about that meeting for all of us in the meeting was that although the deal presented in theory and approach to the four pillars upon which we had agreed did not address the core security issues that we need to do our job and more importantly there aposs nothing in there that would prevent us from getting here again so we re not interested in half measures we don apost want additional temporary populations here it aposs unfair to them it aposs unfair to american citizens and it certainly raises security risks wallace i don t understand i m just going to press back on you once on this subject it seems to me you were in the meeting when these comments were made i can understand you either saying they were sad or they were not said it is pretty shocking language and to say i don apost recall seems implausible if the president of the united states use the word blank hole talking about countries in the oval office or didn apost say it i would know nielsen i understand the question it was an impassioned conversation i don apost recall that specific phrase being used that aposs all i can say about that wallace there are several things about the president aposs comments alleged comments and are both republicans and democrats who confirm that he sent it one is the president seems to be writing off people who come from black countries while he saying we should take people coming from one of the whitest countries on earth norway here was a comment from an official at the u n commission on human rights begin video clip rupert colville u n high commissioner for human rights spokesman i m sorry but there aposs no other word one can use but racist you cannot dismiss entire countries and continents as of expletive deleted whose entire populations who are not white and therefore not welcome end video clip wallace isn apost that the definition of racism to say we don apost want people from these black countries but we do want people from a very white country nielsen i think what the president is saying is he d like to move to merit based which is based on an individual so whether individuals can come here and can contribute to our society help our economy assimilating communities and help america be better i take a little bit of offense to the comments and suggestions that the president is racist what he aposs looking at is the exact merit based system we have in australia and canada i m sure that we are not any of us suggesting that canada and australia and their leaders are racists wallace but the president seems in these comments to be equating merit to the countries that people come from he seems to be suggesting you d rather have a janitor from norway than a doctor from haiti nielsen i disagree i think wallace why would merit have to do with the country why would it have to do with your qualifications nielsen i think it does i think what he aposs trying to do is move away from a quota based system whether that aposs a quota of underrepresented countries or a quota of norway for example i think what he aposs trying to say is we need to look at the individual and ensure that we look at those who can bring merit to our country wallace all right let aposs turn to the practical implication of that because the big question in washington now is chances for a deal on daca the president tweeted out this morning and let aposs put it up on the screen daca is probably dead because the democrats don apost really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military one is daca dead is there a chance for it and is the president willing to see the government shutdown if democrats insist on linking a daca deal to funding for the government before it runs out of money midnight on friday nielsen i do not believe daca is dead but what i would say is for my perspective of course as the secretary of homeland security it aposs not a daca deal it aposs a security immigration deal what my role this is is to ensure that we don apost end up here again we must close these loopholes to ensure that these temporary populations not only are not encouraged to take the dangerous journey to get there but then when they get there we are able to promptly remove them so we don apost end up with the category of daca again in terms of the funding what i would say is in my opinion where i sit it aposs completely responsible to tie the two together we need to fund our troops we need to protect them we need to increase homeland security these are vital national security interest we need to fund to tie them into a daca deal or the actual expiration date is in march is irresponsible wallace so if the democrats insist on linkage and the government shuts down that aposs on them nielsen well it would be very unfortunate if they continue to do that they are not the same conversation i think you heard democratic leaders say just that in the past wallace one more daca question a federal judge this week blocked the administration decision to phase out daca and wrote of and let aposs put this on the screen a plausible inference that racial animus towards mexicans and latinos was a motivating factor in the decision to end daca your reaction to that and how quickly will the administration appeal that judge aposs decision blocking the phasing out of daca nielsen on the appeal i d refer to the attorney general we will be in close contact on that with respect to the quote i find that offensive on its face i took an oath when i became secretary of homeland security to defend and support the constitution the program was unconstitutional what we should be focused on instead of these court interventions and these distractions is that we need a permanent solution we have said that i have said that the president has said that we want to find a permanent solution to the daca population not a continual three year renewal period wallace all right in the short period of time we have left i want to ask you about some of the issues that are facing your department border apprehensions are down 40 percent in 2017 which some administration officials have called the trump effect but in december there was a significant increase as the border patrol caught more than 40 000 people attempting illegal crossings why has it gone back up nielsen it aposs a great question and i appreciate you asking because i think it aposs very important for the viewers to understand this the problem is that we have so many loopholes within our legal system based on a panoply of court decisions confusion with respect to the laws and how we can enforce them that if you are in the south or central america those who would wish to smuggle you are able to tell you if you get to america you can stay so more and more are willing to undertake the journey because there is no way for me to promptly remove them so we talk about the wall the wall is a very very important part of this it works but it only gets us partway there because if i can stop them at the border but i can apost remove them that aposs not border security and they will continue to come wallace so what some people are saying is the reason it aposs going back up is because for all the tough talk from the president people in central america smugglers and people wanting to come across they finally decided the system really hasn apost changed nielsen the system is worse every time a court makes a patchwork decision based on one individual we continue to exacerbate the systemic failure of the system my troops ph cannot remove those that they apprehend whether they are criminals in some cases or whether there are multiple repeat illegal entry we have to change these loopholes so that we can promptly remove them wallace finally this week federal agents raided 98 7 eleven stores in 17 states in the district of columbia resulting in 21 arrests will you order more raids on employers in this country and what s the message you aposre trying to send nielsen yes and the message we aposre trying to send is if you consistently and willfully disregard the laws that the congress and the american people have passed and you will be held accountable these are not accidental hiring as illegal immigrants some of these countries unfortunately have continually and systematically tried to get around the system hire illegal aliens which affects the ability of the american workers but it also continues to encourage those who might not otherwise take the journey to take the journey so we are looking to the employers to try to stop this bad behavior and hold them accountable wallace secretary nielsen thank you nielsen oh it s my pleasure wallace thanks for coming into this holiday weekend please come back nielsen i would love to wallace right nielsen thank you so much wallace up next reaction from xavier becerra who is california aposs attorney general has filed several lawsuits against the trump administration on immigration issues and just won a temporary reprieve for the dreamers that aposs next commercial break wallace just before president trump aposs shocking comments this week about immigrants from africa and haiti a federal judge in california blocked his move to end daca joining me now from sacramento xavier becerra attorney general of california and a former democratic congressional leaders who filed that lawsuit mr attorney general you just heard secretary nielsen what s your reaction to her defense of the president aposs position in that meeting with senator durbin and others this week xavier becerra d california attorney general chris i don apost know if it aposs defensible and it aposs disturbing to see so many people with such short term memory losses and the inability to recall a conversation important conversation that has taken place just a few days ago can you imagine what happens when you have a conversation about nuclear war or what we do about natural disasters and you have a room of people who can apost remember what was said just a few days ago that aposs dangerous wallace do you think president trump is a racist becerra in every respect what he is showing us is that he is a racist let me put it to you this way mental instability mendacity now bigotry having any one of those in the white house is dangerous having the combination that aposs lethal wallace what about the argument get beyond the words and i understand the words are hard to get beyond but this question of merit based immigration what about the argument that too many of our immigration programs family unification or as it aposs also called chain migration visa lotteries do more to help people from other countries than they do to attract and to bring in people to this country who can best help us becerra i can only speak to you chris from the perspective of a son of two of those immigrants and i can simply tell you that with a man who had a chance to go to the sixth grade a mother who didn apost get past 18 years of age when she finally got here both of them never having had a chance to step on a college campus they did a great job of getting four kids a college education or military service and a man who couldn apost walk into a restaurant when he was young because of the sign that said no dogs or mexicans allowed well because of his children had a chance to walk into the white house to meet the president of the united states not this one but the president of the united states so in every respect my dad a proverbial ditch digger built this country and now the results are that his grandkids are going to some of the finest colleges and universities and they are not going on any taxpayer aposs dime because their parents can afford to have them go my mom was a whiz when it came to finances and because of them today they live in retirement better than they ever lived when they were both working those are two examples of immigrants who came to this country with little and gave so much wallace let aposs talk about the situation here in washington right now because democrats are threatening to shut down the government to refuse to vote for another funding bill when the government runs out of money at midnight friday if they don apost get a deal on daca i this seems to directly contradict something that senate democratic leader chuck schumer said a few years ago when the republicans were threatening president obama take a look begin video clip sen chuck schumer d new york we believe strongly in immigration reform we can say we are shutting down the government we re not going to raise the debt ceiling until you pass immigration reform it would be governmental chaos end video clip wallace mr attorney general if it was wrong for republicans to threaten a democratic president and to threaten to hold the government hostage why is it all right for democrats to do exactly the same thing becerra chris i don apost believe democrats are doing anything to try to hold up a government funding bill they are just not agreeing with the outlines of what republicans have put forward in the republican funding bill and they are objecting to this budget because right after less than a month after passing a 1 5 trillion tax break bill which benefited mostly the super rich and corporations all of a sudden having used the government credit card to pay for that now republicans want to cut benefits for veterans for seniors for students for working class americans to pay for that tax cut wallace wait wait crosstalk becerra democrats are saying we re not going to take part in that wallace number one they haven apost called for cutting all those benefits number two that aposs not specifically the question i m asking you i m asking you specifically about the fact that democrats are saying no deal on spending i agree they have to work out the spending deal but no deal on spending and less you also pass a daca fix that aposs what some people say is holding the government hostage do you think the democrats should link funding for the government to a deal on daca becerra chris if you listen closely what democrats have been saying is that we need to have a deal on daca because president trump by trying to repeal daca has created this chaos i will tell my democratic friends the following daca is now actually alive and homeland security department is now accepting renewal applications so it aposs nowhere near dead i would hope it would not agree to any bad deals on immigration talking really bad stuff that has nothing to do with helping our borders in order to get a daca deal that daca deal should stand on its own it should be clean worrying about the budget is what republicans and the majority in the house and the senate should be doing because otherwise the government shuts down and so republicans are threatening to shut down the government unless they get a whole bunch of bad stuff on immigration and i believe democrats are saying let aposs do a clean fix on daca because it has nothing to do with the budget if we could tie it all together great but don apost try to hold young people hostage to get a budget and certainly don apost try to load up a bill with that stuff whether in the budget or on immigration crosstalk wallace let me just interrupt because i m closer to washington now than you were although you were a democratic leader here for years but no the democrats are republicans rather are not insisting on linking daca and immigration they just want to pass a funding bill and in fact they are talking about a three or four week continuing resolution let me switch to another subject because you brought up the fact that daca is alive and well now and one of the reasons it s alive and well is because you as california aposs attorney general filed a lawsuit where the judge agreed to stop the phasing out of daca by march i want to ask you about that because this it seems to me sir is not the no brainer that some people suggested president obama didn apost even create the daca act it didn apost even protect the dreamers until 2012 almost four full years into his term when he was running for reelection why doesn apost just as a matter of principle and law why doesn apost president trump have the same right to end daca and in fact he doesn apost want to end daca he just wants to be a congressional law not an executive action but why doesn apost he have the same right to move on daca that president obama did when he started four years into his term becerra chris because no person in this country even the president is above the law if he wants to take an action he must do it according to the law and as the judge held in this case the president and his administration acted arbitrarily and capriciously and so that aposs why we aposve been able to have several victories it aposs kind of poetic that the son of immigrants is the person wielding the legal slingshot against the trump administration aposs attacks on our constitutional civil rights but the reason we keep winning in fact we are batting a thousand against this administration is because the president believes he is above the law and he continues to act arbitrarily and capriciously and taking action if you want to change the law chris don apost break it wallace well i m not sure i understand how he aposs breaking it he was saying this was an executive order taken by the president it wasn apost even a law and here you had donald trump saying i am resending that executive order giving six months to do so why is that breaking the law becerra because chris you go about a process even president obama went about a process to establish an executive order you go about a process remember you have a whole bunch of people in this country when our government takes action they start to rely on the representations of our government to their detriment and so whether it aposs the consumer who decides to get health care or the consumer who decides to go send his kids to particular college it aposs based on certain representation oftentimes that the government says we will be there in this respect of health care or an education or on immigration and if you are going to try to unwind that you aposve got to do it through the right process and clearly the president has continued to be arbitrary and capricious in the way he aposs tried to undo things and that aposs why as i said before we haven apost lost a case yet against donald trump a guy who should know how to operate in the courts since he aposs been sued or sued himself thousands of times wallace all right i got one final question i got less than a minute left you have condemned the president aposs decision to remove temporary protected status from salvadorans and there are 50 000 of them living in california who have been here since the earthquakes in el salvador way back in 2001 the question i have though sir just as a kind of matter of common sense the earthquakes ended the devastation was repaired why are people still here 17 years later on temporary protected status becerra clearly things are broken both in those countries that sent a lot of those immigrants and in our own immigration system and over the course of some two decades those individuals who were the victims of that broken system on both sides have crosstalk wallace but it wasn t a political system sir it was earthquakes they came in because of a natural disaster why should they stay here there are a lot of broken countries that doesn apost mean we take them all in becerra we don t and we don t why should we take them in over an earthquake that happened 17 years ago continue to have them here becerra we don apost and chris we don t what we do is we tell the country get yourself get back on your feet we re not going to try to make things more difficult for you to get back on your feet two decades have gone by those individuals in this country have now established businesses they have gone to schools here they have families here and to all of a sudden just jerked the rug from underneath them i don apost think it aposs the american way and i do believe congress should try to resolve this because it is a program that was not meant to be permanent but congress could take action as it has in the past to address it and i think it would be only correct and right to do so because these are people who have made major investments in this country to make it better wallace attorney general becerra thank you thanks for your time it aposs always good to talk to you whether it aposs here in washington or in california becerra thanks chris wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss where congress is in talks about immigration and spending with the clock ticking down to a government shutdown midnight friday commercial break chris wallace fox anchor coming up congress continues work on an immigration bill as the clock ticks down to a government shutdown begin video clip sen chuck schumer d minority leader a resolution to the daca issue must be part of a global deal on the budget end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel if congress can get a deal done and what will happen to the dreamers next commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states when this group comes back hopefully with an agreement this group and others from the senate from the house comes back with an agreement i aposm signing it i think i will be signing it i aposm not going to say oh gee i want this or i want that end video clip wallace president trump on tuesday predicting smooth sailing for a daca deal of that televised meeting with two dozen members of congress of course all that fell apart later this week in an explosive meeting in the oval office and it aposs time now for our sunday group former press secretary to vice president pence marc lotter columnist for the hill juan williams adrienne elrod former director of strategic communications for hillary clinton aposs campaign and john bussey from the wall street journal well marc i understand the argument intellectually that we should go to a merit based system of immigration but i want to pick up on the discussion i had with secretary nielsen because what troubles a lot of people is the idea that we aposre equating country of origin with merit and and and it raises the issue what aposs better as i said a janitor from norway or a doctor or an engineer from haiti marc lotter former vp pence press secretary well i don apost think the president is talking about making any kind of geographic or quotas based on any country he aposs wallace but he did say that lotter well what he was saying is that he aposs basically saying because right now under the current system we are we are have we do have quotas we do have random lotteries where people not based on their skill just because they apply our allowed entry into our country he aposs basically saying that let aposs judge the people who want to come and move to america based on who they are not where they aposre from wallace juan i mean forgive me it doesn apost seem to me that aposs what the president said and juan williams fox news political analyst i don apost think that aposs not what the reporting indicates the reporting indicates that wallace and and then let me let me just put up first williams oh wallace before i aposll get to you in a second what house speaker paul ryan said reacting to the president aposs comments begin video clip rep paul ryan r house speaker my family like a whole lot of people came from ireland on what they called coffin ships then came here and worked the railroads the irish were really looked down upon back in those days i here all these stories from my relatives about irish need not apply end video clip wallace and that i guess is the point throughout our history people come to this country because the situation in their countries is bad and it aposs often the best and the brightest who take the initiative to take that step to sail across the atlantic ocean or fly across the atlantic ocean from a much worse situation williams correct and i think that that aposs why you know on the statue of liberty we have emblazon that phrase that american idea that we will take your people who are burdened oppressed you know people who have been left behind and judged to be inferior and we make them and i think this is what lindsey graham was saying to the president in the oval office come to america and adapt the idea of this as a place of opportunity and political freedom and stability and that aposs that aposs the american idea it aposs not based on where you come from certainly not the irish that you just heard paul ryan talk about not for italians not for jews not for catholics at one point in our history all those groups have come up against this kind of bigotry so i think for paul ryan to say this is unhelpful huh how about you know say clearly that this is racist and un american wallace i just want you to respond before i bring everybody else in lotter well again i think what we are talking about here is in the future i mean we we have a great history of immigration and no one can and no one debates that and no one and on one debates the countless contributions that have been made by immigrants and now second third multiple generations of immigrants to our country but as we are moving forward as we face challenges in terms of homeland security and as we are trying to get more people jobs in america putting american workers above the needs of other people who may not be coming in here with the skills to be able to compete there was a study that said over half of immigrant lead families are receiving some sort of welfare three quarters of those families with children are receiving some sort of welfare can we can we not look at who we are bringing in and that aposs what the president is saying not necessarily where you aposre from that aposs that aposs wallace but but he didn apost say that he did say exactly where they aposre from he didn apost say you know we need to bring in doctors and engineers we don apost need to bring in ditch diggers lotter let aposs look at the context of what that conversation was about in this in this immigration wallace i aposm not i mean it was what the language he used sir lotter well i understand but when you look at the way that the context of that conversation it was it was supposedly in a broad immigration discussion and it was also talking about tps williams what he aposs talking about is the lottery program lotter where we aposre talking about some of those williams and in the lottery system what he clearly said was why do we need people from these s hole countries because right now they aposre underrepresented and the reason the lottery exists is to make sure that there aposs more adequate representation of people who have not been coming wallace all right let me let me williams and he spoke not about the countries when saying that but about the people who would be included in the lottery that aposs why it aposs so personal to people like me wallace let me bring in adrienne this is a good moment you aposre a democratic or strategist this is a good moment for democrats a good political moment for democrats but should they actually take the final step they aposre threatening to take which is to link daca and a deal on daca to funding the government and risk a government shutdown is that smart politics adrienne elrod democratic strategist yes absolutely it is and here aposs why chris number one democrats have absolutely no control in the of the house or the senate or the white house republicans have full control right now this is the only bargaining chip that democrats have we are tired of seeing these daca recipients not have a fix we are tired of watching republicans play you know political football with their lives this is our last bargaining chip january 19th is the last train coming so look democrats have made it very clear we will compromise on daca and we will have border stronger border security we will make a compromise but we are absolutely not going to allow daca recipients any longer to live in the state of limbo wallace john john bussey the wall street journal you know something i this seems to be an issue again about messaging from the president marc aposs interpretation of his remarks is a generous one right that he aposs really talking about it being a meritocracy we we aposre going to get more physicists from norway than we are going to get from from haiti that aposs the generous interpretation the failure of the message is that it leaves open this big discussion of whether or not the president is a racist because of the language that he chose similarly coming off of that tuesday meeting which was an incredible hit for him that was a remarkable public relations success for the president looking very presidential having democrats and republicans in the room getting along civilly over disagreements that were fundamental to the two parties and then the very next day having having changed the narrative away from russia away from the fire and fury book the questioned his mental stability the very next day coming back and attacking the courts on their daca decision on saying that he aposs going to change the libel laws so that books can apost be written about him that are negative on attacking dianne feinstein that morning the day before she sat across from him at the table this is what aposs working against the president in any negotiation over daca over the spending bill over immigration in general wallace let me ask you about a different aspect of this though because the president took some heat from that big televised meeting because a lot of people in his base said he seemed too soft to open let aposs get a deal let aposs i aposll sign anything you want maybe he didn apost intend to do it quite the way that he did it but aren apost there some people in his base who are going to be reassured by the hard line he took in that oval office meeting bussey absolutely and we saw some very far right wing elements say hey we liked the language of you know s hole that you used but is that in his interest right now he aposs looking at 2018 some very dicey elections campaign coming up he it aposs in his interest to have a win on daca on the spending bill it aposs in the interest of the democrats similarly they are fairly close honestly to reaching some kind of agreement democrats have agreed to spend something on a version of a wall whatever it might be that gives the president a fig leaf some face while also getting daca advanced why not close that deal as opposed to endangerment it right before the cr expires when it aposs in the interest of the democrats to show a dysfunctional white house elrod and chris the votes are there i mean if we aposre looking at a bipartisan bill the votes are there there are enough democrats and republicans who will come together on this bill and supported a daca fix whether it aposs a clean daca fix or whether it aposs a daca fix that actually has a border security element we even have the progressive wing of the party senators like kamila harris who have said i will support a border security agreement as well or border security strengthening border security but ultimately the votes are there republicans have the task of actually putting this bill on the floor williams yes but the question is what happens when talk right wing talk radio ann coulter said it was the lowest moment of the american of trump aposs presidency this week because he engaged in that kind of talk and i think you can see this now that the far right the freedom caucus is really going to put heat on him and he says this week in the meeting john he says i aposll take the heat well mr president this is your chance because the votes are there wallace yes ok elrod yes wallace all right folks we have to take a break here when we come back president trump says he won apost re impose sanctions on iran and the nuclear deal but he gives congress and european allies a deadline of 120 days to fix the agreement plus what would you like to ask the panel about the deal should the u s stick with it or rip it up just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states in the event we are not able to reach a solution working with congress and our allies then the agreement will be terminated end video clip wallace president trump back in october reluctantly agreeing to stay in the iran nuclear deal but the white house announced friday congress and our european allies have 120 days to fix it or the u s will pull out and we aposre back now with the panel john the president is demanding two big changes to the iran nuclear deal i want to put them up on the screen first inspectors must have access to any site they want in iran and second elimination of so called sunset provisions that iran would be able to restart parts of its nuclear program in ten or 15 years is there any reason to believe that either iran or our european allies who negotiated this deal with us are going to agree to rewrite it bussey yes he wants a third thing too which is something said about their missile program containing their missile program those are three things that a lot of people can agree on that these are issues that need to be resolved before we move ahead with continuing the program as it is on the left on the right in europe and here the problem is there aposs an agreement and it aposs set and it took a long time to get to it there are six countries that are signers of that agreement not just us five others with iran that that have signed that agreement that don apost agree with the united states on reopening it france has said no germany aposs not encouraging this china and russia the united kingdom they aposre not in favor of kind of reopening this so the president may find himself on the outs with his allies and iran and this might be something like we saw with tpp where we move away from an agreement but the agreement has a life of its own there inaudible with iran we would just be on the out of that as we are with the trans pacific partnership trade deal wallace i want to pick up on that we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from michael p mulhall who incidentally we have put up questions from before so good for michael what are the possible consequences to the u s to the u s should the trump administration decertified the obama iran nuclear deal juan how do you answer michael williams well i think it aposs two levels one is i think if you decertify it makes it more likely not less likely that iran gets nukes and therefore is a greater threat to our important ally israel in the middle east the second thing to say is it signals to our allies that we are not to be trusted having signed a deal we signed that deal made a deal and america has to keep its word going forward if as we heard in the question people are asking about u s as an effective negotiator in any international arena wallace michael will have a follow up for you williams i think and i aposm looking forward to michael aposs next question wallace no i we get questions from him every week we appreciate that michael probably inaudible here on the panel there aposs another big story brewing there are reports that the president aposs legal team is negotiating with the special counsel aposs team robert mueller aposs team about terms for an interview in the russia investigation last june mr trump said that he would 100 percent be willing to answer questions but it was a different story this week take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states certainly i aposll see what happens but when they have no collusion and nobody has found any collision at any level it seems unlikely that you aposd even have an interview end video clip wallace adrienne what happens if the president decides he is not going to sit down with robert mueller and his team elrod well look he has a couple of options i mean number one and i think his attorneys would probably do this they would say maybe before we actually sit down with you for an interview mr mueller let aposs think about you know maybe a signed affidavit or answering questions in a written context but ultimately the president of the united states he owes this to the american people to explain in his own words what happened if there was really no collusion with russia then sitting down with special counsel mueller should not even be an issue with him so again he is the president of the united states he certainly has the option to plead the you know the fifth but essentially if he wants to get to the bottom of this investigation and restore any sort of public trust wallace but what would democrats do if the president pleaded the fifth elrod well i think it would be a real i think it would be a real big problem he certainly has that option i don apost think it aposs politically tenable for him to do it but he certainly has that option as any american would under our constitutional rights but ultimately if he wants to nip this in about the bud he needs to have a conversation and needs to do it in an interview format with the special counsel wallace marc do you think it aposs possible that the president will refuse to sit down for an interview with robert mueller lotter i don apost know i mean the president aposs personal layers right now are dealing with a special counsel on that they have been cooperative from the beginning they continue to be cooperative so they aposll have those discussions i mean who knows maybe they aposre asking right now if they can get the hillary clinton treatment you know on an interview with the fbi where you know you do it and then the decision aposs already been made beforehand so i don apost know what those details are but you know he aposs been very transparent there aposs still no evidence of collusion and we aposll trust the lawyers to work that out wallace adrienne which like to respond to the inaudible hillary clinton elrod no i just i just think i think from the broad context it aposs i find it so laughable that every time republicans have that this issue comes up you guys immediately pivot to you know bringing secretary clinton in to try to deflect from you know the real issue here so lotter well so far that is still the only collusion that aposs been proven elrod ok all right well that is that is your take not bussey but this is not about collusion alone elrod exactly bussey this is there aposs an obstruction of justice question that aposs outstanding and so the administration pivots to collusion when it should be answering the question is mueller wanting to talk to the president about the possibility of obstruction of justice williams yes not only that there aposs a constitutional crisis in the making here if the president refuses to talk to mueller because then you put the congress in the position of saying to the president you must comply in order to have credibility for our justice system this to be a country of laws the president as the chief law enforcement officer cannot be exempt from the laws of the united states wallace well and that raises this specific question elrod right wallace and again all of this is speculative but robert mueller could go to a court and get a subpoena williams yes wallace a court order for the president to testify i think that aposs what happened with bill clinton lotter yes i believe that aposs what i recall wallace so that aposs not politically tenable for the president to refuse to submit to a subpoena a court order lotter well and it aposs all speculation right now they aposre still talking so if he comes back with a subpoena that deal is an entirely different level then whether they aposre having voluntary conversations and back and forth in terms of what may be on the table and what parameters may be set for an interview those kinds of things but again the president aposs personal lawyers and the special counsel have been have been cooperating the entire time they continue to be cooperative and we aposll see whether how this goes out wallace john i we aposve got less than a minute left but what interests me is the fact that whatever we aposd like to move on with this president highs like the tax bill lows like the comments in the oval office this week but but the russian investigation both possible collusion obstruction of justice continues to cast a shadow over this presidency bussey yes it does and that aposs what this is about that aposs what all of the tangling with lawyers is about that aposs what the constant iteration that there aposs no collusion is about it aposs the feeling that this russia investigation is expanding is possibly getting closer to the trump organization or the trump family or perhaps the president himself we just don apost know yet there are a lot of outstanding you know questions that haven apost been resolved and so it aposs the big play it is the big issue along with 2018 wallace all right panel and 2018 that aposs another big subject too we aposll talk about that thank you see you next sunday up next our power player of the week from hard hits on the field to heavy lifting on the hill we aposll follow a pro football player aposs journey to house speaker paul ryan aposs office commercial break wallace eight years ago i was at the headquarters for the washington redskins to do a profile of the team aposs new head coach one of the players walking off the practice field said he watched this program every week who was that political junkie here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape derrick dockery business coalitions director for speaker ryan what i do on a daily basis i basically block and tackle it aposs my job to build key alliances to help move the speaker aposs agenda forward wallace derrick dockery has been a staffer for house speaker paul ryan for the last two years working on everything from the tax bill to school choice but when he uses football analogies it aposs not just talk dockery was an offensive lineman in the nfl for ten years wallace on camera which is tougher politics or football dockery i was born to play football and now i aposve been having to transition from the field to the hill obviously it was a tough transition but with the help of a great team around me it aposs easy now wallace voice over dockery says he didn apost care about politics until two of his fellow lineman on the buffalo bills pulled him into their discussions dockery well every day they would bring in the wall street journal the new york times we aposd talk taxes religion national security wallace the turning point dockery one day i looked at my paycheck and i began to think about taxes i was like man i pay a lot of taxes wallace during two stents on the washington redskins dockery made some contacts which led to the next step wallace on camera you aposre an nfl player you aposre making some good money why did you decide you wanted to be an intern in the off season dockery because i wanted to transition well i wanted i was thinking about what aposs next wallace voice over he got a job interning on the house budget committee then chaired by paul ryan wallace on camera what did your teammates think dockery they loved it i mean they they used to always say i look at political dockery it got so bad i would watch c span no i loved it i couldn apost get enough of it so this is pretty cool wallace voice over dockery took us out of the speakers apos balcony looking down the national mall to reflect on his remarkable journey dockery you play at fedex field in front of like 80 000 85 000 screaming fans wallace on camera right dockery and this is surreal too you think about just the history wallace you know the best part you don apost have to choose because you aposve done both dockery i aposve done both right so i get the best of both worlds wallace voice over which brought up the politics of football wallace on camera how do you feel about nfl players taking a knee during the national anthem dockery we need to pay attention to criminal justice and the inequities in our country we should always strive for a more perfect union but to me personally i aposm not comfortable using the anthem as a protest wallace would you let your son play football dockery i would if you ask my wife she aposd give you a different answer but if it was up to me i would wallace so the answer is no dockery the answer is no yes tonight is about you having tons of fun wallace voice over dockery and his wife started a non profit called yellow ribbons united to help veterans and to support the families of the fallen and military who were still serving dockery the reason why we do this is because of my wife aposs brother who we lost in afghanistan sergeant david williams he really inspired us to give back wallace it aposs all part of a tough transition dockery inaudible how you doing good to see you again wallace derrick dockery has made look easy dockery i enjoy getting up every day and having a purpose i aposm not at home t
