national review the 82 day dictatorship the cummings standard dominic cummings fights the blob ending abortion of down syndrome children in the united kingdom it s time to mothball the imf nrplus member article i t is strange how suddenly a skeptical wall street ceos and even university and think tank policy analysts are now jumping on the once taboo trump bandwagon on china that if something is not done to stop china s planned trajectory to global hegemony based on its repudiation of the entire post war trade and commercial order then it will soon be too late in a wider sense at some point on a variety of fronts americans got fed up with perceived lopsidedness and their ensuing exasperation started to change status quo thinking and policy whether china s flagrant cheating the recent illustration via the caravan of rampant hypocrisies about illegal immigration or weariness with the asymmetries with the islamic world china china in its planned trajectory to world global supremacy makes two assumptions about the united states as to chinese trust that their brand of government managed capitalism is superior in the short term it is true that authoritarian governments mostly in wartime occasionally can achieve temporary spectacular results through partnering with capitalists but in the longer run managed capitalism proves far less flexible and ultimately less productive than free markets that are moderately regulated by elected governments rather than heavily controlled by authoritarians or socialists in addition the chinese misjudge western patience especially as its surpluses grow its violations of copyright and patents become more flagrant and espionage and technological appropriation are seen as a chinese birthright jwplayer jwplayer njhyyvv5

holders in america have an obligation to engage in espionage for the mother country and they further expect that u s visitors to china not only do not share such rigid loyalty to the united states but if they did they would be sorely punished by beijing if we think chinese students at stanford or cal tech or in silicon valley are won over by our diversity prosperity consumerism free wheeling popular culture and unfettered free speech and that they will take back such an ethos to china leading eventually to a democratic spring the chinese government thinks that we are sorely mistaken it believes instead that returning chinese students and green card holders will be chock full of invaluable technological military and commercial information but nonetheless turned off by american license perhaps in the same way that japanese visitors and residents in the united states during the 1920s a future admiral yamamoto and foreign minister y suke matsuoka among them eventually became strong advocates for war against the u s yet the history of democracies as thucydides pointed out is that laxity complacency and self absorption are abruptly replaced in extremis by frantic mobilization to danger as the entire commonwealth becomes invested in addressing existential challenges the u s responses in 1917 1941 and 1947 bear that out for all the talk of decline the chinese should not wish to provoke the u s and its allies into a response that would remind them actually how relatively weak in comparison to the u s they actually are in terms of economic clout military capability cultural influence and political unity radical islam the various manifestations of hostile radical islamism the iranian theocracy and its terrorist surrogates isis affiliates and sunni fundamentalist terrorism many within the pakistani government and often two faced authoritarian regimes all assume a similar idea that the west accepts asymmetry as a sort of psychological penance westerners must pay for their inordinate wealth the theory goes or for their supposed sins of 19th and 20th century colonialism and imperialism or they re simply too morally compromised to regain enough confidence in the ancient spirit of christendom and western civilization to defend their values yet isis learned that there are limits to the western tolerance of beheading it is a peculiar western characteristic that despite all the west s pious appeals to its own restraint and humanitarianism when its patience is rarely and finally exhausted and it feels justifiably aggrieved it can bring terrifying military resources to bear without much worry over limiting the damage it inflicts in terms of culture we also live in an asymmetrical world with islam itself mosques sprout all over the west christian churches are banned in many kingdoms of the gulf and more and more are disappearing from syria to turkey this is said to be normal and we are to get over it inside a western country if one blasphemes jesus the mockery is seen as the stuff of comedy art popular culture and entertainment try the same in paris or new york with the prophet of islam and the consequences can become violent and relentless try it in a muslim country and the consequences are death that asymmetry again becomes normative to islamic extremists this is not a token of magnanimity to be reciprocated but rather proof of timidity and impotence to be justifiably exploited mass and illegal immigration to the west from arab and muslim nations is assumed along with the idea that even illegal aliens from the middle east and north africa immediately on entrance to europe or the u s have the right and indeed the eagerness to demand from the west the freedoms and prosperity lacking in most islamic countries including the liberty to ridicule the hospitality of their newfound hosts what pakistani immigrants expect as visiting rights in britain or what turks assume of germans is not reciprocated by pakistan and turkey in their treatment of western visitors in their own countries pakistani and turkish immigrants also insist that their new western hosts treat them far better than their prior governments did fine that is the western tradition and yet immigrants often romanticize the distant countries they have forsaken and they damn the new hosts who have saved them no better examples of such schizophrenia can be found than the current confusion and chaos of islamic citizens and immigrants in france or the role of many first generation muslim intellectuals residing in the west mexico and latin america the shocking thing about the so called caravan wearing out its welcome in tijuana was not that mexican citizens were tired of the chaos of illegal immigrants demanding services of its newfound host country mexico but that mexicans seemed absolutely oblivious to the irony that americans might feel toward them as they feel to central americans in other words both the mexican government and mexican illegal immigrants have their own set of asymmetries that they now treat as de facto entitlements all these asymmetries become force multipliers of one another creating widespread exasperation on the part of americans that vexation especially is magnified when foreign diplomatic officials or residents inside the u s lecture americans on their moral shortcomings for not opening their border without restraint especially exasperating are american elites who talk down to the so called deplorables and irredeemables about their racism nativism xenophobia and general inferiority with the full expectation that the elites themselves have enough money influence and clout to exempt them from the consequences of what they advocate for others don t believe for a second that new york times columnists put their children in schools where half the student body does not speak english or that msnbc talking heads live across the street from recent m 13 arrivals or that npr hosts are sometimes rear ended by hit and run illegal immigrant drivers or find their social security numbers or ids stolen by illegal aliens or even that jane fonda cleans her own toilets or hollywood grandees mow their own lawns trump was many things to many people no doubt but what fueled his ascendance was a promise not to embark on radically abnormal agendas as alleged by his critics but to return things to perceived symmetry thus china must play by the rules that others do given that it would not like to be treated as it treats others the muslim world would not long tolerate western visitors demeaning middle eastern values customs and religions or evangelicals building churches in riyadh and should at least be cognizant of such hypocrisy and would mexico allow 10 million illegal aliens to crash its southern border and once inside demand of mexico city rights and entitlements that their own governments in central america would never extend to them fairly or not by 2016 americans saw far too much of such asymmetry disequilibrium in nato contributions too little parity in nafta paris climate accord virtue signaling rather than concern with actual carbon reductions a distorted iran deal etc half the country the poorer interior no longer accepted the usual apologies that the u s was so rich and powerful that it could always absorb such overhead for the sake of global harmony and collective advancement symmetry is what americans believe leads to mutual respect and with it stability and peace asymmetry leads only to pent up anger contempt frustration furor
