hillary clinton s campaign chairman john podesta sat on the board of a small energy company alongside russian officials that received 35 million from a putin connected russian government fund a relationship podesta failed to fully disclose on his federal financial disclosures as required by law that s one of the many revelations from a 56 page report released late sunday titled from russia with money hillary clinton the russian reset and cronyism by thenon partisan government watchdog group the government accountability institute gai breitbart executive chairman stephen k bannon holds the same title in gai and breitbart news senior editor at large peter schweizer serves as gai s president both the new york post and the wall street journal ran stories on the newly released report late sunday evening as part of her duties during the so called russian reset then sec of state hillary clinton led the way on u s involvement in a russian government technology initiative that was intended to be the russian equivalent of america s silicon valley known as skolkovo the innovation city located outside moscow has some 30 000 workers in state of the art facilities under strict government control as slate described it in 2013 in some ways skolkovo is eerily reminiscent of soviet utopian city building projects according to the gai report clinton s state dept recruited u s tech giants like google cisco intel indeed out of 28 u s european and russian companies that participated in skolkovo 17 of them were clinton foundation donors or paid for speeches by bill clinton however as involvement in skolkovo by clinton cronies increased so too did the danger for the technology coming out of the russian tech mecca to be used for russian military purposes in 2014 the fbi issued what it called an extraordinary warning to several technology companies involved with skolkovo the skolkovo foundation may be a means for the russian government to access our nation s sensitive or classified research development facilities and dual use technologies with military and commercial application warned lucia ziobro the assistant special agent at the fbi s boston office she added the fbi believes the true motives of the russian partners who are often funded by the government is to gain access to classified sensitive and emerging technology from the companies still hillary clinton s campaign chairman john podesta sat on the executive board of a small energy company called joule unlimited joule too received the fbi letter warning about skolkovo other joule board members included senior russian officials according to the gai report two months after podesta joined the board vladimir putin s rusnano announced that it would invest up to one billion rubles into joule unlimited which amounts to 35 million that represents one fifth of the entire amount of investment dollars joule collected from 2007 to 2013 rusnano which former russian education and science minister and current science advisor to vladmir putin andrei fursenko describes as putin s child was founded by putin in 2007 the gai investigative report says it s unclear how much if any money podesta made the reason podesta was on the board of three joule entities but only listed two on his disclosure the most important entity joule stichting he did not list podesta s compensation by joule cannot be fully determined reads the report in his 2014 federal government disclosure filing podesta lists that he divested stock options from joule however the disclosure does not cover the years 2011 2012 why podesta failed to reveal as required by law on his federal financial disclosures his membership on the board of this offshore company is presently unknown but the flows of funds from russia during the reset to podesta connected entities apparently didn t end with joule energy the report states according to the gai report podesta s far left think tank center for american progress cap took in 5 25 million from the sea change foundation between 2010 2013 who was funding sea change foundation according to tax records sea change foundation at the time was receiving a large infusion of funds from a mysterious bermuda based entity called klein ltd who owns klein it is impossible to say exactly given corporate secrecy laws in bermuda but the registered agent and lawyers who set up the offshore entity are tied to a handful of russian business entities including troika dialog ltd leadership includes ruben vardanyan an ethnic armenian who is a mega oligarch in putin s russia vardanyan also served on the board of joule energy with john podesta the fbi and u s army sounded the alarm bells about skolkovo being a threatening pathway for russia to accelerate its military technological capabilities why hillary clinton s state dept and her campaign manager were tied up in this raises serious questions that demand answers and transparency listen to bannon and schweizer discuss of this
