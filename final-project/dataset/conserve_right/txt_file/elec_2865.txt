chip somodevilla getty images democrats are in a frenzy they ve finally nailed the blueprint for defeating republicans in trump country if we re going to take the majority it s going to be because we win districts like that texas democratrep filemon vela said in a beltway news story that claims incoming democratic rep conor lamb s success could provide a blueprint for other democrats in tough races the democrats to be sure will win seats in the midterm elections and might even take the house but not the way they took pennsylvania 18 the blueprint goes something like this run a young handsome marine make sure he s pro second amendment make sure he s anti nancy pelosi make sure he s quiet on plans for amnesty make sure he says he s personally against abortion but runs like hell from any specific questions and make sure he s quiet about democrats anti energy agenda sound unlikely in today s democratic party it s preposterous that might not seem apparent to giddy d c election consultants so of course it didn t dawn on the gossip mongers of washington s press corps but three things democratic leadership the party s faithful and the man in the white house conspire to ensure this blueprint never happens on any kind of national scale the leaders for sixteen long years nancy pelosi has led the democratic party her first partner was democratic sen tom daschle who voted to ban partial birth abortion in 2003 but lost his seat and his post in senate leadership to republican sen john thune a year later after daschle pelosi led alongside sen harry reid who entered the post with a 20 percent rating from abortion cheerleaders naral and a 69 percent from the nra but ended his career with a 100from naral and a perfect score for expanding background checks from the brady campaign to prevent gun violence today the two leaders of the democratic party sen chuck schumer and rep nancy pelosi are far more pure than the slow politically motivated converts who came before since advocacy groups began their rating systems the two have hovered between a 0 percent and 7 percent rating from the nra and neither has dropped from below a 100 percent record with the abortion lobby and the party machine has taken the cue in 2016 the official party platform called unequivocally for legal abortion every candidate who runs as a democrat should do the same democratic national committee chairman rep tom perez decreed the following year the year after that the dccc the party s congressional campaign coordinator broke with precedent and declined to endorse one of its own seven term illinois rep dan lipinski against a challenger from the left lipinski s sin is he is anti abortion and a member of the all but extinct moderate blue dog coalition while his challenger is an abortion enthusiast endorsed by a whole host of fellow travelers includingsitting democrats in the house and senate but the democratic congressional campaign committee isn t an outside progressive organization or a single politician it s the official campaign arm of the democrats in the house of representatives and the only political committee in the country whose principal mission is to support democratic house candidates every step of the way to victory unless it appears that democratic house candidate strays from the one true faith but then pennsylvania s conor lamb prepared to win a house seat in a trump 20 district supporting late term abortion but publicly saying he thought it was bad as his win approached the dccc changed it s tune and aweek before the pennsylvania special electionthey decided to remember lipinski and support their embattled colleague congratulations are in order for conorlambpa and pennsylvania democrats they just made history and flipped pa18 a district trump won by 20 points the dccc tweeted upon victory rt if you re ready to repeat this victory district by district all across the country but no amount of retweets can change the trajectory of the democratic party this year why the faithful schumer and pelosi may be in charge but like nearly all politicians they don t truly lead they follow the loudest progressive voices and in the months before the dccc s initial decision to excommunicate the hard left column belching loudest was clear in its demands of course abortion should be a litmus test for democrats lindy westtitled an op edin the new york times this issue represents everything democrats purport to stand for if the democratic party cares about economic issues it must make reproductive choice fundamental to its platform the assistant editor for opinion news at u s news world report declared progressives wouldn t stomach a democratic candidate who questioned the necessity of brown v board of education she continued equating christians and hindus with segregationists so why might we make an exception when it comes to women s economic well being ignoring women s fundamental freedoms and equality to win elections is both an ethically and politically bankrupt strategy apparent moralist and naral president ilyse hogue tweeted it s short sighted and dangerous to pave the path to victory in 2018 at the expense of women destiny lopez co director of abortion promotersall above all chimed in if your answer is no on abortion the democratic party shouldn t fund your campaign a cnn op ed from an attorney based in nairobi and new york city read the core concern is that the party would errantly move away from a commitment to women s human rights as it tries to rebuild erin matson a former vice president of the national organization for women told the atlantic to say otherwise a writer for teen voguetweeted is a betrayal of every woman who has ever supported the democratic party if that s a purity test a goth writer at the guardianpreached call me mother theresa abortion is far from the only demand on the base s menu right above its demands on abortion the womens march s website has a list of lgbtqia rights non negotiables in 2016 sen bernie sanders nearly won the nomination as an open socialist democratic leaders like sen liz warren loudly call for gun control while cnn cheers on pelosi stood for eight hours to protest not for va reform not for the opioid epidemic but for illegal immigrants coal oil fracking and most other types of energy and industry are out pipelines who needs em all lives matter is racist men are oppressors republicans are nazis and masked vigilantes from boston to berkeley burn buildings and attack trump supporters with bats and chains while the democratic party can barely muster a mumble in protest why president donald j trump president trump has driven his opponents mad in the coastal states and in major cities old friends neighbors and businesses post signs about love and respect that offer the dual function of signaling virtue while telling trump supporters they aren t welcome middle class mothers and daughters who months before had booked non refundable hotels and airlines to see hillary clinton s inauguration parade instead find themselves donning pussy hats and beating drums in the street college professors are drawing up lists of unapproved media like 15th century inquisitors entertainers pose with the decapitated head of the president and call for blowing up the executive mansion a gathered congregation of working professionals and parents cheer it all former colleagues decrysen jeff sessions as a klansman and a kremlin agent depending on the day liberal platforms against free trade are discarded once the white house agrees democratic tenets like jerusalem as capitol are jettisoned once the current president agrees not a single elected democrat backed tax cuts for the middle class newspapers from the new york times on down have declared objectivity in the age of trump a moral hazard media critics and white house correspondents from major networks condemn objectivity on wildly popular off the record media panels television news cheers at each new russia conspiracy no matter how implausible and display no signs of shame when those inevitably deflate a drunk and unstable former trump associate s total breakdown is aired for hours before anyone even wonders if there s been a moral or ethical breakdown in the media the first among them to wonder if it was right are punished with the type of scorn reserved for religious heretics there ain t no settling down not this time no coming back from the brink on this race the base is alit with religious conviction and they will not be tolerating dissent and even if they do calm down and they won t president donald j trump can whip them up in a moment with an eyebrow cocked and a smirk on his face follow bedford on twitter follow bedford on
