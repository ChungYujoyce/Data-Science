president obama a major political victory on his signature health care issue thursday but the justices also provided republicans with a sharper campaign issue by defining the law s individual mandate as a tax the ruling allows mr obama to engage in a four month long victory lap as he campaigns for re election it also validates the president s decision to devote so much time and energy to getting the legislation passed in 2009 while the economy was in free fall a divisive vote that contributed to the democrats loss of house control in 2010 democrats didn t try to hide their i told you so reaction to the decision although mr obama and some others tried to downplay the political benefits top stories russian fighter jets intercept u s navy patrol aircraft over mediterranean ann coulter turns on trump most disloyal actual retard that has ever set foot in the oval office purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni i know there will be a lot of discussion today about the politics of all this about who won and who lost mr obama said adding that such talk completely misses the point of the law s benefits rep steve israel new york democrat and chairman of the house democrats campaign committee said the ruling isn t a political victory for democrats it s a victory for america s middle class and seniors and now house republicans need to drop their partisan obstruction and move on republicans also saw political opportunity in the ruling it will be a short lived celebration in the white house said republican pollster whit ayres obama now goes into the fall campaign defending a law that most americans think will increase their health care costs their premiums their taxes and the deficit he also has to defend raising taxes on all americans which he pledged not to do sen mike lee utah republican and a member of the tea party caucus said mr obama s victory will be fleeting and argued that most americans didn t like the law s individual mandate in the first place they ll like it even less when they understand it s a tax mr lee said on fox news the high court s ruling leaves in place 21 tax increases in the health care law costing more than 675 billion over the next 10 years according to the house ways and means committee of those 12 tax hikes would affect families earning less than 250 000 per year the panel said including a cadillac tax on high cost insurance plans a tax on insurance providers and an excise tax on medical device manufacturers this is a clear violation of the president s pledge to avoid tax hikes on low and middle income taxpayers said a statement from the panel which is chaired by rep dave camp michigan republican on the campaign trail four years ago and since taking office mr obama has been fond of saying that middle class families will not see their taxes rise a single dime under his leadership mr obama and his rival presumptive gop nominee mitt romney engaged in dueling news conferences within two hours of the high court s decision the republican trumped the president by giving his televised statement nearly a half hour before the president spoke at the white house obamacare was bad policy yesterday and it s bad policy today said mr romney who pledged to repeal it if he is elected still the court s decision was a big win for mr obama who spoke thursday of the courage behind the legislation and had been citing the law at campaign rallies as the major achievement of his presidency if the justices had overturned the law or key portions of it mr obama would have been portrayed as having wasted his term on a demonstrably failed policy if the opposite decision had come out a lot of democrats would likely be feeling that much of their activity during the obama administration s first two years had gone to waste said seth masket an associate professor of political science at the university of denver who argued in a study that 13 house democrats lost their seats in 2010 as a result solely of voting for the health care legislation the president joked this spring about the possibility of the court overturning his primary achievement at the annual white house correspondents dinner he said in my first term we passed health care reform in my second term i guess i ll pass it again democratic strategists are feeling emboldened that the supreme court under conservative chief justice john g roberts jr has aided mr obama s agenda the late decisions by the supreme court this summer leaves the gop s agenda in tatters said simon rosenberg president of ndn a democratic think tank in washington their efforts to overturn two administration efforts immigration and health care reform have failed obama comes out of this week much stronger the republicans weaker his first term will now

decision was announced shortly after 9 p m romney campaign spokeswoman andrea saul tweeted that mr romney s website had raised 3 2 million online counting obama campaign manager jim messina sent out a
