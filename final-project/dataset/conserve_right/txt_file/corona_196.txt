national review on today s menu a day by day month by month breakdown of china s coronavirus coverup and the irreparable damage it has caused around the globe the timeline of a viral ticking time bomb the story of the coronavirus pandemic is still being written but at this early date we can see all kinds of moments where different decisions could have lessened the severity of the outbreak we are currently enduring you have probably heard variations of chinese authorities denied that the virus could be transferred from human to human until it was too late what you have probably not heard is how emphatically loudly and repeatedly the chinese government insisted human transmission was impossible long after doctors in wuhan had concluded human transmission was ongoing and how the world health organization assented to that conclusion despite the suspicions of other outside health experts clearly the u s government s response to this threat was not nearly robust enough and not enacted anywhere near quickly enough most european governments weren t prepared either few governments around the world were or are prepared for the scale of the danger we can only wonder whether accurate and timely information from china would have altered the way the u s government the american people and the world prepared for the oncoming danger of infection some point in late 2019 the coronavirus jumps from some animal species to a human being the best guess at this point is that it happened at a chinese wet market december 6 according to a study in the lancet the symptom onset date of the first patient identified was dec 1 2019 5 days after illness onset his wife a 53 year old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalized in the isolation ward in other words as early as the second week of december wuhan doctors were finding cases that indicated the virus was spreading from one human to another december 21 wuhan doctors begin to notice a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause december 25 chinese medical staff in two hospitals in wuhan are suspected of contracting viral pneumonia and are quarantined this is additional strong evidence of human to human transmission sometime in late december wuhan hospitals notice an exponential increase in the number of cases that cannot be linked back to the huanan seafood wholesale market according to the new england journal of medicine december 30 dr li wenliang sent a message to a group of other doctors warning them about a possible outbreak of an illness that resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome sars urging them to take protective measures against infection december 31 the wuhan municipal health commission declares the investigation so far has not found any obvious human to human transmission and no medical staff infection this is the opposite of the belief of the doctors working on patients in wuhan and two doctors were already suspected of contracting the virus three weeks after doctors first started noticing the cases china contacts the world health organization tao lina a public health expert and former official with shanghai s center for disease control and prevention tells the south china morning post i think we are now quite capable of killing it in the beginning phase given china s disease control system emergency

country for another month january 2 one study of patients in wuhan can only connect 27 of 41 infected patients to exposure to the huanan seafood market indicating human to human transmission away from the market a report written later that month concludes evidence so far indicates human transmission for 2019 ncov we are concerned that 2019 ncov could have acquired the ability for efficient human
