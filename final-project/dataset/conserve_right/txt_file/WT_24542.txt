trump was mocked for mentioning a year after mccain s death from brain cancer the library is one way his family members are fighting to shape how the world remembers the vietnam war hero and veteran senator and to prevent president donald trump from doing it for them the counterprogramming also includes videos and its own twitter hashtag actsofcivility in which the mccains ask americans to perform and post affirmative acts of listening to one another and agreeing to disagree the campaign is a rejoinder to trump s smash mouth style and his one man feud against the late senator as a candidate trump derided mccain a prisoner of war for five years during vietnam saying that he preferred heroes who weren t captured even now in campaign rallies trump complains about how mccain turned

remembered and how he did not john mccain did not define himself by any losses said sen mitt romney r utah who commiserated with mccain after the two gop presidential nominees lost to obama in 2008 and 2012 like the library mccain s legacy is still somewhat aspirational upcoming books and other materials are likely to flesh it out so will the mccain institute a nonprofit aimed at leadership development human rights and combating human trafficking he s only been dead a year and legacy is something that s built over a great deal of time the senator s son said in an interview i personally hope that his legacy is defined by his civility in that year mccain s peers especially have given thought to what sticks with them and what it means retired marine gen james l jones who served in vietnam while mccain was imprisoned and who worked under him and later with him said mccain s reconciliation with vietnam helped jones forgive his enemies of war he had more reason than i did to carry

said is not part of the plan as for legacy building in the trump era mccain s allies say it s a long game when the president talks about john mccain and the way he does i think people just click off jones said they just turn him off romney who s had his own battles with the president said mccain s public life is too long for one president to define i don t think the family s going to worry too much what president trump has to say about senator mccain he said tuesday it s a 50 year plus legacy that is not going to be changed or obstructed by virtue of some tweets said sen sheldon whitehouse
