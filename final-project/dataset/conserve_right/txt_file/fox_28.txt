counsel to turn attention to repeal and replace and tax reform and our power player of the week iconic singer judy collins on the inspiration for the songs that defined a generation judy collins singer songwriter it was creative it was exciting it was music wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington donald trump is on day two of his first foreign trip as president meeting with more than 50 muslim leaders and trying to build a coalition to defeat isis and to isolate iran all this while the controversy escalates over possible links to russia threatening the president aposs foreign and domestic agenda we ll drill down on both stories this hour speaking in a few minutes with secretary of state rex tillerson and later with senator john mccain but first let aposs bring in the anchor of special report bret baier who is in riyadh saudi arabia with the latest on the president aposs trip bret bret baier fox news special report anchor chris in the second day in the home of islam aposs holiest sites president trump is calling terrorist barbaric criminals who must be stopped by a new u s muslim coalition which he says starts here on ancient soil begin videotape baier saying he aposs not here to lecture president trump address of the leaders of more than 50 muslim majority countries casting the fight against terrorism as a battle between good and evil a marquee speech on islam calling for cooperation in a much softer tone than his campaign the president has yet to use the phrase radical islamic terrorism from arab leaders in meetings sunday morning unidentified male let me say that you have a unique personality that is capable of doing the impossible trump i agree laughter baier talk of new relationships trump there won t be strain with this administration baier and new arms deals trump nobody makes it like the united states baier the saudis pledged to buy 350 billion of u s military equipment and weapons over ten years and more than 160 billion of saudi investment in u s companies this year president trump aposs first foreign stop has been filled with foreign pageantry a stark contrast to the saudi trips by president obama who was never greeted at the airport by the king and had a chilly relationship largely over his administration s dealings with iran this trip the saudis are already dancing in step end videotape baier later president trump known for his use of twitter will speak here at a conference designed to stamp out extremism using social media you know this trip was planned long ago but senior aides say they could not have asked for more in this first top than the saudis warm embrace which is something else to talk about back home chris wallace bret baier reporting from riyadh bret thanks for that and joining us now from saudi arabia is the secretary of state rex tillerson mr secretary president trump is urging muslim leaders to join the quote battle between good and evil he s opening a center against extremism today muslim leaders are pledging to cut off funding to radicals but the question i have is is this just talk or are there some real teeth there concrete measures that will help us destroy isis and al qaeda and to stop the flow of new recruits tillerson chris i think it is historical what s happening here in riyadh under the king s leadership his convening of the gcc council this morning where we had a very productive discussion on this subject of how to counter terrorism how to defeat daesh and how to bring stability greater stability to the region and of course this afternoon he ll deliver his important message to the convening of the arab summit again arab nations muslim nations from the around the world and i think what s the output of this chris are some framework agreements that are really going to guide the actions going forward but there are concrete commitments being made as to how we will work together to defeat daesh to defeat terrorism here in the region and as well as elsewhere i think the other thing that s important is there s also agreement to continue this dialogue it doesn t end here there is a commitment to have another gcc summit with the u s a year from now and one of the expectations is we will be measuring our project our progress towards the initiatives and agreements that were signed here and we will be looking for concrete results by which to measure each country s commitments wallace we should point out gcc is the gulf council of nations during the campaign sir candidate trump had some tough things to say here he is on the muslim religion begin video clip trump i think islam hates us there s something there s something there that s a tremendous hatred there there s a tremendous hatred we have to get to the bottom of it end video clip wallace and here he is talking about saudi arabia and qatar begin video clip trump you talk about women and women s rights so these are people that push gays off business off buildings these are people that kill women and treat women horribly end video clip wallace given that past rhetoric why should muslim leaders trust mr trump now and on the other hand if the president is so concerned about human rights why isn t he talking about it publicly this weekend tillerson well chris i think this is one of the great attributes of this president is that he is willing to call issues out confront them speak very plainly and bluntly about them and in many ways that motivates these countries to want to understand why the feelings in the u s are the way they are but also to engage to address those and i think that s what we are seeing in this visit to riyadh this visit to the country that is the custodian of the two holy mosques and the president himself has said he has learned a lot on this trip and he s learned a lot about the people he s learned a lot about their culture and i think this is an it s a really important process in terms of how we move forward with this relationship between the muslim world and the non muslim world and i think there s great recognition among all the leaders of the muslim world that they have to take responsibility for what has happened in many respects and they are taking responsibility and they re ready to join with us and other nations in confronting this terrible face of terrorism wallace but but sir i ve seen a draft of the president s speech the big speech this afternoon not a mention of human rights not a mention of women s rights you say he wants to speak concretely and frankly about these things he s not doing that today tillerson well chris i think the way you address those human rights issues and women s rights issues is to improve the conditions in the region and today conditions in the region are under a lot of stress because of the threat of terrorism the threat that iran poses to instability in the region and these subjects are being discussed as well and there are efforts under way to i think improve the rights of women the participation of women in society throughout the region but you know the primary reason we re here today is to confront this threat of terrorism if we do not defeat daesh if we do not defeat these forces of evil there will be no conditions under which we can even hope to improve the human rights for all of the people in the region wallace mr secretary you were in the oval office when the president met with russian foreign minister lavrov on may 10th and according to the official summary the president told lavrov i just fired the head of the fbi he was crazy a real nut ob i face great pressure because of russia that s taken off my question to you sir as someone who was in that meeting was he telling the russians that firing comey was taking off legal and political pressure tillerson chris that s not my my interpretation certainly of the conversation and i think what the president was trying to convey to the russians is look i m not going to be distracted by this all these issues that are here at home they that you know affect us domestically i m not going to let that distract from our efforts to see if we can engage with you engage with russia and identify areas where we might be able to work together the president i think reemphasized the message to the russians that the relationship is at a low point and we need to change that we need to both work towards trying to improve that so i think the point he was making is i m not going to be distracted by those things that are happening here at home nor let them get in the way of the important work of engaging russia to see what can be done to improve this relationship wallace but sir he seemed to be saying that firing comey would help remove one of the distractions tillerson i chris i just didn t my takeaway from that conversation was not that point at all i think again the president was simply saying to the russians these issues at home are not going to get in the way of my effort and the effort of my government to see if we can find a way to move this relationship forward wallace you said this week in washington that you don t think that foreign leaders around the world care about what s going on in washington with regard to the president here you are begin video clip tillerson i think the people in the rest of the world take do not have the time to pay attention to what s happening domestically here end video clip wallace i have to ask you mr secretary do you really believe that because i got to tell you that ambassadors that i talk to here in washington are deeply concerned with the investigation into the president and question wonder whether it s going to somehow prevent the u s from meeting its challenges around the world tillerson well chris i think all you have to do is watch the footage of your coverage of the president on this historic visit to the king of saudi arabia which of course now we re convening nations from throughout the region including africa there s an enormous amount of enthusiasm for the initiative that s being taken by the president on this particular issue and of course the subsequent legs of this trip to tel aviv and then to rome and to the vatican the audience with the pope my encounter with my counterparts foreign ministers but i would also say heads of state these are these are not the issues that are on their mind the issues that are on their minds are security issues economic issues the issues of common interest to both of our countries that s what they want to talk about when i m with them and these domestic issues just simply never come up in our discussions wallace in the time we have left sir and this is your first time on fox news sunday so i ll introduce you to something which i hope you ll do with us again a lightning round quick questions quick answers on various on hotspots around the world there was an excuse me an ugly incident in washington this week where turkish president erdogan looked on while his security beat and kicked peaceful protesters outside the turkish ambassador s residence question sir are you going to do anything about that tillerson well we did call the ambassador of turkey into the state department to discuss what occurred with them and express our view that this is simply unacceptable there is an ongoing investigation chris and i think we ll wait and see what the outcome of that investigation is but we have expressed our dismay at what occurred at the turkish embassy wallace well beyond expressing dismay senator mccain says that you should expel the turkish ambassador tillerson chris i think we need to let the investigation conclude before we come to any decisions such as that wallace as i m sure you know north korea tested yet another ballistic missile today isn t that one more indication that the new get tough policy of this administration the end of strategic patience isn t working tillerson no chris i wouldn t that would not be my takeaway at all we re early in the stages of applying the economic pressure as well as the diplomatic pressure to the regime in north korea hopefully they will get the message that the pathway of continuing their nuclear arms program is not a pathway to security or certainly prosperity the ongoing testing is disappointing it s disturbing and we ask that they cease that because until they cease that testing clearly they have not changed their view but i think we re early into the game of putting pressure on them and one could also interpret that perhaps they re just acting out now in response to some of this pressure that i believe they re beginning to feel wallace do any of the agreements that are being made this weekend with sunni arab and muslim nations do any of them help the united states in the effort to contain iran and its regional expansion tillerson well chris i think certainly the kind of security arrangements obviously there were significant new arms sales packages were announced yesterday with the kingdom but there are also sales going on to other important countries in the region this strengthens the overall security posture of the gulf and the arab nations in particular and i think makes it clear to iran that we the united states will stand with our partners here in the region to counter iran s hegemony any aspirations iran has for putting pressure on these countries will be met by a strong and unified front wallace finally sir we all got to see i don t know that you ve gotten a chance to see it but we all got to see the video yesterday of you participating in that traditional arab sword dance and i have to tell you you look pretty good while you were doing it frankly more comfortable than the president or commerce secretary ross had you been practicing sir tillerson well i hadn t been practicing chris but it was not my first sword dance laughter wallace why have you experienced in the middle east tillerson well i ve been in the middle east for many many years chris and not just in the kingdom but throughout the region this was just a such a wonderful welcome for the president last night the spirit the fun that was going on in the air it was very contagious for all of us and i think just the pure joy that you see on the faces of the people here in saudi arabia but also what we re hearing throughout the region with the president s visit the importance of it and i think great hope that this brings to them that something is finally going to be done to confront these faces of terrorism and the destabilizing forces in the region wallace secretary tillerson i think i can safely say that it s the first time we ve ever heard on fox news sunday this is not my first sword dance we want to thank you thanks for your time today and safe travels sir tillerson thank you chris wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss president trump s ambitious first overseas trip and what he hopes to accomplish on the world stage commercial break begin video clip trump they buy tremendous amounts of our military equipment and they invest in the united states and that aposs what we like to hear we like to hear about jobs jobs jobs end video clip wallace donald trump in saudi arabia today busy making deals with arab leaders and it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume columnist for the hill juan williams former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and kimberley strassel from the wall street journal well congresswoman harman what do you of this president s trip to saudi arabia so far we re in day two and of the effort that he s making to try to unite the muslim world against radical extremism jane harman former u s congresswoman well we have one president at a time and this is our president and i want this president to be successful on the trip and so far he is being successful it aposs a little too much pageantry for my taste i m sure he loves it and the messaging helps saudi arabia as much or more than it helps us but we are in the middle east i love the idea that he aposs going to the fount of all three major religions and i think if he is able to deliver a message that is a little more nuanced than just iran is terrible that will be very helpful just one last point chris and that is that isis and most of these terror groups are sunni arabs the saudi arabia and the gulf states are sunni arabs so it aposs not just attacking shia arabs it aposs more about defeating the idea of terrorism and i hope his speech and his activities address that wallace well i ve seen a first draft of the speech that is very much that the people that have suffered the most from this kind of sunni arab extremism are sunni arabs the muslims who were getting killed in that part of the world you know though kim we aposve seen other presidents make this kind of effort to try to unite the muslim world against the savages they get lip service but then behind the scenes a lot of these muslim leaders whether it aposs for payouts or for whatever reason continued to fund radicalism what makes you think this time will be any different kimberley strassel the wall street journal so i think what makes it different is eight years of a lack of leadership from the obama administration in which things really disintegrated there so what we see is all of these countries attending the summit have come to understand that allowing iran to get move toward nuclear weapons has also allowed them to begin meddling more in all of these other countries through surrogates whether it s in yemen whether it s in syria this has caused problems for all of the gulf region so they now have a renewed interest in actually from their own self interest in doing something and working with donald trump and that i think is a chance for a reset and that aposs why it might be different wallace brit what strikes me about this trip on a larger overview level is just how ambitious it is the president as jane mentioned going to the centers of islam judaism and christianity then engaging with our nato and economic partners and the word that white house officials were using in a briefing they held for us this week especially about the first part of the trip in saudi arabia and israel and the vatican is historic i got to say i don apost think that aposs an overstatement brit hume fox news senior political analyst no but every presidential visit overseas is historic and when chronicles of presidencies are written in foreign visits dealing with foreign leaders are always a part of it and this is this is unmistakably the stuff of the presidency no other official in this country has responsibility for foreign policy the way a president does so this is no question about it a very big deal and the principal purposes here are very big deals as well first is to try to strengthen saudi arabia as a bulwark against the growth of iran aposs power and second of course the big 50 states plus meeting to try to form a stronger coalition against terrorism wallace fifty muslim nations hume fifty muslim nations that aposs right against terrorism and they are bringing the muslim world or most of it together for that purpose it aposs a useful thing there aposs a lot of detail here chris for example you look at saudi arabia even as the president was going there for this purpose the united states proposed the u n to add a saudi based addition if you will of isis to though subject to sanctions wallace in effect the saudi chapter of isis hume the saudi chapter of isis and the saudis through other countries blocked that so there aposs always a lot of detail work to be done and that s often where the devil lies but he purpose here is significant and he seems to be off to a very good start wallace juan i want to pick up on something that kim said because the administration not surprisingly is emphasizing how different this president s approach to foreign policy is from barack obama aposs and what they say is the key is not to preach not to lecture on especially on human rights especially in public and rather instead to be more transactional and to try to make deals and get results do you think that makes sense or no juan williams fox news political analyst well i m just a little taken aback because you can say that we re emphasizing deals not diplomacy but remember not only president obama but president george w bush made arms deals with the saudis and they didn apost all get those hosannas and plaudits it was just part of the deal that aposs what you aposre doing and so when you talk about president trump emphasizing jobs and deals it comes at some cost to us because the lack of human rights attention the lack of understanding that the saudis are implicated everything from 9 11 to this support for the wahhabis the radical islam to the madrassas they preach hatred of israel and jews and hatred of shia i don apost understand how you can say we will just do the sword dance that you were talking about with secretary tillerson it seems to me they are flattering president trump they are appealing to his ego but it does not speak to the central issue on the table which is are you going to change your behavior wallace kim strassel well the purpose of this trip is to be over there talking about the terror threat and they are addressing this look i think it was quite an amazing moment to watch melania trump get off of that airplane not wearing a headscarf and shaking the crown prince aposs hand which you know it aposs very symbolic ivanka trump is over there she s going to be doing around table wallace in fairness michelle obama did the same thing strassel well she did as well too but i guess the importance is you also have to do by action not just by lecturing not just by talking if they are over there attempting to behind the scenes because look that aposs where all the real action is taking place as well too these are all these events that are all for tv but what you aposve got is an entire team of trump delegates that are doing behind the scene meetings crosstalk williams but i ve heard from secretary rice what i ve heard from senator mccain is human rights are an essential part of our long term policy as americans crosstalk hume juan the question of where to address it ph whether the best way to deal with that issue is to do so with public pronouncements in the face of these people who are hosting you or is it better to handle it all the outward and visible stuff with diplomacy which is what this is all about and to address these issues in a quieter way corsstalk wallace i m going to give the congresswoman a brief final word and we ve got to move on harman fine you have to do both brit it aposs good that the egyptians released one guy held in prison but it really matters that the saudis now try civilians by military court wallace all right well that was brief we have to take a break here we ll see you all a little later when we come back though senator john mccain on the president aposs first overseas trip as well as his troubles here at home commercial break wallace coming up former fbi director robert mueller is tapped to lead the investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election begin video clip sen john mccain r arizona we ve got to get this behind us so that we can move forward with the nation aposs work end video clip wallace we ll ask senator john mccain how the special counsel will affect the president s agenda next commercial break wallace as we ve said the president is conducting international diplomacy against a backdrop of intensifying investigations here at home joining us now to discuss both republican senator john mccain senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen john mccain r arizona thanks for having me back chris wallace so what do you think of the president aposs trip so far and do you think that realistically he can get muslim leaders to drop their support for extremism mccain i think this trip so far has been excellent i think that the sunni arab world and particularly our traditional friends there are encouraged because of the very strained if not estranged relations between the previous administration and so i think it successful i think it aposs important there aposs no doubt that if we re going to impede the iranian aposs continued efforts to exert certainly significant strength in the region that this is an important step forward wallace you wrote an article in the new york times recently in which you said that the u s must always stand up for human rights and not abandon oppressed people around the world given that what do you think of the decision and you hurt secretary tillerson defended it a few moments ago not to discuss human rights publicly on this trip mccain my enduring hero and inspiration is a guy named ronald reagan at the height of the cold war when people were talking about real ph politics and we were talking about all these new names they give for accommodation with the then soviet union ronald reagan stood for people he went to the berlin wall and said take down this wall he wasn apost talking about just the wall he was talking about the wall that existed between freedom and and oppression when he spoke for nathan sharansky one of the great human rights person in history he always had human rights as a fundamental belief that we would eventually prevail over the totalitarian regime we called the soviet union wallace but this president and his team seem to think that that s going to get in the way of practical progress mccain i aposve heard that for years and you have heard it for years we aposve got to be practical america is a is the unique nation in history with all of our errors and failings and mistakes that we aposve made and god knows there aposs been lots of them that we have stood up for people that you think would this administration speak up for nathan sharansky do you think i don apost think so but so we have to and we they said well we talk about it quietly look i want a close relationship with these arab countries i want to work with them not so much because of isis although that aposs very important but also against iranian hajemini ph but we have to stand up for what we believe in or we are no different wallace senator you aposve got a lot of attention this week with some remarks you made you re already beginning to laugh about it about the investigation into possible links between russia and the trump campaign here you are begin video clip mccain i think it aposs reaching a point where it aposs a watergate size and scale and a couple of other scandals that you and i have seen it aposs a centipede that the shoe continues to drop end video clip wallace what exactly are you saying mccain true what i aposm saying is that we re now with the appointment of mr mueller we are now at that stage of a scandal and now the question is how is it handled is it handled the way watergate was where it s drip drip drip every day more and more or do we handle it like the like ronald reagan handled iran contra it was a scandal he fired people he went on national television and said we made mistakes we did wrong and we re not going to do it again in the american people let him move forward and so there s what i was saying is there aposs two ways of handling a situation such as this with the appointment of mr mueller it obviously is now at that level the point is do we get it behind us get all the information out there and move forward the american people are very forgiving the american people understand that no one is infallible and so what my point was let aposs get all the facts out let aposs move forward and try to address the challenges that face this nation which i would argue are probably more diverse and more challenging than any time since the end of the cold war wallace senator do you think this is a scandal mccain i don apost know if you want to use the word scandal wallace but that s the word you used mccain ys but well you know the politicians prayer may the words i utter today be tender and sweet because tomorrow i may have to eat them i aposm reminded of that when i what i was saying was what i just described to you i think if you want to use the word scandal that aposs fine as i did the point is it aposs a challenge to washington d c the way we do business a challenge to bipartisanship and a challenge to the effectiveness of this newly elected president wallace some democrats say that the president fired fbi director james comey in order to impede the investigation but the acting fbi director andrew mccabe pushed back on that here he is begin video clip andrew mccabe acting fbi director there has been no effort to impede our investigation today simply put sir you cannot stop the men and women of the fbi from doing the right thing protecting the american people and upholding the constitution end video clip wallace why do you think the president fired jams comey mccain i don apost know i honestly i cannot explain a lot of the president s actions i don apost think it was a wise thing to do mr comey was highly respected and highly regarded and so i can t i can apost explain it i don apost think it was a smart thing to do wallace do you think it was an effort to impede the investigation mccain i do not know i know that that this issue has infuriated the president i mean that aposs obvious from his public appearances and his statements but i don apost think that that was the right remedy but he aposs the president of the united states and he will face the events i aposm not sure you would have had the appointment of mr mueller if that had happened wallace you say that the president should never have let russian foreign minister lavrov into the oval office in the first place last week now it turns out and i want to put this back up on the screen that mr trump according to the official summary told lavrov i just fired the head of the fbi he was crazy a real nut job i faced great pressure because of russia that s taken off how do you read that sir mccain i don apost know how to read it except that and i i aposm almost speechless because i don apost know why to how why someone would say something like that but i know this mr lavrov is the stooge of a thug and a murderer who used russian precision weapons to strike hospitals in aleppo who s committed human rights violations all over the place as invade ukraine has taken crimea has acted in the most thuggish and outrageous fashion and he had no business in the oval office if there s a president to putin engagement in a meeting i think that s under the right circumstances that might be ok but not this stooge lavrov who is nothing but a propagandist wallace the president is considering a number of people to be the new fbi director to replace james comey including your old friend former senator joe lieberman after some democrats criticized joe lieberman you said this i m putting it going to put it up on the screen joe lieberman has more experience than all of my democratic colleagues combined so screw them and you can quote me senator let me deface ph this mccain what this is wallace is it time to switch to decaf mccain chris the thing that aposs really disappointing about this is probably the most beloved and respected member of the united states senate was joe lieberman by republican and democrat so the same democrats that proclaimed their friendship and bondage with joe lieberman are now the ones that are trashing him this is it aposs a commentary on why we get a little cynical around this town wallace the president says that the real story here are all the leaks that are coming out and and i aposve got to say the air force one was barely off the ground on its way to saudi arabia and we had big explosive stories on the front page of the new york times and the front page of the washington post do you believe that there is a concerted effort among elements inside the intelligence and law enforcement communities to bring this president down mccain i can apost go quite that far but i think it aposs outrageous i think it aposs a betrayal of their oaths of office i think it aposs disgraceful these facts would come out no matter what chris in the course of a normal investigation that goes on and these people who are doing it i say shame on them because they are not serving their country or even their own interest in the long run wallace do you think the investigation should go to them as well as the question ph mccain i think it s a violation of the law to leaked classified information and therefore they should be held accountable wallace finally we have less than a minute left you heard my discussion with secretary tillerson about that violent reaction the beat down and these pictures i ve got to say are pretty bad right here in the heart of washington turkish security beating kicking oh peaceful protesters you heard the secretary aposs reaction are you satisfied with that mccain well again this decaf issue you know what i said throw the turkish ambassador the hell out of washington those were his people and erdogan s people that were sent out there that aposs not america and it aposs not allowed in the united states of america peaceful demonstrators being beaten up chris that is just flat out wrong and to say that we have asked for further information you don apost need any further information just look at the clip that we just showed wallace senator good to have you back always good to talk with you thank you sir mccain thank you wallace when we come back washington is abuzz over the russia investigation but the president is determined to proceed with business as usual we ll bring back our sunday panel plus what would you like to ask the panel about the new special counsel and what it means for the president aposs agenda just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump well i respect the move but the entire thing has been a witch hunt and there is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign but i can always speak for myself and the russians zero end video clip wallace president trump saying the appointment of a special counsel is a waste of time that only serves to divide the country and we re back now with the panel brit there were so many leaks so many stories this week including that comey memo that he wrote right after a meeting in the oval office with the president in which he said the president told him why don apost you let the investigation of michael flynn go what strikes you about where we are now in this story hume well i aposve never seen leaks on this scale i mean jason rally of the wall street journal kim s colleague sitting her the other day that there are leaks and then there aposs niagara falls well we re under niagara falls right now i ve never seen anything like it and the problem with it is that if a even if you assumed chris that all these excerpts that we re seeing from memos and conversations and all the rest of it are accurate they re only part of the story and we re going to have to wait a while to get the rest of the story it is perfectly possible for example chris to interpret what was apparently set to comey in the oval office indiscreetly to be sure by donald trump as being not a not a request to shut down an investigation but a but a a question to comey as to whether now that trump that flynn had been fired and at the time the washington post had reported that an examination of his phone calls with the russian ambassador had uncovered nothing improper isn t it wouldn t it be possible now to to let this go because i think trump thinks he aposs innocent and he may think flynn is innocent and he s saying hey come on how about it man can t you wrap this up can t we let this go that aposs indiscreet it aposs probably improper but it aposs not obstruction of justice in the atmosphere in which we re now living everything is likened to watergate reporters even some who weren t there at the time would like to relive that wallace on this question of leaks and what aposs true here we ve got a number of questions from you for the panel and we got this on twitter from bob kortbawi who writes what crimes have been committed not speculation or facts what are they what factual proof is there no innuendos no rumors just facts congresswoman harman how do you answer bob harman well washington was broken before donald trump was elected president that s one of the reasons he was elected president and there were leaks before donald trump became president so let s put that in the background how do i answer him we don apost know if there were crimes committed that aposs what a special counsel not prosecutor but a counsel to investigate collusion any possible collusion between the trump campaign and the russian meddling in the 2016 election was established we ll see but congress also has a role this is a point that aposs important i was here for watergate i wasn apost on one of the watergate committees but i was a counsel to the senate and congress played an important role on a bipartisan basis getting some tough answers to the toughest questions wallace are you troubled by this torrent of leaks that seem to be coming from harman very troubled john mccain is right leakers should be prosecuted the justice department should go after leakers we have enough statues to prosecute them and this climate of partial leaking is even worse because then there are selective quotes and you can make any seem true wallace the white house got more bad news this week with the announcement that former fbi director james comey will testify in public before the senate intelligence committee sometime after memorial day and comey supporters are already trying to build a case for him and his credibility and what he s going to say for instance talking about the time two days after the inauguration when the president singled out comey in the white house take a look begin video clip benjamin wittes lawfare editor in chief trump grabs the hand and kind of pulls him into a hug but the hug is entirely one sided so one guy in the hug is shaking hands and the other guy is hugging and comey was just completely disgusted by unidentified male disgusted wittes disgusted by the episode end video clip wallace kim we aposve seen this before this comey testimony this hearing not saying whether he s right or wrong and certainly people are going to push back it s going to be a moment of high drama here in washington strassel yes everything about jim comey is high drama at the moment i think the important point and it aposs interesting here you have all these leaks half leaks you have his defenders going out this is not unusual for james comey he keeps these notes they clearly were taken as down as a sort of insurance policy precisely in case he did get fired along the way this has happened in the past too you know he s come out and he suddenly had a piece of paper showing a letter that he had sent that he was not on board with the bush aposs enhanced interrogation tactics back at the time he s a very meticulous note keeper for the purpose of making sure that he aposs exonerated later if there are any questions that are coming out so what s going to be interesting though about this hearing is whether or not it really tells us anything of use because he aposs going to be reticent i think to talk about any of the questions that actually do need being answering given that a lot of it s classified wallace and i ve got to i ve got to say juan that the president supporters are already beginning if if comey supporters are trying to build them up trump s supporters are trying to tear him down saying well if there really was this attempt to obstruct justice on go easy on flynn then why didn apost he go public with it why didn apost he resign why didn t he tell more people in the justice department williams just give me a moment here to say if you have a leak please call me at fox news i aposm all for leakers i think leakers are good contributors to democracy i don apost think try to undermine government but i don t think we condemned obama for going harshly against people who were disclosing information acting as if they were agents of some foreign government this is a democracy we have a first amendment reporters play an essential role wallace yes but this isn t on the reporters williams no wallace this is no this is on the people inside the government williams fine what i m pounding ph here wallace don apost you think they have a responsibility to keep secrets williams they do have a in some cases they ve signed an oath but guess what we have as jane harman said a moment ago a history in this country of people talking to the press leaking taking risks i don t see all of a sudden oh just because of this president all of a sudden everybody who says you know what there s a risk to democracy it s to be condemned please wallace have you ever seen a torrent of leaks like this williams no it aposs unbelievable harman half ph leaks williams and guess what have i ever seen a president like this no i haven t i think everybody will say that supporters and opponents but let me just answer your question wallace you ve got 30 seconds left now williams i think jim comey should not have commented if he was be felt that he was being pressured to drop it i think that would have compromised the ongoing investigation he took contemporaneous notes and his job is to see the investigation the probe through as the fbi director not to act on his thoughts as brit hume said you have to sense clear intention and i don apost think that aposs been demonstrated to make the obstruction of justice case and by the way high crimes and misdemeanors that aposs up to the people in the senate it s not a statutory crime wallace wow inaudible going there harman wow inaudible wallace let me just say i can apost wait for the comey hearing it s going to be really interesting thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week a voice of her generation shows no signs of slowing down commercial break wallace the music business is notoriously tough and fickle singers can have one big hit and are never heard from again that aposs why it aposs so remarkable for someone to keep turning out classics for more than 50 years here s our power player of the week begin videotape collins well i think of things from childhood i think of things from last week i think of things from tomorrow i aposm in a kind of state of meditation wallace judy collins is talking about what she thinks of when she sings a song something she aposs done so memorably for more than half a century collins all of a sudden you re in the right place at the right time doing the right thing it was totally magical wallace collins exploded on the music scene in new york s greenwich village in 1961 it was the world of pete seeger and woody guthrie and bob dylan wallace on camera was it the music that attracted you or was it the message collins well it was everything it was creative it was exciting it was music people were writing songs about every aspect of life wallace voice over it was a world where late one night joni mitchell sang her both sides now over the phone wallace on camera and what did you think collins i said i ll be right over this is fantastic wallace is there a phrase you like collins singing tears and fears and feeling proud to say i love you write out loud wallace how would you choose what worked for you and what didn apost collins if it hits me here i sing it if i if that doesn apost happen i never want to hear it again wallace voice over in 1975 collins heard another song by stephen sondheim collins singing isn t it rich are we a pair me here at last on the ground you in midair i mean how could you not want to sing that song wallace it won the grammy for song of the year collins made her mark in other ways protesting for civil rights and against the war in vietnam and in addition to singing her own songs and others or failing love affair with stephen stills inspired him to write the classic sweet judy blue eyes stephen stills musician singing i am yours you are mine you are what you are wallace on camera he was trying to win you back collins yes he was wallace and did it work collins no i said it aposs beautiful but it aposs not going to get me back wallace voice over collins has had emotional problems over the years depression and bulimia and alcoholism wallace on camera you aposve been very public about it why collins because i can apost keep my mouth shut wallace voice over she aposs written several books about it including her latest one cravings but not surprisingly she says what she finds most healing is to sing collins the days when i was still drinking you know i very much would kind of get behind the microphone and shut my eyes and sing like for two hours and that that was a period where nobody could get at me wallace on camera since you asked wallace voice over before we knew it collins was giving us a private concert at age 78 she still does more than 100 performances a year collins i love to sing and the lights are on and the music is on and the sound is great and the band is great and i aposm exactly where i should be doing what i should be doing wallace on camera no plans to retire collins oh my god it aposs not in my repertoire you know i think part of it is that i am an artist and artists don apost retire end videotape wallace this summer collins will tour the country with an old boyfriend stephen stills marking the first time they aposve shared th
