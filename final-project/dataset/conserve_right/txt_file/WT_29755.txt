lung infection six weeks later the girl died i watched my baby girl die slowly and painfully just a few months before her second birthday ms jaurez told congress speaking through an interpreter the world should know what is happening to so many children inside of ice detention ms juarez is suing the arizona city that hosts the ice facility where she was held and is demanding a reported 60 million in the midst of that democrats on the house oversight and reform committee had ms juarez appear as the star witness for the first of a series of hearings this month intended to highlight the border crisis and the conditions for illegal immigrants the american people are up in arms said rep jamie raskin the maryland democrat who chaired the hearing she said the reports democrats and watchdog groups have brought back from the border shame us as a society the hearing was titled kids in cages and was advertised with a photo of a chain link fence cell at a border holding facility republicans pointed out that the photo was from 2014 during the obama administration underscoring how tricky and intractable the border problems have become as the surge of children and families has changed the face of illegal immigration the latest numbers suggest an improvement last month the border patrol reported apprehending 94 897 illegal immigrants in june which was down 29 compared with the may numbers of the apprehensions nearly 70 were either families or unaccompanied juveniles another 9 447 migrants showed up at border crossings without permission to enter also a drop from may nearly half of those were families or children a top border official said part of the drop could be seasonal with a decline in unauthorized crossings during the heat of summer but he said some of the drop is likely a result of better enforcement in mexico thanks to a deal that country struck with the u s last month the official who briefed reporters but whom his agency declined to allow to be identified gave an example of mexico s assistance he said one group of 200 migrants approached the border near del rio texas a couple of weeks ago mexican officials apprehended most of them but left 60 who made it into the u s yet the official said the rate of apprehensions at nearly 95 000 is still the highest june level since 2000 this is still a crisis the official said a 4 6 billion emergency spending bill congress approved last month has helped the health and human services department now has more space to accommodate unaccompanied children meaning they can be transferred out of border custody the number of children at border holding centers dropped from more than 2 000 in early june to just 200 as of wednesday and few of those had exceeded the 72 hour maximum transfer time according to the border official briefing reporters but unless something can be done to change the flow of people leaving their homes to try to come to the u s the crisis will continue ronald d vitiello a former top official at the border patrol and ice told congress he said the border facilities were built for processing adult migrants usually in 12 hours or less the children and families who are more difficult to process and release because they cannot be immediately returned to mexico end up in custody for days that means officials have had to bring in temporary showers and stock food and sanitary supplies it also has meant massive overcrowding democrats at the hearing said blame falls on president trump and suggested some of the horror stories are indicative of intentional behavior what is being pointed to here is a culture of cruelty said rep alexandria ocasio cortez new york democrat after hearing ms juarez s claims that she felt insulted and had mr trump s name thrown at her immigrant rights activists who also testified agreed children are going hungry said hope m frye executive director of project lifeline who conducted a watchdog visit last month she said pureed food for infants less than 1 year old is completely missing and when there are bottles for formula there is no way to wash the bottles so they are contaminated migrants complained that the
