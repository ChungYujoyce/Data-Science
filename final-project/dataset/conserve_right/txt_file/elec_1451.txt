of the four special elections held to replace republican congressmen who have departed capitol hill to join the trump administration ga 06 was democrats best shot at victory and they knew it first they won a moral victory by over performing in mike pompeo s old kansas district but still lost next they won another moral victory by arguably over performing in ryan zinke s old montana district but still lost then they surprised everyone with yet another moral victory by unexpectedly over performing in mick mulvaney s old south carolina district more below but still lost georgia however was always the real prize sure it s a traditionally republican district that the gop s house and senate nominees won by roughly 20 points in november but donald trump very narrowly defeated hillary clinton there squeaking through by less than two points so it s by no means a trumpy district sprinkle in the ongoing russia controversy an allegedly toxic republican healthcare bill and a sagging presidential approval rating and democrats could smell political blood in the water finally factor in the left s much discussed intensity advantage and the literally unprecedented sum of money they poured into the race and the stage appeared set for that elusive inspirational victory the resistance has been pining for polls gave democrat jon ossoff a modest lead down the home stretch of the campaign with late movement to republican karen handel it was going to be tight as a tick it seemed with enthusiasm and energy being ossoff s potential secret sauce and then this happened 99 in handel won by five points pic twitter com zidroyjqlj perhaps the networks ought to start projecting moral victories for democrats a few thoughts on handel s victory 1 the gloating gop take democrats wanted this one badly and they hyped it like crazy they spent somewhere in the ballpark of 30 million to make a statement and they face planted their inexperienced liberal pelosi backed pro obamacare candidate didn t even live in the district keeping his campaign afloat via donations from non georgians with a proverbial perfect storm brewing in precisely the type of district affluent well educated suburban that democrats are going to need to turn blue in order to have a chance to win back the house next year the gop base also got fired up and turned out in force in a high stakes high intensity high attention high dollar high expectations high turnout battle democrats again fell short with the brightest lights were burning and both bases fired up conservatives prevailed liberals perfunctory twitter spin soon gave way to angry recriminations highlighting how demoralizing the loss really was 2 the democratic counterpoint take yes trump struggled in the district a few months ago but ga 06 has been a gop stronghold for decades the fact that the party needed to pump tens of millions into a red district just to retain it against a 30 year old neophyte candidate shows that there s potential trouble brewing ahead of the midterms also don t forget that democrats chirped about a big pennsylvania special election hold back in 2010 which some analysts said took the air out of the gop wave balloon a few months later republicans won 63 house seats republicans breathe huge sigh of relief but they should remember democrats held onto pa12 just months before gop won majority in 2010

another election last night take but look at how close democrats came in a ruby red south carolina district some commentators are interjecting fair point sort of even though democrats controlled that seat basically forever until 2011 it is a very conservative area so the gop nominee s narrow three point win last night was a surprise but it was close because turnout was pretty depressed unlike in
