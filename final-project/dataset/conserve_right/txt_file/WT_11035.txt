apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic china is providing harvard university with 360 million that a former military intelligence analyst says appears to be part of an effort to influence one of america s most important educational institutions anders corr a former government analyst who specializes in foreign influence operations stated in a letter to vice president mike pence that a chinese military linked company jt capital gave 10 million to harvard in 2014 the same year the family of ronnie chan a hong kong real estate mogul with ties to china announced it is giving 350 million to the university both donations were relatively opaque and raise questions about the purpose of the funds he said mr corr who received an international relations doctorate from harvard in 2008 said the chinese donations appear to be an attempt to introduce biases among the university s professors in a bid to influence u s policy or public opinion in china s favor top stories trump dismisses

expositor of the 21st century allowing such donations does not appear to be in u s national security interests and it does not appear to be necessary for harvard s research and teaching it already has an endowment of 36 7 billion he said perhaps there should be legislation against chinese linked money in u s politics including think tanks and universities harvard professors also give paid speeches in china are paid for publishing work in china and enjoy all expenses paid travel to china mr corr stated in his letter these are all potential avenues of influence upon professors who do not usually broadcast these pecuniary benefits as they could diminish the perception of their impartiality he said the u s government gave harvard 600 million in 2016 and over the years has provided billions of dollars for research and education he noted mr corr then asked the vice president who met recently with harvard president drew faust to look into whether the china linked donations violate u s foreign agents registration laws and whether harvard may be providing valuable u s technology to china in exchange the 350 million donation also should be examined by the treasury department led committee on foreign investment in the united states known as cfius harvard is not unique in being a soft but influential voice on china that has a conflict of interest because of china linked pecuniary interests mr corr stated the way in which china linked pecuniary interests percolate through elite level u s policy discussions on china on both sides of the aisle and in supposedly bipartisan think tanks and universities should be a concern to all u s citizens who depend on places like harvard for unbiased political analysis mr corr said that given the substantial government support for harvard american taxpayers deserve greater transparency harvard is but one example i think of a much bigger problem of bias in u s china policy analysis he said i hope the problem can be addressed by the enforcement of existing law new law or at least someone with sufficient stature to improve transparency of china linked donations and get some answers harvard spokesman patrick mckiernan said the university is fortunate to receive support from people and organizations around the world to help in teaching and research in accepting these gifts and grants we are clear from the very beginning that the donor in no way may effect or influence the scholarship or academic independence of the university he said such terms are part of our institutional protocol and only after reaching agreement with the donor is harvard willing to accept such funding harvard also has policies aimed at dealing with conflicts of interest and safeguarding academic integrity mr mckiernan added a spokesman for mr pence said the vice president was traveling and had no comment mda seeks stronger cybersecurity amid heightened threats of both missile and cyberattacks from north korea the pentagon s missile defense agency is taking steps to strengthen the cybersecurity of its high tech system of sensors command and control nodes and missile interceptors the mda this week awarded a 91 5 million contract to booz allen hamilton an intelligence and defense contractor for improving cybersecurity at missile defense sites the funds will be used for cybersecurity management and computer network defense this contract will ensure mda information technology services management and resources are administered acquired managed and operated in compliance with the priorities set by the mda director and the goals and directives of existing statutes and department of defense regulations the pentagon said in announcing the contract locations for the work include missile defense facilities in colorado springs fort belvoir virginia hanscom air force base massachusetts kirtland air force base new mexico naval surface warfare center dahlgren division virginia redstone arsenal alabama and vandenberg air force base california efforts to beef up u s military cybersecurity are part of the trump administration s policy of strengthening defenses against cyberattacks as a first step in a major buildup of cyberpower once better cyberdefenses are in place offensive cyberattacks or counterattacks are expected to be carried in the future administration officials have said schriever air force base near colorado springs is home to the missile defense integration and operations center for u s missile defenses those defenses include a range of systems from short range patriot missile defenses to navy aegis defenses to ground based terminal high altitude area defense thaad systems up to the long range ground based midcourse defense system those interceptors in alaska and california are the main defense against any north korean icbm attack north korea is one of several major u s adversaries developing cyberwarfare capabilities targeting american weapons systems the goal is for their military forces to integrate cyberattacks in the early phase of a conflict with the goal of knocking out sensors electronics and guidance systems by introducing viruses and using other digital disruptions china russia and iran also are developing cyberwarfare capabilities as is the u s cyber command the military command in charge of cyberwarfare published reports have said the u s government was able to sabotage some north korean missile launches by breaking into the supply chain of parts and planting malware in components cyberwarfare requires significant intelligence capabilities to first penetrate foreign weapons or their command and control system and mapping the operating systems and then planting malware or creating backdoor openings that will permit remote access in a conflict north korea is considered a second tier cyberwarfare power pyongyang s major cyberattack took place in 2014 against sony pictures entertainment in a bid to dissuade the company from releasing an anti north korean
