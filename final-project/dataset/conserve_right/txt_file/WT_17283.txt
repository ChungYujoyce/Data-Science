cted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion secretary of defense robert m gates met with china s minister of defense gen liang guanglie last week at the asean defense ministers conference although the specifics of their agenda were unknown china s aggression and arrogance this year means there should have been no lack of talking points certainly china s unprecedented military buildup along with its illegal claims to the south china sea should have been addressed head on however it appears the main focus was on getting the chinese to resume military to military relations and extending an invitation for mr gates to visit beijing in 2011 it should be clear by now that china s communist party and people s liberation army refuse to value building military to military relationships as does the united states the more we stress this goal the more china is simply going to use it as a means to force u s concessions for example two presidents have failed to approve the sale of new f 16 aircraft and new conventional submarines to taiwan in hopes that china will moderate its aggressive actions china deftly employs the same psychology to prevent the united states from defending its interests in the useless six party talks on north korea while china s increasing support for north korea allows pyongyang s nuclear threat to grow on the other hand china has no problem with advancing its priorities which start with building the most powerful military in asia as a direct challenge to the united states in so doing its intent is to place japan south korea australia india and other asean association of southeast asian nations nations in positions of strategic subordination as well as destroying the democratic system in taiwan furthermore from the 2020s onward china intends to challenge the united states for global military supremacy in short china s goal is to make the world safe for the continued survival of the chinese communist dictatorship china s successes if unchecked will come only with diminished influence and freedoms for the united states as well as for our friends and allies top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century so far in 2010 china in april conducted provocative naval exercises in the east china sea followed by precipitating low level clashes with japanese fishing trawlers in august in september a chinese trawler rammed two japanese coast guard patrol boats in the senkakus stoking chinese bluster when the captain justly was arrested further china has made illegal claims to most of the south china sea and then declared it to be a core interest meaning it is on par with tibet and taiwan in importance china s continued military buildup opposite taiwan despite progress on economic and political relations makes no sense unless china is preparing for war against the only chinese democracy china also has expanded foreign military activities such as maintaining constant naval patrols off somalia and a peace mission 2010 exercise in kazakhstan in september that demonstrated heightened capabilities for the shanghai cooperation organization alliance of dictatorships most disturbing was a late september chinese air force exercise with the turkish air force which included a stop in iran that probably compromised sensitive nato air war fighting tactics such an exercise when coupled with other unhelpful recent turkish actions raise questions about turkey s continued slide away from nato certainly there is a need to review the decision to sell turkey our latest f 35 stealth fighter as china faces no ostensible threat its accelerating military buildup cannot be allowed to go unchecked the chinese have begun testing an abm system at the same time suspicion grows that it is putting multiple warheads on its icbms which should raise concerns over the start treaty with russia china s new naval base on hainan island for its nuclear missile nuclear attack submarines and aircraft carriers threatens the critical sea lanes from the straits of malacca to our key western pacific allies china s anti ship ballistic missile clearly is aimed at denying the u s navy freedom of action in the western pacific china has built more than 500 fourth generation combat aircraft and is moving its fifth generation fighter into testing it also has accelerated construction of its first aircraft carrier it also has launched a new conventional submarine with the possibility of two production lines finally china is advancing its moon and space station program which likely will have military missions after a year of dallying the obama administration has started to stand up to china but it is not doing enough its january arms sales package to taiwan was empty without f 16s and submarines it laid down a marker on china s illegal claims to the south china sea by siding with the asean nations but this is only rhetoric until we revive a real conventional military relationship with the philippines our only treaty ally in that region support for south korea after the north korean torpedo attack was wobbly in the face of chinese opposition to its credit the administration backed japan against chinese intimidation in the east china sea deterring chinese aggression will require much more we need to increase our military capability in the western pacific to include our own anti missile and anti ship ballistic missile capabilities as well as enhanced anti submarine forces we should convert older ballistic missile submarines with core life remaining to cruise missile submarines which is allowed under the new start treaty our message should be that the world s leading democracy will not be intimidated or bullied by another communist threat in addition to remaining militarily superior the united states also can begin to organize multinational political and economic pressures that could help accelerate china s evolution from communism we led a similar campaign in the not too distant past retired navy adm james a lyons was commander in chief of the u s pacific fleet and senior u s military representative to the unite
