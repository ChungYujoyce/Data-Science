apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion liberals suffering from trump derangement syndrome tds have a whole new theory president trump is joker the new hit movie starring joaquin phoenix has exploded onto the scene splitting critics down the middle some think the new film featuring the comic villain origin story is worthless garbage while the brilliant critic rex reed wrote that the movie borders on genius repellent dark terrifying disgusting brilliant and unforgettable of course the movie doesn t have anything to do with mr trump and doesn t explicitly cross over into the world of politics but that hasn t kept liberals from declaring that the movie is all about him or at least the america that gave us trump top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century filmmaker michael moore came out of the woodwork to say the film is an anti trump screed it s about the america that gave us trump the america which feels no need to help the outcast the destitute the america where the filthy rich just get richer and filthier he wrote on instagram our country is in deep despair our constitution is in shreds a rogue maniac from queens has access to the nuclear codes he wrote yes there s a disturbed clown in that mirror but he s not alone we re standing right there beside him joker is no comic book movie the film is set somewhere in 1970s gotham new york city the headquarters of all evil the rich who rule us the banks and corporations whom we serve the media which feeds us a daily diet news they think we should absorb cnn went one step further in an op ed from sunday titled joker a political parable for our times writer jeff yang goes to extraordinary lengths to connect the movie to mr trump with repeated declarations that trump is racist the piece notes that the main character arthur fleck phoenix is brutalized by young thugs he s beaten by suit clad wall streeters but to mr yang it s all about race and class and his answer to this dual pincer of oppression by people of color and one percenters is a murderous rampage of revenge which catches fire among fellow angry citizens of gotham and sends them looting through the streets then he jumps to mr trump while many reviewers have focused on fleck as an incel hero his status as a sexless loner who turns to violence the true nature of the movie s appeal is actually broader it s an insidious validation of the white male resentment that helped bring president donald trump to power joker at its core is the story of the forgotten man the metaphoric displaced and disenfranchised white man whose goodwill has been abused and whose status has been reduced a man who has been crushed underfoot by the elite dragged down by equality demanding feminists and climbed over by upstart nonwhite and immigrant masses he concludes the writer also notes that director todd phillips has attacked the outrage culture of the far left quoting him as saying go try to be funny nowadays with this woke culture so i go how do i do something irreverent oh i know let s take the comic book movie universe and turn it on its head mr yang goes on to declare that after watching joker it s easy to decode what phillips really meant in this quote going on to compare it to what he said fired snl cast member shane gillis meant when he excused his repeated use of racist misogynist and homophobic slurs as pushing boundaries it draws from the same well of resentment that trump strums with his racist rhetoric at his rallies the fear of no longer being at the center of the political social and cultural universe with everyone who isn t you positioned at its perceived edges after all being racist sexist and anti gay only pushes boundaries if you define yourself as normal and define nonwhite non male and non straight people as marginalized outsiders mr yang claims mr yang then all but declares trump is joker trump won by using outrageous statements theatrical posturing and grimacing mockery to generate raucous mob energy the very opposite of law and order white men in particular responded to his rhetoric and persona seeing in him a disruptor of oppressive correctness who could lead them back to the top of the heap and the center of the world he writes then the writer goes even further at the end of the movie a triumphant fleck seemingly dead but magically revived by the cheers of a throng of clown masked rioters does a grotesque soft shoe on top of a shattered cop car literally dancing on the destroyed remains of the rule of law imagine fleck as trump shrugging off impeachment rebounding with his roaring red hatted supporters winning reelection against every prediction and probability it seems impossible but liberals see mr trump in everything or at least the sufferers of tds do and that s every bit as scary as joker joseph curl covered the white house and politics for a decade for the washington times he can be reached at emailprotected and on twitter j
