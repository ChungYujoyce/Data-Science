the coronavirus pandemic 113 were black or hispanic of the 374 summonses from march 16 to may 5 a vast majority 300 were given to black and hispanic new yorkers so begins anew york times editorial that recoils at the predictable consequences of a policy thatthe new york times supports when the government orders people under the threat of hefty fines to stop working stay home except for approved purposes wear face masks in public avoid non essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason and keep their distance from each other it charges police with enforcing those edicts the resulting encounters may lead to criminal charges such as disorderly conduct unlawful assembly and obstructing governmental administration given the long record of racially skewed law enforcement by the new york police department nypd it is not at all surprising that the people who bear the brunt of mandatory social distancing are overwhelmingly black and latino thetimes does not like that result videos of some of the arrests are hard to watch inone posted to facebooklast week a group of some six police officers are seen tackling a black woman in a subway station as her young child looks on she s got a baby with her a bystander shouts police officials told the daily news the woman had refused to comply when officers directed her to put the mask she was wearing over her nose and mouth contrast that with photographs across social media showing crowds of sun seekers packed into parks in wealthy whiter areas of the city lounging undisturbed as police officershand out masks without a significant course correction the police department s role in the pandemic may look more and more like stop and frisk the policing tactic that led to the harassment of hundreds of thousands of innocent people most of them black and hispanic while rarely touching white new yorkers mayor bill de blasio has scoffed at the comparison though it s not clear why the course correction suggested by the times a public health corps consisting of specially trained civilians who would fan out across the neighborhoods and parks helping with pedestrian traffic control and politely encouraging new yorkers entering parks to protect one another by wearing masks and keeping their distance presents problems of its own while those specially trained civilians presumably would be less likely than police officers to tackle beat and tase people for perceived violations of covid 19 precautions the potential for violence would still exist what would a member of this public health corps do if a parkgoer says he intends to keep his distance from other people but is not willing to wear a mask since he correctly views the risk of virus transmission in an uncrowded open air environment as negligible fun fact in new york a masked person who congregates in a public place with other persons so masked is guilty ofloitering a violation punishable by up to 15 days in jail the times says the police department would play only a minimal role in this approach but if cops serve as a backstop in responding to recalcitrant pedestrians we are back to a situation in which social distancing rules are enforced by blatantly violating them through the physical contact and close proximity required to arrest book and jail people which puts them in an environment where the risk of catching covid 19 is especially high we also have to allow for the possibility that disputes between social distancing encouragers who may not be as polite as they are supposed to be and uncooperative targets some of whom will be indignant and perhaps belligerent will escalate into physical altercations that dangeris by no means theoretical the times cannot have it both ways if covid 19 precautions are mandatory they must at some point be legally enforced with all the risks that entails including violence and racial discrimination the public health payoff might justify those risks in certain contexts if a dense crowd happens to gather in central park for instance or if subway riders refuse to wear masks although that was the situation in the video that the times cites as evidence of overkill but the risks cannot be eliminated if voluntary compliance is less than perfect as it always will be police officers charged with enforcing mask wearing and social distancing requirements have to constantly weigh the costs of forcible intervention against the likely benefits as the times notes it is not a task they welcome this situation is untenable says patrick lynch president of the new york city police benevolent association the nypd needs to get cops out of the social distancing enforcement business altogether but that effectively means mandates will become recommendations and while most people probably will follow those recommendations out of concern for their own welfare if not out of consideration for others some won t thetimes can t will away that tradeoff by pretending it does

will be red state rubes clinging to their guns bibles and that silly and outdated constitution an assumption with no basis in fact sort of like the assumption that mandatory enforcement of arbitrary executive diktats would be a win for civil liberties eh now that shaquan along with cletus is getting his skull bashed in it s obviously a problem sarah y jassica start making money this time spend more time with your family relative by doing jobs that only require for you to have a computer and an internet access and you can have that at your home start bringing up to 65oo to 7ooo a month i ve started this job and earnhandsome income and now i am exchange it with you so you can do it too you can check it out here read artilces in details you can t be that naive if they don t want to enforce the rules evenly as they are being done now the alternative is what exactly target a different demographic group to the exclusion of others it s not that the concept of government imposed social distancing is flawed it s just that the wrong people were doing the imposition in those instances we simply need to find the right people to bring the populace to heel i mean to convince them to engage in voluntary compliance with guidelines what we need is top men but the people in control seem a lot more like bottom men when does the media ever take responsibility for the unintended predictable as they may be consequences of the policies they endorse it only counts if it goes the way they thought it would incidentally this ronan farrow brouhaha is going to be hilarious the pot kettling is going to be off the charts should be fun to see how the russia hoax mongers come at him the idea that they are even remotely afraid of looking like hypocrites died with the tara reade story says the guy who supports the president taxing me by unconstitutional executive orders that s pretty rich says the guy who hasn t said shit about excise taxes i am against sin taxes so nardz have you changed your mind on the subject to gg my argument stands as the following for unconstitutional nature of tariffs power to lay taxes rest in congress per the constitution article i section 8 clause 1 no constitutional amendment has changed that the people vested that power into the hands of congress not the executive the president and congress have no authority to alter the constitution without passing an amendment ergo any law or eo that says otherwise must be unconstitutional well have fun with that i m pro tariff wasn t always but reading articles and comments here has pushed me firmly in that direction maybe think about what that implies about yall s arguments what the fuck are you talking about sometimes people who are persistent on violating rules that are for their own protection as well as that of others have to be dealt with more harshly that s the bottom line if it means that persistent scofflaws in this instant get arrested jailed fined or even roughed up a little bit so be it let these people learn their lesson i don t give a rat s ass who they are or about their ethnicity or color at least you re not racially disparate in your love of authoritarianism so i guess there s that yeah who cares if a few niggers get beat up as long as your feelings are protected from injury sometimes people who are persistent on violating rules that are for their own protection up yours with a rusty running chain saw slaver once the times figures out how to do so it will explain to us how noncompliance is donald trump s fault it must be because of the big surge in black support for trump i came across a clip from crowder yesterday which i thought expressed the sentiment on this whole cv19 thing pretty well sure initially when we didn t have enough data precautions were taken people were concerned about the virus but as data has come in and the models turned out to be wrong ferguson turned out to be crazy wrong it s pretty clear that the good nature of the american public has been preyed upon i don t think i ve heard a better breakdown of the current situation crowder has been presenting the argument quite well in my opinion the entire response has now become an exercise in perpetual goalpost shifting from two weeks to flatten the curve to things will never be normal again and everyone must stay in their homes until there is a cure is such an absurd shift that you really have to be quite the moron not to notice the sleight of hand and this really is a red blue divide blue states are fucked the lockdowns are never going to end and they were never intended to be temporary the thing i noted from the beginning of this was as data comes in governments should be able to adjust their precautionary measures in real time they re not and they re stubbornly refusing to a real case of the cure being far worse than the disease sadly this guy gets it without question i think that stubbornly refusing to is assuming that they aren t living the power that have given themselves wrong grandma baby killer some kid has it in podunk iowa so therefore the rest of the country must be locked down in perpetuity now take your government pittance and stop complaining that fuddruckers is closed nazi if the times really believed the social distancing mask wearing rules were necessary to stop the spread of a killer virus it would be glad that the police were trying so hard to protect minority communities and would complain or maybe approve that the police didn t seem to care about white people infecting each other bingo but they re so caught up in disparate analysis that this conclusion escapes them voluntary cooperation is fine as long as everybody cooperates with the mandatory volunteering the times likes the idea that the government has the authority to beat you to death for whatever reason it came up with that day it just doesn t like it when people see what that actually looks like they d really prefer it if we all just voluntarily followed the orders our betters gave us otherwise we force our betters to beat us into submission it really hurts our betters more than it hurts us when this kind of thing happens this can t be stated enough it s the stupid dichotomy that the times editorial position has found itself in stop and frisk implemented on the basis of gun control yay stop and frisk resulting in minorities being disproportionately hassled and arrested boo they d really prefer it if we all just voluntarily followed the orders our betters gave us otherwise we force our betters to beat us into submission we make them beat us by making them angry when they don t get what they want oh and walk on eggshells in case you say the wrong thing these fuckers seriously want a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with the rest of us ain t no life like being a battered wife that s the inevitable result of catering to narcissists the time just doesn t like it because the wrong people are being targets if the cops were to only abuse white men who voted for trump they d be ok with it the police department s role in the pandemic may look more and more like stop and frisk the policing tactic that led to the harassment of hundreds of thousands of innocent people well we are all being treated like we are guilty infected forcing non infected people to wear makes is harassing the innocent this is the left in a nutshell they simply do not care about anyone who doesn t toe the moving line it s like dealing with uncompromising robots if you keep voting for these schmucks this is what you re gonna get i still define progressivism as using the coercive power of the state to force people to make sacrifices for what they think is the greater good i ve often wondered if they completely oblivious to what it means to use the coercive power of the state or whether they re faking it assuming they re faking it is giving them the benefit of the doubt if they re really so pathetic that they don t realize that using the government to make people do things against their will involves sending guys with guns to drag people away and lock them in cages i don t know how to persuade them to stop doing that it s like politely asking someone to stop stabbing you in the chest i usually assume that the progressives in power running things are faking it the clintons and the schumers pelosis of the world the average progressive voter doesn t see past their stated intent they don t measure anything by what actually happens just the things that politicians say in their stump speeches and when they re in softball interviews on corporate news networks republicans used to do the same thing with their whole fiscal conservative schtick for both parties the masks have almost completely come off counter intuatively while we all realize more and more that these people are all dishonest grifters we are constantly giving them more and more power and control to keep it from the other side it s become a very lose lose situation i don t believe for a second that the leftards give a shit about the greater good what they want is free shit and to see people they don t like get persecuted by the government jcr they only feign outrage for their own gain they re clearly just continuing to push their agenda lockdowns are racist public health corps consisting of specially trained civilians no just no do not create a new permanent tsa of pandemic police but the tsa has been so effective at stopping terrorism how could you disagree with the new public health administration they can employ hundreds of thousands maybe millions of enforcers to patrol america s streets and ensure that no one is doing anything unhealthy you don t want people to get sick do you also just think of how many jobs will be created and so we can recognize them and offer them our thanks they could wear brown shirts with contrasting armbands the times is envisioning something like this https babylonbee com news de blasio announces system for reporting social distancing violations knowledgeable actors reporting edict noncompliance karen 1 if you are sick the cdc says you should wear a facemask when you are around other people e g sharing a room or vehicle and before you enter a healthcare provider s office but if you are not sick it adds you do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick and they are not able to wear a facemask 2 a randomized trial of face masks involving about 7 700 hajj participants in mecca had less promising results at the end of the study which was reported in the lancet last year the subjects who received masks most of whom used them intermittently or not at all were just as likely to have viral respiratory infections as those who did not last year was 2019 most people in c19 panicked 2020 wear their mask intermittently or just plain wrong like over their mouth only or hanging around their neck 3 why masks and anti social distancing still looking for a no bullshit answer to that one could it be that the masks work as intended but only when used as intended and most people don t use them as intended so we all really need mandatory classes on how to wear masks after fashioning them ourselves from old clothes then we ll all be ok the masks don t work if you are coughing sneezing or are near someone who is coughing sneezing then wearing a mask is effective at blocking coughs and sneezes if you are performing surgery then wearing a mask is effective at blocking coughs and sneezes into the open body cavities of your patients if you are going to walmart then your fucking bandana is 100 useless it is a magic talisman of virus repelling and nothing more 3 the effects of stacked mitigations are cumulative a properly positioned mask reduces the spread of your sneeze or cough by a factor and distancing reduces it by a different factor the two together reduce the exposure of a second person to your possibly virus laden output by the product of the two factors if the second person also is using a correctly positioned mask it will reduce his or her exposure by a third factor although a fairly small one i think that it would be preferable if folks would just voluntarily wear masks in public businesses where employees of the business are being constantly exposed it is the polite thing to do imo i suppose one could argue that those exposed employees should not work there if they don t want to get infected easier said than done though when they risk unemployment as a result it might also get the feds off our back sooner to just do a few simple things to attenuate the spread while having a fully opened economy though i would not mandate it a randomized trial of face masks involving about 7 700 hajj participants in mecca these are people who wipe their ass with their hand the braintrust at the times and vox based aca healthcare subsidies on median income i m sure they ll come up with mandates and bans based on median melanin levels problem solved in my dreams the nypd swat kicks in the doors to the nyt and beats down everyone in sight asset forfeitures the presses and the computers and books them all for loitering arresting someone for unlawful assembly in the absence of violent action by the persons being arrested is unconstitutional the first amendment guarantees the right to assemble peaceably the word except is not in it if the people are peaceful and on private property they have a right to assemble state laws regardless of how well intentioned they may be do not supersede the us constitution like everything else in the world of liberalism it s good intentions that count if they think they had good intentions they can feel good about themselves and consider themselves more virtuous than the rest of us unintended consequences simply necessary collateral damage if there wasn t a racial angle the times wouldn t even be sweating it the nypd should forget this ticky tack stuff anyway and get busy tracking down all the criminals the genius deblasio released this situation is untenable says patrick lynch president of the new york city police benevolent association the nypd needs to get cops out of the social distancing enforcement business altogether if the problem is indeed as the nyt claims racist cops then the problem surely is getting rid of racist cops of course the assumption by the times implicitly endorsed by reason that racial group overrepresentation in law enforcement actions implies police bigotry is at best a hypothesis in need of evidence there are numerous possible reasons for that such overrepresentation might occur one is bias and another is that members of different groups may sometimes behave differently in ways relevent to law enforcement when you have over 90 enforcement on two groups that make up 53 of the population when you have a long history of racially biased enforcement there are also large groups of people that were clearly visible on news reports that were neither arrested or ticketed i m sorry but nypd has lost the assumption of innocence on this one everyone knows this the fact that the black community disrespects and fears the police not without reason does make matters worse but who can blame them i m too lazy right now to look it back up but i recall reading a few years back about a study on searches of cars after a traffic stop iirc this was in florida cars with black drivers were twice as likely as cars driven by white motorists to get searched however and this is the interesting part once a search was started they were twice as likely to find contraband in the cars of white drivers anyone who questions the lockdown is a serial killer i m no lawyer but i m pretty sure that s how the law works the ban it committee never seems to put two and two together to figure that every regulation is ultimately backed by a cop s nightstick and gun you just mandate something and it happens that s their limited thinking when national prohibition made beer the old crack cops immediately began killing americans who proceeded to give as good as they got amid the crashing economy nullification replaced enforcement in 1923 and the economy revived but since the law was on the side of terrified eugenicists they ramped up coercion in 1929 until by feb 1933 every bank was closed the real problem germ labs in communist china these muggers struggle to ignore if you need a corp of polite attendants to gently nudge people into submission instead of police tactics perhaps you ve already gone way overboard in trying to micromanage outcomes marginal results are the best you re going to get any attempt beyond that is just an invitation for events like this let s face it this is the only event that s happening people incarcerated for not wearing a mask with 10 efficacy when you illegally make formerly legal activity illegal it increases the amount of people getting locked up for illegal activity whoddathunkit if people who don t wear masks are grandma killers then they need should be dragged away from the site and taken to jail if the perp was infected he or she could infect dozens around him with a single sneeze of course the very notion is ridiculous and even some sheriffs recognize it the left championed a response to a pandemic that mandated unquestioning participation by the masses and officers of the law would have to shut down any violators for the good of the public why do they create a crisis all on their own and then demand nuance when it comes to bite them in them in the ass usd55 an hour seriously i don t know why more people haven t tried this i work two shifts 2 hours in the day and 2 in the evening and whats awesome is im working from home so i get more time with my kids heres where i went http www dollars9 com 113 arrests and 300 citations in a city of 8 000 000 people who cares besides you deserve to get your ass kicked for walking around on public without a mask but but racial disparities of the 125 people arrested over offenses that law enforcement officials described as related to the coronavirus pandemic 113 were
