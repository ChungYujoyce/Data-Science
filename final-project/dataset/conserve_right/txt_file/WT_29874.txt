their government said rep james mcgovern massachusetts democrat most americans are tired of the constant threat of a looming shutdown and so am i it was a speedy end to a spending fight that lasted months saw the longest government shutdown on record and whose outcome wasn t assured until the last minute racing against a friday deadline for another shutdown negotiators didn t strike a deal until monday and didn t release the details of the plan until thursday morning at 12 13 a m unveiling a 1 169 page bill and a 609 page accompanying report less than 16 hours later senators were voting lawmakers acknowledged the frenetic and bizarre process but they said the package was likely as good as negotiators could do amid the newly divided government and that enduring a second shutdown would be unthinkable a we should pass whatever it takes to get out of a shutdown and b we should never let this happen to us again said sen johnny isakson georgia republican no one got everything they wanted on border security the issue that sparked the original shutdown mr trump only got 1 375 billion for border barriers less than the 5 7 billion he d asked but more than democrats zero dollar ante democrats also caved on their demand to cap the number of illegal immigrants that can be detained by immigration and customs enforcement ice yet the bill contains stunning new limits on some deportations ice is banned from detaining or removing any illegal immigrant who lives in a household where someone is looking to take in an unaccompanied alien child analysts said that will spark a

plenty to like in the bill sen patrick j leahy democrats leading senate negotiator touted a boost in funding for the epa and support for national parks and said the package rejects anti science know nothingism of the trump administration by supporting money for scientific research this is what a compromise looks like said mr leahy vermont democrat this is how the american people expect our government to function not by tweets but by reasonable reality based compromise sen chris van hollen touted money to protect the chesapeake bay 150 million for the washington area subway system a 1 9 percent pay increase for civilian federal employees and the certainty of funding for the rest of the year the trump shutdown the longest in history was a political temper tantrum that wreaked havoc on our country said mr van hollen maryland democrat while it s not perfect this spending agreement represents major progress republicans meanwhile said they were happy to have beat back democrats attempt to cut the number of illegal immigrants ice could detain and said they managed to get more wall money than democrats had said they would allow the budget deal is a down payment on the wall provides funding for more immigration judges and does not include a cap on detention beds for violence illegal immigrant offenders said sen lindsey graham south carolina republican while homeland security money was the battleground it was just one of nine departments spanning dozens of agencies caught in the shutdown fight the new bill also includes full 2019 funding for nasa and the epa the justice and state departments the national park service and the smithsonian the commerce department is getting a 1 billion boost to prepare for the 2020 census the irs is also getting a slight boost compared to 2018 as the agency grapples with processing americans returns for the first full tax year after the gop s 2017 tax cut the national endowment for the arts and the epa are seeing increases and there s 9 billion for new transportation infrastructure projects funding boosts were made possible by a deal congress struck a year ago to lift strict spending caps by about 300 billion collectively in 2018
