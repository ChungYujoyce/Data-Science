gary johnson said that it was game over if he was not included in the first 2016 presidential debate on sept 26 given that the democratic republican controlled nonpartisan commission on presidential debates cpd will choose the debate roster in mid september based on a five agency polling average that currently sits at 8 8 percent well short of the required 15 percent for johnson the irresistible force of the lp s debate centric focus has been on a collision course with the immovable object of the cpd s unreasonably high threshold until it seems this afternoon no matter how much independent bent political celebrities such as mitt romney arnold schwarzenegger and mitch daniels support the l p ticket being included in the debates and no matter how much that motion is seconded by solid majorities of the american voting public rules are rules and when said rules are written by the republican and democratic parties libertarians are screwed unless vice presidential nominee william weld told me this afternoon the mounting outrage at the rigged system is married to the sight of the two candidates outside every debate venue making a mockery of the proceedings inside by answering every question simultaneously only better so i m no longer so sure that it s game over if we re not in the debates weld told me i think there s going to be kind of a national uproar if we re not in the debates and we will join in that uproar and be standing together on the street corner outside every debate venue answering the same questions as in the debate in real time you know putting it out on facebook live weld made the same promise during his address at a midtown manhattan rally this afternoon which was attended by 500 plus enthusiastic supporters we ve seen that the little videos that we record in 90 seconds are seen by 15 18 million people in a matter of less than two weeks he told me so that kind of free media attention might continue all the way from now until november 8th as a result of our exclusion that would be a substitute at least in part for being in the debates and it would give us the high ground it s ground that i think we could occupy with some happiness

over weld you authoritarian p o s authoritarian point of sale no authoritarian piece of siv while i can understand yet totally disagree with you cosmofags crushing on gayjay don t try and tell me you find anything good about his running mate weld s less evil than pence and keane he s also older then johnson so unlikely to be president or have any power unlike the other two whose presidents would be amongthe oldest in history there is that something anything i report you don t get to decide for me or anyone else he has an l next to his name that s good enough for me baby steps he doesn t like siv i m making over 15k a month working part time i kept hearing other people tell me how much money they can make online so i decided to look into it well it was all true and has totally changed my

cpd is a national joke the cleveland police dept cpd is not a joke it s an abomination tamir rice when they clash with the bureau of land management it s going to get ugly they own the upper west side about 245 million acres of it this alt right is alright perhaps they should start marketing i m deplorable and i m proud t shirts next they can have deplorable pride marches and demonstrations you could put half of trump supporters into what i call the basket of deplorables this is what hate speech looks like hitlery hates americans 2346 huh anybody care to shed light on that number someone left out the 5 rainman the demographic that johnson needs to win over probably does not even know what facebook live is or how to access it in the offchance that a small percentage of them are able to access it seeing a man with presidential aspirations resorting to live streaming on facebook will likely solidify the idea that he is not a serious candidate we know this from experience as gj employed this exact same tactic when he was running for the republican nomination in 2012 he would stream responses to the debate questions on youtube and it made him look like an amateur who on earth knows the third parties need to try what they can against the duopoly nobody would call hillary an amateur yet it won t necessarily help her being a professional politician the demographic that johnson needs to win over probably does not even know what facebook live is or how to access it what demographic is this the elderly people who have what used to sometimes be called a life people who get out of their basement once in a while and have some clue about how to effectively communicate with other human beings face to face exactly the elderly wait what shakes fist at kids on lawn perhaps not as likely voters but millennials are the largest eligible voting demographic emphasize the pot legalization that s what drew me to the libertarian party then i read mises hayek friedman spooner etc their writing convinced me that sort of tactic is exactly what prez candidates need to do if they get shut out their only possible stage is a national stage so if one avenue is blocked they have to take another the reason it doesn t end up accomplishing much is because libertarian activists don t do what only they can do local retail work to show that a third party vote is viable even if it is just a protest in real life absent that voters will almost always end up choosing the lesser of two evils because no one wants to be the only person doing something if libertarians want people to vote libertarian they have to show that they exist that s it they don t need to sell people on a philosophy just demonstrate that you exist i enjoy being the only person doing something zfg that s true but on net the libertarian party is an impediment to your showing up that way probably true given two choices of where to canvass for votes a woodstock festival with a few hundred thousand or an unannounced unmarketed bring your own drum and bang it to your own beat party the lp will only see the opportunity in the latter star pringled boob rivers and stupendous slathered praise sandwiches lofted by bored pigeons in gold disco pants into the piehole of jebus also super duper transfixated awe for yet another fucking goddamn decade of completely fucking worthless 90 second eye gaze by the constipated gazillions turned aimlessly toward the muffled throttled shriek slipping from mysterious edges of goddamn dark space lined like graffiti punk eyeball anger around the smashing vertical grind of the ass jacking fuckslime establishment john wayne cancer boot yeah well i guess you could say that about sums it up clerk that is an excellent draft opinion your honor why don t i just polish it just a little and you can issue it peevish crimped anal people with lips like ice screech entire crowds of haranguing starlings when their goddamn screw gets bent noticeably against their grain of a thousand predetermined visions fuck the hell that will fall on all our soaring heads when that goddamn billionaire police witch gets the total giuliani lsd but the crepe cunt and her parasitic millennial fleshbots smithered alongside fried reason and voice tones yapping on the medias purposely melted from the curling insidious yawning hell of civilization skinning socialism is a long haul scrawping deep into the gaping ass of volcanic fuckery the important thing we have to remember here is that the senator speaks with absolute sincerity no holds barred though i don t think you jackals in the media appreciate that explain to me why cal is shitting the bed i think drugs are the only way to figure it out at this point cal who worthington coolidge o mein cal worthington and his dog spot make california great again the total giuliani lsd must be terrifying i get your drift blm context i like music that s made with real instruments like guitars pianos saxophones drums harmonicas fiddles horns basses theremins organs etc this one isn t but it s not bad this shit will fuck you up killer if you like free jazz hardcore broken electronic devices and juvenile humor why you ll just love kid606 he hits that you never knew was there sweet spot in between the pretentious electronic music guy who takes his shit way too seriously and the mindless guido techno dj who just wants a pumping beat and some synth stabs better plan than being on stage with the two monkeys the spectacle of it will draw more attention to it might even get more viewers than the staged affair he also gets to answer every question not just the bones thrown by the d r moderator i d never waste my time on the staged affair but i might just watch his alternate answers at the gym tonight dumbass 10ft away apparently forgot his headphones so decided to bless the room with his crappy music another millennial turd that should have been flushed i think the problem with most of these narcissistic young cretins of today is that they never got the proper ass kicking that they probably should have it s never too late to take proper corrective measures though it used to be that if parents didn t teach their precious snowflakes how the world worked it fell to the first employer to finish the job of raising with youth unemployment being what it is knocking heads in the gym may be society s last hope you think millennials are bad wait until you see how their kids behave i have a friend who s an elementary school music teacher who says that every year she spends more of her time having to settle the kindergarteners down and get them to stop hitting each other tumbling around and making weird noises and less actually teaching music they come in never having been taught to sit still or play nice at home the parents apparently think that s school s job at least they re still housebroken for the most part i wouldn t cite gym etiquette as the battle ground of the generations each generation sucks in its own unique way at it upto i saw the receipt of 6105 i have faith that my sister woz like realy earning money part time at there computar there sisters neighbour started doing this for only a year and resantly cleard the depts on there appartment and bourt a great citro n 2cv check http www work jobss1 com looks like spambot has been fed agile cyborg for its machine learning course sloppy i see exactly what the error is but just don t think anybody including me cares enough to even finish this sentence lighten up anyone can misspell their occasionally i haven t n t read anybody s comment since like 9 denver time so maybe it s already been posted but vox yes i said vox actually gets it right also if i were to end my post at the word right is there any reason to add the lesser than a greater than at the end or is it just more tidy that way i believe so its how you tell the computer that the link is complete and what follows is not link if you don t use the close bracket then it will drop the rest of the text because it assumes that what follows the open bracket is an improperly formatted command that less than greater than with whatever is inside it is a command to the computer the brackets are what tells the computer where to start and where to stop reading the command humans can figure out where the beginning and the end of a sentence is even if the sentence doesn t start with a capital letter like it s supposed to and the period gets left off and they can figure out what you mean if you missspel a word or accidentally a word computers can t you have to specifically tell the computer where to start and stop and if you misspell or accidentally omit a word the computer doesn t work right vox was created by some stupid people with bad intent but a lot of their stuff is contributed so individual writers may or may not be stupid people with bad intent a lot of that stuff could have come straight out of the reason posts on the same subjects when we react rashly to a tragedy by pushing through poorly conceived policy we are likely to suffer for decades from the unintended consequences of that law let s be thoughtful and deliberate before rushing to enact major policy responses to isolated crimes no matter how angry they make us most of the people calling for policy changes in response to brock turner are well meaning and rightfully seek to enhance protections for women and prevent sexual assault crimes but it s our responsibility not to allow that good will to create bad law there s a general priciple involved there you don t really solve problems you just make trade offs every solution to one problem creates other problems and those problems might not be foreseeable or easily dealt with be careful what you wish for game over man game over in other news john hinckley is now a full time member of my local community hides jodie foster dvds what horrible times we live in instead of reagan we have trump instead of jodi foster we have lena dunham instead of john hinckley have joe scarborough future headline joe scarborough shot president trump today in an attempt to impress his favorite actress lena dunham marijuana strikes again u s authorities have arrested two north carolina men accused of hacking into the private email accounts of high ranking u s intelligence officials andrew otto boggs a k a incursio 22 of north wilkesboro n c and justin gray liverman a k a d3f4ult 24 of morehead city n c were arrested thursday morning and will be extradited next week to alexandria where federal prosecutors for the eastern district of virginia have spent months building a case against a group that calls itself crackas with attitude one member told cnn that he smoked marijuana all day every day and was probably high when gaining access to high level accounts boy our bumbling intelligence apparatus can sure get the job done when they re the target can t they well in answer to rc s speculation nbc and msnbc are airing a memorial now that the today show is on they are re airing their live footage cbs is airing the memorial apparently i don t get cnn fox is rearing its live report from 2001 including the footage of the impacts and the people jumping from the towers update mrs suthenboy showed me how to find cnn they are airing the memorial and then obumbles speech i can hardly wait to hear his lecturing and scolding the nation over islamophobia also cnn is interviewing cankles about her memory from that fateful day so basically they are using this as another chance to boost the democrats she was in the tower and flew many people to safety on her broomstick sorry that was totally inappropriate not really eddie she spent a good bit of time describing how she rushed to the scene and braved the terrible conditions to help everyone she could so you aren t that far off well by rushing their for the photo ops she was ensuring herself a ratings boost so she could stay in congress to help all kinds of people influential donors foreign governments and corporations etc here s the answer i want to hear johnson give every time he s asked what he plans to do about this that or the other problem every politician will tell you they have a solution to that problem and they re either a liar or an idiot first if there were a simple solution why haven t the democrats or the republicans who have been working on solving that problem for so many years been able to solve it doesn t that tell you that the problem is not so easily solvable as they would have you believe i m not going to stand here and lie to you tell you i have an easy solution there are no easy solutions but i will tell you that the republicans and the democrats have collectively spent trillions of dollars not solving problems and i m smart enough to know not solving problems should be cheaper than that so no i don t have an easy answer to that but i can tell you i won t create the worse problem of spending trillions of dollars we don t have trying to fix it let s grow up here people admit there s no magic flying unicorn going to come along wave a magic wand and cheaply and easily solve our problems that s not an option our options are two allow people the freedom to pursue their own individual methods in addressing the problem as best they can and trust that someone somewhere is going to come up with a solution everyone will voluntarily flock to adopting or we have men with guns threaten to shoot you in the head if you resist having someone else substitute their opinions for how best to deal with the problem for your own i submit to you that the second approach is a cure worse than the disease and i m not going to prescribe it freedom has worked wonderfully for finding the best solutions to problems because the best solutions are the ones people will freely choose to adopt of their own accord no matter how good you may believe a particular solution is if it starts off requiring a law to force people to adopt it it s a very bad solution i might also add why is it that with their long track record of failing to solve problems the democrats and republicans are given repeated chances to solve problems on the assumption that they deserve a chance to try whereas libertarians are commanded to show their work demanded to explain how exactly their proposals are going to work before they re even allowed a chance to try their hand at dealing with the problem after giving the others repeated chances to try and having only failure and a huge tax bill to show for it what have you got to lose by giving us a chance the politics of failure have failed we must make them work again is there a change org petition to let them in the debates obama said he d fix any problem with enough signatures right the president has too much respect for the first amendment to interfere with the activities of a nonpartisan organization such as the respected impartial commission on presidential debates there will always be disagreements over the inclusion of this or that candidate and i may not agree with the commission on every decision but it is not my job as president to second guess this private organization at least we could tout the number though if it were high x million people want to see them in the debates is more convincing than mitt romney wants them in the debates first time i ve ever dipped my toes into the change org site trigger warning the waters are infested with sj ideas of the debate related ones that are out there include all qualified candidates in 2016 presidential debates at least petitions the cpd it currently has 8 400 supporters for comparison we want jon stewart to moderate a 2016 presidential debate has 340 000 supporters a petition to add just jill stein to the debates has 64 000 supporters a petition to allow the libertarian candidate to debate in the general election has 3 800 supporters politico runs hit piece against comey in retaliation for not being sufficiently compliant to his future queen these concerns were only whispered about until july when the fbi director s public disposition of the hillary clinton email investigation stoked national controversy since then even some of comey s supporters have been forced to concede that his exercise of power has been without precedent in the post hoover era among dozens of current and former justice department officials this realization has given way to a rising sense of alarm that our next president will find comey just as untouchable as hoover once was and perhaps nearly as troublesome highlight of the hit piece is the entire thing was written by riley roberts a former speechwriter for eric holder the attorney general has a speechwriter does the secretary of the interior get a speechwriter too the new york times is hilarious bill clinton after a year of restraint unleashes an impassioned self defense but the focus on the clinton foundation which has come under escalating scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest and foreign donations has rankled him far more according to those close to the former president because of his deep personal investment in the foundation s charitable work over the past 15 years in a series of swing state appearances this week mr clinton unleashed an impassioned self defense by turns sarcastic and almost pleading all we ve done is save lives he told voters on monday in detroit if creating jobs and saving lives is bad mr clinton said in orlando the next day i guess you can zing me with it moments later he wondered aloud how much money mr trump had spent to help the people of haiti trump s response if alls they ve done is save lives it should be easy to trot out someone an actual honest to god human being who has been helped by the clinton foundation besides a friend of the clinton s who ended up on the payroll i mean their most high profile endeavor was haiti and haitians are probably protesting outside their ny office right now over the abuse the donald is rather pear shaped out of his suits weld comes off as little more than a sore loser in this piece the cpd set an objective standard for inclusion in the debates and johnson weld failed to meet it what standard do johnson and weld think the cpd should use for inclusion let me guess whatever cutoff would allow them into the debates but keep the greens out or should they include everybody who claims to be running for president on equal footing so that johnson shares the stage with jill stein once she gets out of lockup the prohibition party the constitution party the natural law party etc not only would that be a chaotic mess it would hurt johnson by negating his claim to be the only alternative to clinton and trump perhaps a more rational approach is being qualified for sufficient ballots to reach 270 that might work but it would put the greens and possibly the constitution party on the stage too that would be bad for johnson whose main campaign slogan seems to be i m not clinton or trump possibly the greens i suspect not the constitution party but i m spouting here without looking it up sure if they qualify they ought to be there lets face it even if he did get on the stage the moderators would almost never throw johnson a bone the opening question would be how does it feel being on the debate stage with the big kids trump and clinton would ask why he was wasting everyone s time stalling to avoid more questions no one would shut the fuck up about aleppo at least here he has the time to give a well thought out answer by his standards anyway to each question and he ll probably draw a decent crowd outside work oppertunity start your work at home right now spend

https www joinmate2 com they took in over a million dollars on saturday 11 september 2016 in tiny donations their numbers and support have been steadily rising despite the declaration that they are doomed because gary said he didn t know aleppo most people including those in govt don t know they are looking for any reason to screw us pot heads whack jobs fools etc truth be told they are talking to themselves our folks are more excited than ever same for trump hillary lacks any momentum her people are voting if they actually do so with their noses pinched she is the least beloved most scripted candidate in years her only rallying point trump is worse we have 6 weeks to continue to grow and we will in every way weld is right we will take over the streets during the debate and the whole world will watch them answer all the questions this is our moment and we are more and more at the point where it is happening for us we have over 50 000 volunteers help out only 6 weeks to go i meant to write 10 sept so i m no longer so sure that it s game over if we re not in the debates weld told me i think there s going to be kind of a national uproar if we re not in the debates and we will join in that uproar and be standing together on the street corner outside every debate venue answering the same questions as in the debate in real time you know putting it out on facebook live hahahahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahaha the entire point of this campaign was to get into the debates without that their campaign has failed national uproar hahahaahahahahahahhahaaahahhaah so like 10 people on twitter got their panties in a wad because they didn t make the debates don t get me wrong i think it s a travesty that johnson weld aren t going to be at the debates however they re not folk heroes they re 3rd party candidates struggling to stay in double digits yep their reward for selling out libertarianism is going to amount to nothing more than a couple of talk show appearances i never really understood this why don t the news channels hosting the debate just say f you cpd we ll decide who we invite to our events or not who made cpd king it s a private non profit with no real punitive power which is why all the lawsuits against them have failed i know they help fund the events but the news channels could fund it themselves as well bringing gary johnson and jill stein would surely increase viewership and intrigue as well the cpd is a result of an agreement between the major parties to smooth over debate negotiations between their candidates if it did not exist the campaigns would be negotiating between each other directly and still excluding the third parties if the major do not agree to share the stage with third party candidate then you do not get debate img
