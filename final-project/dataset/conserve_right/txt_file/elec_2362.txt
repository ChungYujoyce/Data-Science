floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge fusion gps the research firm commissioned by the clinton campaign to compile the so called trump dossier is also responsible for a second dossier the information that kremlin connected lawyer natalia veselnitskaya provided to top trump campaign officialsin june 2016 the second dossier reportedlyalleged financial misconduct by major contributors to the clinton global initiative a project of the clinton foundation fusion dug up this information in connection with its work in behalf of prevezon a russian company controlled by putin cronies at the time prevezon was the defendant in a multi million dollar asset forfeiture suit brought by the justice department the suit stemmed from the putin regime s fleecing of an investment fund called hermitage years earlier to investigate the russian government s role in the fraud hermitage hired sergei magnitsky a private lawyer in moscow his exposure of the putin regime s complicity led to his imprisonment torture and murder that atrocity led congress to pass the 2012 magnitsky act which allows the federal government to seize and forfeit fraud proceeds this in turn has led to a furious kremlin campaign to smear hermitage s chief executive officer bill browder and to get the magnitsky act repealed in the united states that campaign has been spearheaded by veselnitskaya it was the magnitsky act that the justice department used to sue prevezon veselnitskaya is prevezon s lawyer in moscow and she helped the company retain american counsel to defend them in the suit a lawyer ironically named john moscow and his firm baker hostetler these lawyers hired fusion gps to do research on browder and hermitage for litigation purposes it was in that role that fusion prepared the dossier which as far as we currently know did not actually implicate mrs clinton directly in any misconduct my conjecture is that there are three explanations for what happened here none of which excludes the others a the russians do not understand american political campaigns well enough to appreciate that alleged misconduct by a donor does not hurt a candidate if the candidate is not complicit in the misconduct b the putin regime attempted unsuccessfully to lure the trump campaign into its anti magnitsky act effort by convincing don trump jr and other campaign officials that there was a useful anti clinton angle to be exploited and c the putin regime calculated that simply by taking a meeting with a kremlin emissary on the promise of damaging information about clinton the trump campaign would foolishly expose itself to blackmail by putin veselnitskaya transmitted this second fusion gps dossier to the trump campaign at a june 9 2016 meeting at trump tower the meeting had been set up by don trump jr in a series of communications mostly by email with an intermediary of two putin cronies russian real estate magnate aras agalarov and his pop star son emin as i noted in a washington postop edin july donald trump sr had been a business partner of the agalarovsin connection with the 2013 miss universe pageant the intermediary who spoke with trump jr on behalf of the agalarovs was rob goldstone a british entertainment publicist and trump family friend on june 3 2016 goldstone told trump jr that the agalarovs had learned from the crown prosecutor of russia about some official documents and information that would incriminate hillary and her dealings with russia and would be very useful to your father thus they wanted to transmit this information to the trump campaign as part of russia and its government s support for mr trump trump jr responded if it s what you say i love it after some additional back and forth apparently including a phone call between trump jr and emin agalarov arrangements were made for a russian government attorney who was flying over from moscow to bring the damaging information about hillary clinton to trump tower on june 9 that lawyer was veselnitskaya it has been reportedin recent days that veselnitskaya met with fusion founder glenn simpson both before and after this trump tower confab because fusion had been commissioned by the clinton campaign to produce the so called trump dossier through the campaign s lawyers at perkins coie there was speculation that the trump dossier was the explanation for these meetings between veselnitskaya and simpson if it s what you say i love it to the contrary as i contended in a new york postop ed on tuesday evening it is more plausible that the pair were consulting on what at the time was a more exigent matter of mutual interest the potential disqualification from the asset forfeiture case of the law firm that was representing prevezon and that had hired fusion prevezon is controlled by veselnitskaya s russian clients the katsyvs denis katsyv and his father pyotr a powerful russian transportation official and crony of putin s in her capacity as the company s lawyer in moscow veselnitskaya had helped prevezon retain the american counsel representing it in the forfeiture case john moscow in turn moscow and his firm baker hostetler had hired fusion to do research on the victims who were behind the justice department s suit hermitage and its financial advisory firm hermitage capital management headed by bill browder here at national review we have recently editorializedagainst the placement of browder on an interpol watch list due the putin regime s machinations the revocation of browder s u s visa based on this treachery which our jay nordlinger wrote about hereand here has now been lifted it turns out that fusion s research on browder in connection with the prevezon case developed the information that veselnitskaya transmitted to the trump campaign the billionaire ziff family invests through ziff brothers investments with browder veselnitskaya perceived that there could be grounds for portraying the ziff browder financial dealings as tax evasion forbesreportedback in july this appears to have been part of the energetic kremlin smear of browder as forbeselaborates russia s general prosecutor yuri chaika announced in june 2017 that his agency had presented to u s officials serious evidence of violations of the law by browder and the ziff brothers evidently veselnitskaya and russian officials surmised that these purported violations could cause problems for hillary clinton because the ziff brothers were contributors to the clinton global initiative a clinton foundation project as mark hosenball reportedin reuters on thursday night it was fusion s digging that put together the nexus between browder and the ziff brothers and between the ziff brothers and clinton this appears to have been the grist for the russian government s claim to have damaging information on mrs clinton three trump campaign officials met with veselnitskaya trump jr along with jared kushner the now president s son in law and paul manafort then the campaign manager now a defendantin a case brought by special counsel robert mueller that is unrelated to the 2016 campaign we can easily infer why the trump campaign concluded veselnitskaya s information was useless we do not know what it is about the ziff family s dealings with browder that the russians believed amounted to or could be spun as tax law violations but the trump officials who were under the impression they would be receiving information that incriminated clinton herself would have realized instantly that alleged misconduct by clinton foundation donors would be irrelevant to the campaign if it did not directly involve clinton while it has been reported that veselnitskaya met with fusion s principal glenn simpson before she met went to trump tower on june 9 we do not know whether she picked up this second dossier from simpson or whether they discussed the information in either the clinton browder ziff dossier or the trump dossier according to the reuters report simpson told senate judiciary committee investigators that he met with veselnitskaya about the prevezon litigation but he did not know about veselnitskaya s meeting with trump campaign officials until after it was reported publicly in july 2017 this claim makes sense for the reasons outlined in my new york postcolumn cited above prevezon is controlled by denis katsyv the son of putin crony pyotr katsyv a powerful russian transportation minister prevezon s retention of moscow and baker hostetler was controversial they had represented hermitage capital the very financial fund whose fleecing by russia had led ultimately to the killing of magnitsky in fact this representation of hermitage was in connection with the same matters that lay at the heart of the justice department s forfeiture case against prevezon the putin regime had sought to deflect its culpability in the fraud against hermitage and the death of magnitsky by framing hermitage s chief executive officer bill browder as jay s aforementioned posts detail in attempting to defend themselves from the russian government browder and hermitage had retained baker hostetler s moscow the law firm worked for hermitage for nine months it is against the canons of professional conduct for lawyers who have represented a party on one side of a dispute to then take on the representation of the party on the other side at least in connection with the same dispute here having represented hermitage the fraud victim moscow and baker hostetler were now representing prevezon an alleged participant in the fraud wittingly or not fusion gps helped the putin regime play both sides as one would expect hermitage moved to disqualify moscow and baker hostetler from representing prevezon strangely the u s district court in new york city denied this motion so hermitage appealed to the second circuit u s court of appeals on the morning of june 9 2016 the second circuit heard oral argument in the case veselnitskaya attended this prevezon proceedingin lower manhattan and later proceeded to midtown for her trump tower meeting consequently the disqualification litigation in the prevezon case was the main reason for simpson and veselnitskaya to meet in june 2016 it was of immense importance to both of them because baker hostetler had retained fusion its disqualification would put in doubt fusion s continued participation in the case for veselnitskaya the disqualification of baker hostetler would necessitate finding new american counsel for a client that stood potentially to be held liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in hermitage losses the disqualification would also undermine the kremlin s underhanded effort to use browder s own former lawyers against him in the end it all seems like sound and fury signifying nothing the baker hostetler lawyers were disqualified prevezon with new counsel settled the case in may 2017 for 5 9 million and no admission of responsibility sparing the putin regime the embarrassment of a public trial that would examine the fraud and the magnitsky murder fusion s dossier about clinton foundation donors was never used in the campaign neither was fusion s dossier about donald trump the one compiled for fusion by former british spy christopher steele and later described by then fbi director james comey as salacious and unverified for all the talk about trump collusion with russia it seems increasingly clear that the kremlin as is its wont hoped to undermine the united states government regardless of which party won the white house in 2016 wittingly or not fusion gps helped the putin regime play both sides read more a bipartisan dossier of collusion the manafort indictment not much there and a boon for trump the
