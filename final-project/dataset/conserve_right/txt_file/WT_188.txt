apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump forced white house reporters monday to watch a campaign style clip that argued the media got the coronavirus pandemic wrong and he got it right riveting his core supporters in an election year while sparking cries the commander in chief let his need for praise turn a somber update into an unseemly rally mr trump who consumes a lot of tv news stood to the side while he forced reporters to watch a three minute clip designed to give a public spanking to media pundits who downplayed the risk to the u s right before the president restricted travel from china the source of the outbreak top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century a timeline of mr trump s response rolled across the screen though it had a big gap between feb 6 and march 2 a period of scrutiny during which mr trump held crowded rallies and made a short trip to india the clip then shifted to praise of his china ban from a new york times reporter and clips of governors in both parties calling mr trump and his team outstanding california gov gavin newsom said mr trump returns calls and new york gov andrew cuomo another democrat said he appreciated the president s efforts although he s critiqued the administration just as frequently we were way ahead of schedule mr trump said after the digital scolding remember this everything we did i was criticized because it was too early i don t mind being criticized but not when they re wrong he said mr trump said the clip was pieced together by white house director of social media dan scavino in a period of less than two hours he said he has hundreds of other clips that didn t make it into the final cut cnn and msnbc cut away from coverage of the briefing and the democratic national committee called the move outrageous more than 20 000 americans have died hospitals and states still can t get the supplies they need testing is failing and instead of updating americans on the coronavirus pandemic trump commandeered the briefing to run campaign propaganda to soothe his small ego and pathetically try to cover up for his own failed response the dnc s war room said in a written statement it won t work and the american people deserve better mr trump s supporters ate it up omg trump is using actual media clips during his press conference to clear up the fake news about the pandemic response savage thebradfordfile an account that links to a conservative commentary site wrote mr trump has used the daily briefings to get in front the cameras nearly every day he took easter weekend off after societal restrictions forced him to cancel rallies in an election year and relegated his presumptive opponent former vice president joseph r biden to his delaware basement studio yet monday s briefing had an unusual tone from the start with dr anthony fauci a top national institutes of health scientist coming to the podium to clarify remarks to cnn that resulted in mr trump retweeting a post that said firefauci the president said he won t fire the doctor mr trump who says he s a counter puncher seemed particularly set off by a new york times story on sunday that said the president was warned about the virus early in the year but wasted valuable time in late january and february mr trump has repeatedly highlighted his decision to bar foreign nationals who d been in china for the last 14 days saying the outbreak would have been much worse i think i ve educated a lot of people as to the press mr trump said the administration s response however was dogged early on by notable steps in testing one early test failed and bureaucratic rules kept labs across the country from making their own forcing the administration to scramble to loosen the rules and get diagnostics out critics complained the country was flying blind as the virus spread making it difficult to pinpoint and isolate cases as cbs reporter paula reid pressed mr trump on his efforts to prepare in february after the china ban and before the march closures mr trump said you know you re a fake you know that the coronavirus was discovered in wuhan china in december and killed thousands in east asia before battering europe and the u s nearly 575 000 people have contracted the virus in the u s and over 23 000 have died about 330 million people live in the u s nearly a third of u s deaths have occurred in new york city the epicenter of the domestic crisis mr cuomo reported in 671 new deaths in new york state on monday it was lower than the increases from the previous few days but felt especially painful as the world observed easter to have this happen over this weekend is really really especially tragic mr cuomo said at his daily briefing but the governor said there is definitely a flattening in metrics like intensive care unit icu admissions and new covid 19 related hospitalizations per day he said improving metrics are a direct result of the public s abiding social distancing rules and other virus related restrictions the worst can be over and it is over unless we do something reckless and you can turn those numbers on two or three days of reckless behavior he said it was a similar story in louisiana where officials on monday said the death toll climbed toward 900 but the pace of deaths continued to show signs of tapering the number of hospitalizations another closely watched stat crept up to 2 134 an increase of just 50 people while the percentage of those who need ventilators held steady at 21 from the white house mr trump pivoted from slamming the media to a dry rundown of his latest efforts to get help to the front lines he said remdesivir appears to be a promising drug therapy and cited the millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine that have been dispersed around the country mr trump has pushed the latter drug hard citing anecdotal reports of people who got better and studies that looked at small samples of patients south dakota gov kristi noem said the state is partnering with sanford health a major rural health provider to conduct a statewide clinical trial of the drug enrolling up to 100 000 people with covid 19 from day one i ve said we re going to let the science facts and data drive our decision making in south dakota said ms noem a republican and former congresswoman throughout last week i communicated with white house officials to let them know that south dakota s medical community was ready to step up and lead the way on research efforts the day got off to an awkward start however as the white house was forced to downplay any rift between the president and mr trump who shared a post on twitter late sunday with the hashtag firefauci sorry fake news it s all on tape i banned china long before people spoke up mr trump tweeted as he shared a separate post that said it was time to get rid of the doctor the tweet led to speculation he would oust the doctor who directs infectious disease research at nih has served six presidents and is one of the leading public faces of the federal response to the outbreak the reposted tweet was from deanna lorraine a former candidate for house speaker nancy pelosi s seat in california who got less than 2 of the vote in last month s open primary her post appeared to refer to comments dr fauci had made earlier in the day about whether instituting social distancing measures earlier on could have saved more lives obviously you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier you could have saved lives obviously no one is going to deny that dr fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases said sunday on cnn s state of the union but what goes into those decisions is complicated i mean obviously if we had right from the very beginning shut everything down it may have been a little bit different he said but there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then corners of the conservative twitter sphere have scolded dr fauci for weeks as being too willing to buck the president with some claiming he s part of a deep state that s out to tank mr trump s presidency dr fauci said he was answering a hypothetical as honestly as he could and that mr trump never tried to overrule public health officials recommendations on shuttering the economy the president went with the health recommendations dr fauci told white house reporters the white house said mr trump was trying to defend his own efforts in his tweet that led to the intrigue it was democrats and the media who ignored the coronavirus choosing to focus on impeachment instead and when they finally did comment on the virus it was to attack president trump for taking the bold decisive action to save american lives by cutting off travel from china and from europe deputy press secretary hogan gidley said dr fauci has been and remains a trusted adviser to president trump dr fauci meanwhile said his attempt to clarify things from the podium was by choice everything i do is voluntarily don t even imply that dave boyer and james varne
