apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic momentum is building at the white house for president trump to cut capital gains taxes by executive order allowing him to boost the economy without congress where house democrats would be all but certain to block a legislative proposal sources close to the white house confirm that the president is looking seriously at the idea of issuing an order to index capital gains to inflation which would cut taxes for investors when they sell stock or real estate by taking such action soon advocates in the white house argue the economy would receive a significant boost before november 2020 top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century it would be an enormous stimulus of new capital investment into the economy said economist stephen moore a trump ally and columnist for the washington times i think it would be one of the most stimulative things that trump could do for the economy between now and election day while the total impact isn t known mr moore said you re talking easily hundreds of billions of dollars the risk politically is that an executive order could face a legal challenge people familiar with the matter say the white house has not yet sought a legal opinion president george h w bush considered cutting capital gains taxes without congress in 1992 but treasury department lawyers reportedly said the government lacked the authority democrats criticized the anticipated action by mr trump calling it a giveaway to the wealthy democratic presidential candidates sens bernard sanders of vermont amy klobuchar of minnesota and cory a booker of new jersey are calling for raising the capital gains tax donald trump s primary goal is to further slash taxes for himself and his wealthy political allies said sen ron wyden of oregon top democrat on the senate finance committee this would be plainly illegal it would be outrageous to circumvent congress to again cut the capital gains rate by indexing it to inflation republicans must be nervous about donald trump s reelection chances if they are considering such a drastic step to continue looting the treasury according to the nonprofit tax foundation indexing capital gains for inflation would cut taxes like this if a worker invested 5 000 in the stock market in the year 2000 and that investment had risen to 8 000 last year current law calls for the investor to pay taxes on the entire 3 000 gain but most of the gain about 2 100 was due to inflation by taxing only the 900 gain that wasn t caused by inflation the investor would pay a substantial lower tax alfredo ortiz president and ceo of the conservative job creators network said the potential move would be just the latest big victory for small businesses under the trump administration the capital gains tax exacts a significant toll on small business owners especially considering that it not only applies to asset appreciation but also to the phantom gains associated with inflation mr ortiz said this means the effective capital gains rate is far higher than its stated 23 8 this punishes small businesses for successfully growing their companies the trump administration s plans to take executive action to correct this injustice and index the capital gains tax to inflation would bring additional tax relief to small business owners while adding fuel to the current economic fire

receive more than 86 of the tax cut while 1 of the benefits would go to households in the bottom 80 the study estimated that indexing would reduce tax revenues by 102 billion over the next decade the
