block alfa bank moscow s largest and owned by vladimir putin associates and the trump organization supposedly maintained a secret line of communication via a dedicated computer server the story s prime promoter glenn simpson slate com ran the first pre election alfa story on oct 31 under the headline was a trump server communicating with russia two years later the same allegation appeared in the new yorker was there a connection between a russian bank and the trump campaign mr jones and his assemblage of secretive cyber experts were prime sources for the story which asked more questions than it answered none of the independent experts i spoke to could be certain of what alfa bank and the trump organization were doing the new yorker story reads some of them cautioned that it was impossible even to guess at every way that an e mail system might malfunction a trump organization official told the washington times in 2017 that the root of suspicion lay with a cyber trail to a
