of the house homeland security committee on efforts to pass compromise immigration bill this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday june 24 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace widespread confusion on our southern border is president trump flips on separating immigrant families but doubles down on his zero tolerance policy against those entering the u s illegally begin videotape donald trump president of the united states our first duty and our highest loyalty is to the citizens of the united states we want safety in our country we want border security sen chuck schumer d ny senate minority leader the president must continue to act to deal with these problems which again he can do on his own wallace we aposll discuss what the president will do next and if congress can pass immigration reform with republican congressman michael mccaul chair of the house homeland security committee then do democrats have a solution for how to deal with a flood of illegal immigrants we aposll ask jeh johnson former secretary of homeland security under president obama plus charles krauthammer conservative commentator i believe that ultimately everything hinges on getting your politics right wallace saying goodbye to our friend and colleague charles krauthammer we will ask our panel about his life and legacy and our power player of the week the man behind some of president trump aposs most important nominations you have been called president trump aposs supreme court whisperer how do you plead all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington when president trump signed an executive order this week he said it would solve the sudden firestorm over immigration but at the week aposs end the disarray on our southern border has only grown the president action called for ending the separation of families coming to the u s illegally but there are still questions when 2 000 children will be reunited with relatives the order called for maintaining the president aposs zero tolerance policy but the government is divided about continuing prosecutions in a moment we aposll ask congressman michael mccaul chair of the house committee on homeland security what the president and congress will do next but first let aposs bring in steve harrigan with the latest from outside a detention center in mcallen texas steve steve harrigan fox news correspondent chris here on the ground there aposs a real sense of confusion about what aposs next for families who have been separated right now there aposs no clear answer begin videotape harrigan protesters here think children and parents are still being separated so they block a bus of families being moved from one detention center to another chanting free the children they are not the only ones confused about what aposs happening along the texas border a string of politicians has come through the rio grande valley to see conditions firsthand only to emerge with more questions than answers rep jackie speier d california we have applauded the work of the border patrol at each of our stops there aposs no directives coming out of washington so they are flying by the collective seat of their pants harrigan justice department officials say it remains government policy to criminally prosecute families who cross the border illegally but in courtrooms in mcallen texas those cases are now routinely dismissed the department of health and human services now has an emergency task force to speed the reunion of parents and children but it is not clear how they will reunite children here with parents who have already been deported one thing both sides agree on now is the goal of keeping families together sen ted cruz r texas my hope is in the coming days and weeks we will see republicans and democrats coming together to ensure that kids stay with their parents end videotape harrigan together in more than 20 000 beds on military bases here in texas and arkansas chris wallace steve harrigan reporting from mcallen texas steve thank you joining us now the chair of the house homeland security committee congressman michael mccaul sponsor of an immigration reform bill the house may vote on this week after rejecting a more conservative plan on thursday mr chairman welcome back to fox news sunday rep michael mccaul r texas chairman house homeland security committee thank you chris wallace let aposs start with that more moderate immigration reform bill that you helped pass let aposs put up what aposs in it it provides a pathway to citizenship for the dreamers 25 billion to build a border wall it puts new limits on legal immigration and ends separation of families president trump tweeted this friday republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more senators and congressmen women in november so will the house still vote on your bill this week and how much damage has president trump aposs stop wasting your time to be done to the chances for passage mccaul well i would urge the president to continue to support the four pillars idea that aposs my border security bill going to a merit based system and providing for a rational daca fix that was rejected as you mentioned the conservative bill that chairman goodlatte and i sponsored that got rejected but i did talk to the white house yesterday they say the president is still 100 percent behind us moving forward i think you know when you look at these kids down there and i aposve been down there this is not the first time this has happened this happened in 2014 as well congress needs to act to close the legal loopholes that incentivize the coyotes to bring these children into the united states and if we don apost do that we are going to see this scenario this human tragedy play out over and over again wallace but the president aposs tweet stop wasting your time can apost have helped in the fact is that the reason this bill the more moderate bill was put over from last week to this week is because you still don apost have the votes mccaul well we call it a consensus bill we aposre trying to get a consensus from freedom caucus moderates and people in the middle on the republican side we had a very good conference when we put a pause on that bill going forward i felt very optimistic we are going to have a solution to this problem and if we don apost do this you are going to see more for these kids at the border and let aposs not forget the dangerous journey they make yes the secretary told me there were 12 000 children 10 000 of them did not come with parents but rather the coyote was their guardian taking them from central america all the way through mexico and the united states a very dangerous journey where they are abused and exploited wallace if comprehensive reform your bill goes down this week and it still seems to be more likely than not there is already talk to the house may try to pass a narrow bill which would deal simply with the idea of keeping families together not separating them one is that true and secondly if you pass that bill is it humane that your solution is going to be well yes we are going to keep them together but we aposre going to keep the families and the children detained for weeks or even months mccaul well under the bill that i helped to pass this week we provide the solution the problem chris is that we treat people from other than mexico the central americans different from the mexicans coming across we want to treat them all the same and that is when you come in from mexico as a child you are detained but then immediately removed from the country we think if we could do that with the central american population that would go a long ways to providing disincentivizing the smugglers and cartels and traffickers from bringing the kids up in the first place wallace but is there talk and is there serious thought about if you can apost pass your bill that you go to a skinny bill that just deals with family separation mccaul i think i think we at a minimum have to deal with the family separation i aposm a father of five i think this is inhumane and i think the pictures that we have seen that aposs not the face of america i think that most people in this country want wallace the president keeps blaming democrats for the problem and the failure to deal with the immigration problem in this country take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states democrats don apost care about the impact of uncontrolled migration on your communities your schools your hospitals your jobs or your safety democrats put illegal immigrants before they put american citizens what the hell is going on end video clip wallace but chairman republicans control the house it was republicans who failed to pass the more conservative bill this week it aposs republicans who could pass your bill next week without a single democratic vote in fact you could lose 20 republican votes and still pass the bill so for all the president aposs talk about democrats if you failed to pass the bill isn apost that on republicans not democrats mccaul well i think our family needs to come together the fact is every democrat voted against a very i think rational daca fix they have been talking about daca you know for a year now and we had a bill on the floor that would resolve this issue legalize the daca kids and yet every one of them voted against that i don apost think that aposs operating in good faith either and i also think it aposs important on the border security piece i aposve been doing this since i was a federal prosecutor in texas to chairman of this committee to deliver on the president aposs campaign promise to build a wall with technology and get the border secure the crosstalk wallace why can apost you get republicans to support this i mean you know democrats oppose it certain elements of it like the wall like limiting legal immigration why can apost you get your own house in order and republicans pass the house bill mccaul well i am the eternal optimist and i do think there are 218 republicans that agree with the four pillars of border security ending chain migration visa lottery a a random system and fixing the daca children wallace you know some of the hardline conservative call that amnesty and they are going to vote against it mccaul it aposs merit based wallace i aposm talking about the daca mccaul right and it aposs a merit based visa it aposs based on merit it aposs not amnesty i mean raul labrador is hardly a left wing liberal right he aposs very conservative freedom caucus guy actually drafted that daca provision that carlos curbelo on ph the left they came to an agreement on that wallace i want to go to something else you said about all of this because if the house does pass something it goes onto the senate where you would need 10 or nine democratic votes to get above the filibuster proof majority to get to 60 votes you said this week that you think the republican majority in the senate should change the rules an end the filibuster but you know sometimes when you were in the minority that works to your benefit and the question i guess i have is ok that would help you right now but are you willing to see a democratic president and a democratic senate that will at some point able to ram anything they want through mccaul well we did that supreme court neil gorsuch wallace but not legislation mccaul i would argue that this is national security at stake securing that our border the threats i can tell you not only drug cartels opioids but also the terrorists we stop 10 terrorists every day from getting into this country i look at it from a national security standpoint it should be a bipartisan issue but if not the senate has that traditional role i think they should wave it in this case on the basis of national security to protect the american people wallace let aposs turn to the president aposs executive order this week in the confusion that it has sown at the border here aposs what the president said begin video clip trump so we are keeping families together and this will solve that problem at the same time we are keeping a very powerful border and it continues to be a zero tolerance end video clip wallace but as chairman of house homeland security can you sit here and tell me right now as we sit here do you know when those 2 000 children who are still separated from their families will be reunited with their parents mccaul well i applaud the president for reversing course on this issue those children were sent into the custody of hhs who then sent them 1 000 miles away to relatives in the united states i think the better way to do this that are billed as is we keep the family together but we also treat them like the mexican people where we detain and then remove them from the country if we don apost do that we will never stop this problem we aposll be talking about this next year and the year after if we don apost fix it by congress wallace but i just to press my point do you know when these 2 000 children who have been separated and as you say some of them are thousands of miles away what are they going to be reunited with their parents mccaul i think it aposs a very difficult thing to do and they aposre going to do have to bring them back to the border where they should have been in the first place and wallace are we talking weeks or months mccaul and be with their parents who violated the law reunite them at the family center and then go forward with the removal proceedings but chris as it exists now under the flores decision after 20 days they are released into society and these could be dangerous people i aposm not saying they all are but i think the children you know because hhs they are put in their custody and transferred somewhere else in the country wallace let me ask you another specific question as chairman of house homeland security do you know whether adults members of families crossing the border illegally can and are still being prosecuted under zero tolerance mccaul that was the plan they violated the law they were being prosecuted i have wallace and now we hear some of these people are being dismissed mccaul i have heard recent reports now that that may be that policy may be revisited and it may not go forward wallace zero tolerance mccaul i mean that aposs some of the reporting i aposm getting and it aposs very unclear how this executive order is playing out but i aposm not clear about how the prosecution of the parents i think they want to reunite the family and then remove them from the country wallace final question at the height of this furor you said and you basically made that point just now that you were destroyed as a father of five at what aposs happened and you said at one point that this policy must come to an end how badly has this been handled mccaul i think you know to set forth a policy and then having to reverse it is not a consistent message obviously to be candid with you but i think i wouldn apost fall the administration on this i would fault the united states congress who has the power to change the laws that will stop this from happening again and yet we can apost seem to get this done and that aposs why i aposve urged my colleagues why is it so important that national security is at stake protecting the american people we have to get this done or we aposll be seeing the scene play out over and over again there will be we had 30 000 kids in 2014 we aposre going to see the same thing this summer if we don apost change it wallace chairman mccaul thank you thanks for your time we aposll track what happens with your comprehensive bill on the floor this week thank you sir mccaul thank you chris wallace up next president trump says he inherited a mess on immigration from the obama administration we aposll talk with jeh johnson mr obama aposs secretary of homeland security when we come back what is the democrats apos solution commercial break wallace democrats say president trump created the mess over separating families at the border with his new zero tolerance policy and that he alone can fix it but what is their answer for stemming the tide of illegal immigrants coming into the u s joining us now jeh johnson president obama aposs secretary of homeland security who had to deal with a spike in illegal crossings back in 2014 mr secretary president trump says the real cause of our immigration problems are weak laws and what he calls open border democrats take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states they just want everyone to be released into our country no matter how dangerous they are they can be killers they can be thieves they can be horrible people the democrats say it aposs ok for them to be in our country end video clip wallace mr secretary does the president have a point jeh johnson former homeland security secretary chris first of all thanks for having me on chris i aposm not going to go down the road of the normal washington blame game trump versus obama obama versus bush or what have you we have an underlying humanitarian crisis on our southern border that we must deal with and in central america the high in illegal migration was 18 years ago it is now a fraction of what used to be but the demographic has changed it aposs women and children coming from central america as you point out we saw a spike in 2014 we did a number of things to deal with it we have the second lowest number in apprehensions on our southern border in 2015 since 1972 but then the number started to creep up again and so this is a problem that is international in scope i applaud mike mccaul for his leadership on the bill he discussed with you but we aposve got to address this problem at the root cause in central america the poverty and violence in central america that motivates women and children to come here in the first place we started on that in the congress two years ago and i hope congress continues on that road wallace well and we aposll get to that a little bit later but obviously you aposre not going to solve the problems quickly which are pretty systemic in guatemala and honduras and el salvador johnson without a doubt wallace i want to talk to about some specifics i aposm not playing the political blame game i aposm talking about issues and one of them the president says in the trump administration part of the problem is a measure that was written by democratic senator dianne feinstein in 2008 that became law if a minor an unaccompanied minor or child comes across the border from mexico or canada we can send them immediately back to their country but under the feinstein amendment if it aposs a noncontiguous country like central america not right on our border they can apost be sent back immediately hasn apost that contributed especially to the spike in unaccompanied minors coming into this country over the last few years johnson chris what you aposre referring to is the tvpra passed in 2008 and as you pointed out it does say that an unaccompanied child from central america noncontiguous country cannot be sent back immediately now there aposs a certain amount of common sense behind that because you can apost just simply send an unaccompanied child back across the southern border into mexico you cannot repatriate a guatemalan to mexico and so that law which has a certain level of protections for children we are talking about unaccompanied children 5 and 6 year old kids it requires that the department of homeland security place that child with hhs within 48 hours a deportation proceeding is commenced and the child has a right through a lawyer to assert a claim for asylum wallace secretary johnson the fact is you know we aposve talked all about the children who are separated from their families of the 12 000 children that are in the system 2 000 our children separated from families 10 000 are unaccompanied minors perhaps unintended consequence of this amendment is that unaccompanied minors have flooded the area a lot of them brought by coyote smugglers into the country johnson well chris even if that law did not exist it would not be simply a matter of expediting the removal of an unaccompanied child there are certain due process rights that they have anyway and when we repatriate somebody and the trump administration knows this when you repatriate somebody to central america central america has to agree to take them back you have to put them on planes it aposs a very measured process so the tvpra in 2008 was put in place to make certain that we treat unaccompanied children we aposre talking about unaccompanied children in a fair way wallace i understand that let aposs look because you mentioned it at how the obama administration and you as secretary of homeland security handle this back in 2014 when there was also a spike in children most of them unaccompanied coming across the border you started jailing entire families in some cases not a lot but in some you separated children from their parents in these pictures that we are putting up from 2014 show pictures of unaccompanied minors in effect jail situations as you look back on that did you handle it so well johnson well chris without a doubt the images and the reality from 2014 just like 2018 are not pretty and so we expanded family detention we had then 34 000 beds for family detention only 95 of 34 000 equipped to deal with families so we extended it i freely admit it was controversial we believed it was necessary at the time i still believe it is necessary to name ph a certain capability for families we can apost have catch and release and in my three years we deported or repatriated or returned over a million people but again you can deal with this on the border you can try different things we did not want to go so far as to separate families but unless we deal with the underlying causes that are motivating people to come here in the first place we are going to continue to bang our heads against the wall on this issue wallace all right let aposs look at the problem that president trump is trying to address right now let aposs put it up on the screen 40 000 to 50 000 people across the border illegally each month last month 9 500 family members crossed the border illegally and up to 40 000 unaccompanied minors cross per year when i was talking this week to a top member of the trump administration he and i told him you were going to be on show he said i have one question for secretary johnson what is the democrat solution how would they deal i mean it aposs easy to say well we aposve got to fix central america but come on that isn apost going to solve the 40 000 50 000 coming each month johnson well wallace certainly not anytime soon how would you deal with that flood of people coming over the border now johnson well i aposll tell you of jeh johnson aposs solution continue our border security efforts give the border control give immigration enforcement the tools they need but let aposs not go so far as two separate families but also continue what congress started two years ago aid to central america to deal with the property and violence and also encourage other countries in the region mexico belize costa rica panama to develop their own systems for asylum for refugee processing it was someone from the u s conference of catholic bishops who told me in 2014 you can apost just simply padlock a burning building without providing people with an alternative path to safety and so we need to develop those additional paths for getting crosstalk wallace but sir that isn apost respectfully that isn apost going to solve the problem anytime soon it won apost solve it for months it probably wouldn apost solve it for years if we put 750 million which is what we did during the obama administration into foreign aid in those three countries they are pretty broken countries you aposve got a real crisis on the border with 50 000 people a month 600 000 people a year coming across the border how do you stop that and what aposs wrong with zero tolerance the idea you come across the border you broke the law we aposre going to prosecute you johnson three things first chris you aposre right there are no easy fixes to this problem and washington is bad at investing in long term solutions number two history will tell you lessons learned lessons learned in 2014 you can do certain things that will drive down illegal migration in the short term as we did in 2014 but then the longer term patterns always revert to form the numbers always creep back up president trump himself saw that in 2017 the numbers went down dramatically and then they are back up again and so you can do these things but we aposve got to make the longer term investment in dealing with illegal migration generally and if we don apost do that we are going to continue to have this problem wallace one final question because the practical result of the program that the obama administration put in was that you had to release you caught and had to release some of the people with a promise and sometimes an ankle bracelet that they would come back i want to put back some numbers on the screen because according to government numbers 74 percent of those who were released showed up for their hearings last year but that still left almost 40 000 people who didn apost show up for deportation hearings so catch and release which is what the practical effect was under the obama administration and until this year for the trump administration that doesn apost really work either does it johnson well without a doubt it aposs a problem chris which is one of the reasons we expanded family detention which was controversial wallace and was knocked down by the court that aposs the reason we got this 20 day ruling it was because of the obama administration aposs policy johnson well we expanded family detention and then we ran into the issue of the flores case which you mentioned a moment ago i disagreed then with the ruling in the flores case because i think that our border patrol and our immigration enforcement people need those tools available to deal with situations like this but it aposs the sheer matter of numbers chris right now we have family detention capability for about 3 000 or 4 000 people and you aposve got over a thousand migrants crossing the border a day in central america and so even if you emptied it out completely today it would fill back up in a matter of days wallace right johnson so there you are this is not an easy problem which is why we need to invest and address the underlying causes wallace secretary johnson thank you thanks for joining us today always good to talk with you sir johnson thanks wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the policy and politics of illegal immigration plus what would you like to ask the panel about president trump advising republicans to put off immigration reform until after the midterms just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up rudy giuliani calls for an end to the mueller investigation after the inspector general hammers the fbi begin video clip rudy giuliani president trump aposs attorney they aposre in jeopardy of having the whole thing thrown out on the fact that strzok began it strzok began it with total bias end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what comes next for the special counsel aposs probe in a moment commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we can apost do it through an executive order democrats forced that law upon our nation i hate it i hate to see separation of parents and children we aposre signing an executive order i consider to be a very important executive order it aposs about keeping families together end video clip wallace well what a difference a few days and a national uproar make as president trump ended up signing an executive order in the separation of families after saying he couldn apost and it aposs time now for our sunday group rich lowry of national review columnist for the hill juan williams former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and former federal prosecutor andrew mccarthy who writes about legal issues for national review well rich let me start with you the president says he does not like to reverse course but he did it repeatedly this work first he said he couldn apost sign an executive order he did then he went up to capitol hill and said he was a thousand percent behind republicans trying to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill then he told them to stop wasting the time what aposs going on here rich lowry national review he aposs been all over the map well this separation policy it wasn apost sustainable and it hasn apost been sustained and they obviously need to get beyond this phase reunite the kids quickly with the parents which is easier said than done because there are insane bureaucratic rules around it which means it will take months and then try to get to debate on the catch and release and i think the policy they want to implement now make sense and is a common sense goal hold the kids and the parents together at the border and then deport them the problem is there aposs rules that make that impossible and there aposs limited capacity my understanding dhs has three family detention facilities one of them is in pennsylvania so obviously they would need to radically ramp up the amount of shelters they have wallace on friday the president met with what are called the angel families to talk about the human cost of illegal immigration here he is begin video clip donald trump president of the united states they aposre not separated for a day or two days they are permanently separated because they were killed by criminal illegal aliens these are the families the media ignores they don apost talk about them very unfair end video clip wallace juan did the president succeed in changing the focus on the immigration debate from separated families to the drugs and crime that come over the border with illegal immigration juan williams fox news political analyst well i think it was a last you know a last gasp maneuver because he was having a rough week on this issue as you aposve as you aposve explained chris but two wrongs don apost make a right my heart goes out to anyone that aposs lost a child to a terrible crime like that but there aposs that doesn apost excuse separating children from their parents at the border so this was a cynical act by the president at the end of the week statistics show very clearly that there aposs a lower crime rate among illegal immigrants than there is among native born americans there aposs a 70 year low in terms of people crossing that southern border but we aposve had a spike in recent months i think this is about politics and i think trump has decided for the midterms he aposs going to demonize immigrants and so you demonized immigrants in a way you talk about infestation you talk about animals people come in from terrible countries to me this is offensive but this is his policy at the moment and i mean what aposs regrettable is that it aposs become about politics not so much about immigration and right now he aposs losing on that fight two thirds of voters americans say this is a bad policy but the president thinks it excites his base and will get them out for the midterms wallace i want to pick up on that but i want to ask you andy as a former federal prosecutor because one of the things that strikes me at weeks apos end is the confusion you heard mike mccaul chairman of the house homeland security committee basically say i don apost know when these families are going to be reunited when he was asked about prosecution and zero tolerance he said i don apost know where that stands as a former federal prosecutor it can apost be good when there aposs real confusion the department of justice says yes we can continue to prosecute the parents of these families coming across and dhs says no you can apost and they aposre letting some of these people go andrew mccarthy fox news contributor yes but chris we have to remember that in every single case where you enforce the law this is a residual problem that you have i had i don apost know how many cases that i prosecuted where day after day the family of the defendant would sit in the front row behind the defendant and the signal to the jury in every one of those cases was if you convict this person if you apply the law in this situation you are going to rip this family apart you aposre going to separate the family and in every case as a human being the prosecutor feels awful about it the police who have to enforce the law feel awful about it and the jury feels awful about it i never saw a single case where somebody actually was acquitted because of the because of that dynamic wallace so do you think the president was wrong to revoke the the family separation aspect if you aposre saying that aposs part of what happens when you commit a crime mccarthy it aposs a fact that it is part of what happens when you commit a crime but it aposs also a fact that if you were going to start a law enforcement initiative you have to back it with the resources that you need to carry it out effectively so if we decided today is a country we now want to crack down on marijuana trafficking that would require a vast resource reallocation to commit to that problem and it would mean a number of other things didn apost get addressed wallace oh in other words there should have been a lot more detention mccarthy infrastructure wallace infrastructure mccarthy right right wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue on the separation of families we got this on facebook from john ward who writes what can congress and potus do president to help solve the problems in central american countries that would allow its citizens to remain there you can apost solve the problem after they aposve reached the border this is of course what we heard several times from former secretary jeh johnson congresswoman edwards i mean are we really i understand that there aposs a problem there and people are going to want to leave if their lives are miserable but that aposs a that isn apost going to solve the problem of 600 000 people coming over the border it aposs certainly not going to solve it quickly donna edwards former u s congresswoman d md oh i think i want to go juan aposs point which is that these border crossing are actually at an all time low and so let aposs be real about what aposs happening here and the fact is that we do have to change the circumstances both economic circumstances but also the violence that aposs been driven by the drug trade in central america which is why many of these families are fleeing and frankly ripping babies infants toddlers children from parents doesn apost deal with the issue of ms 13 i think the president was like mixing apples and oranges here when it comes to to what aposs happening with families who are being detained and we can apost be a country that on one hand embraces immigration but on the other hand separates families separates children from their parents and this was wallace well the difference in we embrace legal immigration we don apost embrace edwards this was a policy this was a policy change by the trump administration he didn apost actually even need an executive order to deal with it it was a policy change and it was deliberate and now we aposre learning from the president himself that it was a deliberate strategy that was actually about an election strategy for 2018 not acceptable wallace rich lowry overall border crossings are lower than they had been you know ten 15 years ago but they aposre not lower from these central american countries the only wallace and they aposre also not lower than they were last year lowry right wallace in the first year of trump they went down considerably they aposre back up to normal levels of about 50 000 a month lowry right and the only way you aposre going to stop the influx is if future migrants get the idea that if they come they aposre not going to get in and they aposre going to get turned around and they aposre going to go home they aposve made this harrowing journey for no good reason that should be the policy goal there aposs going to be legislation in the house that will be narrowly tailored to make it possible to hold these migrants together and then deport them it will die in the senate because democrats have no interest in enforcing the law against this segment of illegal immigrants wallace all right panel we have to take a break here when we come back rudy giuliani says the president may not talk to the special counsel while his 2020 campaign manager calls for an end to the investigation and remembering our colleague charles krauthammer we look back at his extraordinary life commercial break begin video clip christopher wray fbi director senator i believe that special counsel mueller is conducting an important investigation rudy giuliani president trump aposs attorney i believe that this investigation is very very close to being able to be thrown out anything they do end video clip wallace fbi director christopher wray and president trump aposs lawyer rudy giuliani with very different views on the merit of the special counsel aposs investigation of the president and we aposre back now with the panel andy you aposve been writing for months about the special counsel investigation and in the national review and you say that the inspector general aposs report only adds to the argument that justice the department of justice should pull the plug on the mueller probe explain mccarthy well it should pull the plug on the aspect of the mueller probe that deals with whether the president aposs guilty of obstruction and part of the confusion here is that when you talk about the mueller probe people seem to mean different things about it as they say the mueller probe as it was originally articulated by deputy attorney general rosenstein is a counterintelligence probe into russia aposs interference in the 2016 election i don apost think anybody thinks that that the entirety of that mission is a waste of time in fact it aposs an important investigation it ought to be seen through then there are the aspects of a deal with president trump which are very important to the governance of the country because you can apost unless it aposs very necessary you should not have a situation where the president is under the cloud of of federal criminal investigation so the question is do they have a case on him and it appears that they don apost as a matter of law and the inspector general aposs report underscores that because the inspector general aposs theory is that when an executive official like the fbi or the federal prosecutors are dealing within their discretion as executive actors even if there is a possibility of corrupt intent as long as there are legitimate explanations for any particular step that they take we should assume that they are acting legitimately wallace so for instance even if peter strzok the lead investigator for the fbi sends these wildly biased texts and e mails to his girlfriend if there aposs a legitimate reason that he could have taken the actions he aposs taken you aposve got to put the best face on it you have to mccarthy correct and because the president under the constitution has broader discretion than the fbi and the federal prosecutors do and because there aposs more scant evidence of corrupt intent on his part than there is with respect to the agents as we aposve seen in page after page after this of this inspector general report i just simply don apost see a basis even if you bought their theory of obstruction which i never have wallace congresswoman edwards does the bias and misconduct inside the fbi as documented by the inspector general aposs report does that fatally taint the special counsel investigation with regard to donald trump edwards i don apost think it does it all and here aposs why the special first of all we know very little of what the special counsel mueller is doing and i think with good reason and i aposm glad for that the ig report is separate dealing with the fbi i think it could well be that you know this ends up like iran contra where at the end of the end of the day there aposs nothing that comes that would would taint or indict the president on the other hand it could end up like watergate that results in a resignation or like like you know wallace impeachment edwards clinton impeachment and so i think it aposs really too early to know we aposve already had five guilty pleas we aposve had 14 indictments it aposs really early on in this investigation to call for an end to it wallace in the time we have left want to talk about the passing of our colleague charles krauthammer back in 2013 when charles apos best selling book things that matter came out we did a power player segment on charles and it was so interesting it was the only two part power player we have ever done and here is a portion of that begin video clip charles krauthammer the best thing i had going for me is from the first day i had no hope and no hope is a redeeming thing i knew what life would be like and i you either accept it or you don apost wallace voice over and that may be the most remarkable part of this story more than all charles has accomplished and all he does in a wheelchair there is not a trace of self pity not a bit krauthammer you aposve got two choices you aposre either going to live a good life or you aposre going to live a miserable life and that to me was a very easy choice end video clip wallace rich where do you think and i just found out that you worked for charles one of your first job out of college where does charles rank in the pantheon of conservative thinkers and and just among commentators on the public scene in general lowry well let me say i worked for him as a research assistant out of college i was scared the entire time obviously not because he did anything to make me feel uncomfortable he aposd be incapable of that but just he had a formidable dignity to him and you always knew you were in the presence even if he wasn apost rubbing it in your face of a superior intellect i think he aposs he ranks with bill buckley irving kristol as among the top conservative intellectuals of the last 50 years he was one of the great defenders of our civilization and he represented what was best about it and his voice will be missed and never replaced wallace is there one story from your days as a college graduate dealing with mr krauthammer lowry i once inserted a typo into his column late when it was you know almost going to the printer at the washington post and i had to go tell him this the next day i thought i didn apost realize in washington you actually pass the buck and you cover for your mistakes and he he wasn apost wallace you mean you could have said well it was the paper that did it or lowry he wasn apost he wasn apost mean about it or nasty about it but i remember still it rings in my ear he said why did you do it and and like like you know i aposd killed my mother and and we came to joke about this over the years wallace juan you were on the other side fencing with charles often and it always struck me that whether you agreed with him or not and you know charles wasn apost always right i think we would agree if you ignored him you missed out on an important part of the national conversation williams without a doubt you know it comes to mind because i was on the opposite side that people talk about wayne gretzky or michael jordan as knowing where the puck or the ball was going before it gets there so charles was like a chess player strategic thinker and when it came to debate he thought out he had a strategy in mind he aposs going someplace so to go along with him was to learn and to match strategies the best example of this would be harriet miers going back to apos05 i don apost know she was if you remember she was nominated for the supreme court by george w bush then their i supported her as a democrat i thought this was a moderate republican the best we can hope for from this president he opposed her and there was tremendous opposition from the right they feared harriet miers would be another david souter kind of a indistinct even liberal justice charles then cames up comes up with this idea for how george w bush can pull harriet miers apos nomination effectively an exit strategy and the white house follows charles apos instructions and for me it was like oh my god he came up with this idea and he had the influence to make it real it was it aposs a revelation so you know i just give thanks that i was on the other side of a chess master at public debate wallace you know it aposs interesting it aposs like when walter cronkite turned against the vietnam war lyndon johnson said if i aposve lost cronkite i aposve lost the country i suspect george w bush thought if i aposve lost krauthammer i aposve lost the country thank you all panel see you next week up next our power player of the week if there aposs a vacancy on the supreme court he will help fill it commercial break wallace this last week in june marks the end of the supreme court aposs term when it announces its biggest decisions and often when a justice plans to retire we learn that too if president trump gets to fill another court vacancy he aposll almost certainly reach out for guidance to someone he aposs relied on before here is our power player of the week begin videotape leonardo leo executive vice president the federalist the job of a judge is to enforce the constitution as it aposs written wallace leonard leo is executive vice president of the federalist society which advances the cause of limited constitutional government in washington he aposs known by a different name wallace on camera you have been called president trump aposs supreme court whisperer how do you plead leo i don apost remember ever whispering and i know he aposs never whispered wallace voice over leo may be back in the spotlight this week if a justice on the aging supreme court retires at the end of the term anthony kennedy is 81 ruth bader ginsburg 85 wallace on camera do you given your role do you think to yourself we aposre headed into the regular season now leo every june we think about that yes absolutely the odds are high that over the course of the next couple of years several years you aposre going to see a couple of vacancies wallace better than 50 50 leo yes wallace voice over if president trump gets to nominate another justice that will move a court that aposs often split over two solidly conservative leo has already helped get four justices on the court he organized conservative support for clarence thomas and john roberts and sam alito but his role increased dramatically when candidate trump asked him to draw up a list of potential nominees leo what you see in that list of 21 now actually i think 25 is probably the best and brightest you know individuals on the bench donald trump president of the united states judge gorsuch has outstanding legal skills a brilliant mind tremendous discipline wallace just days after he took office president trump nominated federal appeals court judge neil gorsuch who was on leo aposs list justice neil gorsuch supreme court i will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the constitution laws of this great country leo it aposs always been a point of contention wallace leonard leo has been pushing his originalist philosophy for more than a quarter century the idea that the words of the constitution should be interpreted as they were commonly understood when it was written outside his office there aposs a photograph of the supreme court aposs chambers of justice antonin scalia the prime mover of originalism over the last half century wallace on camera is this the inner sanctum of originalism leo that aposs why it aposs hanging here outside of my office because this is the place this is the originalist temple wallace voice over leo is modest about what his role will be if there aposs another vacancy on the court saying it aposs up to the white house but there aposs little doubt if president trump makes another nomination leo will be at the center of the action and he could not be more committed leo this is really at the core of his legacy you aposre dealing with fundamental transformation in the federal bench it aposs abou
