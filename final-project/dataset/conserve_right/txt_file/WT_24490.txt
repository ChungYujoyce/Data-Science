tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion siege trump under fire by michael wolff henry holt and company 30 335 pages top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey during the week before this book s publication the new york times ran two full feature articles in that week s issues apparently attempting to distance itself from the book which would soon be riding the paper s own bestseller list and from its author with his disregard for the usual fact checking procedures valued by reporters at mainstream news outlets they make the obvious points although steve bannon one of the chief sources in fire and fury left the white house in 2017 he continues in that role here mr wolff has not visited the white house in the past two years and is not close to people now employed there and several of his most sensational claims in this one among them that robert mueller had drafted an indictment of the president on obstruction charges have been officially refuted the result of faulty or non existent sourcing to some this apparent effort by the times to discredit mr wolff s journalistic methods in advance of publication and specifically his sourcing could be an attempt to discourage their readers from confusing their daily dose of harsh criticism of the president on both their editorial and news pages with the wolffian approach although the sourcing is often equally anonymous thereby raising the possibility of a measure of fakery no doubt justified by the writers and editors as serving the public good as jill abramson the only female executive editor ever of the new york times put it the paper s news pages are unmistakably anti trump and perhaps never has this total anti trump focus been more evident than when the times published its briefly famous and unprecedented unsigned front page anti trump op ed by an anonymous senior official in the trump administration mr wolff approves the consternation and confusion it caused in the white house but he also mentions the strained and unconvincing explanations of sourcing and authorship the writer said the editor responding to a query was introduced to us by an intermediary whom we know and trust and that s it so much for sourcing and as far as we know the op ed could have been written by a jumped up federal careerist protecting his pension or a committee of new york times editorialists but mr wolff isn t concerned with the times editorial or sourcing inconsistencies more power to them in fact they re in the same business attacking this administration as mr wolff and the times have proved beyond a doubt anti trump sells and in fact much of what we read in mr wolff s latest we ve also read in the times substantiated by unnamed sources there are exceptions mr wolff with all the taste and delicacy of an old school new york gossip columnist has no compunctions about dealing with the sleazier rumor sourced material he tells us that the trump marriage is a sham that melania spends most of her time in maryland in a house she bought for her parents and although she s a caring mother the president has little or no relationship with their son barron the president we are told although no new names are supplied continues his womanizing and mr wolff repeats a truly foul rumor involving former u n ambassador nikki haley one of the truly admirable women involved in republican politics we are told that the president was vociferous in his defense of harvey weinstein that he doesn t like mike pence that he makes racist and anti semitic comments in private that he seriously considered withdrawing his nomination of brett kavanaugh to the supreme court because of his catholicism and then there s mr wolff s primary source the exiled steve bannon who nevertheless still claims to be in touch of the characterization of the trump organization as a semi criminal enterprise he tells mr wolff i think we can drop the semi part mr bannon continues in this vein in the process speculating on the possibility of suicide and where will all this take mr wolff s book as he knows yellow journalism still sells and his book will hit the best seller list at the new york times where the news sections of the paper seem increasingly inclined to shed the remaining restraints imposed by the journalistic ethics of another age and join mr wolff in pursuit of a president john r coyne jr a former white house speechwriter is co author of strictly right william f buckley jr and the american conservative movem
