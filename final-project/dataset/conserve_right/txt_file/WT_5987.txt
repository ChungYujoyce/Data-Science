move comes after the trump administration designated five chinese media outlets as foreign missions and restricted the number of chinese who could work for them in a de facto expulsion of about one third of their chinese staff china described its steps as necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that china is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the chinese media organizations experience in the u s the american journalists will likely have to leave china because their visas are tied to their press credentials they will also be unable to work in the semi autonomous territories of hong kong and macao the foreign ministry said in a release posted on its website u s secretary of state mike pompeo disputed the comparison between the u s and chinese actions telling reporters in washington that they enjoy press freedoms that don t exist in china the individuals that we identified a few weeks back were not media that were acting here freely he said they were part of chinese propaganda outlets we ve identified these as foreign missions under american law these aren t apples to apples and i regret china s decision today to further foreclose the

from some of the world s top news organizations and called on the chinese and american governments to move quickly to resolve the dispute the health and safety of people around the world depend on impartial reporting about its two largest economies both of them now battling a common epidemic baquet said matt murray editor in chief of the wall street journal called it an unprecedented attack on freedom of the press at a time of crisis and said the journal s commitment to reporting fully and deeply on china hasn t changed the u s announced earlier this month that five state controlled chinese media outlets would be restricted to 100 visas it cited increasingly harsh surveillance harassment and intimidation of american and other foreign journalists working in china the chinese outlets which employ about 160 chinese citizens in the u s include the official xinhua news agency and china global television network the overseas arm of state broadcaster cctv by designating the five chinese
