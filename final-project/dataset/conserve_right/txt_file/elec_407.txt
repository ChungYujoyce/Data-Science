st louis missouri it wouldn t be trumpian if there weren t any fireworks donald trump the 2016 gop presidential nominee crushed his democratic opponent hillary rodham clinton in sunday evening s debate at washington university in st louis propelling him closer to the white house and past perhaps the roughest stretch of his campaign yet it was an absolute home run for mr trump jason miller trump s senior communications adviser told breitbart news in the spin room after the debate this was a game changing victory you know what the underdog is back several key exchanges in the debate proved trump to be the better candidate on sunday night the most important of which was whentrump forced out on his own with no help from moderators cnn s anderson cooper and abc news martha raddatz when trump said he would appoint a special and independent prosecutor to investigate the clinton email scandal trump held his own through six straight questions with whichraddatz and others peppered him opening the debate about the recently surfaced video of him using lewd language with former president george h w bush s nephew billy bus then when hillary clinton brought up the birther questions again trying to force that into the conversation trump trapped her he trump owes the president an apology he owes our country an apology and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words clinton said regarding the birther issue after detailing howit is actually hillary clinton who owes president obama an apology because she started the birther narrative it s been proven that clinton ally sidney blumenthal pushed the story back in the 2008 campaign as did at least two people on clinton s campaign trump shifted the conversation to questions about her emails but when you talk about apology i think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33 000 e mails that you deleted and that you acid washed and then the two boxes of e mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing trump said before dropping the mega bomb aspecial prosecutor to independently investigate clinton and i ll tell you what i didn t think i d say this but i m going to say it and i hate to say it but if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies so much deception there has never been anything like it and we re going to have a special prosecutor trump said adding when i speak i go out and speak the people of this country are furious in my opinion the people that have been long term workers at the fbi are furious there has never been anything like this where emails and you get a subpoena you get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena you delete 33 000 emails and then you acid wash them or bleach them as you would say very expensive process so we re going to get a special prosecutor and we re going to look into it because you know what people have been their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what you ve done and it s a disgrace and honestly you ought to be ashamed of yourself after clinton accused trump of lies without detailing any and as raddatz attempted to intervene to save her she begged the so called fact checkers for help it s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of donald trump is not in charge of the law in our country she added in response trump fired back his most aggressive and bold comeback all year because you d be in jail another key moment came when raddatz tried to press trump on his plan to temporarily halt islamic migration into america from nations with terrorism problems hillary clinton in her previous answer in a response to an islamophobia question from an audience member had attacked trump over the khan gold star family controversy again trump in his reply to raddatz s question flipped the whole thing back on clinton who unlike trump supported the war in iraq first of all captain khan is an american hero and if i were president at that time he would be alive today because unlike her who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing i would not have had our people in iraq iraq was a disaster trump said so he would have been alive today the muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world trump continued hillary clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands raddatz then interrupted him excuse me excuse me trump talked over her and why did it morph into that no did you no answer the question do you still believe raddatz asked over trump s talking why don t you interrupt her you interrupt me all the time trump asked raddatz speaking directly at the moderator i do raddatz said why don t you interrupt her trump followed up the moderators interrupted trump 26 times and clinton only 12 times a clear and implicit bias by the legacy media anchors would you please explain whether or not the muslim ban still stands raddatz interjected again it s called extreme vetting trump said he continued we are going to areas like syria where they re coming in by the tens of thousands because of barack obama and hillary clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over obama people are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are where they are from what their feelings about our country is and she wants 550 percent more this is going to be the great trojan horse of all time we have enough problems in this country i believe in building safe zones i believe in having other people pay for them as an example the gulf states who are not carrying their weight but they have nothing but money and take care of people but i don t want to have with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on hundreds of thousands of people coming in from syria when we know nothing about them we know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country there were many other moments throughout the debate from exchanges on obamacare to more about refugees to dealing with russia and syria and even campaign finance andtrump defeated clinton on all of them after the moderators could not stump trump in the opening and he steamrolled ahead in the early momentum she could not catch a break all night trump s debate victory which comes after a rough first debate with clinton back on september 26 an eternity ago in this race and indiana gov mike pence s win last tuesday in virginia in the vice presidential debate againstsen tim kaine d va puts perhaps the roughest stretch of his campaign behind him a videotape of him making lewd remarks about women surfaced on friday and jittery establishment republicans showed initial signs of a full scale collapse of support for him that was followed by an apology video late friday night from trump a wikileaks document dump of clinton campaign chairman john podesta s personal emails a rough and tumble but effective showing from several women who have accused bill clinton of allegedly raping or sexually assaulting them and now this debate performance with each of those developments and more trump seems to have put that stage of the campaign behind him and returned to the offensive position riding high into political battle moving into the final month of the campaign the videotape threatened to derail trump s campaign as it prompted several senior republicans to call on him to withdraw and hand the nomination away to his running mate or someone else trump has doubled down and refuses to quit on his supporters and sure enough the tape found its way to center stage at the debate s opening trump was pressed on it a whopping six times before he finally as he hinted he would before the debate when tweeting out video interviews that bill clinton s accusers did with breitbart news then appearing with them at an event here in missouri lit into hillary clinton for enabling bill clinton s behavior but not only did trump survive he thrived in the chaotic environment as he described it as one on three with the moderators working to help clinton far more than to help him trump found his groove again and soared to a much needed debate victory the win not only stops the bleeding from a rough patch of the campaign but propels him forward into the week like a cannonball onto the homestretch with one final debate to go in las vegas a week from wednesday miller trump s senior communications adviser noted that trump does his best with his back against the wall i think donald trump loves being the underdog and this was fantastic miller told breitbart news i think what we saw tonight is a presidential leader in donald trump who stepped up is ready to lead and that he s not going to back down to anybody hillary clinton was rattled completely rattled the entire evening she couldn t answer on crazy obamacare she couldn t answer on taxes she couldn t answer on the emails you could see everything from her face was rattled to her inability to give clear answers to the voters who were there i think if you re at home and you re watching and you think about that person who is out there and what it would look like if she were across the table from a foreign leader i d be nervous that she wouldn t be able to stand up and defend this country i think one candidate came across as very presidential tonight and that was donald trump politics2016 presidential campaign2016
