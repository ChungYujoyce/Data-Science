equipped destroyers to japan another attack submarine to guam and four littoral combat ships to singapore a modest increase in firepower that reflects the service s problems resulting from the obama administration s sharp cuts in defense spending enhanced naval capabilities in the pacific the four star admiral said include better electronic warfare undersea warfare advanced anti aircraft warfare and cyber warfare capacities the understanding element involves creating closer relations and exchanges with allies and partners in asia and bolstering security assurances adm greenert said in a speech at the carnegie endowment for international peace in a signal to china whose main strategic goal is to drive u s forces out of asia and assume unchallenged regional power adm greenert made clear that the united states is not leaving so we re going to be in this region economically and politically it s critical he said and we ll be staying in the south china sea and we ll be staying in the east china sea both seas in recent months were the scenes of chinese military bullying of its neighbors as part of beijing s expansive maritime claims on the resource rich waters significantly adm greenert threw cold water on china s latest propaganda campaign aimed at pressuring the pentagon to halt all surveillance flights near chinese coasts that campaign began last month after a chinese su 27 fighter nearly collided with a navy p 8 anti submarine warfare aircraft near the south china sea in a move the pentagon called dangerous and unprofessional we will continue to operate in international airspace the admiral said we ve made that clear and we will continue pressed on whether u s surveillance flights would be halted he stated there s no intention that i m aware of to do that we re flying in international airspace asked about the p 8 incident adm greenert said he was concerned by the unprofessional activity and we have clear documentation that it was unprofessional

encounter after press inquiries adm greenert revealed after the speech that he has had discussions with taiwan on helping the island buy or build submarines i ve had conversations with my taiwan counterpart i won t discuss them here i can t he said xi urges pla to wage infowar chinese president xi jinping is urging the people s liberation army to shift its focus from preparing solely for a future conventional and nuclear conflict to developing information warfare capabilities as part of beijing s military buildup mr xi called for developing advanced military capabilities including information warfare as part of what he termed the global revolution in military affairs a term coined by the soviet union s military and later adopted by the u s military for what is now high technology and intelligence driven warfare the military reforms were discussed during a meeting aug 29 of the ruling communist party s central committee in addition to being chinese president mr xi is chairman of the central military commission the ultimate power organ in china that directs all military activities faced with the severe challenges to our national security and stability and the deep seated contradictions and problems with reform it is even more pressing that we greatly liberate our ideas and concepts have the courage to change our fixed mindsets of mechanized warfare and establish the ideological concept of information warfare mr xi was quoted as saying in state media state run china national television the internet propaganda broadcaster reported sept 2 that apart from safeguarding the country s sovereignty and territory mr xi emphasized strategic interests and the ability to counter non traditional security threats including economic threats an indication china is preparing to wage economic warfare in the future china currently holds 1 28 trillion worth of u s government bonds and chinese military leaders in the past have threatened to use the debt holdings to punish the united states for arms sales to taiwan the directive to build information warfare capabilities follows disclosure in a pentagon report earlier this year that china is engaged in information warfare the report produced for the pentagon s office of net assessment an internal think tank identified china s three warfares as psychological media and legal warfare used as surrogates for conventional and nuclear war the report warned that the u s government and military are ill prepared for countering chinese information warfare since military academies and service schools do not teach the subject the three warfares is a dynamic three dimensional war fighting process that constitutes war by other means said cambridge university professor stefan halper who directed the study it is china s weapon of choice in the south china sea the report said china uses information warfare to counter u s power projection the united states is one of four key audiences targeted by the campaign as part of china s broader military strategy of anti access area denial in the south china sea the report said according to the report china will employ information warfare on issues ranging from its dispute with japan over control of the east china sea s senkaku islands to political posturing in the south china sea with vietnam and philippines if the three warfares is not a game changer it certainly has the capacity to modify the game in substantial ways the report concludes rick fisher a china military affairs analyst said the disclosure is a sign china is increasing its military power mr xi has ordered the communist party to place a high priority on developing cutting edge doctrine for joint war fighting forces said mr fisher of the international assessment and strategy center this will likely accelerate changes in military culture procurement and training he said in the u s jointness in part became a necessity to help compensate for declining military size whereas for china this will ensure that an ever increasing military force has an even greater effect contact bill g
