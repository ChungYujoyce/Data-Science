r persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic despite china s escalating cyberattacks that are stealing massive amounts of sensitive u s government personnel and military data president obama still plans to have china s president as an honored guest in washington this year the white house said wednesday mr obama will roll out the red carpet in september for the first official state visit by president xi jinping who is presiding over what analysts say is an increasingly successful effort to raid u s government secrets and personal information about millions of current and former federal employees white house press secretary josh earnest said the administration needs and values china s help in nuclear talks with iran which are reaching a culmination this month he called china an active and important participant in the negotiations top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore we value their contribution to that effort and they have acted constructively alongside other members of the international community to try to prevent iran through diplomatic talks from obtaining a nuclear weapon mr earnest said engaging with china is something that has served this country well there are going to be some areas with china where we re able to cooperate and some areas where we re going to compete the administration hasn t publicly blamed china for the attack on the office of personnel management computer network which officials call one of the biggest security breaches in u s history but lawmakers and anonymous administration officials say there is no doubt china is responsible the obama administration estimates that chinese hackers even before the digital break in at opm carried out more than 30 000 cyberattacks in recent years as part of an enormous military industrial spy program more than 500 of those attacks gained significant access to defense department computer systems in the attack on opm hackers obtained personal information on as many as 4 million current and former federal employees including hundreds of thousands with security clearances some of the information dates back to 1985 raising questions about how the federal government is storing its data if you know that breaches are inevitable why would you keep data active going back to big shoulder pads big hair and reagan said theresa payton a top cybersecurity consultant who was the white house chief information officer under president george w bush we ve got to change how we think about how much we store where we store it and who has access to it she said mr obama should use the white house meeting with the chinese president to get tougher about cyber espionage it doesn t matter if it s china russia or somebody else ms payton said there is a clear and present danger with the collection of information about federal employees intelligence operators and political appointees i would not cancel the meeting i would talk to mr xi about creating some type of agreement or treaty between the u s and the chinese about acceptable rules of the road mr earnest said the administration has expressed its concerns to the chinese many times about some of their activities in cyberspace and he noted that the justice department has indicted five members of china s military for carrying out cyberattacks but analysts and other government officials say the u s warnings have made no appreciable dent in chinese efforts to infiltrate u s government and private computer networks china has denied the activities and says it too is often a victim of cyberattacks in a report to congress last month the pentagon said china s malicious activity in cyberspace is a massive military program china is focusing on counter space offensive cyber operations and electronic warfare capabilities meant to deny adversaries the advantages of modern informationized warfare the report said the pentagon added that chinese military planners think the key to seizing cyberspace superiority is to deter or stop an adversary by developing and employing offensive cyberspace capabilities in attacks attributed to china hackers have gained details of the f 35 joint strike fighter s stealth radar and engine secrets and access to the u s transportation command s single mobility system which is used to coordinate troop and equipment deployments during military operations the white house and congress have accused each other of being slow to approve steps to prevent cyberattacks administration officials say they are stepping up efforts to install security software called einstein 3 at all federal agencies ms payton said there hasn t been significant cybersecurity legislation in 12 years and that measures pending in congress are focused too much on punishment after an attack rather than detection and prevention she said policymakers should offer incentives such as tax breaks or research and development credits for companies to create defenses against cyberattacks i d actually like to see the hill and the president think about before a breach happens is there something we can do differently and how do we incentivize companies to think about different designs and d
