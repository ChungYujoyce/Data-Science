member of the house judiciary committee plus joe biden d presidential candidate china is going to eat our lunch come on man trump he aposs very naive about china that aposs a very dumb statement to make wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about push back to joe biden aposs comments on china from both the right and the left and our power player of the week melinda gates on the moment a lift for women melinda gates i aposm not afraid to say what i believe and what i know to be true wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington president trump got some good economic news this week but it aposs been a rough patch for trump foreign policy first the failed uprising in venezuela as opposition leader juan guaido was unable to get the military to overthrow disputed president nicolas maduro then reports north korea fired several short range projectiles raising tensions between washington and pyongyang and russian president putin in the middle challenging the u s on both fronts in a moment we aposll discuss all this with the secretary of state mike pompeo but first let aposs get the latest from kevin corke at the white house kevin kevin corke correspondent chris it remains unclear exactly what the administration will do in terms of strategy as it ponders how to tackle those simmering hot spots around the globe that you mentioned but what is clear is each comes with a great sense of urgency begin videotape corke north korea state media company showing kim jong un looking through binoculars observing what it says is the firing of long range rocket launchers and what appeared to be a short range ballistic missile the provocation comes amid a new rift in the repressive government aposs diplomatic relationship with the u s just last week chairman kim held a summit with russian president vladimir putin who also appeared to undermine american foreign policy in venezuela by backing embattled president nicolas maduro a plan to oust maduro appeared to fizzle out this week as opposition leader juan guaido continued to garner the vocal support of both the trump administration and that of millions of his countrymen who have seen their once prosperous economy fall desperately into ruin and while guaido told the washington post that he underestimated maduro aposs support within the military he promised to continue his fight to wrest control of the country from the dictator hopefully he said with the support of the u s president trump meanwhile had what he described as a very good conversation with the president of russia this week the two men discussing a number of topics among them trade nuclear proliferation as well as the ongoing crisis in caracas end videotape corke and speaking of caracas guaido told the washington post he expects a groundswell of defections in the military to ultimately force maduro from power we aposll see if that actually happens he also said chris he wouldn apost rule out u s military assistance alongside venezuelan forces to ensure the peaceful transfer of power chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thank you and joining us now secretary of state mike pompeo mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday mike pompeo secretary of state chris it aposs great to be with you this morning wallace let aposs start with venezuela on tuesday you and national security advisor john bolton were talking as if a coup in caracas was underway take a look begin video clip john bolton white house national security they need to be able to act this afternoon or this evening to help bring other military forces to the side of the interim president end video clip wallace what happened was there an intelligence failure about whether or not some top venezuelan officials were going to flip on nicolas maduro pompeo well first of all chris there can apost be a coup led by juan guaido he aposs the elected leader of venezuela duly elected to their constitutional process so there couldn apost have been a coup there the venezuelan people aposs struggle for democracy continues we made it very clear that maduro must leave there is no way you can have free and fair elections with maduro still inside of that country and we aposve made very clear that not only the united states but 50 plus nations support juan guaido and his national assembly in their efforts to beat back the the horrific conditions that i was i was on the border of cucuta i watched women carrying babies across the border they didn apost want to leave their country they were having to make decisions about whether they could feed their baby on the second day or the third day their sick children didn apost have medicine all of which was sitting in colombia and maduro has denied them and so our effort so our effort is to make sure crosstalk wallace ousting coup whatever why didn apost it happen maduro is still in power pompeo he is these things sometimes take time wallace and why did we think it was going to happen on tuesday and it didn apost happen pompeo we know it aposs going to happen wallace but i aposm i don apost mean to press pompeo chris i aposm not going to talk about all the various conversations that have taken place we continue to work with leaders down there the lima group continues to work with leaders on the ground the organization of american states continues to work with leaders on the ground if you think about where this country was 90 days ago the venezuelan people should be very proud they aposre much closer to having democracy restored and having their country back on the right track than they were 90 days ago wallace on for weeks you and bolton have talked about and called out russian interference in venezuela here you are begin video clip bolton they aposd love to get effective control of a country in this hemisphere it aposs not ideological it aposs just good old fashioned power politics pompeo we aposve told the russians and we aposve told the cubans that aposs unacceptable end video clip wallace but friday president trump talked with russian president vladimir putin about venezuela here he is begin video clip donald trump president he is not looking at all to get involved in venezuela other than he aposd like to see something positive happen for venezuela end video clip wallace so which is it is putin propping up a dictator in our own backyard or is putin looking for something positive in venezuela pompeo president aposs been very clear on this he said i think it was in a tweet several weeks back the russians have to get out that remains our view we want the venezuelan people not to have interference from any country whether it aposs china or russia you now have iranians on the ground in venezuela we know about the long history with a couple of thousand cuban thugs essentially controlling that country today the united states wants all other countries out of this nation and allow the venezuelan people to restore their own democracy we aposre confident that we aposre going to achieve that and i couldn apost tell you what day but it will happen wallace but the president told the american people that putin said that he didn apost want to get involved there he was looking for something positive in fact russia is very involved the wagner group private russian military force in venezuela putin has sent top military and intelligence officials to venezuela what are you going to tell you aposre going to be meeting with russian foreign minister lavrov in finland tomorrow what are you going to tell him pompeo i aposm going to tell him the same thing the president told the world that every country must get out including the russians that aposs what i aposll tell them we don apost want anyone messing around with venezuela because we want them to be an autonomous independent sovereign state democratic elected officials this is what we desire for the venezuelan people that aposs what i aposll talk with him about i aposm then going to travel on to germany and to the united kingdom we aposre going to work with them to achieve this objective wallace the mueller report that came out has completely cleared the president when it comes to collusion with the russians in the 2016 election as for the kremlin however it said this the russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion but here aposs how president trump described his talk with putin on friday about 2016 and about possible meddling in 2020 take a look begin video clip trump he actually sort of smiled when he said something to the effect that it started off as a mountain and it ended up being a mouse reporter did you tell him to meddle in the next election trump we didn apost discuss that really we didn apost discuss it end video clip wallace why doesn apost the president get tough with putin about what everyone seems to agree is clear meddling in 2016 and the threat of meddling in 2020 pompeo chris this administration has been tougher on russia than any of it aposs predecessor administrations i could go through the list but there aposs not time in the show to talk about all the things we aposve done largest defense buildup our new i mean the list is long chris and so for you to suggest that somehow we haven apost taken election interference seriously we do we continue to work on it we continue to make sure that every election is as safe as it can possibly be the department of homeland security the intelligence agencies are all working to not only ensure that 2018 was successful we were and that 2020 will continue to be successful we take seriously the threat of election interference from every country russia included wallace but i guess what i aposm asking and i take your point because in terms of specific policies the u s pompeo chris i don apost get your point crosstalk pompeo i aposm confused i aposm confused wallace well let me crosstalk pompeo the administration that has been tougher on russia than any of its predecessors and yet you continue to be fixated on something that robert mueller wrote down i aposm i struggle with that wallace i aposm not i aposm not fixated about robert mueller i aposm fixated on the president aposs conversation with vladimir putin and in the fact that in a conversation he doesn apost even mention meddling in 2020 and the question i aposm asking i think it aposs a legitimate one a lot of people are asking it sir is why not pompeo i talk to leaders all the time we cover a broad range of subjects sometimes conversations just aren apost long enough to cover every issue that might be broad up i aposll let the white house talk to what the president actually said in the set of remarks but no one should misunderstand from your question today your viewers should not be misled this administration has taken seriously the threat of election interference and we aposll continue to do so wallace yesterday north korea fired what it is calling short range projectiles but the question is and let aposs put these up on the screen were they in fact north korea aposs new short range ballistic missiles and if so did they violate north korea aposs moratorium on missile tests since 2017 pompeo here aposs what we know so far the launches and there were several were short range i don apost want to say exactly how long we aposre still working to ensure that we have the dataset right we have high confidence that they were not intermediate range missiles that they were not long range missiles or intercontinental missiles we are continuing to evaluate that data set but we want to put it into larger context we still have every intention of negotiating a good resolution with north korea to get them to denuclearize we aposve known it would be a long path we aposve known it wouldn apost be straightforward but i have extended our negotiating hand to the north koreans since hanoi we aposve heard back from them i extend my hand to continue those negotiations we want to continue to work towards a peaceful resolution to achieve denuclearization fully verified in north korea wallace you i just want to make it clear were they in fact those that we just put up on the screen the new north korean short range ballistic missiles pompeo i didn apost see the list on the screen i aposm going to let the department of defense make announcements about what they ultimately determine these to be i can tell you what we have ruled out with certainty wallace and and you don apost or do you see it was violating their moratorium on missile tests pompeo we aposll have to take a look we know our objective the moratorium was focused very focused on intercontinental missile systems the ones that threaten the united states for sure wallace north korean officials you talk about wanting to continue talks have gone after you recently i want to put some of this on the screen they said you have a quote mean character you should be replaced by someone quote more careful and mature in communicating with us and you talk about changing your talk about changing paths if diplomacy fails their quote sir not mine is stupid and dangerous i guess the question i have is the president says even in a tweet yesterday the deal will happen it sure seems like diplomacy between the u s and north korea is in trouble pompeo it always seems that way until it aposs successful chris and as for the north korean comments you know the immaturity thing i aposm not so sure about the rest of it i aposll let the world decide crosstalk wallace there were some moments in this conversation when i thought mean might be correct pompeo they aposre not the president gets to choose who his negotiators are he aposs leading the effort we we are we want to maximize the possibility and keep open to the maximum extent possible that we can achieve the outcome that president kim himself told president trump in june in singapore that we aposll achieve and we aposre working to do that that aposs what the state department aposs mission is wallace i aposve got a couple of minutes left i want to get into two more subjects one there has been an outburst of rocket fire from gaza the u s rather israel is responding with the air strikes is this just the normal outburst that we see across that border every once in a while or do you think it aposs something more serious pompeo well it aposs pretty serious now the number is over 400 rockets that we can validate have been fired the israelis have every right to defend themselves i aposve seen video that we can apost validate just yet but where there have been strikes on home civilian populations these rockets were fired with civilians around them in order to protect the return from return fire this is terrible the israelis have every right to protect the sovereignty of their nation and i hope that we can return to the ceasefire that has been in place for weeks and has been holding significantly before this wallace the pentagon issued a report this week that china is making tremendous progress in replacing the u s as the preeminent leader in the pacific and also is projecting economic power as well but former vice president biden said this this week begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate china is going to eat our lunch come on man they aposre not bad folks folks but guess what they aposre not a they aposre not competition for us end video clip wallace does former vice president biden know something you don apost pompeo he seems a little disconnected from the reality that is china today maybe when he ran for president the first time this was the situation but it aposs certainly not today china poses an enormous challenge to the united states of america i agree with him ultimately america will prevail we i aposm confident of that we should bet on our nation but it aposs going to take a serious concerted effort president like president trump who aposs prepared to push back against china whether that be on trade or their military build up or the theft of our intellectual property we need a president who will be serious in protecting american against the challenges china presents wallace secretary pompeo thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir safe travels pompeo thank you sir wallace up next president trump says the white house is fighting all subpoenas and now democrats are threatening to hold the attorney general in contempt we aposll talk to the house democratic leader when we come right back commercial break wallace the chair of the house judiciary committee is giving the attorney general one more chance to comply with a subpoena or face sanctions joining us now from rhode island congressman david cicilline a key member of the committee and of house democratic leadership congressman your committee has given attorney general barr a deadline of 9 00 a m tomorrow to turn over a fuller version of the mueller report as well as underlying documents one has there been any progress have you gotten any response from the attorney general and two if you don apost by 9 00 a m tomorrow will your committee vote to hold the attorney general in contempt of congress rep david cicilline d r i well good morning chris it aposs good to be with you the chairman of the committee conveyed to the attorney general some additional compromises and said you know produce all of the documents but prioritize those that are referenced in the report give us an opportunity to see the unredacted version and gave until tomorrow morning at 9 00 to produce the document there has not been a compliance yet we obviously have to wait until the mornings to see if the attorney general will comply i think if the attorney general does not the chairman will ask the committee to move forward with a contempt citation the chairman has been very patient trying to accommodate the attorney general in every way but the members of our committee need to see the full report and the supporting documents so we can continue to do our work conduct oversight in a responsible and sober way so i hope the attorney general will comply wallace all right back in 2012 when house republicans were in the majority they voted on the house floor to hold then attorney general eric holder in contempt for failing to turn over documents in the fast and furious case you walked off the house floor in protest explaining quote i declined to participate in these partisan political games which you called an abuse of power congressman aren apost you and democrats now involved in the same political games cicilline they are quite different chris in that instance the white house had already indicated it would produce all the documents and the attorney general said the same the republicans nonetheless wanted to go forward with a contempt citation which is close to an election i thought it would be politically advantageous it was really a stunt in this case the attorney general has continued to refuse to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena so they aposre very different circumstances wallace wait wait wait cicilline barr said tomorrow morning i aposm going to produce the documents then we would not go through with contempt crosstalk wallace they sued for documents that eric holder hadn apost turned over they wanted him to testify and he didn apost testify i mean the point is kind of the same which is the attorney general refused to answer requests from the house and the house voted him in contempt in one case you said it was an abuse of power in the other you aposre going to support it cicilline no attorney general holder did testify before congress and the white house did indicate the intention to turn over the documents that the republicans sought despite that assurance they wanted to move forward with contempt in this case we don apost have that assurance from the attorney general mr barr has refused to furnish the documents or come before the committee so those circumstances are different if mr barr agrees to turn over what we aposve requested and a reasonable way no one on the committee is interested in moving forward with contempt we want the information so we can do our work so we can do the oversight that our committee is required to do wallace attorney general barr declined to testify before your committee this week after your panel insisted that he answer questions from staff lawyers in addition to members of congress i have a question when was the last time that a house committee demanded that staff lawyers interrogating a cabinet secretary cicilline well i think the last time was probably during iran contra when the staff lawyers examined ed meese and caspar weinberger so and of course it happened in the senate with christine dr ford i mean the fact is the house rules permit this the committee decides how we will examine witnesses and how we will collect evidence a witness has no right to dictate to the congress how they are going to be examined or how we are going to collect evidence wallace so let aposs go back in terms of the direct answer to my question which was the last time a house committee did this it was iran contra in 1987 which is cicilline i stand corrected there were a number of witnesses that were examined during the clinton email inquiry wallace cabinet secretaries sir cicilline i don apost know if there were cabinet secretaries certainly director of the fbi and others but look the fact is they are all witnesses whether they aposre cabinet secretaries or not crosstalk wallace by staff members cicilline yes wallace i can tell you we asked the house judiciary committee they say the last time that a house committee demanded that staff lawyers talk to a cabinet secretary was 1987 during iran contra you aposre quite right about that that was 32 years ago the christine blasey ford case is completely different first of all she is not a cabinet secretary secondly she was interviewed by a woman because of the fact that republicans didn apost want an all male panel to have a bunch of men questioning her so it really seems that the only two cases that we could find were one iran contra and two during watergate and i guess really that aposs the question congressman wasn apost this an effort by the house judiciary committee to make the russian investigation seem as bad and as serious as iran contra and watergate cicilline well i do think it aposs as bad and as serious but that aposs not the purpose for asking staff attorneys to question look it aposs been done it aposs been done to a lot of witnesses and i don apost think whether it matters if it aposs a cabinet secretary or a lay witness the fact is the committee has the right to collect evidence in the way that we think is appropriate and the reason that it aposs so critical for a witness like the attorney general is he aposs a master of invading and when you have five minutes that you go back and forth republican and democrat you sometimes can apost dig deep enough and really get an a follow up questions so we decided it would be much more useful to get the evidence with a staff counsel having extended period of time to follow up and really drill down so the attorney general couldn apost evade answering questions as you saw him do in the senate so look what people should be asking is why is the attorney general afraid to come before the house judiciary what is he hiding what is he worried about what questions is he afraid he can apost answer that aposs the real question crosstalk cicilline it aposs not why does congress want to have staff counsel wallace wasn apost wiling to testify before the committee it was just this particular condition cicilline but why chris i mean you have to ask why what is it about that wallace maybe it aposs the fact that it hasn apost happened in 32 years cicilline but wallace if i might ask you another question sir just to follow up the question now is what is the house going to do about all this here is what attorney general barr said when he testified before congress last month begin video clip rep charlie crist d fla reports have emerged recently general that members of the special counsel aposs team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your march 24th letter do you know what they are referencing with that william barr attorney general no i don apost i think i suspect that they probably wanted more put out end video clip wallace but after we learned this week that in fact special counsel robert mueller had written long before that testimony just after the release of the attorney general summary to barr complaining about his summary here was the reaction from house speaker nancy pelosi begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif he lied to congress he lied to congress and if anybody else did that it would be considered a crime end video clip wallace you are on the record as saying the house should be prepared to imprison people held in contempt of congress are you really serious that you aposre going to go down and arrest the attorney general cicilline well what i aposm serious about is the congress has the absolute responsibility to collect evidence and to compel the presence of witnesses to testify under oath if the executive branch can prevent us from doing that they will have effectively extinguished our oversight function so we have to take this in a deadly serious way we have several ways to enforce the subpoena the first is to judge someone in contempt and to initiate a civil proceeding congress also has the inherent authority to judge people in contempt and there is both 1821 and a 1935 supreme court decision that recognizes congress apos right to that and in both those cases individuals were taken into custody pending their compliance with the subpoena it of course should never come to that we expect the attorney general to honor a subpoena when properly served and we will fully enforce that through the courts but the reality is we have to have access to this information this is central to our oversight responsibilities and it is not up to the executive branch to decide what they want to give us our constitution requires otherwise wallace i aposve got a couple of final questions there have been new reports this week about alleged surveillance some would call it spying by the fbi on the trump campaign it turns out that a new person in the fbi or the justice department had actually met with george papadopoulos continuing questions about the steele dossier attorney general barr said he aposs going to investigate the origins of how this whole trump russian investigation began don apost you think in the interest of fairness that your committee and congress should investigate that as well cicilline well it aposs laid out in the mueller report in pretty significant details more than 140 contacts far less between the trump campaign and russian officials or people connected to wikileaks we know how the investigation began what we ought to be focusing on is protecting america from an attack by a foreign adversary of our democracy and while we are doing that chris it aposs important to note we aposre doing this oversight work but we should not forget the democrats ran on an agenda for the people of this country to drive down health care costs particularly the cost of prescription drugs to raise family incomes with a real focus on rebuilding infrastructure and to root out corruption in washington which is why we passed hr 1 the most significant ethics reform since watergate wallace right cicilline we passed a universal background check that will pay for equal work we aposve begun to work and prescription drugs so we are going to get the work on for the american people but we are also going to do our oversight and we are going to protect our democracy and hold people accountable who engaged with this conduct wallace finally congressman the house judiciary committee your committee is reportedly in talks with special counsel robert mueller about testifying before your committee in fact has he agreed to testify and has a date been set cicilline a tentative date has been set of may 15th and we hope the special counsel will appear we think the american people have a right to hear directly from him crosstalk wallace let me just interrupt because we aposre running out of time cicilline sure wallace when you say a tentative has been set has the special counsel agreed to that date cicilline well he aposs i think counsel for the special or the representative of the special counsel has but obviously until the day comes we never have an absolute guarantee the white house has so far indicated they would not interfere with mr mueller aposs attempts to testify we hope that won apost change wallace congressman cicilline thank you thanks for joining us today cicilline my pleasure wallace always good to talk with you sir cicilline thanks wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss why democrats are suddenly targeting attorney general barr are they afraid of what he will discover the trump russia investigation plus what would you like to ask the panel about president trump aposs decision to ignore house subpoenas just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up the fight between house democrats and the white house begin video clip donald trump president there aposs been no president in history that has given what i aposve given end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what democrats can do if the president keeps ignoring their subpoenas commercial break begin video clip william barr attorney general yes i do have people in the department helping me review the activities over the summer of 2016 end video clip wallace attorney general william barr telling a senate committee this week he aposs serious about investigating what led to the fbi probe of russia and the trump campaign and it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume welcome back brit brit hume senior political analyst thank you chris wallace charles lane from the washington post marie harf co host of benson and harf on fox news radio and gop strategist karl rove well brett since you aposre back from a long time away from us and we aposve missed you i aposm going to ask you the first question attorney general barr seemed to become a big target this week for a lot of democrats particularly after we learned just before his testimony before that committee that robert mueller had sent a letter complaining to him about his summary just after he issued it to congress to what degree do you think that attacks on barr are really about the fact that he aposs serious about investigating the origins of the trump russia investigation hume i think that barr is the latest target because that aposs all they aposve got right now all the critics the people were so disastrously and flaming wrong on trump collaboration with russia in the campaign have now turned their fire on barr and his characterizations of what was in the mueller report because that aposs what they do this kind of character assassination they aposre trying is is a common tactic i don apost think that that they aposre looking ahead to what they suspect might be the outcome of his inquiries into the origins of the investigation and worrying about that and therefore that aposs that aposs too complicated it aposs too clever by half that theory i don apost think that the democrats and the left are very happy that he aposs going to look deeply into that and i think it aposs probably a fairly rich environment to find stuff but i don apost think that aposs the real basis of it they aposre doing this to barr because it aposs what they do wallace i i maria i want to pick up on that with you particularly the last part whether this is a rich environment to investigate this because conservatives seem to think that that aposs going to turn out to be the real scandal here fbi and other intelligence agency overreach and perhaps even clinton campaign collusion with the russians in terms of financing the russian dossier maria harf analyst well there certainly have been a lot of conspiracy theories on the right about the investigation but when william barr was asked in testimony a few weeks ago point blank he was asked do you have any evidence of any wrongdoing in this investigation barr said no he said he had questions and he wanted them answered but questions isn apost evidence so i understand why he aposs doing it there aposs a political pressure on the right for him to do so and i aposm actually happy for him to do so i would love all the fisa warrants to be out because what we saw in the mueller report and i think what we will see when the investigation is looked into is that there were dozens and dozens of contacts between russians russian intelligence link organizations and individuals and americans they may not amount to conspiracy or criminal collusion but they were coming to the fbi and the intelligence community throughout 2016 that were worthy of being looked into from a national security perspective and the counterintelligence investigation if you dig into it i am totally comfortable with people doing that because i think it was warranted in the conspiracy theories on the right will not be borne out by the evidence wallace karl are you as confident and there are a number of investigations you aposve got the inspector general you aposve got the u s attorney out in utah john huber who we we never hear from karl rove contributor right wallace and now we aposve got bill barr are you as convinced as marie is that there aposs no there there when it comes to investigating the origins of this investigation rove well look john huber aposs a barack obama appointed the u s attorney in utah michael horowitz is a respected inspector general we aposre i i think they aposre going to find things absolutely and do i think that it is worthy looking into this you i noticed with representative cicilline he talked about russian interference in the election russian involvement in election why is it that no democrat seems to be concerned about the fact that the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign funneled money to a law firm in order to hide the fact they were hiring christopher steele a british security former intelligence agent to call his buddies in moscow kgb and fsb agents and say got any dirt on trump this ought to worry any american we should not i mean talk about the conspiracy theories on the left have been blown to pieces by the mueller report no evidence of conspiracy or collusion however we don apost have that same assurance yet on the on the clinton campaign and their hiring of christopher steele and in an overt what i think is going to turn out to be a covert attempt by the russians to influence the election by spreading disinformation about donald trump wallace chuck charles lane contributor well i think this conversation shows that whatever comes out of these investigations isn apost really going to settle this dispute to everyone aposs satisfaction i would just flag the michael horowitz ig investigation he aposs already done one that was quite critical of peter strzok and andrew mccabe and some of these other figures wallace this this was about the hillary clinton investigation and how that was conducted lane correct and part two or phase two now is i take it the investigation the background of this fisa warrant so i don apost believe i i don apost believe the democrats are doing what they aposre doing now to distract from that i think they have another agenda which is this is kind of the alternative to impeachment this high pressure investigation but i aposm not sure they are going to like the results of what horowitz comes up with wallace then there is the fight with between democrats who were issuing subpoenas for more documents and for more trump advisors to testify and the white house saying no here was the president this week on that begin video clip donald trump president i have been probably a person that aposs given more to a so called investigation than anybody ever in the history of this country i aposve allowed lawyers to be interviewed i didn apost have to do any of it i could have used presidential privilege end video clip wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on this specific issue we got this from shannon on facebook how many subpoenas did obama and clinton ignore brit how do you answer shannon and just generally who do you think has the higher ground both legally and politically on whether or not the president has to respond to all these subpoenas for documents and for members of his administration current or former to go up and testify especially somebody like former white house counsel don mcgahn hume his resisting of all of this strikes me as a negotiating position it aposs not it aposs and i think that aposs where we are and we aposve had these disputes before going back decades and what normally happens chris is that eventually the parties agree to terms for releasing materials or testimony by administration officials that both sides can accept for example now we aposre having a fight over whether the whole mueller report with all the all the redactions removed which are very few to begin with and all the supporting material will be turned over to congress you know that ought to be able to be worked out and this fight over all the subpoenas for testimony and so forth that ought to be able to be worked out too both every both sides seem very dug in so it aposs not entirely clear to me that this will that this will get worked out in a way that it normally does and i think that the question then becomes how does the american public react post mueller report to the continuing pursuit of these issues and you know we don apost know the answer but my suspicion is that the public may be losing patience with all this wallace i aposve got less than a minute left and i want to pick up on exactly that point with you marie which is when you talk to the democratic candidates out on the campaign trail they say they get questions about you know real pocketbook issues they don apost get questions about trump and impeachment and executive privilege is there a danger for democrats you heard cicilline talk about well we aposve still got this aggressive agenda but here in washington that aposs not what you aposre hearing from the democrats you aposre hearing all about the investigation harf i really think they have to be able to do both here because donald trump has blown up the normal way of doing things in washington on every level and to brit aposs point how this would normally get worked out is some sort of compromise i aposm not sure donald trump will ever do that and if they set the precedent that you can just ignore subpoena requests over and over and over again i do think the american people will start to say if they have nothing to hide and they didn apost do anything wrong why won apost they just come answer questions that aposs why we gave democrats control of the house in 2018 inaudible answers wallace or they may say why don apost they get off that and move to something else anyway all right panel we have to take a break here when we come back former vice president biden positions himself as the blue collar anti trump but will the booming economy undercut biden aposs 2020 ambition commercial break begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate there was a 2 trillion tax cut last year did you feel it did you get anything from it of course not of course not all of it went to folks at the top end video clip wallace well former vice president biden attacking trump tax policy in his 2020 kickoff pitch to working class americans in pittsburgh this week and we aposre back now with the panel karl the washington post fact checker says that biden is wrong of course people the wealthy who paid the most in taxes get the biggest tax cuts but according to the tax policy center and let aposs put this up 82 percent of people making between 50 000 and 75 000 got tax cuts averaging almost a thousand dollars apiece so can biden make the argument as he seems to be there well maybe they did but they don apost quote feel it rove yes well they may not feel it but it aposs not a particularly strong argument i mean particularly when you aposve got 3 8 percent unemployment the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years lowest unemployment rate among african americans and latinos since we began breaking the data out by race in 1948 and most interesting of all wages increasing over the last two years with the people who are the working people getting their wages up 25 percent more than their supervisors unlike the previous five years under president obama whereas supervisors got 40 percent more in wage increases then did the working people underneath them so strong economy hard for biden to make the kind of arguments that he seemed to be trying to make on monday particularly this outrageous comment he made this week about china where it seems like he is completely unconnected to the economic and geopolitical rally of the modern world wallace as karl was suggesting the debate over the economy comes we just got some numbers on friday for april actually you said 3 8 you aposre not quite right let aposs put these numbers on the screen because in fact employers added 263 000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate fell to 3 6 percent rove sorry my my mistake wallace there you go rove i i beg your forgiveness wallace it went from 3 8 to the lowest in 50 years which raises the question chuck how do democrats just generally forget joe biden just generally how do they run against the president when his economy his economy the economy that he is presiding over is doing so well lane yes employment is falling so fast that even karl can apost keep up with the numbers and i i really do think there there is no way to deny that the economy is in great shape in fact when when joe biden he the other thing he said was the stock market you don apost feel that but even that aposs not quite true because so many people have 401 k s and unions are invested in pensions and they are being held by the higher stock market so i think the democrats you know are just in a no win position on that because in a weird way they aposre in the position of rooting for a recession to make their political chances better they aposve got to win this election on other grounds and that wallace other than the economy lane they aposve got to win it on trump is unfit to be president trump is disgracing the office et cetera et cetera and by the way you know trump it picture a different behaving president with these same economic numbers rove that aposs the point harf yes lane his re election wouldn apost even be in doubt hume right he ought to be lane he is keeping himself at in in jeopardy pardon the expression by by biden inaudible wallace and let me let me just say you should read chuck lane aposs column about jeopardy he aposs a hater of jeopardy james but lane but just one last thing if i may wallace yes sir lane the other thing that this demonstrates is that presidential approval and re election are increasingly disconnected from the condition of the economy it aposs much more of a straight partisan judgment than it has been in the past wallace brit hume that aposs exactly that aposs precisely the point that that these numbers on the economy and the general situation in the country in the world this president ought to have an approval rating in the high 50s or low 60s and he can apost get out of the 40s on his approval rating and the reason is that he does this stuff all the time and says the stuff all the time and act in such a way to offend people and and the truth is it shouldn apost or wouldn apost be that hard for him to stop doing that stuff but he can apost and he aposs and the only time i can remember his actually doing that was in the final in the closing weeks of the campaign in 2016 when he stopped on twitter basically and disciplined himself and campaigned in all the right places and and and did smart things and and won the election but most of the time he he he seems to go out of his way to try to make people crazy rove take take a look at inaudible hume and all you have to do is stop that and and he aposd be immeasurably better off can he do it i have my doubts rove take a look at the gap in his numbers his approval in realclearpolicits on the economy is 54 6 approve 41 disapprove his overall approval is 43 8 to 53 1 hume there you go rove now having said that remember this at this point in well in october of 2011 barack obama aposs re election was 38 re elect and generic republican 46 today donald trump is 41 re elect generic democrat 48 so it aposs roughly where obama was at this point or slightly earlier than this so the same rule can apply can he disqualify the 2020 democratic nominee as barack obama disqualified mitt romney wallace marie let me rove inaudible wallace le me bring marie in here because i know that there are a lot of democrats who are saying well ok maybe the overall numbers are good but when you talk about can you afford health insurance can you afford tuition the kind of jobs that people are getting in at behind that 3 6 percent there aposs still a case to be made against the trump economy harf that aposs right and put health care in that same bucket when you talk about tariffs and you look at individual states that trump needs to win the tariffs are having still an impact to this day because he can apost wrap up these trade wars i also think that they don apost sell their own economic news the fact that a lot of people don apost think they benefited from the tax bill that it still polls pretty negatively they aposre not even selling that so president trump can certainly win re election that is true but i don apost think he can do it based on the economy alone democrats are going to make this a moral contest an ethical contest sometimes economic news isn apost enough and there are still a lot of people hurting whether it aposs health care whether it aposs education and the president to brit aposs point i do not think can find that discipline within him we aposve never seen him be able to do that i don apost think he can now ph wallace and let me just say this because i aposve had the opportunity to sit with the president and he does say i aposm president and you aposre not he aposs a 72 year old billionaire he ran against all odds and become the president so i aposm not sure it aposs that easy to tell them how to perform he seems to harf i don apost think it aposs easy hume and the other thing is you had going for him is that there does not seem yet to be emerging in the democratic field anybody who might be an obvious winner you know joe biden biden can wallace well in the polls some of these guys are leading i understand hume right i understand that but but biden comes out of the box and he goes up in the polls and he raises a bunch of money and so forth and the next thing you know you aposre playing clips of him saying dumb stuff on television and and this is the story of joe biden it has been a lot of good in joe biden but he you know i you know the idea that he aposs some blowout great candidate is that because of his blue collar roots is going to be able to knock trump off i think is is fanciful he aposll he aposll struggle against trump wallace we aposve we aposve we aposve only got a year and a have to talk about this harf right hume right wallace thank you thank you for coming back brit see you next sunday up next our power player of the week a household name who for the first time is opening up about her own household trying to give all women a lift commercial break wallace she grew up in texas the daughter of an engineer who worked in the space program and she

education in the u s now she aposs written the moment of lift how empowering women changes the world wallace on camera you say that you feel rage about some of the injustice you see rage about what

births of her pregnancies she aposs not only healthier the children are healthier the family the kids are better educated and they aposre wealthier we want to use this window this opportunity wallace another big issue for gates unpaid work in the u s she says women do 90 minutes more unpaid work a day than men do taking care of the family gates over the course of a woman aposs lifetime around the world it aposs seven years of her life so i think there aposs every man and woman can imagine what they might do with seven more years of their life wallace it has been tough for gates stepping out front and pushing a personal issue like birth control especially as someone raised catholic gates i was terrified to go out and speak about this but somebody had to do it and and at the end of the day i think it also had to be a woman wallace on camera you are famously private about your own life gates yes wallace how hard is it to open up about your marriage your kids gates very wallace voice over gates talks about unpaid work in her own family and convincing her husband to share in driving their first daughter 45 minutes each way to kindergarten gates a mom came up to me and said do you see
