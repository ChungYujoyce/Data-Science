apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion no one s world the west the rising rest and the coming global turnby charles a kupchanoxford university press 27 95 272 pages the future isn t what it used to be never in living memory have foreign policy pundits been father from consensus china will rule the world claims martin jacques 2009 book or collapse insists gordon chang america will or should remain the world s dominant power argues robert kagan or will go down in armageddon in mark steyn s latest page turner a dozen recent tomes warn of islam s march to world s domination while at least one my own contends that islam is dying too there is information in the cacophony most of the world s contenders for superpower status have choices to make that could assure their success or seal their doom things can t simply continue as they are at constant fertility for example china s working age population will fall by half by the end of this century and more than half of japanese will be over 60 according to the united nations demographic model top stories trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning into the fray wades now charles kupchan a georgetown university professor and a fellow at the council on foreign relations who proposes to split everything down the middle if only everyone would be reasonable mr kupchan enjoins we would accept that every country is exceptional in its own way and that no country can exercise global hegemony mr kupchan who ran the europe desk at bill clinton s national security council argued in a 2002 book that the european union would leave america behind disappointed he now selects none of the above democracy promotion tops mr kupchan s list of western policy failures he quotes robert kagan s statement that western ruling classes have operated on the ideological conviction that liberal democracy is the only legitimate form of government and that other forms of government are not only illegitimate but transitory and counters that the equation of legitimacy with democracy undermines the west s influence among emerging powers that is true as far as it goes but mr kupchan does not trouble to ask which autocracies might be stable and why history belongs to those who turn up for it an alarming number of countries may not demographics barely merits a mention in the present book russia has stabilized for the time being but its working age population will fall by two thirds by century s end if the present trend continues between 1981 when ronald reagan took office and today almost 400 million chinese have moved from rural poverty to some degree of urban prosperity the largest migration in modern history and it was accomplished peacefully once the balance of china s population has shifted to the cities though what happens next in place of traditional loyalties or communist ideology china has offered prosperity to the citizens of its polyglot multiethnic empire it will have to decide what it will be in place of the discarded confucian empire will it revert to leftist populism or mystical nationalism or will the 10 percent of chinese who now identify as christians nudge china toward the west underlying mr kupchan s complacency is a naive faith in the whig interpretation of history first there was the holy roman empire he reports and then came the rising bourgeoisie whose aspirations led to the reformation which led to the enlightenment which led to modernity but unlike the end of history school mr kupchan does not believe that the rest of the world will walk the whiggish way of the west instead he has adapted the whig interpretation to accommodate today s academic regime of cultural diversity every culture has its own path to modernity he avers the trouble with this way of looking at things is that modernity hasn t worked out too well in its original western home once continental europe threw off the yoke of the church it embraced the neo pagan nationalism that motivated the world wars of the last century having failed both at christianity and nationalism the europeans for the most part are sunk into an anomie that leaves them infertile and enervated their present sovereign debt problems portend much worse to come by 2040 for example 3 out of 5 italians will be retirees an impossible burden on state finances in the developing world modernity is not a fixed state of affairs but a social and economic morphology whose ultimate outcome is not yet determined many non western nations will follow their own path to modernity just as mr kupchan believes but for many of them modernity will resemble the lion s cave in aesop s fable with many footprints leading in but none leading out america confronts a world in which some of its competitors may flourish while others become failed states as the new contenders confront modernity america s example may be more pertinent than ever provided of course that we americans persist in setting an example
