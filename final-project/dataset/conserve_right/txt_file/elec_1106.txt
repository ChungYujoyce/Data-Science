national review joe rogan hosts one of the most successful podcasts in the country on it he talks about his passions for comedy and mixed martial arts and about conspiracy theories he also talks about male self improvement and self experimentation working out doing drugs fasting meditation sensory deprivation etc etc he s the kind of guy in hollywood who will debate religion with milo yiannopolis in one episode talk comedy with dave foley in the next and then he ll schedule edward snowden to come on he also recently gave a roganesque endorsement for bernie sanders and progressives are mad about it why because joe rogan like other comedians rails against political correctness he also makes jokes about transgenderism opposes the participation of trans women in women s sports and has entertained and ventured the usual arguments about bone density lung capacity and strength when arguing for the unfairness of this practice personally i think progressives are nuts to reject endorsements for the most progressive candidate in history from generally centrist and enormously popular media figures i would bet anything that rogan s audience is full of the obama trump voters across the industrial midwest and north but maybe i don t think like a progressive perhaps rejections like this reflect a serene confidence that progressives don t need political power to continue consolidating culture war wins four more years of president trump just means a few more executive orders to overturn meanwhile taking a hard line encourages corporations universities and entertainment to enforce the newer cultural norms get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
