tarr two of the leading voices of the movement but first correspondent peter doocy reports from the march begin videotape gonzalez jamie guttenberg would never meadow pollack would never peter doocy fox news correspondent six minutes and 20 seconds that aposs how long high school student emma gonzalez stood on stage in silence to mark the length of the mass shooting at her school marjory stoneman douglas high last month march for our lives also spread to new york boston and parkland florida where students started this nationwide campaign for gun control kasky thousands of young people my classmates were forced to become adults and were targeted as adults we have to do this for them doocy the trump administration aposs proposed bump stock ban and the fix nics background check improvements signed into law friday don apost go far enough for students like parkland s delaney tarr tarr the pressure is on for every person in power and it will stay that way because they know what is coming doocy lin manuel miranda ben platt ariana grande and miley cyrus were among the celebrities sharing the stage with students saturday president trump is in florida this weekend but a white house spokeswoman applauded young people exercising their first amendment rights as for the nra unlike the day of the school walkouts when they tweeted i ll control my own guns thank you no response during the rallies even though a high percentage of protests signs were aimed at them unidentified male to all the politicians out there if you take money from the nra you have chosen death doocy thousands who couldn apost get close enough to see the stage on pennsylvania avenue stood around for hours anyway supporting a cause that inspired many young protesters to attend a political rally for the first time in their lives chris end videotape wallace peter thank you now to just released fox news polls that strong support for tougher gun controls by a 13 point margin voters say protecting against gun violence is more important than protecting gun rights and there is broad support for measures to reduce gun violence universal background in mental health checks raising the legal aid to buy rifles to 21 putting armed guards in schools and banning assault weapons but the poll also finds widespread doubt congress will act while 38 percent say it aposs extremely important for congress to pass gun legislation this year only 7 percent think that aposs extremely likely to happen joining me now two students from parkland florida who were key organizers of yesterday aposs marches cameron kasky and delaney tarr and to both of you welcome back to fox news sunday cameron kasky march for our lives organizer thank you for having us wallace cameron it was a remarkable event hundreds of thousands of people marching on washington in cities around the country but in practical terms what do you think you accomplished kasky i think the best thing to come out of the march was the fact that while it was important to stand for what we believe in and it was important that the people have come together on this unified front i think the fact that young people everywhere were taking initiative standing up and leading in their communities showed that we learn that our voices matter and so many people came and registered to vote so many people discussed voting and if you look at the voter turnout for our age it aposs embarrassing so the fact that this movement has so many people realizing that it aposs important to get out to the polls is what i think is one of the best things we aposve accomplished wallace well i want to pick up on exactly that point which is that young people traditionally do not go out and register and vote take a look at these numbers in the last midterm election in 2014 only 19 9 percent of 18 to 29 year olds voted that was the lowest rate of youth turnout in the last 40 years delaney what makes you think that 2018 is going to be any different and look i understand the rally is exciting but we are talking about more than seven months from now are people going to go out and are they actually going to vote in november and how do you in a sense keep this movement going delaney tarr marjory stoneman douglas student i believe that the strongest thing we have going for us at this time is the fact that this is a youth movement this is led by the youth and it is lead for the youth and if we can encourage these people to take action to be participating in our society and our politics then that aposs going to encourage our voters to actually turn out and that aposs something i think is going to continue the momentum because even when the media leaves these people are still there and they re still fighting for their own lives wallace let aposs talk about the government response since the terrible shooting at your high school in the big spending bill the president just signed a tightened background check system and allocate 2 3 billion for school safety and the justice department says it will ban bump stocks your state of florida passed a tougher law it raises the age you can buy a rifle from 18 to 21 imposes a three day waiting period makes it easier to take guns away from people considered a danger bans bump stocks and provides 400 million for school safety cameron what grade you give the state and the federal response kasky the state i will give a very very crisp c minus because there are things in what that they passed that are very important raising the age to 21 is something that the majority of the country can get behind and the three day waiting period all of that these are great steps in the right direction as for the country with wallace federal kasky the federal level i was not impressed at all because it aposs important to make the schools safer but this doesn apost just happen in schools shootings are in night clubs churches movie theaters airports yes it aposs important to stop school shootings but this does very little to keep the american people out of the line of fire wallace so what you want to see kasky what do i want to see i want to see an assault weapons ban i want to see high capacity magazines ban these are things that now i don apost just want to see these these are everybody the age has to be raised to 21 these are things that are that are these are important issues and the fact that nobody just got in the bill they don apost say the word gun once what causes all these shootings what aposs the one thing that tie everything together there aposs no specific mental health problem that makes all these shootings happen it s the weapon the fact that they aren apost taking any action towards it is a proof that we need to keep on going wallace right after parkland president trump talked tough about these issues he talked about taking guns away from the people who have basically are have been seen as a threat he talked about raising the age to buy a semiautomatic take a look at what the president had to say begin video clip donald trump president of the united states take the guns first go through a due process second you can apost buy a handgun at 18 19 or 20 you have to wait until you re 21 but you can buy the guns the weapons used in this horrible shooting at 18 end video clip wallace delaney what do you think happened tarr i mean words are find and day i m glad that he said those words because those are some things that we would like to see however i have not seen any action taken to follow through the steps ph crosstalk wallace and why is it that you think that the rhetoric ended and he backed off a lot of the more extreme steps or stronger steps kasky we know he had a meeting with the nra after that and suddenly he backed down wallace is that what you think it is tarr i mean to call it a coincidence seems like a bit of a stretch because to say all of these incredibly firms stances and then to immediately backpedal on them after having a meeting with the nra and not a long time periods of difference there it reads sketchy to me wallace the nra says that what you guys want to do is not just take away semiautomatic weapons just take away high capacity weapons you really want to take away people s guns here is one of your fellow students at parkland kyle kashuv talking during the march yesterday begin video clip kyle kashuv parkland school shooting survivor they truly don apost know what they re marching for they think that they are marching to end school violence but in reality the march for our lives website hasn apost listed that they want to ban assault rifles end video clip wallace cameron how do you respond to kyle kasky well first of all we are not just marching to end school violence we are marching to end violence all over the country because that aposs where it happens second of all we are not trying to take everybody aposs guns away my father was a reserve police officer we have guns in our house they are responsibly managed and hidden from anyone but him the point is we are not trying to take away everybody aposs guns away and the nra wants people to think that they are fear mongers they want to sell weapons by exploiting people aposs fears so the second we want to put common sense resolutions on these assault weapons the nra will say they are trying to steal every single one of your guns and people believe them fortunately the majority of the american people see past this wallace so where would you draw the line in terms of eliminating guns would it just be assault weapons kasky i think assault weapons need to be banned and i think that smaller weapons used more for protection of your homes can be sold but there need to be more restrictions you need to go through mental health check you need to be 21 these are all things that are common sense and i think getting a handgun to protect your home is an important thing if you need to but it can apost be that easy wallace we had a school shooting as i m sure you know here in maryland last week where a student went into the school and killed his former girlfriend but he was stopped and died we re not sure whether he killed himself or he was shot by a sheriff aposs deputy at the school who confronted him a host on nra tv yesterday talked about that deputy begin video clip colion noir nra tv host to all the kids from parkland getting ready to use your first amendment to attack everyone else aposs second amendment at your march on saturday i wish a hero like blaine had been at marjory douglas high school last month because her classmates would still be alive and no one would know your names end video clip wallace delaney your reaction to that in your reaction to the nra argument which is the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun tarr well first of all our school is marjory stoneman douglas high school not marjory douglas high school so i felt like i needed to clarify that but also i m glad that that sheriff had a gun because he is a person who should have a gun but a teacher a teacher does not need a weapon like that a teacher aposs job is to educate not to defend they are pushing that a good guy with a gun what do you define as a good guy with a gun because i would define it as a highly trained professional not as filling our classrooms with weapons that is not a good guy with a gun wallace and what about the application when he says nobody would know your name that this is an ego trip kasky yes i think that aposs the most pathetic thing i ve seen out of this possibly even beating ph crisis actors and that s the nra you ll notice they can apost attack our argument so they are attacking us personally the fact that they are saying that all we want out of this is for people to know our names they have no idea how much each of us would give for it to be february 13th again so the fact that they stooped that low i can apost imagine how much lower they can get wallace i want to end this on a personal note because this is been a whirlwind 39 days and i suspect in some way maybe even you wouldn t agree with this that organizing and the media attention and all of that was a way to get through these 39 days after the shot but now the camera is going to go away first of all how are you doing and secondly do you look at going back to being high school students is something that you re to be able to do tarr i mean even through all the negativity that we aposd seen as we just watch there there aposs been an overwhelming amount of support and positivity and i think that aposs what keeps this going knowing that so many people stand with us and even once the cameras go way that doesn apost mean our job is done it doesn apost mean we just get to go back to our old high school lives because those are forever changed we can never go back to school and feel the same that we once did that s just not a possibility anymore and even though our lives are changed it aposs something that we take in stride because we know we re going to have to continue working on this wallace cameron kasky well you know it aposs been a frenzy the past couple of weeks but the fact that the people that i ve been directly working with my peers the fact that we ve had each other that aposs really how we ve gotten me through this we aposve been supporting each other we ve been smiling through the pain together and the fact that we still have each other the fact that we ll still have the stoneman douglas community it shouldn apost be too hard to feel like everything is ok soon wallace cameron delaney thank you both thanks for taking time out of this busy hectic weekend we ll follow where the movement goes from here and thank you again for everything you ve been through kasky thanks for having us wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss whether the student movement on gun control will have an impact on the midterm elections and beyond commercial break begin video clip david hogg parkland shooting survivor when politicians say that your voice doesn apost matter because the nra owns them we say no more end video clip wallace student organizers of march for our lives calling for action in the wake of last month aposs shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school in florida and it aposs time now for our sunday group former speaker of the house newt gingrich columnist for the hill juan williams julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and former trump campaign senior advisor jason miller well speaker gingrich some people are comparing what we saw yesterday to the civil rights movement to the marches against the vietnam war as a historian do you see some parallels newt gingrich former house speaker i think it would be fascinating to know who paid for it all i mean the left has this wonderful ability to mobilize so the day after inaugural you have the women aposs march people come in buses who paid for the buses people who organize the whole process who brought the entertainers the left can apost govern but they can sure demonstrate wallace well i mean respectfully why does it matter who paid for it gingrich it matters who paid for it because you d like to know how does somebody build again and again an ability to demonstrate i think it aposs useful for the country to know that as part of the political process wallace juan juan williams fox news political analyst well i couldn apost disagree more i think the key point here is that you saw people of their volition turned out in astounding numbers to express their discontent with the easy availability of guns in this country and what it s led to which is obviously not only we saw the events in parkland now just about a month ago mr speaker but we ve been through columbine which is coming up on its 20th anniversary virginia tech so we know that there is a problem with gun violence in schools and i think it came as an expression of genuine concern about our country and for their own lives to see these young people turn on and his numbers and if folks help them organize i don apost think that is somehow to discount the sincerity of their feeling gingrich i didn t discount the sincerity of the individuals i just said it s an interesting phenomenon that the left s great ability is organizing whether it aposs the women the day after the inauguration you go down a whole list of things but let aposs talk about guns for a second i adamantly favor having armed guards in school i think if we have armed guards in school you would radically reduce the danger we just saw i m willing to have a debate about guns there are five cities in america that have most of the killings in america five cities all five theoretically have gun control all five cities are a disaster by the way those guns are almost all handguns williams right well i just i don apost think that s specific in terms of i think this march was sparked by what happened in parkland florida wallace let me i want to just take before i bring i promise i will in a moment the other two in you and i are old enough so is the speaker that we were around for the marches in the 60s the civil rights marches the vietnam marches you wrote a great book on the civil rights movement eyes on the prize what parallels do you see and do you think these activist can accomplish what they did williams well i can tell you this i don apost make predictions but i will say that i do say a clear parallels just before easter 1963 in birmingham dr king had young people people without mortgages no cars able to go out on the street and take that risk and when the nation saw that saw these young people up against bull connor and the dogs and the arrests guess what the country became galvanize they though oh my god these are children in distress so our arguments about be patient take your time this change will come suddenly all those people who were on the line chris suddenly said you know this is a matter of conscience to seek children in distress and we now want change in terms of civil rights same thing with vietnam same thing interestingly with the suffrage movement in this country young people took the lead so this could be a preview wallace the conventional wisdom and of course as the student said the big issue is are they going to get out register vote and put people like minded people into positions of power the conventional wisdom is that gun rights activists tend to vote more on a single issue than gun control activists but i want to put up this gallup poll thirty percent of gun owners say they will only vote for a candidate who shares their views on gun control but so do 20 percent of people who don apost own guns jason gallup says that we the chattering class overestimates the power of the gun rights lobby jason miller former trump campaign senior advisor well i think that obviously second amendment supporters are very important here and i think going back to the speaker s point though as well we have to look at where the money is going because you have the students that were out marching yesterday you have the celebrities that were there but what people haven apost been talking about near as much are the gun control groups which there aposve been articles this week talking about their record fund raising i think one of the groups saw a 30 percent increase so what do we have coming up this november we have the midterm elections and that aposs what everyone seems to be missing is that these groups have a lot more funding they are going to be trying to turn people out but there aposs another thing that we are missing as we talk about the paradigm here with this entire debate don apost just look to the future look what just happened kyle kashuv one of the parkland students who you referenced in the previous segment has already worked with senators hatch rubio and murphy to pass the stop school violence act these parkland students are already getting it done before we even get into the radical left groups that they are going to try to influence the elections this fall wallace julie what are your sources at the white house say how worried are they about the really tough anti well let me put gun control advocates that they re going to be able to mobilize people to go out and vote and the impact it could have in the midterms and beyond in 2020 julie pace washington bureau chief associated press i don apost get the sense that they are particularly worried about that piece right now i think they are worried broadly about what we aposd seen over the last several months which is a groundswell of enthusiasm on the left among democrats in marches the big think they are looking for though is can that be translated into votes and that aposs where this always comes down to you can have regardless of who is funding it if you have hundreds of thousands of people on the streets that aposs an enormous show of enthusiasm but it doesn apost always translate into registration it doesn apost always show up in people especially young people turning out into the pulse wallace so is that something they re concerned about is it something that they are skeptical and think probably pace most republicans both inside and outside the white house that i talked who are involved in the midterm elections say that the enthusiasm on the left is real that it is not a flash in the pan from you know donald trump aposs election that it has been sustained what they are unsure about and what they aposre trying to combat is the idea of that turning into electoral victories for democrats i think that is still an open question on both sides right now wallace final thoughts speaker gingrich i think nothing would make mitch mcconnell aposs day more than if the democrats insist on bringing up a strong gun control bill because in north dakota montana missouri go down the list every vulnerable democrat wallace we are about democrats running for reelection in states that donald trump gingrich democrats running for reelection in states trump carried 10 of them at least eight of those states it would they would commit political suicide if they voted for strong crosstalk wallace real quickly williams look at what happened in florida rick scott a republican took on the nra and passed some gun control measures i think that aposs a sign of a political potency here for people who aren t necessarily on the left but also independent and republicans wallace ok all right we have to take a break we ll see you all a little later when we come back treasury secretary steven mnuchin on the escalating trade rift between the u s and china what does it mean for the economy and jobs and the stock market that aposs next commercial break wallace coming up president trump holds his nose and signs a massive spending bill after threatening to veto it begin video clip donald trump president of the united states there are a lot of things i m unhappy about in this bill end video clip wallace so how will he and congress funds the government we ll ask treasury secretary steven mnuchin next commercial break wallace after months of good news the economy has hit some choppy waters with the announcement of stiff tariffs threats of a trade war and stomach churning drops in the stock market joining me now to discuss it all treasury secretary steven mnuchin mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday steven mnuchin treasury secretary thank you great to be here with you wallace u s stocks just had their work week in two years the dow fell more than 1 400 points that s a 5 7 percent drop what aposs going on and how long will it last mnuchin well chris there aposs a lot of different things impacting the stock market but i think the most important thing to focus on is the market will go up and down in the short term the real important issue is where will it be longer term and the market is still up an enormous amount since the election and we re confident as we continue in our economic plans that will translate into the market doing better wallace eleven you know to talk about why it is dropping right now 1 100 points of that drop came thursday and friday after president trump announced that he aposs going to impose tariffs on 60 billion of chinese exports are the markets wrong to react so negatively to the president aposs tariffs mnuchin well chris i aposve never thought that the markets are necessarily efficient there aposs a lot of things that went on last week including the fed but as it relates to the tariffs there aposs really been three parts of our economic plan and we aposve been very consistent from day one tax reform regulatory relief and trade and now we are executing on the third part of our plan so i don apost think anybody should be surprised this is a president that absolutely believes in free trade but wants free and fair trade and has been very clear since our first meeting at mar a lago with president xi that the trade deficit has to be addressed that they need to open up their markets to our companies and that aposs fair and free reciprocal trade wallace but to press my point are the markets wrong to be afraid of the president aposs tariffs and the impact it will have on the economy mnuchin i don apost expect to see a big impact on the economy we aposve been very careful in how we aposre doing this and and what we aposre doing but again i think what we aposre doing is long term very good for the economy which it is pressing for free and fair trade and to the extent that china is willing to open up their markets which they aposre making all the right directions on but if they open up their markets it aposs an enormous opportunity for u s companies wallace of course the fear is that that aposs not going to be the way they respond the fear is that the response to the president aposs tariffs is going to be a trade war with china and the day after the president announced his tariffs china announced plans to impose its own tariffs on 3 billion in u s exports and the possibility of billions of dollars more in u s experts whether it aposs american soybeans or boeing jets i know that you spoke with the chinese vice premier yesterday who according to the chinese news agency said that china is prepared to defend its interests do you really believe beijing is going to blink mnuchin well it aposs not a question of blinking i think we aposve been very clear in what we want and they understand that president xi liu he ph have acknowledged that our shared objective is to reduce the trade deficit so as president trump said we aposre not afraid of a trade war but that aposs not our objective and i aposve had very productive conversations with the vice premier he came to washington we aposve communicated several times since then we continue to have a discussion the other night and i think we aposre working on a pathway to see if we can reach an agreement as to what fair trade is for them to open up their markets reduce their tariffs stop forced ph technology transfer these are all the things we want to do but in a negotiation you have to be prepared to take action and that aposs what president trump is doing wallace so so i just want to make sure i aposm clear here because the president announced 60 billion in tariffs the chinese talked about 3 billion and the possibility of more and as i say the vice premier talked about defending beijing aposs interests are you suggesting that none of this is going to happen that you aposre going to be able to avoid it and that none of these tariffs will actually go into effect mnuchin well we we are going to proceed with our tariffs we aposre working on that we aposre also working on investment restrictions but we aposre simultaneously having negotiations with the chinese to see if we can reach an agreement as the president has said we want to cut the trade deficit 100 billion over the next year we want to eliminate forced joint ventures forced technology and we aposre having very productive conversations with them i aposm i aposm cautiously hopeful we reach an agreement but if not we are proceeding with these these tariffs we are not putting them on hold unless we have an acceptable agreement that the president signs off on wallace earlier this month the president announced different tariffs on aluminum and steel imports into this country and one of his top advisors on trade peter navarro was on in this program right after they were announced and he said that this was going to be a global imposition of tariffs on every nation that sends metals to this country take a look begin video clip peter navarro white house trade adviser but you have to understand chris as soon as he starts exempting countries he has to raise the tariff on everybody else as soon as he exempts one country his phone starts ringing from the heads of state of other countries end video clip wallace but that aposs not what happened the administration has now exempted canada and mexico and the european union and south korea and almost all of the major exporters of aluminum and steel i guess my question is what was the point of announcing global tariffs in the first place when you took them all away mnuchin well chris i think i think the strategy has worked quite frankly so we announced the tariff we said we were going to proceed but again we said we aposd simultaneously negotiate and i aposm pleased to say ambassador lighthizer reached a very productive understanding with south korea not just these tariffs but on the chorus ph trade agreement overall we expect to sign that agreement soon and and there is a quota so south korea will reduce the amount of steel that they send into the united states as part of this so i think this is an absolute win win when i was at the g 20 last week i had many discussions with with my counterparts so where we aposve put a pause on tariffs we aposre negotiating wallace president trump said that his policies and especially the big tax cut that was passed at the end of last year would unleash strong economic growth here is the president begin video clip donald trump president of the united states to get it going the way i really want where we have gdp getting up to four five and even six percent because i think that aposs possible end video clip wallace but the federal reserve just came out with its production and it aposs not four or five or six percent growth its 2 7 percent this year declining to 2 4 percent in 2019 again this is the projection of the federal reserve question what happened to the boom mnuchin well i think we aposve absolutely had a boom and that aposs why the fed raised their projection to 2 7 it was substantially lower part of the reason why they aposre projecting to raise interest rates is because of the exceptional performance of the economy and as i aposve repeatedly said our objective is 3 percent or higher the president would like us to get higher than that but at 3 percent there aposs trillions of dollars of additional revenue to the government and tens of trillions of economic growth so what we aposve wallace but they aposre saying for the next two years the fed is you aposre not going to reach 3 percent it aposs going to be 2 7 and then 2 4 mnuchin well again as you know the fed is independent of us and i respect their projections our projections are higher but i think what to focus on is their projections are up significantly and we aposve now had more than two we aposve had two quarters of 3 percent gdp we are well on our way to the 3 percent growth and tax reform and tax cuts are a big part of that we aposre seeing enormous investment back in the united states and great success on that wallace do you think the fed is raising interest rates too quickly mnuchin well again i respect fed independence so i aposm not going to comment on that but what i would say is the market expects interest rates are going to go up that aposs built into the forward curve so the only question is how fast do they raise them and where does it stop and i think that aposs something that they will balance as they see economic growth i think the fed is very committed to make sure that they don apost cut off economic growth wallace when a corporate tax bill was passed you and the president promised that most of the benefits were going to go to workers but that aposs not in fact what has happened so far i want to put up this chart according to one study s p companies have given employees 5 2 billion in bonuses and higher wages the kinds of things you and the president talked about but at the same time they spent 157 billion on stock buybacks so far the tax cuts are going to shareholders they aposre not going to workers mnuchin well chris first of all we aposre only a couple of months into this so i think you have over 4 5 million americans that have received special bonuses that aposs an enormous situation i was at boeing last week with the president or two weeks ago viewing the factory there were a lot of happy workers there i was at apple who aposs committed to put 350 billion back into the united states these are massive commitments and as i aposve commented there aposs nothing wrong with share buybacks share buybacks are just an allocation of capital if a company can apost effectively use that capital they will return it to shareholders in many cases that aposs pensions and other large investors who then invest that capital back into companies that need the capital so wallace ok so are you disappointed that 5 billion is going to workers and 150 billion is going to shareholders mnuchin it aposs not it aposs not an equivalent comparison so again that 150 billion that aposs going back to shareholders gets recycled into the economy the 5 billion that aposs going to workers is an is an enormous amount of money that we didn apost even expect to see right away what we aposve expected to see is over the course of the next year wages increase something like 4 500 and that aposs that aposs a lot of money so i think i think you aposre seeing absolutely the impact that we thought and more so on the tax plan wallace finally we had some drama on friday when president trump threatened for a few hours to veto the 1 3 trillion spending bill that congress had passed and then eventually signed it and when he signed it not very happily he issued this warning begin video clip donald trump president of the united states and i say to congress i will never sign another bill like this again i aposm not going to do it again end video clip wallace question what is the president saying is he saying that he aposll not sign another omnibus spending bill that it aposs got to be individual spending bills for each department and this is something the republicans are in control of the house and the senate and they and the bill that was passed aren apost they responsible for this big omnibus grab bag spending bill mnuchin not not at all so first of all as you know you need bipartisan support in the senate to get the bill passed so even though the republicans control the senate they couldn apost pass this alone it was a difficult decision for the president and i understand that because the president aposs main priority was to get money for the military given everything that aposs going on in the world that is absolutely critical and the democrats held us up our original budget was we would keep everything else balanced but the democrats demanded a massive increase in non military spending and that aposs going to balloon the deficit wallace because that aposs going to mnuchin and that aposs something we aposre going to have to deal with wallace but but i was going to say that aposs going to happen next time when the next spending bill comes up in october they aposre going to be demanding parity as well i aposm not saying it aposs right or wrong but it is reality mnuchin well it doesn apost need to be reality and i aposm not going to comment on what the president will do but as you heard him say he aposs not planning on doing this again i think i think they should give the president a line item veto these things should be looked at wallace but that aposs been ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court sir mnuchin well again congress could pass a rule ok that allows them to do it but wallace no no sir it would be a constitutional amendment mnuchin chris we don apost we don apost need to get into a debate in terms of there aposs different ways of doing this my comment is it aposs clear what happened the democrats in order to get us military spending demanded a massive increase in non military spending and the president made the decision this time that that was worth it because military spending given what aposs going on in iran in north korea in venezuela and russia all around the world where we aposre using sanctions we need to make sure we have a military that has the necessary resources wallace secretary mnuchin thank you thanks for your time this weekend i always appreciate your willingness to take all our questions and answer them thank you sir always good to talk to you mnuchin thank you chris great to be here wallace up next more shake ups at the white house as president trump names former ambassador john bolton as his new national security advisor we aposll bring back the panel to discuss the new hawks ph on his national security team commercial break begin video clip john bolton former u n ambassador this is the way i would propose you do it i aposm glad to be here to talk about denuclearization so tell me what ports american ships should sail into what airports american cargo planes can land at so we can load your nuclear weapons program onto those as soon as beginning next week end video clip wallace president trump aposs new national security advisor john bolton suggesting just weeks before his appointment how the president should handle his upcoming summit with north korean leader kim jong un and we aposre back now with the panel speaker gingrich to say that john bolton is a hard liner on foreign policy is an understatement in addition to those remarks he also said it was quote perfectly legitimate for the u s to conduct a preemptive strike on north korea putting bolton at the nsc and pompeo at the state department do you think that helps or hurts in terms of the president aposs foreign policy in general and specifically in terms of the upcoming summit with kim newt gingrich fox news contributor well i think first of all it actually helps the president because i think he always felt that he and secretary tillerson and he and national security advisor mcmaster had a tension and that both of them wanted a more moderate policy than he did now he aposs going to have two guys who are him and i think it will allow him to relax and accept the fact that they can work together as professionals and bolton is a very solid professional with a very long career and i think that bolton and pompeo both will provide the president with a range of choices along with secretary mattis and i think that they will but they aposll be on they aposll be going in the room saying how can we help get what you want done as opposed to going in the room and saying what you want done is wrong wallace the new fox poll that we were talking about earlier also asks people about the upcoming kim trump summit take a look sixty three percent approve of the two leaders meeting while 30 percent disapprove and when asked who will get the better deal 42 percent say president trump 26 percent say kim juan what do you think of mr trump putting together what some people are calling a war cabinet and does it increase the chances this more hawkish team for conflict or for peace juan williams fox news political analyst well you know to meet the big item here chris is that we have the iran deal reauthorization coming up in about a month and the president has been reluctant in the past to sign it but mcmaster tillerson were of a mind that he should that it is a good deal for the usa bolton on the other hand is a critic a strong opponent and i think that in the short term it means that there aposs it aposs less likely that the president will allow the iran deal to go forward and what does that mean in terms of north korea as we were just discussing does it mean that the united states as we try and negotiate with north korea and kim jong un that we might be seen as not keeping our commitments so i think it does increase the chances for conflict not only in the short term in terms of the iran deal but also with north korea wallace all right i aposm going to make a dramatic change here because the president is also changing his legal team his lead private lawyer john dowd resigned this week and the president is apparently considering a well known lawyer here in d c named joe digenova to join the legal team here he digenova about trump back a couple of months ago begin video clip joe digenova former u s attorney there was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate hillary clinton and if she didn apost win the election to then frame donald trump with a falsely created crime end video clip wallace julie now there is talk that the president may be having second thoughts about bringing digenova on one what do you know about that and two with dowd out and all of this talk about the legal team what aposs the strategy here do you get a sense that is the president going to be more cooperative with the special counsel and sit down and do an interview is he going to be more competitive what aposs going on julie pace associated press well the questions about digenova started to percolate pretty quickly after it was floated that he was under consideration he and his wife have a law firm they are representing his wife in particular is representing another person who has some potential exposure under the mueller investigation and that really encapsulates one of the problems that the white house has had that the president has had in trying to bolster this legal team the mueller investigation is incredibly broad so you have qualified lawyers all over town who are conflicted out because of other clients that they have taken on you have a second problem where you have people who are not conflicted out who frankly just don apost want to join the team right now it has been a struggle to find high quality lawyers who are inaudible wallace but do you have a sense of what his strategy is pace so the strategy as it relates to the mueller investigation wallace yes pace has been twofold one has been to say we want to let this investigation continue we think that there is nothing that the president did wrong either during the campaign or with some of the things that we know mueller is looking at since he aposs taken office the firing of comey the crafting of this letter so that has been one piece of it but you do see the president himself itching to get this over with and getting it over with would mean having to do some type of interview with mueller aposs team and that aposs where a lot of the debate is right now the president wants to do that interview a lot more than his legal team does wallace jason what aposs your sense what aposs the what aposs the strategy going forward after these changes in personnel and do you think the president wants to sit down or not with mueller jason miller former trump campaign senior adviser well we aposve obviously seen the comments from the president about wanting to sit down but i think he absolutely should and i aposll tell you why where i disagree i agreed with the speaker in the previous segment i aposll disagreeing with him here in a conventional washington with a conventional client this would be the advice that you would give the president to say don apost sit down with him but president trump is an unconventional president he didn apost run as a conventional candidate in the primary or the general inaudible wallace but wait this isn apost policy this is law ph miller no but but it all but it all comes together because at every moment every critical moment in president trump aposs short political career he has risen to the occasion whether it be in debates whether it be in big speeches he sat down in front of interviews and depositions before and to sit down and say there was no collusion between the trump campaign and a foreign entity i have full confidence that he can do that because he has to get on offense and take that power away from mueller right now the only one who aposs telling the story are president trump aposs political opponents this is his chance to go and tell it now there aposs one other critical point here chris even after this investigation wraps up president trump is one of is going to be out there telling his story going into 2019 and into 2020 and if he hasn apost sat down i think that aposs going to make it much tougher in the eyes of the american public to say that he aposs completely cleared the deck i full i have full confidence in the president wallace go ahead pace but the reality the reality though is that collusion is not what the president aposs lawyers are worried about in terms of this interview they aposre worried about the things that happened after he took office the firing of comey the drafting wallace the potential obstruction of justice miller but this is cross talk miller but but he has the ability here and his legal team has the ability to dictate some of the terms of what this interview was going to look like and so this is where he needs to go and do that on the front end because again if he aposs not telling his story nobody else is going to wallace all right ten seconds he picked a fight with you and you haven apost said a word gingrich well the only time we were talking outside look my only point is this trump may have done a lot of civil litigation criminal investigations by special councils are very different and very dangerous wallace all right we well i think we would all agree with that to be continued this is not going to be ending right here thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week how the pence family aposs pet rabbit i should say bunny is giving children a civics lesson commercial break wallace for the first time in 150 years there is no pet in the white house but the vice president and his family have brought a menagerie to washington including a dog a cat and a bunny which brings us to our power player of the week begin videotape karen pence vice president mike pence aposs wife and he aposll sit and hold a poise and wait until you get a lot of shots i mean it aposs really adorable he aposs kind of a prima donna hey marlon wallace karen pence is talk about the family aposs pet bunny the main character in a children aposs book she had her daughter charlotte have written called marlon bundo aposs day in the life of the vice president but before we get to the book there aposs marlon aposs story charlotte was working on a college film project and needed a bunny charlotte pence a day in the life of the vice president i asked the owner how much for the bunny and they said to make him an offer and so it became this godfather joke with my friends wallace marlon brando became marlon bundo who escapes from his cage just as two teens break out of their troubles c pence he aposs kind of a metaphor he aposs every deep wallace in 2017 when the family moved to washington photographers spotted marlon being carried off air force two k pence for some reason it became this phenomenon you know that oh my gosh the pences have a bunny and so charlotte thought it would be a lot of fun to start marlon aposs own instagram account wallace last may marlon made his first official appearance at an event honoring military families and clearly upstaged the vice president mike pence vice president of the united states you want to pet him k pence you know who this is don apost you whisper it whisper it m pence marlon c pence marlon this is chris wallace mr chris wallace this is the botus wallace yes that stands for bunny of the united states wallace on camera my family has had a bunch of bunnies and none of them were ever as well behaved as marlon c pence he aposs good yes he aposs he we think he aposs kind of you know he likes the spotlight a little bit wallace voice over and so was born the idea for a book about marlon following grandpa the vice president around washington for a full day of meetings mrs pence who aposs an accomplished artist did the illustrations while charlotte wrote the story in verse c pence allow me to introduce myself i am marlon bundo pence i live with my family here at the vice president aposs residence wallace the pence aposs are donating proceeds from the book to charity charlotte to fight human trafficking mrs pence to support art therapy k pence when our soldiers come back and can apost talk about trauma art therapy is something that can help bring those emotions to the surface where then they can deal with them wallace charlotte says marlon brings bunny lovers together erasing political lines ph but comedian john oliver came out with his own book trolling the vice president with proceeds going to lgbt and aids groups john oliver late night host our story is about marlon bundo falling in love with another boy rabbit because our marlon bundo is gay k pence on marlon aposs instagram marlon actually said the only thing better than one bunny book that benefits charity is two bunny books that benefits charity wallace marlon can be seen on instagram flipping the pages of his book while mother and daughter are clearly enjoying their collaboration c p
