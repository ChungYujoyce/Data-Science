jbs bid an average of 2 56 per pound for five pound pork loin cuts while its competitors bid an average of 3 80 per pound the company bid as low as 2 02 for the cut the midwest center found the analysis found that jbs bid 33 less on the contracts undercutting its competitors even tyson foods the second largest meat processor in the country jbs usa is the u s division of jbs sa the world s largest meat producer the company owns more than 300 live hog operations in the united states it s expanded its reach in the u s in the last decade buying swift co smithfield beef group inc pilgrim s pride poultry and cargill s pork business in addition to other acquisitions abroad jbs facilities in minnesota iowa illinois and california have won trade mitigation contracts with the usda who s the government going to purchase it from the brazilian owned jbs or the chinese owned smithfield they ve allowed enough concentration in the packing industry you re running out of choices said brian duncan a hog farmer from northwest illinois and vice president of the illinois farm bureau duncan raises 70 000 hogs each year selling mostly to tyson but also to jbs beardstown illinois facility following publication of this story the usda provided a response from secretary of agriculture sonny perdue we re buying u s produced agricultural products the premise behind procurement is to take product off the market and support prices this will help u s farmers said perdue these are legal companies operating in the united states this is no different than people buying volkswagens or other foreign autos that are manufactured in the united states where their executives may have been guilty of some issue along the way they still buy the cars jbs is a brazilian company operating in the united states buying product from u s farmers what we do through these companies it s not to help the companies they offer a bid to us based on buying u s farmers production this helps u s farmers by supporting prices companies are able to buy from our farmers more because we are buying that product and taking it off the market greg gunthorp who raises hogs near mongo indiana said its jbs size that allows it to offer such low prices they re a huge global corporation he said because of that they are less impacted by the demand problems purely american pork processors are facing to claim we re bailing out the farmer and bailing out agriculture and giving it to foreign multinational corporations is a joke in an emailed statement jbs stressed its american roots we operate u s pork plants processing american hogs raised by u s farmers the true program beneficiaries said nikki richardson a spokesperson for jbs usa like other companies in the program our sole intent for participating was to support u s producer prices and help our american producer partners it was not a bailout the pork jbs is selling to the federal government comes from american farmers the company said jbs said its facilities in worthington minnesota marshalltown iowa ottumwa iowa and beardstown illinois work with more than 3 165 pork producers paying 3 5 billion in livestock payments each year but many of those producers are on long term pricing contracts with jbs and may not see much benefit from the usda s purchases how does that trickle down to farmers raising pigs for them asked gunthorp they re on a contract that contract s not changing because jbs sold more pork to the government duncan said he hasn t seen much uptick in prices because of the trade dispute commodity purchases there was a slight run up in price late last fall he said there was a rally and the rumor was the government was making some purchases the first usda awards for pork products were released in november but duncan said a bigger factor affecting hog prices has been the african swine fever that s been hurting hog farmers in china and southeast asia since last august china s hog population has dropped by 40 million the u s produces 74 3 million hogs annually according the usda s national agricultural statistics service the disease has increased global demand for pork and could be an opportunity to sell more u s pork to asian markets but that depends on trade with china reopening there s opportunity there for us to be a major supplier said duncan but i don t know if this administration is going to let us take advantage of that opportunity the usda s purchases represent such a small portion of u s hog production it s unclear they ll make much difference ted schroeder an agriculture economist at kansas state university said many of the impacted markets will barely notice these purchases i just don t see these programs being huge support for farmers said scheoder while pork makes up nearly half the food to be purchased through the usda trade mitigation program it s small in comparison to the amount of pork produced each year schroeder said once completed it will have resulted in moving a week s worth of u s pork production which is significant during a challenging time said jim monroe senior communications director for the national pork producers council referring to the first round of pork purchases our preference is an end to trade disputes that have prompted retaliatory tariffs against u s pork from two of our largest export market mexico and china the u s department of agriculture has bought 748 million worth of food from farmers and ranchers nearly two thirds of the original 1 2 billion goal according to the midwest center analysis that s five times as much on food as the agency bought in the first six months of the program according to analysis by the midwest center for investigative reporting the program was intended to be temporary relief for farmers struggling against the effects of the trade wars on may 13 president trump announced the usda would buy another 1 3 billion in food from u s producers an agency spokesperson said in an email that the first round of commodity purchases won t be completed until january 2020 the usda has yet to give details on the second round of purchases jbs is under scrutiny by several u s senators who say the company shouldn t be able to participate in the usda program it is counterproductive and contradictory for these companies to receive assistance paid for with u s taxpayer dollars intended to help american farmers struggling with this administration s trade policy said the may 29 letter t
