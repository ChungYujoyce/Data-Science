having role in deep state hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender kent told investigators that that was his understanding of what trump wanted ukraine president volodymyr zelenskiy to say in order to unlock u s military aid as relayed to the official by others including those in direct contact with the president numerous current and former trump officials have testified that the president was conditioning u s aid on ukraine publicly investigating democrats including his potential 2020 political foe joe biden and biden s son clinton he explained was shorthand for the 2016 u s presidential campaign it was a reference to trump s view pushed by his personal attorney rudy giuliani but outside of mainstream u s intelligence that ukraine played a role interfering in the election kent also raised concerns about giuliani s campaign of lies against ukraine ambassador marie yovanovitch and the trump administration s firing of the veteran diplomat house investigators are releasing key transcripts from days of closed door interviews in the impeachment inquiry as they prepare for public sessions with witnesses next week a whistleblower s complaint about trump s july 25 telephone call with zelenskiy was the spark that ignited the investigation kent had testified for hours in october about the shifting u s policy toward ukraine as administration officials and giuliani were taking the lead acting outside of regular foreign policy channels the career official began to understand that unless ukraine took on the investigations trump wanted the administration would hold up nearly 400 million in military aid to the young democracy that relies on u s support to counter russian aggression kent said he memorialized in writing the conversations he was having with other diplomats amid his concerns of an effort to initiate politically motivated prosecutions that were injurious to the rule of law both in ukraine and u s the memorandum was submitted to the state department he told investigators he was uncomfortable with what he was hearing about giuliani pushing the investigations and trump s special envoy to ukraine kurt volker engaging ukrainian officials on the subject and i told bill taylor that s wrong and we shouldn t be doing that as a matter of u s policy kent said referring to william taylor the top diplomat in ukraine who has also testified in the inquiry trump s ambassador to the european union gordon sondland had dubbed himself volker and energy secretary rick perry the three amigos with a mandate to take the lead on ukraine policy over the career diplomats kent testified at one point kent said volker s assistant catherine croft asked if anyone had sought investigations from ukraine kent said he hoped the u s had not because that goes against everything that we are trying to promote in post soviet states for the last 28 years which is the promotion of the rule of law in one particularly unsettling scene kent describes mounting unease over trump s phone call with zelenskiy within days he was receiving a readout from lt col alexander vindman an army officer assigned to the national security council who was among the officials listening to the call vindman has become a key witness in the house investigation vindman was uncomfortable as he gave kent the readout and unwilling to share much of what was discussed even over the secure phone line between the nsc and state it was different than any readout call that i had received kent said he felt i could hear it in his voice and his hesitancy that he felt uncomfortable vindman told him the tone of the trump zelenskiy call was cooler reserved and that zelenskiy a former comedian had tried to turn on the charm he said that vindman told him that the conversation went into the direction of some of the most extreme narratives that have been discussed publicly the diplomats and national security officials weren t the only ones concerned about the military aid being shut off to the east european ally many senators particularly from the republican side called and talked to the president he said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and sens jim inhofe of oklahoma and rob portman of ohio and were among them trump has insisted it was a perfect call with zelenskiy and he tweeted thursday that americans should just read the transcript house speaker nancy pelosi used that as an opportunity to tweet excerpts from the call including the part where trump asks ukraine for a favor next week kent yovanovitch and taylor are expected to appear in the public hearings first to testify on wednesday will be taylor still the top diplomat in ukraine who relayed in his closed door session his understanding that there was a blatant quid pro quo with trump holding up military aid to ukraine a u s ally facing threats from its giant neighbor russia the diplomats are among those who have worked on ukraine issues for years and have expressed deep concerns about the trump administration s new approach especially in the face of an aggressive russian neighbor kent testified that trump initially did not want to sign a congratulatory letter to zelenskiy on his election in may he actually ripped up the letter that had been written for him he recalled by the end of the meeting though trump been convinced and sondland helped him draft a new version kent said he did raise concerns with biden s staff back in 2015 when he first learned the then vice president s son hunter was on the board of the ukrainian energy firm burisma he considered that a potential conflict of interest but he said biden s office told him the vice president s other son beau was dying of cancer and there was no bandwidth to deal with the situation pressed by republicans if that was the end of the discussion kent said it was he noted the situation at the time russia had recently annexed crimea and said the staff at state was working nonstop we had a war with russia he said associated press writers andrew
