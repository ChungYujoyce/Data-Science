clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk that fandom and the importance of those international eyeballs just keeps growing the nba has been going overseas to play either preseason or regular season games for 40 years and the global footprint of the league not to mention its business interests continues to expand the league has opened up 12 international offices establishing seven academies on four continents and started broadcasting games to more than 200 countries and territories this season the nba heads back to mexico and england for regular season contests after the 76ers and mavericks played exhibitions in china earlier this month i believe we can be the no 1 sport in the world nba commissioner adam silver said when i look at the trajectory of growth the fact that young people boys and girls continue to love this sport are playing this sport are engaged in the sport of basketball on social media or with online games i don t know what the limit is the numbers touted by the nba are impressive 300 million people playing the game for fun in china alone rapid growth in india over the past decade as that country is on pace to become the world s most populous by 2025 an estimated 1 billion people around the globe that s basically 1 out of every 7 people alive having some access to the nba finals but in terms of global popularity soccer is still tops the nba model of academies

to play basketball at a local court there is a plethora of nba jerseys being worn by the players johnson said if you ask any local playing basketball they can t name the players on the local chinese basketball association team but they can name their favorite players in the nba in an instant wade and heat teammate udonis haslem went to china this summer to promote li ning everywhere they went thousands of people were waiting and that s now standard for when any big name nba player heads to asia lebron james has made an annual trip to china for years stephen curry dropped some mandarin on

be able to show your personality that s what i do when i come to china going to places like china is fun for certain but it s clearly smart nba business now as well it s been that way for years wade

philippines england france and japan he tossed out the ceremonial first pitch at a japanese baseball game he shot around with soccer star neymar he watched a premier league game in england one of the
