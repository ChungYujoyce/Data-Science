ace for house seat becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion presidents by the very nature of their job have to put up with a lot of criticism and donald trump gets more than his share of well downright insults take for example the recent remarks from the british ambassador to the united states kim darroch whose unvarnished views about the president contained in leaked diplomatic cables described president trump as insecure dysfunctional inept and unpredictable mr trump fired back tuesday calling mr darroch wacky a very stupid guy and a pompous fool he proceeded to broaden his response by attacking prime minister theresa may for her failed handling of the brexit negotiations saying he advised her on how to deal with the issue but she went her own foolish way and was unable to get it done a disaster top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender obviously the ambassador s leaked confidential cable was an embarrassment for the may administration but mr trump s rash decision to attack the prime minister did more harm than good in a stroke the cables appeared to undercut an intense english charm campaign to win over trump who was feted by queen elizabeth ii had tea with prince charles and commemorated a d day victory during an official state visit last month the washington post said on wednesday but mr trump didn t stop there he stepped up his criticism by saying he would no longer deal with mr darroch who was disinvited from a monday dinner with treasury secretary steven mnuchin and the emir of qatar as of late tuesday the state department has not been told to end all its contact with the ambassador waiting no doubt to see if great britain decided to recall him that didn t happen because mr darroch resigned wednesday instead the political squabble over mr trump s remarks about mrs may has become a divisive issue in the upcoming election to replace her british foreign secretary jeremy hunt who is likely to oppose trump favorite and front runner boris johnson in the race sharply criticized mr trump s remarks in a live tv debate tuesday night earning mr hunt the biggest applause line of the evening i think trump s comments about theresa may were unacceptable and he shouldn t have made them mr hunt said mr hunt had tweeted earlier in the day that if i become pm our ambassador stays then in the evening debate he again promised to keep mr darroch in his ambassador s post until his retirement in 2020 mr johnson on the other hand has refused to say whether or not he would recall mr darroch all of this is enormously sad because of the special relationship and alliance that america has long had with great britain one white house official said it was unfortunate what had happened with trump s comments because there previously had been a very strong relationship the washington post reported wednesday all of that is now endangered due to some name calling that future generations will little note nor long remember politics is a rough and tumble business it isn t the kind of work for the faint hearted perhaps the most famous exchange of insults came in a blistering letter harry truman wrote to the washington post s then music critic paul hume who had written a scathing review of his daughter s soprano voice in a concert she gave at dar constitution hall miss truman cannot sing very well she is flat a good deal of the time more last night than at any time we have heard her recital when one can relax she communicates almost nothing of the music she presents hume wrote in part in an angrily written letter truman responded this way mr hume i ve just read your lousy review of margaret s concert i ve come to the conclusion that you are an eight ulcer man on four ulcer pay he wrote some day i hope to meet you when that happens you ll need a new nose a lot of beefsteak for black eyes and perhaps a supporter below the president said his letter sparked a torrent of criticism from voters who bitterly admonished him for his undue concern over your daughter s music career while our soldiers were dying as for mr trump he had better understand that criticism goes with the presidency get over it donald lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to the washing
