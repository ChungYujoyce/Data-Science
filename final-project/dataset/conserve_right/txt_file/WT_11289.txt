top candidates and their allies accusing each other of everything from using their own children as political shields to betraying the u s navy now the campaign between establishment friendly former state treasurer shane osborn and tea party backed university president ben sasse which has turned uncharacteristically negative for nebraska is creating an opening for a lesser known wealthy

kind of the tea party wing and traditionalists said john hibbing a political science professor at the university of nebraska there is the perception here that sasse is kind of the new kid on the block hasn t really paid his dues in terms of establishment nebraska republican politics here a dearth of polling has made the race difficult to handicap but mr sasse is trying to ride the wave of endorsements from conservative groups such as the club for growth and high profile republicans including former alaska gov sarah palin and sens ted cruz of texas and mike lee of utah mr osborn on

conservative is in this race their claims could not be further from the truth he said i am a lifelong pro life conservative who has voted for republicans in every election and supported countless republican candidates campaigns but the freedom pioneers action network s sudden interest in the race raises eyebrows in a contest that has drawn attention from groups that mr mcconnell has vowed to crush this election cycle such as the senate conservatives fund freedomworks and the club for growth mr osborn and his allies say mr sasse a health and human services department adviser in the george w bush administration can t be trusted to fight obamacare they say he called the affordable care act an important first step in fixing the country s health care problems mr sasse said that line is

he landed a navy reconnaissance plane in china after the plane was hit by a chinese fighter the incident turned into a major international crisis and mr osborn s handling of the incident and the sensitive information and equipment on the plane has become a campaign issue an officer that s willing to stoop to something like create a fake memo just shows a total lack of character and is not someone that we need in the united states senate retired nebraska air national guard brig gen carl lorenzen says in the ad while not addressing the accusations mr osborn s campaign dismissed the ad in
