apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic tehran iran ap iran on monday broke further away from its collapsing 2015 nuclear deal with world powers by doubling the number of advanced centrifuges it operates linking the decision to u s president donald trump s withdrawal from the agreement over a year ago the announcement which also included iran saying it now has a prototype centrifuge that works 50 times faster than those allowed under the deal came as demonstrators across the country marked the 40th anniversary of the 1979 u s embassy takeover that started a 444 day hostage crisis by starting up these advanced centrifuges iran further cut into the one year that experts estimate tehran would need to have enough material for building a nuclear weapon if it chose to pursue one iran

prototype he called the ir 9 which worked 50 times faster than the ir 1 as of now iran is enriching uranium up to 4 5 in violation of the accord s limit of 3 67 enriched uranium at the 3 67 level is enough for peaceful pursuits but is far below weapons grade levels of 90 at the 4 5 level it is enough to help power iran s bushehr reactor the country s only nuclear power plant prior to the atomic deal iran only reached up to 20 iranian president hassan rouhani will announce further steps away from the accord sometime soon government spokesman ali rabiei separately said monday suggesting salehi s comments could be followed by additional violations of the nuclear deal an announcement had been expected this week iran has threatened in the past to push enrichment back up to 20 that would worry
