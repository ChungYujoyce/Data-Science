tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap michael cohen s testimony is just the beginning the house oversight hearing with president donald trump s former attorney coming in advance of special counsel robert mueller s report heralds what democrats in congress view as the long days ahead providing checks and balances on the oval office for some the outcome may or may not lead to grounds for impeachment for others impeachment cannot come fast enough top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens n j governor

and investigations unfold democrats particularly those running for the white house may be speeding toward a moment when they have no choice but to consider the i word newly elected democratic rep rashida tlaib among the most outspoken lawmakers on impeachment says that as the 2020 presidential candidates visit her detroit area district most residents are going to ask where they stand on this issue voters are less concerned with mueller s russia investigation tlaib said than with the day to day white house operations and whether or not there s a crooked ceo in the oval office hours into cohen s testimony wednesday new hampshire s statehouse speaker steve shurtleff a democrat said that impeaching the president was becoming a realistic option they re putting a lot of meat on the bone shurtleff said in an interview it could be a one two punch he said of the cohen hearing and mueller report i think it ll connect a lot of dots trump allies have tried to use the prospect of impeachment as a political weapon the president s former chief counselor steve bannon had warned before the 2018 elections that democrats would impeach the president if they won control of congress republicans are taking up that mantle at the start of the cohen hearing the top republican on the panel rep jim jordan of ohio said the only reason for the session was so democrats could pursue impeachment another committee republican rep chip roy of texas called the hearing a circus not worth americans time and newly elected republican rep carol miller of west virginia said the sole purpose was discrediting the president if it was not already obvious miller said there are members here with a singular goal in congress to impeach president trump house speaker nancy pelosi has kept calls for impeachment at bay by insisting that mueller first must be allowed to finish his work which reports suggest could happen in the coming weeks and present his findings publicly though it s unclear whether the white house will allow its full release impeachment is a divisive issue in our country and let us see what the facts are pelosi said thursday when the facts are known we ll make a judgment then pelosi says the house shouldn t pursue impeachment for political reasons nor should it hold back for political reasons instead she says lawmakers need to do their jobs as a co equal branch of government and go wherever the facts lead the american people expect us to hold the administration accountable said rep david cicilline d r i a member of house leadership and if during the course of that we come upon sufficient evidence that warrants his removal i think they expect us to do that but democrats are not there yet at all so far the democratic party s potential 2020 class has tried to avoid the impeachment question altogether fearful that calling for impeachment before the mueller report is out could undermine the process and trigger a voter backlash among them only former texas rep beto o rourke has directly called for trump s impeachment others approached the cohen hearing in more cautious and creative ways sen kamala harris of california used the hearings as a fundraising opportunity are you watching michael cohen testify before congress today campaign manager juan rodriguez wrote there s a lot to unpack but it s abundantly clear if we are finally going to get to the truth congress must act to protect robert mueller from being fired before his findings in the russia investigation are made public he asked for donations of between 10 and 250 sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts sent an email during the hearing promising if she becomes president not to pardon anyone implicated in the trump investigations she set down a challenge for others running to do same sen amy klobuchar of minnesota tweeted that cohen s testimony is a big deal sen cory booker of new jersey said in a brief chat that he wasn t watching the hearing but was looking to digest it and howard schultz the former starbucks ceo considering an independent bid said the testimony is another stark reminder of president trump s utter disregard for honesty and decency the liberal base is restive though a new group by the people launched a pledge drive urging members of both parties in congress to show leadership by extending the legislative branch s oversight to the next step of impeachment we already know donald trump has committed impeachable offenses said alexandra flores quilty a spokesperson for the group we can t wait any longer and want our representatives to move forward now so far only tlaib and fellow newly elected rep ilhan omar of minnesota have signed on another new democrat rep joe cunningham of south carolina said impeachment was not central to his campaign for office our constituents back home sent me up here to do a job and focus on certain issues and that s not something i m focused on right now he said surveys show impeachment has merit for some voters in a january washington post abc news poll about as many americans said congress should begin impeachment proceedings 40 percent as said they approved of the job trump is doing as president 37 percent billionaire liberal activist tom steyer who has poured millions of dollars into a campaign calling for trump s impeachment said cohen s testimony marked a turning point in the debate because it s clear trump broke the law his group is launching a tv ad over the next week to highlight that point it ended the argument it didn t end the fight steyer said in an interview steyer says democrats can only wait on the mueller report for so long before they have to make their own decisions his group is hosting town halls in the hometown districts of key house chairmen including rep elijah cummings of maryland who presided over the wednesday s hearing but as the oversight committee chairman exited the hourslong sessions cummings told reporters the only people using the i word were the republicans not one person on our side mentioned the word impeachment the chairman said editor s note ap congressional correspondent lisa mascaro has covered congress since 2010 ap national political
