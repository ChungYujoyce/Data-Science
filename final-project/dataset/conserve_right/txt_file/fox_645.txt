email we re going to see a massacre on a scale that has never been seen during this entire war these are the words of un deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for syria mark cutts speaking tosky newsabout the assad regime s ongoing russian and iranian backed slaughter of idlib for years the entirety of the international community has had exhaustive and irrefutable proof that syria s dictatorship has been carrying out a campaign ofhuman exterminationagainst its civilian population with a death toll in the hundreds of thousands there isindisputable evidence that the regime has been responsible for using chemical weapons and deliberately targetinghospitals un aid convoys paramedics schools civilian homes andcivilian infrastructure this regime has used starvation torture rape and displacement as weapons of war how much worse can it get idlib is home tothree million syrians one million of them children with the overwhelming majority of the population already displaced from other parts of the country how did those people end up in idlib googletag cmd push function googletag display 1x3 while western leaders were insisting there was no military solution to the conflict in syria russian president vladimir putin s military intervention to save the crumbling assad regime proved that was alie moscow s sponsorship of assad has allowed him to pursue a campaign of mass aerial bombardment of civilian infrastructure while the international community s response has been to issue strongly worded statements about ceasefires after nearly a decade of civil war syria s opposition is broken and fragmented having received no significant international support most of syria s democratic military opposition groups have been disbanded or devoured by hardline islamists the regime which has never made a distinction between civilian democratic armed or islamist opposition has used their presence to justify the bombing ofhospitals with impunity after each rebel held city in assad s sights had been besieged and starved the un would help the regime bus this broken and forcibly displaced civilian population off to idlib former residents of rebel held areas that do not flee are routinelyrounded upand sent to the same death camps that pro democracy activists never returned from in the early days of the syrian revolution a process of systematic human extermination and depopulation the un stopped counting the death toll in syria more than four years ago with a un envoy estimating it stood at more than400 000people that number did not include the hundreds of thousands of missing syrians kidnapped by the governmentfor taking part in anti regime demonstrations with the near daily bombardment syrians have faced for the last four years how much of an underestimate do you think that number is the true horror of the syrian civil war is now beyond human comprehension we will never know how much blood has been spilt and by achieving their final military solution in syria assad and putin will make sure nobody will ever be able to answer that question there is nowhere left to turn for idlib s three million people thesyrian civil defencehas

establishment of a separatist kurdish state and its appalling human rights record including the crimes of militias it has recruited to fight kurdish groups should put into perspective how little hope anyone should have for idlib so how much worse the situation could become is not the question we should be asking the question we should be asking is how many more human beings have to die before the world responds to the knowledge that it already has thatwhat is happening in syria is the deliberate systematic and calculated extermination of a civilian population there are no good options left the opportunity for the world to prevent the slaughter in syria passed the moment it refused to act when the regime started bombing its own cities but while the international community kept fooling itself that it could freeze the conflict the regime and russia maintainedtheir relentless blitzkrieg until only idlib was left ankara s temporary agreement with moscow over idlib has now collapsed and turkey and the lives of three million human beings are now all that stands between the regime and its goal to burn every inch of syria left outside of assad s rule we are now at the precipice standing aside

never let this happen again yetevery single time we ask that question again wefail syrians cannot afford this failure the only options left on the table are a total regime military conquest or the
