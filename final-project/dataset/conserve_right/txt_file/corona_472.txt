the coronavirus pandemic washington president trump on thursday announced new guidelines for reopening states as soon as may 1 now that the coronavirus appears to be peaking in the us but he left the decision up to each state s governor while recommending criteria that would have to be met for each to gradually reopen america wants to be open and americans want to be open trump said at the white house during the daily coronavirus task force press briefing based on the latest data our team of experts agree we can start the next front in our war which we are calling opening up america again and that is what we are doing opening up our country and we have to do that trump stressed that getting the economy back in gear soon would help america recover from the pandemic as i have said for some time now a national shutdown is not a sustainable long term solution to preserve the health of our citizens we must also preserve the health and functioning of our economy over the long haul you cannot do one without the other he said the president said the task force s new guidelines will allow governors to take a phased and deliberate approach to reopening their individual states but that it would be up to individual governors to make the decisions governors will be empowered to tailor an approach that needs the diverse circumstances of their own states every state is very different if they need to remain closed we will allow them to do that and if they believe it is time to reopen we will provide them the freedom and guidance to accomplish that task and very very quickly he said the opening up america again guidelines say states that show a downward trend in covid 19 cases will be able to reopen restaurants bars theaters workplaces sporting centers and gyms as soon as may 1 bottom line if you re ready and you have those beautiful low numbers like some of you have let s get going let s open up your state trump told state leaders in a call in which he praised governors for their hard work you re gonna call your shots under the guidelines states will need to demonstrate a downward trajectory of covid 19 cases over a 14 day period and a robust system for testing health care workers before they can proceed to a phased opening the phases as described by task force member dr deborah birx include dr anthony fauci another expert on the task force left open the possibility that there could be professional sporting events with fans in the stands in phase 3 of the plan which would be around july or august the answer is it is conceivable that we will be able to do that he said i think there will always have to be attention to making sure that we don t do all that packing in together i think we ll be able to have sports events in that phase where you actually have participants there trump applauded the potential return of sports we re going to be back to enjoying sports the way it s supposed to be trump said asked by the post if states that already meet the preliminary criteria such as montana and utah could reopen immediately trump confirmed that they would yes they will be able to go literally tomorrow yes because the guidelines if you go back they ve met those guidelines actually pretty long ago he said under the headline core state preparedness responsibilities the federal government s plan is asking states to be responsible for testing and screening and securing an independent supply of personal protective equipment earlier thursday concerned governors had cautioned trump against reopening too quickly telling him they were still experiencing critical coronavirus test shortages during the conference call in which trump presented his guidelines to reopen the economy multiple state leaders told him they were still struggling to secure enough complete testing kits and were worried about a second spike in infection we have an enormous lack of manufacturing capability for testing kits themselves said washington gov jay inslee according to a person familiar with the call describing it as a hand to mouth existence the democrat said he had more than 160 nursing homes with covid 19 cases that he could not test because the state lacked kits and swabs to get the samples needed for them that is an extreme limitation and we literally are unpacking bags from china by the minute and getting them to a nursing home he said trump promised to ramp up manufacturing of these testing elements saying 5 1 million more swabs would be delivered to states by the end of the month the guidelines were developed by birx and fauci in coordination with centers for disease control and prevention director robert redfield trump also named a bipartisan group of house and senate members to serve on the opening up america again congressional group including two new york republicans upstate rep elise stefanik and long island rep lee zeldin trump s announcement came as seven northeastern states on thursday extended their shutdown until may 15 to contain the coronavirus pandemic additional reporting by steven nelson and bob fredericks read next massachusetts man allegedly tried to blow up jewish nursin read next
