slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed friday s developments came despite president trump s often stated desire to bring american troops home from forever wars in the middle east defense secretary mark esper authorized the new deployment weeks after the administration had already sent 200 air and missile defense soldiers to saudi arabia in response to the sept 14 attack on saudi oil facilities as well as an army patriot missile defense battery a pentagon statement on friday said an additional two patriot batteries are now being deployed as well as one terminal high altitude area defense thaad system along with the two fighter squadrons and the air expeditionary wing u s military officials said mr esper informed saudi crown prince and minister of defense muhammad bin salman of the troop movement friday morning saudi arabia is a longstanding security partner in the middle east and has asked for additional support to supplement their own defenses and defend the international rules based order mr esper told reporters at the pentagon friday afternoon taken together with other deployments i have extended or authorized over the last month this involves about 3 000 united states forces the secretary said that since may the u s has moved about 14 000 new military personnel to the wider persian gulf region the pentagon statement on friday stressed that the united states does not seek conflict with the iranian regime but the statement warned that the u s will retain a robust military capability in the region that is ready to respond to any crisis and will defend u s forces and interest in the region analysts say the expanding deployment to saudi has sensitive implications given the difficult history of american military activity in the kingdom while u s forces were sent there during the lead up to the 1991 gulf war washington began moving personnel out of saudi arabia in the late 1990s following a series of nightmarish developments most notably the 1996 terrorist bombing of a housing complex in the saudi city of khobar that left 19 u s service members dead u s frustration over operating in the kingdom was already boiling when al qaeda leader osama bin laden himself a saudi later cited the american military s presence in the nation and more precisely near the muslim holy cities of mecca and medina as a core motivation behind 9 11 and the khobar towers attack by 2003 the pentagon had shifted many american forces from saudi arabia to al udeid air base in nearby qatar the base currently houses the forward headquarters of u s air forces central command there was little immediate reaction to friday s announcement that thousands of u s personnel will now be heading to saudi arabia but mr trump has faced sharp criticism throughout this week over his announcement last sunday to pull a small contingent of u s special forces back from syria s border with turkey republican and democratic lawmakers on capitol hill have warned the pullback essentially invited turkey to invade northeastern syria and target kurdish forces there that the u s had supported in the ground war against islamic state terrorists mr trump has responded to the criticism by asserting that he is following through on his campaign promise to pull america back from quagmire deployments to the region we were supposed to be in syria for 30 days we ve now been there for 10 years mr trump said at a campaign rally in minneapolis on thursday night we were supposed to be in afghanistan for a short period of time the president said we re now going to be there for close to 19 years it s time to bring them home it s time to bring them home we ve done our job we ve defeated everyone that we re supposed to defeat now we are we are policing we are now policing mr trump said we re not fighting we re policing we re slowly getting out of the middle east he said we re doing it carefully while mr trump made no mention during his remarks of the impending pentagon announcement of a new troop deployment to saudi arabia he lamented that the u s has spent 8 trillion in the middle east we ve lost thousands of brave soldiers and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people great people their lives will never be the same he said these wars produced only chaos and bloodshed and all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed made the middle east really it s less safe it s less stable and it s less secure i say it all the time the president added the single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going into the quicksand of the middle east dave boyer and ben wolfga
