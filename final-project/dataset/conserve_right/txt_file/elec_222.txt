apos s the obama speech on race you probably haven apos t heard in june 2007 then sen barack obama told a mostly black audience of ministers that the country apos s leaders don apos t care about new orleans residents suggesting the city was neglected in the aftermath of hurricane katrina because of institutional racism according to an unedited video reported on by the daily caller in the address delivered during the upswing of the democratic presidential primary season candidate obama specifically criticizes in outspoken terms the decision not to waive a federal law known as the stafford act that requires communities hit by disasters to match 10 percent of federal aid when 9 11 happened in new york city they waived the stafford act and that was the right thing to do he tells the crowd at hampton university in virginia when hurricane andrew struck in florida people said apos look at this devastation we don apos t expect you to come up with your own money here here apos s the money to rebuild we apos re not going wait for you to scratch it together because you apos re part of the american family apos obama echoing rapper kanye west apos s infamous anti bush remarks a couple years earlier then argues that new orleans was treated differently suggesting the reason was that the city is mostly black what apos s happening down in new orleans where apos s your dollar where apos s your stafford act money obama says makes no sense tells me that somehow the people down in new orleans they don apos t care about as much the obama campaign in response to the resurfacing of the video noted that the speech was covered in 2007 and claimed the fresh attention was an attempt to change the subject away from mitt romney apos s own controversial comments about the 47 percent of americans who don apos t pay taxes in a transparent attempt to change the subject from his comments attacking half of the american people mitt romney apos s allies recirculated video of a 2007 event that was open to and extensively covered by the press at the time spokesman ben labolt said in a statement the only thing shocking about this is that they apparently think it apos s wrong to suggest that we should help returning veterans children leaving foster care and other members of mitt romney apos s 47 percent get training that will allow them to find the best available jobs if the romney campaign believes that americans will accept these desperate attacks tonight in place of specific plans for the middle class it apos s they who are in for a surprise media organizations covered the speech at the time but the daily caller said the video it obtained showed parts of the speech that had never been publicized it posted what it said was the complete speech on the website by january 2007 nearly a year and a half after hurricane katrina hit the federal government had committed 110 billion to relief efforts in areas hit by katrina through a variety of programs including community development block grants funding for the corps of engineers and small business administration loans according to a report that may by the u s department of commerce s economic and statistics administration but at the time of obama apos s speech there were still concerns about federal response to the disaster under the stafford act which governs relief efforts the federal emergency management agency was unwilling to waive the law s 10 percent local match provision for aid like it did after the sept 11 attacks and other hurricanes one reason cited for fema s reluctance to waive the 10 percent match in new orleans is concern about corruption the joint center for political and economic studies said in a 2008 report on the relief efforts that report also noted that then louisiana gov kathleen blanco was pushing in early 2007 for a federal law eliminating the 10 percent match the house passed the bill but it stalled in the senate and president bush had threatened to veto it the complete video of obama s 2007 speech surfacing barely a month before the presidential election and the night before obama s first debate with romney could complicate obama s efforts to avoid a politically risky debate over race that partly ensnared him during the 2008 race four years ago his fiery pastor the rev jeremiah wright became a political liability over videos that showed wright making controversial statements obama after initially defending him eventually was forced to condemn wright publicly and the controversy prompted obama to deliver his much heralded 2008 address on race in philadelphia wright reportedly attended the 2007 speech and in the video obtained by the daily caller obama is heard calling wright my pastor the guy who puts up with me counsels me listens to my wife complain about me he apos s a friend and a great leader not just in chicago but all across the country the daily caller also highlighted a segment in which obama questions federal priorities in transportation spending we need additional federal public transportation dollars flowing to the highest need communities we don t need to build more highways out in the suburbs if we have people in the cities right now who want to work but have no way to get into those jobs we apos ve got to help connect them to the jobs that exist obama said we should be investing in minority owned businesses in our neighborhoods so people don t have to travel from miles away get all the stories you need to know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox subscribed you
