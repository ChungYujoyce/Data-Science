first coronavirus meeting took place jan 8 and its first case was detected jan 30 but it wasn t until the world health organization declared the virus a pandemic on march 12 that the government s response kicked into gear the indian council for medical research or icmr the government s top research body said mitigation was the solution to keeping the virus spread in check it released a mathematical model in february that suggested that the government was relying too heavily on screening incoming travelers it recommended testing for asymptomatic cases and implementing strict social
