two doctors suggesting covid 19 death tolls are being boosted and urging an end to lockdowns because they do more harm than good the site took down the video of news conference featuring drs dan erickson and artin massihi who run a private urgent care clinic in bakersfield california on monday because they claim it violated their user policy by disputing health officials but the move has been blasted as censorship and a worrying sign of big tech companies trying to control information during the pandemic and quashing free speech social media giants facebook and twitter are also coming under increasing scrutiny for removing posts that they say contain health misinformation or calls to break stay at home orders the hour long video with drs erickson and massihi suggesting stay at home orders are damaging drew a massive audience garnering more than five million views before it was removed using testing stats from their urgent care centers they argue that the mortality rate for coronavirus is minuscule and that lockdowns are disruptive to normal healthcare provision the functioning of healthy immune systems and are devastating to the economy the doctors also share anecdotes which they say come from colleagues in hospitals claiming that there is pressure to add covid 19 as a cause of death to unrelated fatalities to artificially boost the death toll it s time to open back up the science says it is the models we ve been using from predictions to predict the amount of disease are not accurate erikson said in the press conference tesla ceo musk an increasingly outspoken critic of lockdowns shared the video on twitter before it was taken down adding the comment docs make good points drs dan erickson and artin massihi who run a private urgent care clinic in bakersfield california held a nearly hour long press conference on april 22 tesla ceo elon musk touted the video before youtube removed it from the platform this is censorship on what is arguably the most important media platform in the united states tweeted alex berenson a former new york times reporter who has emerged as one of the strongest skeptics of the lockdowns in a blistering opening monologue on tuesday night fox news host tucker carlson also railed against the ludicrous measures by big tech companies to control what they call misinformation during the pandemic when this is all over it s likely we ll look back on this moment what youtube just did as a turning point in the way we live in this country a sharp break with 250 years of law and custom carlson said the doctors video was produced by a local television channel it was in fact a mainstream news story carlson continued the only justification for taking it down was that the physicians on screen had reached different conclusions than the people currently in charge last week youtube ceo susan wojcicki told cnn that anything that would go against world health organization recommendations would be a violation of our policy consider that for a moment carlson responded as a matter of science it s ludicrous like everyone else involved in global pandemic policy the who has been wrong in its recommendations in january who told us that coronavirus could not spread from person to person in march they told us that face masks didn t work those are lies and they were welcome on google s platforms former cnn producersteve krakauer said in his fourth watch media newsletter that this was an egregious censorship effort on the part of youtube that should make all journalists concerned he added youtube can take down this video of course but should they absolutely not these doctors weren t calling for people to cough on other citizens they weren t even questioning whether injecting disinfectant might be a good idea they were using data to suggest a sweden model of eased lockdown may be effective that s not damaging to the public to watch alex berenson a former new york times reporter who has emerged as one of the strongest skeptics of the lockdowns harshly criticized youtube for removing the video in a blistering opening monologue on tuesday night fox news host tucker carlson also railed against the ludicrous measures tech companies are taking to remove information it comes as the debate over reopening intensifies with many states moving to ease restriction facebook says it will consult with state governments on their lockdown orders and will shut down pages planning anti quarantine protests if the tech giant determines the gatherings violate those rules unless government prohibits the event during this time we allow it to be organized on facebook for this same reason events that defy government s guidance on social distancing aren t allowed on facebook a spokesperson said on the social network s policy facebook officials said they reached out to states individually to understand their lockdown orders then removed posts that violated those rules we reached out to state officials to understand the scope of their orders not about removing specific protests on facebook we remove the posts when gatherings do not follow the health parameters established by the government and are therefore unlawful a company spokesperson said to dailymail com the tech firm says it will allow protests that abide by social distancing guidelines to go forth but will shut down the ones that defy those health orders the social network said it has already removed protest messages in california new jersey and nebraska the move has led to outrage from donald trump jr and republican figures like missouri sen josh hawley who claim facebook is violating americans first amendment rights in a statement to dailymail com a youtube spokesperson said we quickly remove flagged content that violate our community guidelines including content that explicitly disputes the efficacy of local healthy authority recommended guidance on social distancing that may lead others to act against that guidance however content that provides sufficient educational documentary scientific or artistic edsa context is allowed for example news coverage of this interview with additional context the statement continued from the very beginning of the pandemic we ve had clear policies against covid 19 misinformation and are committed to continue providing timely and helpful information at this critical time the company added youtube points out that news coverage of the doctors press conference which adds commentary and analysis is still allowed on the platform the doctors in the video erickson and massihi co owners of accelerated urgent care which offers bakersfield s only private walk in covid 19 testing site in the video which is a recording of a press conference that the duo held on april 22 the doctors said 12 percent of californians tested for coronavirus so far have had a positive result they used that figure to extrapolate an estimate that millions in the state have already contracted the virus and thus speculate that its mortality rate is much lower that believed the doctors speculate that coronavirus has a case fatality rate as low as 0 03 percent or roughly one third of the mortality rate of the common flu experts point out that the coronavirus testing the doctors refer to was not random and was administered mainly to people who had symptoms or believed that they had been exposed randomized antibody testing in new york suggests a case fatality rate of 0 5 to 0 8 percent or five to eight times higher than the flu the doctors in the video above used methods that are ludicrous to get results that are completely implausible said one infections disease expert dr carl bergstrom a university of washington biologist who specializes in infectious disease modeling likened their extrapolations to estimating the average height of americans from the players on an nba court they ve used methods that are ludicrous to get results that are completely implausible bergstrom said in a rare statement late monday the american college of emergency physicians and the american academy of emergency medicine declared they emphatically condemn the recent opinions released by dr daniel erickson and dr artin messihi these reckless and untested musings do not speak for medical societies and are inconsistent with current science and epidemiology regarding covid 19 the group continued as owners of local urgent care clinics it appears these two individuals are releasing biased non peer reviewed data to advance their personal financial interests without regard for the public s health the two doctors tout their support for president donald trump leading some to accuse them of political motivation in their remarks critics of the doctors also point out that non coronavirus visits to urgent care clinics such as they one that they own are down sharply down in the shutdowns suggesting they may have a financial motive for calling for the restrictions to end while criticism of youtube for removing controversial videos has mostly come from political conservatives the left has hammered the company for not removing videos fast enough virginia senator mark warner a democrat blasted youtube on tuesday over videos promoting a conspiracy theory that accused a us army reservist in virginia of being the source of the outbreak in wuhan china warner s office reached out to youtube on monday asking why the company hadn t taken down all the videos targeting the woman cnn reported it s clear that the blanket grant of immunity for sites like youtube has resulted in platforms that are too big and unresponsive to the harms they promote warner said saying congress need to act billionaire elon musk has slammed coronavirus lockdown measures by
