tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion one huge question looms large over the so called trump ukraine scandal and here it is why would the democrats go after president trump for allegedly threatening to withhold u s aid to ukraine when their proposed 2020 standard bearer did exactly the same thing and is on tape admitting it there are only two answers and both might deliver the same result democrats either don t care what happens to former vice president joseph r biden or they re intentionally trying to take him out top stories cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots mr biden has been a weak candidate from the outset while the comparatively moderate career politician appeared to be perfectly positioned when he stepped into the race for the democratic party nomination in april a slew of other contenders were running hard left promising free everything for everybody that left the middle uncontested for mr biden since then though the inevitable nominee has blundered his way back into the pack the former vice president is still at or near the top of most polls but few democrats are jazzed up for joe but then it s hard to imagine voters getting excited about any of the others in the whole sad pack of wannabes still sen elizabeth warren is rising fast in the polls and sen bernie sanders pulled in 25 million last quarter putting him atop the pile the race is changing fast the way the trump ukraine scandal has played out so far has certainly appeared to favor mr trump some conspiracy theorists speculate that the master troller set up the entire thing remember originally the allegations were that mr trump demanded at least eight times in a phone call that ukraine investigate the business dealings of mr biden s son hunter when mr trump released the transcript of the call it turned out there was just one time that the president asked for a favor but by then house speaker nancy pelosi and all the other top democrats had already decided to move forward with an impeachment inquiry as the smoke clears around mr trump mr biden is left standing in the crosshairs and this fact has emerged hunter biden made hundreds of thousands of dollars through his employment with burisma the largest private gas company in ukraine despite having no known qualifications for the job and when word spread that a prosecutor was looking into the matter then vice president biden demanded that the prosecutor be fired that s a fact more mr biden is on tape discussing his push for the ukrainian government to fire viktor shokin bragging he had threatened to withhold 1 billion until mr shokin was canned if the prosecutor is not fired you re not getting the money he says he told ukrainian leaders well son of a bitch he got fired mr biden says with a smile in the video clip that s exactly what mr trump is accused accused mind you of doing weeks before mr trump s july 25 phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky mr trump put on hold 391 million in aid he says he did so to pressure other nations to contribute more money and to take time to examine programs democrats though say it was a clear quid pro quo dig up some dirt on mr biden and his son or no money but the new york times kenneth vogel posted an interesting statement on twitter last week in the midst of the mess the ukrainians weren t made aware that the assistance was being delayed reviewed until more than one month after the call he wrote so no quid pro quo worse a photo emerged monday showing mr biden and his son playing golf with executives from burisma not good it s certainly too early to tell whether mr trump will emerge unscathed from yet another scandal but regardless of his fate mr biden s star is greatly dimmed and while house democrats will get in lockstep to vote to impeach mr trump the senate will be a whole different kettle of fish during the trial of the president republicans will target mr biden and his son nonstop it s highly unlikely 22 republicans will join democrats to vote to convict but mr biden will be heavily damaged that may have all been part of mr trump s master plan he knew the transcript didn t show a quid pro quo and the whistleblower complaint now also public doesn t amount to much either and maybe just maybe democrats knew that this scandal would also take out mr biden if they did they could well be right even better if mr biden gets crushed in the playout of the ukraine scandal they ll have no blood on their hands former democratic sen robert torricelli said tuesday that the ukraine allegations will hurt mr biden it is hard to imagine a democratic primary electorate witnessing this spectacle of 50 000 a month to hunter biden the contradictory information about whether there was consultation with him and his father the rather unseemly view of this that the democratic primary electorate is going to decide this is our guy said the former senator from new jersey the torch wasn t right about much when he was in the senate but he could well be spot on with this prediction joseph curl covered the white house and politics for a decade for the washington times he can be reached at emailprotected and on
