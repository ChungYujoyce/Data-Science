apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic richmond va ap virginia s democrats struggled to find their way out of three interlocking political crises thursday that could bring down the party s top elected officials and put a republican in the governor s chair with gov ralph northam s career in peril over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook the state attorney general acknowledged on wednesday that he put on blackface when he was in college and a woman publicly accused the lieutenant governor of sexually assaulting her 15 years ago while nearly the entire democratic establishment rose up against northam over the past week to demand he resign party members did not call for immediate resignations over the two latest developments which threaten to cause a political

three failing pols were republicans far stronger action would be taken in a statement thursday night virginia s legislative black caucus reiterated its call for northam to resign but stopped short of calling for lt gov justin fairfax or attorney general mark herring to step down fairfax would become virginia s second black governor if northam stepped down the black lawmakers said the sexual assault allegation against fairfax must be thoroughly investigated they also said that while they appreciated herring s candor in admitting to wearing blackface they await further action on his part to reassure the citizens of the commonwealth of his fitness for leadership shortly afterward the state s two u s senators and seven democratic congressmen took a similar approach they released a joint statement calling for an investigation into fairfax and urging herring to continue to be engaged in in depth discussions with leaders and others in virginia if he is to regain the public s trust quentin kidd a political science professor at christopher newport university had initially predicted northam would be unable to hang on to office for more than a week now with all three top democrats in trouble the equation has changed he said he said it is possible all three could survive just out of political necessity because conservative republican house speaker kirk cox would be next in line for governor if they all resigned the democrats moral clarity last week has given way to the realization they could lose power completely at the executive level kidd said he likened the situation to three sinking boats that suddenly lash themselves together and find they can float several top democratic female lawmakers in virginia declined to comment thursday on an allegation of sexual assault that california college professor vanessa tyson made against fairfax tyson said fairfax forced her to perform oral sex at a hotel in 2004 during the democratic national convention in boston fairfax

serious charge while fairfax has given a very unequivocal denial asked whether northam should stay in office kaine replied no we ve reached a conclusion and we ve made a recommendation meanwhile the rev al sharpton said in a fiery speech at historically black virginia union university that northam and herring must step down over their blackface admissions and the allegations against fairfax should be investigated thoroughly the civil rights leader said he came to richmond to deliver a message to the governor i m not going to be your minstrel members of the crowd of 300 students faculty clergy and political leaders shouted in agreement and jumped to their feet several times during sharpton s speech the governor is under fire over the discovery of a photo on his yearbook profile page of someone in blackface standing next to a person in a ku klux klan hood and robe northam initially said he was in the photo then denied it but acknowledged putting shoe polish on his face for a dance contest in texas in 1984 when he was in the army on wednesday herring who had been urging northam to step down admitted wearing blackface to look like a rapper during a party when he was a 19 year old at the university of virginia in 1980 he apologized for his callous behavior up to now the democrats nationally have taken an aggressive stand against misconduct in their ranks in part so that they can criticize trump s behavior without being accused of hypocrisy democrats in virginia have expressed fear the crises could jeopardize their chances of taking control of the gop dominated legislature
