voted on feb 13 to require the president to seek congressional authorization for military action against iran mr trump himself has claimed that he wants a better iran nuclear deal not a war with iran but his demands that iran permanently curb its nuclear ambitions restrict its ballistic missile program and stop destabilizing the region have fallen on deaf ears so have his reassurances that the united states does not seek regime change what then is the way out of the iran crisis the iran nuclear deal is dead an iran war is out of the question and a more comprehensive and complex agreement is impossible to envision secure and enforce with u s presidential elections around the corner iran s supreme leader is in no rush to boost mr trump s electoral prospects this was reinforced in a meeting last year between japanese prime minister shinzo abe and ayatollah ali khamenei mr khamenei stated i don t regard trump as deserving any exchange of messages and have no response for him and will give no response he further stated what trump says that he is not after regime change is a lie for if he could do so he would however he is not capable of doing it top stories oregon becomes first state to

deep state the ayatollah may be right change in iran cannot come from the outside but it is coming from the inside from the hostage crisis to the nuclear crisis today iran s revolutionary clerics have used foreign policy enmity with the united states and hatred toward israel as the key to survival at home the price of their foreign policy the tab for fundamentalism tyranny corruption and terrorism has stunted iran s growth decimated its economy and shattered iran s security that formula has ceased to work after 40 years of anti americanism iran s revolutionary clerics boosted by their apologists from liberals like jimmy carter to socialists like bernie sanders can no longer scapegoat the late shah of iran let alone fool the iranian people with a blame america first strategy the nuclear crisis is a symptom of a theocracy in meltdown the cause of the crisis is the theocracy s democracy deficit wherein a kleptocracy plunders iran s resources behind the veil of religion today the need for structural change in iran is not a matter of theory but a practical imperative a matter of national survival and one might add the key to reframing american foreign policy in the region the rift between state religion and society has never been greater the schisms within iran s religious establishment and the factional divisions among iran s political oligarchs have exposed a massive crisis of legitimacy the promise of reform from within has collapsed parliamentary and presidential elections are rigged to silence the people and snuff out the truth the system deflects blame for its defects on others and does so in the face of compounding political military and economic crises look no further than the lies surrounding iran s recent downing of a ukrainian airliner the human toll of the regime s ideology and policies inside iran is unfathomable oil exports are almost zero the economy already decimated under mahmoud ahmadinejad is contracting at a 9 5 percent annual rate

unemployed addiction depression divorce and suicide are fraying iran s social fabric as never before to divine the islamic republic s future look no further than the ayatollah s shoot to kill policy a response to nationwide protests against a three fold spike in gasoline prices last november like venezuela the islamic republic of iran is a failed state the credit for that failure does not go to mr trump it goes to the ayatollah he is waging the real war on the iranian people this is not the moment for iran policy to become hostage to partisan bickering democrats and republicans deserve credit for reducing the risks of an iran war they have made it harder for the ayatollah to escalate the nuclear and regional crisis to provoke the united states into a war but mr trump and secretary of state mike pompeo also deserve credit for rejecting an iran deal that fails to contain the regime s regional and military interventions it is reckless to leave america and its allies including the iranian people hostage to an ideological threat with millions of iranians boycotting parliamentary elections last friday and millions more likely to boycott presidential elections in 2021 iran s revolutionaries reformists and hardliners stand stripped of democratic legitimacy and religious sanctity change is coming to iran as surely as it did to the soviet union eastern europe and south africa our fixation on iran s nuclear program should not blind us to tectonic demographic political and economic shifts that signal the end of clerical rule in iran the passion driving the iranian people forward on their path to a constitutional democracy has deep roots dating to 1906 the revolution of 1979 khomeini s religious coup is a detour not the destination instead of being provoked into an iran war or seeking a nuclear deal premised on the sacrifice of democracy and human rights in the crucible of fundamentalism let us stand by the iranian people their triumph over an ayatollah who equates the fundamentals of religion with tyranny and terrorism will not only break the nuclear impasse it will advance our ideals and interests by ushering in an era of freedom prosperity and security across the region instead of embracing fear and pessimism let us summon our spirit to secure a future worthy of our great democracy an iranian spring khosrow b semnani is an iranian american
