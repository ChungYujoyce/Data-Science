apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the stage is set for a return to u s north korea brinkmanship with pyongyang ignoring repeated offers from the trump administration to restart stalled nuclear talks while china and russia are pressing to lift international sanctions on the isolated nation despite its refusal to drop its nuclear programs the top u s envoy for north korea on tuesday ended a three day visit to seoul this week without a hoped for meeting with north korean officials as pyongyang stuck to its threat to launch fresh provocations unless the u s offers major concessions by the end of the year u s special representative for north korea stephen biegun made clear during his visit to seoul that washington won t accept the arbitrary deadline he also suggested the trump administration would be disappointed but not surprised if the government of north korean leader kim jong un engages in weapons tests or some other aggressive action in the coming weeks top stories sex

abortions for all including illegal aliens let me be absolutely clear the united states does not have a deadline mr biegun told reporters in the south korean on monday we are fully aware of the strong potential for north korea to conduct a major provocation in the days ahead to say the least such an action will be most unhelpful in achieving lasting peace on the korean peninsula it s a delicate moment in president trump s high stakes personal diplomacy with mr kim launched with high hopes at a summit in singapore last year analysts say the trump administration finds itself increasingly being backed into a corner by pyongyang s refusal to discuss serious denuclearization efforts while demanding relief from punishing international sanctions a string of missile tests and military exercises by the north have only worsened the atmosphere pyongyang is expected to move up the escalation ladder in attempts to induce u s concessions said bruce klingner a former high level cia official in korea now with the heritage foundation mr kim s regime could incrementally raise tensions with medium and intermediate range missile launches or jump immediately to an icbm or nuclear test mr klingner said adding that the latter would cross trump s red line and trigger a strong u s response there are concerns that trump could either return to threats of preventive attack which could lead to an all out war on the peninsula or accept a minimal poorly crafted deal to maintain the facade of progress with kim jong un mr klingner said fixing the blame patrick cronin a regional expert with the hudson institute said mr kim is seeking maximum concessions in exchange for minimal denuclearization steps mr biegun s trip this week he said in an interview was meant in part to put the blame squarely on pyongyang for any breakdown in diplomacy steve biegun is forcing kim to decide if and when to make a deal mr cronin said although he added that there is a danger kim s future provocations will make it look as though the trump administration has returned to the discredited policy of strategic patience scott snyder who heads the program on u s korea policy at the council on foreign relations said it was unclear whether the notoriously secretive kim regime is truly playing with the fire or simply using threats and belligerent rhetoric to gain the upper hand in talks with the u s with mr trump under pressure to reach a deal in a presidential election year the north koreans are dealing with a u s that is much larger and more powerful then they are and they feel like they need to create a crisis in order to have negotiations mr snyder said the problem is that their actions are going to look the same until they reverse course and come back to the negotiating table mr biegun in seoul appeared to be putting the onus on north korea to improve the atmosphere and resume the talks let me speak directly to our counterparts in north korea he told reporters it is time for us to do our jobs let s get this done we are here and you know how to reach us hanging over the recent diplomacy is mr kim s threat to take action if the u s does not soften its position by the end of the month pyongyang has not explicitly said the concessions must come in the form of sanctions relief but that has been the north s consistent demand and now china and russia which have close economic ties with pyongyang have appeared poised to advance the north korean demand on monday beijing and moscow proposed that the united nations security council lift a ban on north korean exports of seafood and textiles while easing restrictions on infrastructure projects and north koreans working overseas according to a draft resolution seen by the reuters news agency the resolution also calls for a resumption of multilateral six party talks that would give beijing and moscow a seat at the negotiating table we all know that the situation in the korean peninsula is really at a critical stage chinese ambassador to the u n zhang jun said in new york tuesday and while we all expect progress forward we have to really do whatever we can to prevent the situation from rolling back and to prevent a more deteriorated situation the state department quickly made it known tuesday it opposed the china russia resolution warning that easing sanctions would be premature at a time when pyongyang is threatening to conduct an escalated provocation and is refusing to meet with u s officials china and russia which both wield veto power on the security council were key votes in imposing the sanctions in recent years under the maximum pressure campaign championed by the trump administration mr biegun will be in beijing thursday and friday for talks with top chinese leaders the state department confirmed tuesday a kim trump summit in hanoi in february broke up abruptly when mr trump says he rejected north korea s demand for sweeping sanctions relief in exchange for only a limited commitment to destroy part of the north s nuclear arsenal a characterization pyongyang later disputed working level talks led by mr biegun in october broke up quickly without movement and the standoff deepened last week with north korea accusing the u s of engaging in a stupid and hostile provocation by convening a u n security council meeting on a recent wave of short range missile tests by pyongyang national security adviser robert o brien warned it would be a big mistake if mr kim were to carry out a nuclear bomb test the north korean leader has refrained such tests as well as from long range intercontinental ballistic missiles launches since the singapore summit in june 2018 a pause mr trump cites as a major payoff of his diplomatic approach mr trump faces rising pressure to consider short term concessions in a bid to revive talks because the alternative escalation and brinkmanship could spiral into a major military clash unclear goals some also criticize the administration for failing to articulate its own bottom line in the talks we are at this point primarily because the trump administration refused to be specific about what it was willing to offer kim said jessica lee a fellow in the east asia program at the quincy institute issuing more threats will not compel pyongyang to recommit itself to diplomacy north korea she said a new analysis this week needs to know what we are asking them to say yes to specifically the u s should offer partial sanctions relief declare the end of the korean war and offer to open a liaison office in pyongyang in exchange for concrete steps by north korea to suspend all weapons related nuclear activities over a period of 12 months she wrote others said the recent difficulties highlight a basic disconnect the u s wants mr kim to give up a nuclear weapons capability he sees as essential to his regime s survival the goal of the north koreans is to improve relations with the u s as a nuclear state in other words they want detente but not denuclearization while we want detente in exchange for denuclearization mr snyder said as a result there is still a fundamentally unbridgeable gap in the positions of the two sides mr klingner argued that the trump administration has failed to fully enforce sanctions already imposed on north korea and right now should be knuckling down rather than considering concessions for pyongyang mr biegun has consistently emphasized that the u s is seeking diplomatic dialogue to resolve the nuclear crisis mr klingner said yet pyongyang has consistently rejected engagement in favor of developing its nuclear and missile arsenals in violation of un resolutions since the singapore summit he added trump has undermined his maximum pressure policy by constraining enforcement of u s sanctions laws risked allied deterrence by cancelling numerous military exercises and embraced a purveyo
