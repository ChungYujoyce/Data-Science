national review over the weekend during an msnbc town hall on abortion rights bernie sanders offered his troubling two cents on a question that has arisen a few times during the democratic presidential primary is there such a thing as a pro life democrat in your vision of the party asked the host stephanie ruhle i think being pro choice is an absolutely essential part of being a democrat sanders replied by this time in history when we talk about what a democrat is i think being pro choice is an essential part of that he added this response is a far cry from the bernie sanders of 2017 who campaigned on behalf of heath mello an omaha neb mayoral candidate who had been dubbed anti abortion for supporting a bill that would require doctors to inform women that they have the right to an ultrasound prior to an abortion the bill did not as some outlets incorrectly reported require women to undergo an ultrasound a piece in salon at the time insisted that sanders s endorsement of mello proved that he believes reproductive rights are negotiable being pro choice is not an optional part of being a progressive full stop the author wrote one hundred percent pro choice is the only pro choice position though his support for mello was hardly an endorsement of the pro life worldview it seems that bernie sanders has been converted to his critics way of thinking his newfound intolerance notwithstanding sanders perhaps deserves a bit of credit for being so forthcoming when faced with a similar question at a fox news town hall a few weeks back pete buttigieg couldn t bring himself to offer a straight answer nr s afternoon roundup of the day s best commentary must read analysis do you want the support of pro life democratic voters kristen day executive director of democrats for life asked buttigieg there are about 21 million of us and if so would you support more moderate platform language in the democratic party to ensure that the party of diversity of inclusion really does include everybody buttigieg responded only with equivocations such as this the best i can offer is that if we can t agree on where to draw the line the next best thing we can do is agree on who should draw the line and in my view it s the woman who s faced with that decision in her own life there are several reasons why this framing of the abortion debate is the wrong one chief among them the fact that pro lifers believe correctly if we are to admit readily available facts of human biology that abortion ends the life of a distinct human being not that women shouldn t be afforded personal autonomy but his rhetorical games aside it is noteworthy that buttigieg wouldn t directly respond to day s rather plaintive question is there room for us pro life democrats ask their presidential contenders again and again they re answered in the negative at least sanders has the courtesy to tell them not to waste their time get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
