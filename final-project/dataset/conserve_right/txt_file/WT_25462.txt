was sent on july 8 and to date council officials say they have received responses from nine of the candidates trade and the far reaching trans pacific partnership asian trade deal negotiated by

may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century after mr trump withdrew the u s from the original tpp the remaining countries went ahead with a new pact known as the comprehensive and progressive trans pacific partnership pctpp that kept most of the original agreement intact with the u s on the outside looking in sens cory booker and kirsten gillibrand reps tim ryan and seth moulton south bend mayor pete buttigieg and author marianne williamson all told the council they oppose trying to enter a renegotiated asian trade deal ms williamson wrote simply the tpp would need greater protections for workers and the environment for me to support it other candidates notably ms gillibrand said there would have to be specific changes in particular protections for american workers before they would sign on i will only support a trade deal that at its core is focused on advancing the american worker and working families creating jobs lifting wages and boosting environmental standards mr booker wrote sen bernie sanders and mr ryan who wrote that he has spent my entire career fighting bad trade deals like tpp werevocal in their opposition to any major new multilateral trade deal in asia under no circumstance would we rejoin the trans pacific partnership under a sanders administration the vermont lawmaker wrote former reps john delaney and joe sestak were both in favor of rejoining the pact mr delaney was in favor of rejoining the tpp on day one of my administration north korea president trump s precedent shattering outreach to north korea including three face to face meetings with north korean leader kim jong un to deal with the nuclear crisis on the peninsula also provoked divided democratic responses all nine democratic candidates who addressed the issue agreed that denuclearization of north korea is key for national security mr buttigieg mr moulton former adm joe sestak and ms williamson all said partial sanctions relief could

step we take to reduce north korea s nuclear force to open it up to inspections to end the 70 year old korean war and to encourage peaceful relations between the koreas and the united states increases
