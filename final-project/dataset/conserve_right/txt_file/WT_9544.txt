organization director general tedros ghebreyesus continued to praise chinese authorities who have been criticized elsewhere saying they bought the world time with stringent measures i have given credit where it s due and i will continue to do that as i would and i did for any country that fights an outbreak aggressively at its source to protect its own people and the people of the world even at great cost to itself he told the munich security conference in germany it s easy to blame it s easy to politicize it s harder to tackle a problem together and find solutions together we will all
