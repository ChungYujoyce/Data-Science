potential supreme court picks soothed conservatives fears and his embrace by the national rifle association guaranteed him the backing of the most committed activists on the right as likely republican presidential nominee donald trump continued to build unity within the party in both cases the support is as much about antipathy toward mr trump s likely opponent former secretary of state hillary clinton as it is about liking the billionaire businessman but the effect is the same an increasingly unified republican party and a candidate who is saying the right things to keep them in his camp

for trying to capitalize on biden you ain t black comment mr trump tried to make it an easy choice for the nra rank and file as he addressed the gun group s annual convention in louisville on friday talking up his sons enthusiasm for firearms railing against gun free zones and saying that electing mrs clinton would mean kissing the second amendment goodbye the only way to save our second amendment is to vote for a person that you all know named donald trump he said at the nra ila leadership forum i will never let you down i will protect our second amendment i will protect our country chris cox who heads the nra s lobbying arm openly acknowledged that mr trump might not have been the first choice for everyone but told attendees that if their preferred candidate dropped out of the race it s time to get over it now were there differences between the candidates for the nomination of course mr cox said at the forum are there valid arguments in favor of some over others sure will any of it matter if hillary clinton wins in november not one bit he added during his speech mr trump also highlighted his list of 11 potential supreme court picks a list that won him praise from conservative activists and pro life advocates last week pro life groups in particular responded with enthusiasm to the list and combined with the nra they make up the backbone of the volunteers the republican party relies on to knock on doors and rally neighbors at election time the right is starting to coalesce said republican party strategist michael mckenna questions about is he sufficiently conservative have been banished charlie curie 63 a veterinarian from ohio said he thinks the nra s endorsement will spur on gun rights enthusiasts to knock on doors or get active in the campaign in some other way honestly in my opinion i would pick anybody other than a democrat said mr curie and not just for second amendment issues on all of the conservative issues carrie christman from near buffalo new york was hopeful the endorsement would mobilize folks she was helping sell t shirts with a picture of a giant bird and what appeared to be lightning bolts coming out of its talons with the words trump shocking the establishment on the front and trump 2016 and a presidential seal on the back i hope it does energize the nra members to get involved and become active actively pursue your neighbors to actually get them out to vote she said but tony matuszak who was hawking the shirts along with ms christman was skeptical it s tough to get people to freakin do work man ok he said it s really tough to get walking boots john thayer 62 who works in accounting in florida pointed out that the nra typically saves its endorsement for after the party officially selects its nominee and said he did think it would spur people on to do more during the campaign than simply pull a lever on election day i was for trump from the beginning but a lot of the nra people and other pro gun people were for sen ted cruz said mr thayer who was wearing a red make america great again trump hat and a pin with a likeness of mr trump on it now it s just a choice really between trump and hillary so i mean to me it s pretty clear that if you re a conservative you re going to vote for trump he said mr trump s conservative critics have said his positions can change almost daily depending on what audience he s speaking to or what mood he s in for example in his 2000 book the america we deserve mr trump wrote that he generally opposes gun control but that he supported a ban on so called assault weapons and a slightly longer waiting period to get a gun mr thayer though said the inflexibility of other onetime candidates such as mr cruz and sen rand paul is a turnoff cruz and paul you know they act like they re in a college debating club they stake out an absolute position and then say it s this or nothing he said and donald trump he s negotiated all his life in business i think it s better to get half of what you want than nothing larry seitz 63 a retired maintenance executive from outside chicago said the stakes are extremely high for the fall and appeared concerned that many people still wouldn t tune in to get properly educated most people don t pay attention until eight to 10 weeks in front of the election you know and then they start reading the news but they haven t paid attention to what s going on he said mr seitz said his mind s pretty much made up as to who he s voting for and said most of his friends are in a similar boat but once they step behind that curtain they may say one thing and do another you know he said copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view comments click to hide terms of use privacy
