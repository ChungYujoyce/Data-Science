ent trump declares a national emergency on the southern border in a bid to divert billions toward border security reaction from talk titan rush limbaugh this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday february 17 2019 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace president trump declares a national emergency to go around congress and build his border wall begin videotape donald trump president we are talking about an invasion of our country with drugs with human traffickers with all types of criminals and gangs wallace what showdowns lie ahead in congress and the courts we aposll ask one of the president aposs top integration hardliners senior advisor stephen miller then trump the only reason we aposre talking about this is because of election because they want to try and win an election which it looks like they aposre not going to be able to do wallace we sit down with rush limbaugh for a rare live television exclusive to discuss the border wall the constitution and the path ahead to 2020 plus fired fbi acting director andrew mccabe speaks out on why he opened an investigation into president trump aposs ties to russia andrew mccabe fbi acting director i was very concerned that i was able to put the russia case on absolutely solid ground that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what this means for the mueller investigation all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington congress used the power of the purse to deny president trump all the money he wants to build a wall on the southern border so the president invoked executive powers to free up billions of dollars to do it anyway the president says there aposs a crisis at the border but critics including some republicans say the president aposs move has created a crisis of its own in a moment we aposll speak with white house senior policy advisor stephen miller but first let aposs get the latest from kevin corke at the white house kevin kevin corke correspondent chris the president may have avoided other shutdown fight by signing off on a funding bill but his use of executive power will very likely create a new battle in the courts begin videotape trump we have tremendous amount of drugs flowing into our country much of it coming from the southern border i aposm going to be signing a national emergency corke in laying out the reason for declaring a national emergency president trump lit a political fuse reigniting a separation of powers debate and setting the stage for a possible constitutional crisis an issue border wall funding illegal immigration and the use of power given to the president by congress but the criticism has come from both the left and the right with senate minority leader chuck schumer and speaker nancy pelosi issuing a statement calling the president aposs declaration unlawful over a crisis that does not exist meanwhile trump loyalists howled because they believe the president signed off on a funding bill that restricts much of what and where a wall could be built accusing mr trump of setting up an illegal immigration stimulus ann coulter the only national emergency is that our president is an idiot end videotape corke chris if the white house spends the money sequentially as they currently plan to do they would spend over 5 billion before any emergency funds are tapped that aposs money to get moving if you will while this battle makes its way through the courts chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks for that and joining us now for an exclusive interview white house senior policy advisor stephen miller stephen welcome back to fox news sunday stephen miller white house senior policy advisor great to be here thank you wallace i want to start with something that president trump said friday when he was declaring a national emergency here he is begin video clip trump i could do the wall over a longer period of time i didn apost need to do this but i aposd rather do it much faster end video clip wallace i didn apost need to do this how does that justify a national emergency miller well as you know chris we already have 4 000 troops on the border in light of a national emergency a decision that was made almost a year ago as we see an increasing number of people crossing the border as well as increasing violence in mexico what the president was saying is that like past presidents he could choose to ignore this crisis choose to ignore this emergency as others have but that aposs not what he aposs going to do wallace the president talks about an invasion used that word multiple times on friday an invasion on the southern border but let aposs look at the facts i want to put them up on the screen 1 6 million people were stopped crossing the border illegally back in 2000 less than a quarter that many were caught last year the government aposs own numbers show for all the president is talking about drugs streaming over the border 80 to 90 percent of the cocaine heroin and fentanyl seized at the border is seized at ports of entry not along unfenced areas and in 2017 twice as many of the new people in the country illegally were from visa overstays as were from crossing the border again where aposs the emergency the national emergency to build a wall miller there aposs a lot of values presented there so i aposd like to go through it each one piece at a time if i could so let aposs start with your point about the border crossings in the year 2000 as you know when george bush came into office illegal immigration total doubled from 6 million to 12 million by the time he left office that represented an astonishing betrayal of the american people i aposm not going to sit here today and tell you that george bush defended this country on the southern border because he did not one of the biggest changes that aposs happened since then and now is the mass release of illegal aliens due to a patchwork of court rulings and loopholes in our federal laws and changing tactics from smugglers and transnational organization wallace i want to go into all of this but let aposs just focus on that one issue four times as many people were coming across the border in 2000 as now so why is that crosstalk miller back then when 95 percent could be turned around in a matter of days as a result of loopholes activist judicial rulings and increasing sophistication from cartels the reality is that more than half the people crossing the border are what we call non impactable they can apost be turned around and so what you see is sophisticated operations and smugglers will actually push out migrants and children and family units to divert border agents and then because there aposs not secured areas with the wall they aposll then cross after the border agents have been diverted to those areas at a fundamental level we could go down to the details and you know chris i could go down to details as much as you want to but the bottom line is this wallace please don apost miller but the bottom line is this you cannot conceive of a nation without a strong secure border it is fundamental and essential to the idea of sovereignty and national survival to have control over who enters and doesn apost enter the country and we can get into statistics you want to talk about drugs there aposs been a huge increase in drug deaths since george w bush and barak obama were in office wallace i understand that but 80 to 90 percent of those drugs don apost come across in unfenced areas they come from ports of entry those are your own customs and border patrol numbers miller which is the reason why we also ask for additional resources at the ports of entry wallace but this is what you got miller but chris the problem with the statement that you aposre apprehending 80 to 90 percent of the drugs at the ports of entry that aposs like saying you apprehend this contraband at tsa checkpoints at airports you apprehend the contraband there because that aposs where you have the people that aposs where you have the screeners i assure you if we had people at that same density and screeners at that same density across every single inch and mile of the southern border you aposd have more drug interdicted in those areas you don apost know what you don apost know and you don apost catch what you don apost catch but as a matter of national security you cannot have uncontrolled unsecured areas of the border where people can pour in undetected wallace ok miller one more point i guarantee you this if donald trump had said he aposs invoking the national emergency military construction authority to build a security perimeter in iraq or afghanistan or around a military installation in syria there would not have been one word of objection from congress this is defending our own country wallace i question whether in fact that aposs the case but in any case let aposs talk about the constitutional aspects of this because i aposve talked to you over the years i know that you are a constitutional conservative and you believe the constitution should be interpreted as written correct miller yes wallace ok here aposs article 1 section 9 clause 7 of the constitution as written no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law isn apost what president trump wants to do a clear violation of what the founders of what james madison talked about as giving congress the power of the purse miller no because congress in 1976 passed the national emergency act and gave the president the authority as a result of that to invoke a national emergency in many different circumstances but among them the use of military construction funds and that was the point i was making earlier if the president were to say we aposre going to use military construction funds to say increase a perimeter around a base in bagram around a base in syria nobody would even say anything about it and we have 4 000 troops on the border right now and as a result of that mission they need to secure those areas where they aposre patrolling wallace but let aposs talk about national emergencies national emergencies have been declared 59 times since 1976 when the law was passed the national emergencies act can you point to a single incident even one where the president asked congress for money congress refused to give him that money and the president then evokes national emergency powers to get the money miller first of all wallace can you find one case miller what you aposre missing chris is that national emergencies don apost have all the same authorities and the same justification wallace i assume that but there have been 59 can you find one case like that miller this authority specifically refers to using military construction funds other emergencies for example were to crosstalk wallace if you want to talk about military constructions do you know how many times military construction has been invoked as a national emergency that would be only be twice miller right wallace twice once by george h w bush during the middle of the gulf war and the second time by george w bush right after 9 11 crosstalk miller chris can you name can you name one foreign threat in the world today outside the country aposs borders that currently kills more americans than the threats crossing our southern border wallace you know the joy of this is i get to ask you question and miller the answer is no wallace answer my question can you name one case where a president has asked congress for money congress has refused and the president has then evoked national policy to get the money anyway miller well this current situation wallace just yes or no sir miller the current situation pertains specifically to the military construction authority wallace i aposm just asking crosstalk wallace when congress asked for money for military construction congress said no and he aposs then miller the meaning of the statute chris is clear on its own terms if you don apost like the statute or members of congress don apost like the statute crosstalk wallace but you agree the answer is no that miller but the premise of your question is also false because congress has appropriated money for construction of border barriers consistently this is part of the national security wallace but they aposve never done this under a national emergency where the president miller who declared national emergency to promote democracy in belarus to promote democracy in zimbabwe crosstalk wallace but it didn apost involve taking money that congress refused to appropriate miller they didn apost refuse to appropriate it they passed a law specifically saying the president could have this authority it aposs in the plain statute that aposs the decision that congress made and if people don apost like that they can address it but to my but to my point that i made this would not be even an issue if the president was invoking that statute to support some foreign adventure overseas you and i both know that that presidents for years have engaged in one military adventure after another not to mention the fact that we do operations to destroy drug fields in foreign lands in afghanistan or in colombia and we can apost even deal with the criminal cartels operating on our border wallace ok let aposs talk about miller these two organizations are destabilizing the western hemisphere crosstalk wallace i want to move on respectfully let aposs talk about the logistics here if the president gets access to the entire 8 billion he aposs seeking how many miles of barrier wall would he be able to build and how quickly miller well if you look at the authorities we have both in terms of drug corridor funds in terms of national emergency funds in terms of treasury funds as well as appropriated funds and other reprogramming authorities that may exist in combination with the existing wallace answer the question miller you aposre looking at hundreds of miles collectively wallace and how soon miller well you aposre going to see probably a couple hundred miles in time i would say by the end of the next appropriation cycle all together in terms of what we already have underway what aposs underway right now and then what we aposre going to complete wallace so by the end of this year and hundreds of miles miller no next fiscal year one more after this wallace ok by september of 2020 miller right wallace right in the middle of the presidential campaign miller my point is that if you look at what we aposve already outlaid we have 120 odd miles that are already under construction or are already obligated plus the additional funds we have and that we aposre going to outlay we aposre going to look at a few hundred miles wallace ok final question if both the house and the senate approve a resolution of disapproval which they aposre allowed to it aposs specifically called for in the national emergencies act and if they pass it in the senate it would be with bipartisan support because there aposs republican control if they pass a resolution of disapproval will the president veto that which would be the first veto of his presidency miller well obviously the president is going to protect his national emergency declaration chris and i know that we aposre out of time but i again want to make this point there aposs not threat wallace so yes he would veto miller he aposs going to protect his national emergency declaration guaranteed but the fact that they aposre even talking about a resolution of disapproval show you this is a statutory issue and a statutory delegation that congress made but again i want to make this point this is a deep intellectual problem that is plaguing this city which is that we aposve had thousands of americans die year after year after year because of threats crossing our southern border we have families and communities that are left unprotected and undefended we have international narco terrorist organizations this is a threat in our country not overseas not in belarus not in zimbabwe not in afghanistan or syria or iraq but right here and if the president can apost defend this country then he cannot fulfill this constitutional oath of office wallace stephen thank you miller thank you wallace thanks for coming in it aposs always good and always challenging to talk to you miller thanks wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the legal and political battles ahead as the president tests his powers to make his border wall a reality plus rush limbaugh joins us live you don apost want to miss that commercial break begin video clip trump we aposre talking about an invasion of our country with drugs with human traffickers with all types of criminals and gangs rep nancy pelosi d calif speaker of the house you want to talk about a national emergency let aposs talk about today the one year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in america that aposs a national emergency end video clip wallace president trump justifying his declaration of a national emergency at the border while house speaker pelosi warns republicans of the president aposs action may set and it aposs time now for our sunday group marc short former director of legislative affairs for president trump charles lane from the washington post bob woodward author of the best selling book fear trump in the white house and katie pavlich from townhall com well bob as we saw from the aforementioned book you spend a lot of time reporting on this president how do you explain why do you think he declared a national emergency over warnings from top senate republican leaders and from some of his own top lawyers bob woodward author fear trump in the white house two reasons it aposs a political promise and even though what he aposs saying or trying to do here is unsupportable in terms of the facts he looks tough he looked strong i aposm protecting you and that aposs very appealing not just to his base but to lots of people and so it aposs not out of the zone of plausible presidential action but as a constitutional matter it aposs absurd and you know everyone knows that and he aposs found an angle and my god he looks tough to lots of people you know this is going to go to the courts but that will be resolved in about a year or so and so it aposs not going to be on the way there wallace all right marc i aposm going to give you an opportunity to respond to all that but it isn apost just coming from bob woodward it isn apost just coming from democrats there aposs been considerable blowback from some republicans especially in the senate they say it aposs a violation of the separation of powers under the constitution they say you aposre taking money that had been specifically appropriated for some important military projects and know the president faces the possibility of a resolution of disapproval passed not just by the house controlled by democrats but by the senate controlled by republicans marc short former white house legislative affairs director yes i think that the reality is that this is actually a statue that has been authorized by congress to the executive branch not just in 1976 but in 1982 military construction act under title ten code 50 that basically says that the secretary of defense can reallocate dollars so it aposs fair that congress want to say we want to vote disapproval because they never liked the executive branch exerting that sort of influence but they aposve given them the executive branch this influence if they want to change it they should change the statute that aposs the reality any republican who eventually would choose to vote against this is really not voting against the statue what they would be voting against is the president aposs commitment to try to secure the border and that would be a pretty perilous vote for any republican wallace katie whatever you think of the wall the president defends it using as i discussed some would say even argued about with stephen miller was some very questionable facts for instance facts from his own administration from cpb customs and border protection that the vast majority of drugs that are seized come through ports of entry not through unfenced areas here aposs how the president responded to that on friday begin video clip trump when you listen to politicians particularly certain democrats they say it all comes through the port of entries wrong it aposs wrong it aposs just a lie end video clip wallace does that bother you the president dismissing facts as they say from his own administration as democratic lies katie pavlich townhall com editor i wouldn apost say that the statistic was coming through ports of entry are not true however think that there are no drugs coming through these non ports of entry with no fencing is kind of like saying a tree falls in the forest did anybody hear it or see it if you don apost have anybody there to look and see or to confiscate wallace but that aposs all supposition you aposre going to declare a national emergency and spend billions of dollars because a tree may have fallen pavlich well you can apost prove it aposs not happening we do know that walls work in yuma 98 percent of the illegal traffic both in terms of drugs and human traffickers went down human trafficking is a billion dollar industry this is not with all due respect about the president simply trying to look tough the fact is that in the bill that he signed take away the wall the unaccompanied minor crisis in the central american migrant crisis is about to get a lot worse because it allows anybody any adult who has any connection to an unaccompanied minor to get amnesty and not be deported by ice that means that people are not going to use children as human shields they aposve been doing since 2014 under barack obama to come into the country illegally there are 22 million people here who are underground in the economy both republicans and democrats have not decided what they want to do with them they created an underclass of people which is anti american and instead of saying they want to do with a resolution condemning the president on trying to fix the problem maybe they should try and fix the problem of illegal immigration changing the asylum loss and making sure the crisis stops at the border before there is one wallace chuck charles lane the washington post what t strikes me about this whole crisis is if you really stop and think about an issue of just getting money for the wall the president could have done a lot of that without the national emergency it aposs gotten too little attention that almost half of the money he aposs reprogramming within the executive branch does not require a declaration of national emergency wallace that aposs right more than two a half of the 6 billion lane correct and if you put that together with the 1 4 appropriated you are within shouting distance of the famous 5 7 so clearly he feels it is in some other way to his advantage to declare this national emergency and precipitate a crisis and i would argue it is a political calculation that he believes that putting pressure on these wavering republicans in the senate by arousing his base by doing something dramatic to keep the political promise this is to his long term benefit he said himself i don apost need it i don apost need an emergency he is doing it because if parameterize is this issue politically and allows them to play a role wallace all right then there was the president predicting the legal journey of his declaration of national emergency over the next few months or years take a look begin video clip trump and they will sue us in the ninth circuit even though it shouldn apost be there but we possibly get a bad ruling and that we will get another bad ruling and that will end up in the supreme court and hopefully we aposll get a fair shake end video clip wallace which is actually about how this is going to play out here aposs the question as our court watcher how do you think this will go in the courts because obviously there aposs some feeling there are some people in the court brett kavanaugh expensive presidential powers on the other hand if you aposre a strict constructionist a textual list article one as there were two stephen miller seems pretty clear lane well you know i think where this boils down legally basically it aposs true as mark said congress can do my kind of created a loophole for the provision of the constitution in the event of national emergencies in certain specific contexts such as this military construction so the question is going to come down to two questions one is it really a national emergency and two is this military construction on the first one courts would be very loath to start weighing what aposs an emergency and what aposs not wallace and try to overrule the president on it lane correct but the military construction thing i mean we aposre talking about a wall in the middle of nowhere it aposs nowhere near a military base and that one is tougher the question i have is where the opponents are going to immediately find somebody with standing to sue over this because by the president aposs own account the money isn apost going to start flowing for months and months wallace ok we got 30 seconds short yes when you go back to what obama did in the borough he appropriated money out of thin air and told the treasury to pay those payments to people on obamacare this is different you can be a strict constructionist and support this decision because congress is giving this authority in statute to the president to do this if congress wants to change it they can but it aposs perfectly legal and constitutional to do what the president is doing pavlich if i can just say real quickly it aposs not in the middle of nowhere it aposs on the sovereign international border and the president certainly has the military authority to protect that wallace you know what nobody ever gets the last word all right panel thank you for listening to me bob we have to take a quick break here when we come back we want to save time because we are joined by the king of conservative talk radio rush limbaugh to get his take on the national emergency the mueller investigation and democrats apos move to the left commercial break wallace coming up rush limbaugh joins us to discuss the president aposs declaration of a national emergency at the border begin video clip trump for three hours he speaks he aposs got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world i mean this guy is unbelievable end video clip wallace we aposll ask rush what he thinks about the wall the fbi and the race for 2020 next commercial break wallace he is the most listened to talk show host in america who this week said the budget deal congress handed the president was an outrage by both parties rush limbaugh joins us live from his eib studio in florida rush welcome back to fox news sunday we aposre delighted to have you for your annual visit rush limbaugh the rush limbaugh show yes and it aposs great to be back chris thank you very much for having me as always wallace all right so i know that you are a constitutional conservative and originalist do you really have no problem with president trump declaring a national emergency and taking money that congress refused to give him limbaugh you know no i don apost i i just listened to your panel and i think so many it aposs all minutia all you guys were talking about was minutia katie pavlich had it right we have an emergency this is an invasion the very existence and definition of american culture american society the rule of law why does nobody talk about the fact that millions and millions and millions of people are breaking the law coming here illegally and that the democratic party wants that to happen we can apost have the breakdown of rule of law and law and order this way that alone would suggest that this has gone on way too long and we need to stop it the argument about where drugs come into the country can anybody deny that they aposre coming in and it needs to be stopped and its destroying future generations of the country we aposre we aposre so caught up in the game of how washington debates issues is this a fact is that not a fact it is undeniable that we have a major immigration problem and a political party that needs a permanent underclass of voters that wants that parade of illegal people who are uneducated wallace all right limbaugh don apost even speak the language they want them here wallace all right and and you and i have disagreement limbaugh it aposs a crisis it really is a crisis wallace but i can interrupt you so i can keep things moving because as donald trump said you can go for three hours limbaugh inaudible wallace all right but i want to ask you about the game that you say we play in washington because the fact is that when president obama took executive actions you were outraged and as you would expect i aposve got a couple of examples of rush limbaugh over the years let aposs put them on the screen in june of 2012 when president obama deferred action against the dreamers you said this 40 years ago richard nixon was hounded out of office supposedly for his illegal actions and i aposm telling you that whatever nixon did pales in comparison to just this move by obama today in november of 2014 on reports that mr obama was going to protect millions of parents of dreamers you said this we can apost just stand idly by and try to find some political opportunity while the president basically shreds the constitution and flushes it down the toilet so here aposs my question rush i understand that you like what president trump is doing and you didn apost like what president obama was doing but i that aposs the concern here is that to the degree that you give the president more and more powers yes you aposre going to get some things executive powers from one president you like but you aposre going to get things executive powers from another president that you don apost like limbaugh you may look at it that way i don apost i look at it as right and wrong and what obama was doing was furthering this existing problem in a he was politicizing this using whatever executive powers he wanted to use yes i objected to that but primarily because of what he was doing with these executive powers he was taking action that i deemed to be harmful to the country i look at what trump is doing as something he has to do because he aposs not getting any cooperation what so both parties chris let aposs be honest here both parties have people that are still trying to get rid of donald trump i read this bill this spending bill this bill is outrageous the things welcoming centers for newly arriving illegal aliens and all kinds of medical care for the purpose of this bill i think was to eventually be used by the democrats and some republicans to tell the american people see electing trump was pointless worthless he can apost protect you he can apost stop us he can apost do what he said he was going to do because we hate him so much we aposre not going to allow him to do that that aposs what this bill is so to me all of this boils down to where the heck are we going as a country and what kind of country are we going to have and if anybody is willing to go to the limit to make this country remain as founded they aposre going to have my support wallace all right president trump talked about you on friday there he is begin video clip trump rush limbaugh i think he aposs a great guy he aposs a guy that can speak for three hours without a phone call try doing that sometime for three hours he speaks he aposs got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world i mean this guy is unbelievable end video clip wallace now you aposve gotten upset with me and some others for saying that president trump listens to you but let aposs go back to what we were talking about which was last december vice president pence goes to the republican senate leaders and he says you aposve got a continuing resolution and i aposm the president has authorized me to tell you he aposs going to sign it and then you get on the radio and some others get on the radio and the house freedom caucus gets up and they say look this continuing resolution doesn apost have a dime for the wall and he shouldn apost sign it and the very next day after they told the senate republican leaders he aposs going to sign it the president says no i aposve changed my mind and you put on the radio that he sent a message directly to you saying hey i aposm not going to sign this bill so look i aposm not saying that you aposre a puppet master but would you agree that he cares about what you say and what you aposre millions of listeners here limbaugh of course he does he cares about what everybody thinks but i don apost make policy can i take just a brief few seconds to correct what happened here i aposm on the radio i aposm reviewing this bill it aposs horrible it doesn apost even have the 1 6 billion that the senate bill had wallace this was back last december limbaugh so i said he aposs yes last december he aposs getting less than nothing and i said he can apost sign this thing this is crazy i get an instant message at that moment from somebody close to the president with the message don apost worry he aposs not going to sign it he was never going to sign it so i report that the media then take that to say that he was almost ready to sign it he had the d in his first name sign and then somebody ran and said no no mr president rush limbaugh says no that aposs not what happened and if these people in the media chris really thought that i was telling trump what to do and when they aposd be calling me they aposd be asking me about it they would they aposd want to get down to the the dirty details i haven apost had one call i haven apost had one inquiry people don apost really believe what they aposre saying about this it aposs just another effort to continue to try to diminish the president diminished trump as somebody that doesn apost know what he aposs doing can apost do it without guidance from the so called wacko right it aposs not at all the way he aposs governing and there isn apost anybody doing what i do that has a thing to do with actually making policy for this president wallace ok i aposm going to switch subjects now we aposve had enough about the wall former acting fbi director andrew mccabe is going to say on 60 minutes tonight i aposm not predicting this he aposs already done the interview that after james comey was fired the deputy attorney general rod rosenstein raised the possibility of invoking the 25th amendment to remove the president here is mccabe begin video clip andrew mccabe former acting fbi director the discussion of the 25th amendment was was simply rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort end video clip wallace now mccabe says that there was no serious conversation as you just heard he says this was raised rosenstein says to the degree he ever discussed it it was sarcastic why do you call what was going on inside the fbi a silent coup limbaugh because these people are unelected they took it upon themselves to overthrow the election results of 2016 ignoring the potential real collusion and conspiracy between democrats and russians to undermine the trump candidacy and the trump presidency the mueller investigation i believe is a cover up of all of that it aposs to distract everybody aposs attention you know again the washington game we aposre losing sight of what happened here people unelected simply because they don apost like a guy aposs hairstyle or like where he came from decided the american people aposs decision was invalid and began a systematic process to get him thrown out of office this is a silent coup these guys if you ask me ought to be the ones in jail they ought to be the ones under investigation what they have done working with agents from the obama intelligence agencies is simply unprecedented this is a kind this is one of the greatest political hoaxes that has ever been perpetrated on the people of this country certainly in a couple of generations wallace federal prosecutors speaking of people in jail federal prosecutors have recommended that paul manafort for a few months the president aposs campaign manager in 2016 that he serve up to 25 years in prison basically be a life sentence he aposs 69 years old now limbaugh right right wallace what do you think of the sentence and should the president the president pardon paul manafort limbaugh i do not know about presidential pardons on something like that i just think that every one of these things that has happened here is designed to make it look like there was some kind of collusion between trump and russia manafort is probably going to die in prison they have him in solitary confinement all of these are process crimes that have been committed there isn apost one crime that has been found under the umbrella of what they were ostensibly looking for collusion between trump and russia it aposs serious chris i saw a poll the other day 42 percent of the american people after two years of this believe the russians tempered with votes and affected the outcome of elections there is no evidence to suggest so and rosenstein aposs even said that that aposs the case when the indictment of those russian internet trolls was announced but wearing a wire to somehow entrap the president of the united states this is classic you know you asked me one time when i was here deep state you liked the term this is it i mean this is and it aposs all of washington d c and it aposs all arrayed against donald trump and it aposs designed to get his approval numbers down maybe into the 30s or 20s they can then go to him and say mr president you aposve lost all support you have no support or then you know this has been an effort to impeach him the the effort that was underway for collusion didn apost work now the mueller report that may not happen is going to be used to continue to leak things that may be in it they aposre going to ratchet this up for the next election and we aposre going to face two more years of this collusion stuff and it aposs i think it aposs just it aposs it aposs something people need to be paying a heavy price for for what they aposve done on the investigatory side of this wallace all right let aposs talk about the next election 2020 is there anyone in either the announced or potential democratic presidential field who you think would offer president trump a real challenge limbaugh well i think you know i first thing i aposm doing here i aposm trying to be one of the first to book a first class seat on a train to hawaii after we enact the green new deal or whatever it is from alexandria ocasio cortez i think what we aposre going to have these people are they aposre so convinced they aposre going to win that that aposs why so many of them are running and they are going to be in a contest to see who can out extreme the other who can move the country furthest to the left the soonest it aposs going to be very entertaining to watch i hope it is eye opening for the american people right now if i had to pick somebody i thought wallace do you see do you see anybody in that field though who you think that that person could give the president a run limbaugh well i think maybe well i don apost know that any of them right now give the president a run but i think the front runner would probably be right now joe biden seventy seven years old plagiarist nicknamed plugs i think he aposs the guy that they probably are thinking is the leader in the polls right now but it aposs going to be very crowded they aposre going to be knocking each other off that aposs going to be fun to watch incumbency carries with it a lot of power as you know and i think they aposre convinced that they aposve already won this election like they were convinced in 2016 they aposre getting way ahead of game and i don apost think it aposs going to be as easy as they think to win the presidency wallace ok let let me ask you about that because you talked about the green new deal and the trains to hawaii you aposve also got limbaugh right great isn apost that wonderful wallace well yes you know where what was it in back to the future where we go we don apost me roads or apparently tracks the calls for medicare for all calls for huge increases on taxes on the very wealthy how potent an issue do you think the president has and how much do you think he will make this case that the democrats want to make this a socialist country limbaugh i think it aposs a huge case because we aposre not a socialist country and even a fox news poll the other day pointed out how many people prefer capitalism we aposve done a real disservice to our young people you look at this new green deal and you look at the things that they think are true they live in the greatest country ever they have more opportunity for contentment happiness success than ever and they think they live in a country that aposs unjust and immoral they have an ill educated mal ph educated and it aposs really a shame i know young people chris who really think that by the time they aposre 65 the country the world is not going to be habitable because of climate change which is another hoax there aposs no evidence for it climate change is nothing but a bunch of computer models that attempt to tell us what aposs going to happen in 50 years or 30 notice the predictions are never for next year or the next ten years they aposre always for way way way way out there when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true in the meantime they get to push for more government big government more tax increases more control over people i it aposs sad what has been done in in k 12 education and higher education to these young i mean graduating economics degree graduates like cortez it doesn apost know what you could put on a thimble about economics it aposs really a shame and it aposs a it aposs a problem going forward they aposre going to have to be defeated beaten wallace rush limbaugh yes wallace thank you thank you for joining us again limbaugh is that it wallace we aposve been limbaugh oh my gosh that aposs at we aposre out of time oh geez wallace we were out 14 minutes limbaugh thank you so much wallace we we flew by limbaugh it really did it always wallace anyway it aposs always good to talk with you anytime you want to come back you aposre always welcome sir limbaugh thank you i appreciate thank you very much see you next time wallace up next our sunday group returns to discuss andrew mccabe aposs account of what happened in the days after the president fired fbi director james comey plus what would you like to ask the panel about how the fbi has handled the trump russia investigation just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip andrew mccabe former acting fbi director i was speaking to the man who had just run for the presidency and and and won the election of the presidency and who might have done so with the aid of the government of russia end video clip wallace former acting fbi director andrew mccabe explaining the reaction at the bureau after president trump fired james comey first trying to protect the russia investigation and then some even discussing invoking the 25th amendment to remove the president and we aposre back now with the panel well we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from timothy pullen does everyone on this panel believe that mccabe and rosenstein were talking about the 25th amendment what do you think should happen to these individuals if it is found to be true katie how do you answer timothy katie pavlich contributor well the reporting by the new york times a couple of months ago showed that rod rosenstein did talk about this now president trump called him to the white house the reporting at the time was he thought he was getting fired he did not get fired that could be for political reasons the president not wanting to show that he was firing anybody it had to do something with the special counsel but the idea that this was even brought up is terrifying to everyday americans because of the implications it has not for high powered government officials who may have a lot of money for their legal defenses but for individual people who the fbi could go after but keep in mind that andrew mccabe had been referred to the u s attorney in washington d c for criminal charges after lying under oath to both doj inspector general investigators and the fbi and so you have to take what he says with a grain of salt however the fact that this was going on at the department of justice after donald trump was elected the president by the american people says a lot about the way that the fbi used to run and i do think that christopher wray the new fbi director has done a decent job of cleaning the place up however there is much more to be done and there has to be accountability for the people who were engaged in this kind of behavior wallace all this was happening in the immediate aftermath in may of 2017 of donald trump firing then fbi director james comey and here aposs how mccabe talks about that begin video clip andrew mccabe former acting fbi director i was very concerned that i was able to put the russia case on absolutely solid ground in an indelible fashion that were i removed quickly or reassigned or fired that the case could not be closed or vanished in the night without a trace end video clip wallace chuck what do you make of what mccabe says about those days in may of 2017 first of all that he was trying as he said there to protect the russia trump investigation and make sure the people at justice didn apost just sweep it away and secondly that and there seems to be some question how seriously this was discussed but that there was any discussion of invoking the 25th amendment to remove the president charles lane the washington post you know on the 25th amendment part i it sounds very desultory what they were doing it was sort of blue skying ph this idea and there is some discrepancy between rosenstein aposs account and mccabe aposs account about this matter wallace but what about what katie says the idea that they aposre even discussing it lane no i to the to the extent i was about to say to the extent it was serious it aposs very troubling because it aposs way above their pay grade to be getting involved in like a head count of which cabinet officers might vote for it or might not on the other hand i i don apost think it went any further than this one or two desultory conversations it aposs the attitude is a little bit troubling on the question of the comey firing and preserving the obstruction of justice case i mean i think this gets right down to the heart of this paradox we aposve all been wrestling with since the beginning here is like who is really watching the watchmen and who is really the top law enforcement officer of the united states is it the president which is he aposs the top guy of the executive branch or are there people somehow below the president in the chain of command who do have the authority or should have the authority to hold him accountable when necessary we went through bob knows it well we went through all of that in watergate we aposve wrestled with this for decades as a country the expedient we aposve come up with now is the special counsel and i think that aposs ultimately going to be how this one gets worked out wallace right lane and bill barr will tell us how much we learn from this report wallace it seems to me marc looking back on this there are two theories of the case when it comes to the fbi one is that the fbi and now special counsel robert mueller have been involved in a legitimate don apost know how it aposs going to turn out but a legitimate investigation of possible collusion and possible obstruction of justice the other theory of the case is that the real scandal here is how comey and mccabe and lisa page and peter strzok and bruce ohr have behaved and and how they acted and particular how they acted well to some degree in the clinton case but even more so in the trump case where do you come down marc short former white house legislative affairs director well i think that the actions of some of those actors cast a dark spell on the fbi and that aposs unfortunate i don apost know keenly why we continue to talk about andrew mccabe and listen to him the reality is that the own inspector general determined that he lied multiple times including three times under oath andrew mccabe in theory was supposed to be leading an investigation into hillary clinton and he says he aposs concerned about russia collusion and that aposs what he was all worried about as far as this being uncovered there aposs 145 million from russians given to the hillary and bill clinton foundation when she was secretary of state 145 million and he aposs sitting here saying that he aposs worried that he was really worried as to how this was going to interfere with his investigation into president trump i mean i don apost know why we still listen to the guy he aposs been proven to be a serial liar again and again wallace bob woodward you have been covering and dealing with fbi officials for more than 40 years since watergate how do you think they have conducted themselves in all of this bob woodward the washington post not well i think there are a lot of legitimate questions but but they aposre gone comey aposs gone mccabe is gone the really interesting point here is bill barr he aposs now attorney general he was attorney general for bush senior 30 years ago and he has a record he aposs a very interesting man he believes that at the time it was the end of the iran contra investigation by lawrence walsh he was very he said at one point that he had an itchy finger for 18 months to fire walsh and he was very upset about what he called the drag netting ph in that investigation going down every possible trail wallace so are you suggesting he might interfere with mueller woodward no he aposs made it clear he will not but he aposs going he aposs going to look at it and he aposs got a very interesting perspective on all of this at the end of the iran contra investigation with then president bush senior decided oh well let aposs pardon caspar weinberger who was indicted it was barr who said well let aposs pardon more people the cia people and elliott abrams so he aposs somebody who is going to protect the president but i think he also knows legally and politically it aposs very important that the mueller investigation proceed so the spotlight should be as marc suggests not on the past but on the future we don apost know who aposs going to run against trump if trump runs in 2020 we know who now is the attorney general and this is the important player in the coming months maybe coming two years wallace and katie i aposve got less than i aposve got about 45 seconds left how transparent should barr be when the mueller report comes out how transparent should he be in saying here i aposll let you pavlich i think he should release as much of it as possible without you know compromising any kind of a technique but the american people because this has been used as a political weapon absolutely deserve to know what is in the mueller report and as we aposre looking in the future yes the guys at the fbi comey and mccabe they aposre gone however i think that the senate judiciary committee with the new chairman lindsey graham are going to be looking into fisa abuse what happened during the 20 wallace he aposs talking about subpoenaing some of these people pavlich right looking at the looking at that kind of abuse going back to the 2016 campaign and looking at how the fbi used those tools because they don apost want that it
