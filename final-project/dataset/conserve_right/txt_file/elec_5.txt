national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge the best thing we could do is just get mike bloomberg in there screen legend clint eastwood said february 21 in the wall street journal the actor and director s comment raised eyebrows especially coming from one of hollywood s few openly conservative luminaries eastwood 89 told interviewer tunku varadarajan that he likes certain things that trump s done but wishes the president behaved in a more genteel way without tweeting and calling people names how sad that such a prominent and normally sensible figure on the right opposes donald trump not on policy differences but because the president does not mirror mr rogers yes trump should use twitter more selectively he need not react to everything under the sun and his name calling often is counterproductive but it is baffling for eastwood who backed trump in 2016 to abandon him now over a lack of gentility like so many of those who oppose trump s style eastwood pines for a long lost world political gentility sounds lovely but it should be a two way street alas eric holder obama s attorney general perfectly captured the attitude of today s left when they go low we kick em that s what this new democratic party is about eastwood and others who share his concerns crave gentility even as democrats and their left wing media allies call trump a black hating white nationalist who as resist fascism s sunsara taylor said on february 22 2017 could arguably be worse than hitler jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup

he just made richard grenell acting national intelligence director and thus america s first openly gay cabinet member through grenell s efforts the supposedly gay bashing trump administration has worked to decriminalize homosexuality in nations where gay relationships can lead to prison time or even beheading trump haters also have mocked his fast food consumption weight shamed him and even recruited psychiatrists to declare him mentally ill without even examining him or obtaining his permission this flagrantly violates the goldwater rule section 7 of the american psychiatric association s principles of medical ethics trump haters call him an anti semite never mind his muscularly pro israel policies his orthodox jewish daughter son in law and grandchildren and among other exculpatory evidence the two white house hanukkah parties that he hosted in december trump foes routinely pillory his elegant wife s attire and christmas decor more revolting the late actor peter fonda said via

beat the hell out of him and numerous artists have depicted by turns trump s stabbing shooting rape and decapitation how genteel democrats called trump a russian asset before during and after the 22 month robert mueller investigation found no such thing since ukraine o rama failed to remove trump from office democrats are rerunning their donald kgb trump rubbish if trump is a russian tool why did he invite onto the stage at his february 21 las vegas rally the u s olympic hockey players who beat their soviet rivals in 1980 s miracle on ice the russian team s defeat on ice which came soon after the ussr invaded afghanistan was one of the soviets most humiliating moments it hinted at the deep rot of the socialist workers paradise if trump is putin s stooge why would he make moscow relive that embarrassment and while we re at it why would trump repeatedly slap sanctions on the kremlin urge germany to purchase american rather than russian natural gas and supply ukraine with javelin missiles which swiftly would turn russian tanks into flaming ruins the left slams trump 24 7 365 no matter what beyond that they invent stories from his expulsion of the martin luther king jr bust from the oval office to his empowerment of neo nazis in charlottesville to the dangerously overfed koi in a tokyo pond to the pro trump white nationalist students from covington catholic high school the trump hating left also displays its gentility by violently attacking conservatives and trump supporters leftist thug zachary greenberg clocked campus reform leadership institute staffer hayden williams on

detective daniel sprague s red hat says make fifty great again even this was too much for the woman who attacked him from behind in a nashville baron february 10 yelling how dare you she drew blood from his cheek sprague says the cut is pretty deep and it goes to the bone how genteel conservatives tried genteel with bush the elder bush the younger and mitt romney although sometimes grumpy the late senator john mccain r ariz also fit this category these courtly republicans either lost to tougher democrats or knuckled under to democrats demands for larger social programs higher domestic spending tighter regulations and fresher entitlements none of this should be news to a conservative like eastwood in a world of inescapable tradeoffs americans should focus on president trump s public policy if they do they will see a tough energetic and focused leader who 90 percent of the time delivers what conservatives and free marketeers want tax cuts deregulation energy independence 210 constitutionalist judges dead terrorists and more as for the other 10 percent trump raised import taxes but now they re yielding to modern trade deals with china south korea and japan meanwhile the u s works to strike commercial agreements with the u k and india and recently signed an updated version of nafta social spending is too high but that was democrats ransom for freeing vital defense outlays trump should have driven harder bargains here but he chose national security over fiscal discipline yes entitlements should be on the table but the genteel republicans did little about this either bush 43 touched social security the third rail of politics got the shock of his life and never looked back he also launched medicare part d the prescription drug plan his father s one term as president featured no effort at entitlement reform too bad eastwood and the genteel caucus miss the big picture having a 90 percent conservative president is worth the trade off in occasional twitter outbursts and grade school name calling pity clint eastwood did not make my day get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
