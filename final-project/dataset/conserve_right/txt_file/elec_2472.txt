national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge regimes however intellectually disreputable rarely are unable to attract intellectuals eager to rationalize the regimes behavior america s current administration has national conservatives they advocate unprecedented expansion of government in order to purge america of excessive respect for market forces and to affirm robust confidence in government as a social engineer allocating wealth and opportunity they call themselves conservatives perhaps because they loathe progressives although they seem not to remember why the manhattan institute s oren cass advocates industrial policy what other socialists call economic planning because market economies do not automatically allocate resources well across sectors so government he says must create the proper composition of the economy by rescuing vital sectors from underinvestment by allocating resources well cass does notmean efficiently to their most economically productive uses he especially means subsidizing manufacturing which he says is the primary form of production because innovation and manufacturing production are not easily disaggregated manufacturing jobs cass s preoccupation are however only 8 percent of u s employment furthermore he admits that as government i e politics permeates the economy on manufacturing s behalf regulatory capture other forms of corruption and market distortions will emerge emerge using government to create market distortions is national conservatism s agenda the national conservatives pinup du jour is fox news s tucker carlson who like the president he reveres is a talented entertainer carlson says that what senator elizabeth warren d mass calls economic patriotism sounds like donald trump at his best carlson approves of how warren excoriates u s companies excessive loyalty to shareholders she wants the government to act aggressively and intervene in markets in order to stop abandoning loyal american workers and hollowing out american cities carlson darkly warns that this pure old fashioned economics offends zealots controlled by the banks he adds the main threat to your ability to live your life as you choose does not come from government anymore but it comes from the private sector well if living as you choose means living free from the friction of circumstances the threat is large indeed it is reality the fact that individuals are situated in times and places not altogether of their choosing or making national conservatives promise

labelmapping labelmapping their agenda is much more ambitious than president nixon s 1971 imposition of wage and price controls which weretemporaryfiascos their agenda is even more ambitious than the new deal s cartelization of industries which had the temporary and unachieved purpose of curing unemployment what national conservatives propose is government fine tuning the economy s composition and making sure resources are well distributed as the government i e the political class decides forever what socialists are so fond of saying national conservatives are now saying thistime will be different it never is because government s economic planning always involves the fatal conceit that government can aggregate and act on information more intelligently and nimbly than markets can national conservatives preen as defenders of the dignity of the rural and small town mostly white and non college educated working class however these defenders nullify the members dignity by discounting their agency national conservatives regard the objects of their compassion as inert victims who are as passive as brown paper parcels awaiting government rescue from circumstances in contrast there was dignity in thejoadfamily of john steinbeck s the grapes of wrath who when the depression and dust bowl battered oklahoma went west seeking work right wing anti capitalism has a long pedigree as a largely aristocratic regret symbolized by railroads the noise the soot the lower orders not staying where they belong that despoiled theedenictranquility of europe s landed aristocracy the aristocrats were not wrong in seeing their supremacy going up in the smoke from industrialism s smokestacks market forces powered by mass preferences do not defer to inherited status although the national conservatives anti capitalism purports to be populist it would further empower the administrative state s faux aristocracy of administrators who would decide which communities and economic sectors should receive well allocated resources furthermore national conservatism is paternalistic populism this might seem oxymoronic but so did elizabeth warren conservatives until national conservatives emerged as such the paternalists say to today sjoads stay put we know what is best for you and will give it to you through government as national conservatives apply intellectual patinas to the president s mutable preferences they continue their molten denunciations of progressives hysteria about a flight 93 election the republic s last chance and similar nonsense heat however neither disguises nor dignifies their narcissism of small differences 2019 washington post writers group get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020
