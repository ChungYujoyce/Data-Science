s embassy was billed in his official schedule as simply a round table discussion with academics but a recent cia report reveals the vice president was one of a long list of current and former u s and foreign officials who exchanged information with cui liru one of the five experts identified as a longtime ministry of state security mss intelligence officer working undercover as the head of china s most important intelligence analysis group mr cui is head of the china institutes of contemporary international relations known as cicir pronounced kicker cicir has a long history of supplying information to the cia through agency paid u s consultants who are dispatched yearly to cicir s offices in beijing for discussions according to u s officials top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed some of cicir s disinformation designed to influence u s policies is said to have shown up in some agency intelligence products according to officials familiar with the reports cicir experts also were quoted frequently in leaked u s embassy cables reporting from china as academics not all of the more than 100 cables mentioning the group however identify the institute as mss affiliated a spokesmen for mr biden and wang baodong a chinese embassy spokesman did not respond to email requests for comment report shows intel link the new report by the open source center at cia headquarters states that cicir is so close to the ruling chinese communist party that it is reported to be the eighth bureau of the ministry of state security the notorious chinese equivalent to the soviet kgb political police and intelligence service cicir has provided intelligence collection support to the mss and the foreign affairs leading group falg the communist party of china s top foreign policy body the aug 25 report says the intelligence organ played a major role in providing analysis for communist leaders on the arab spring uprisings in the middle east since late 2010 and also recently set up a terrorism research center however most of cicir s work involves spying on the united states and providing analysis some of it secret charts in the report show that about 60 percent of cicir s research and publication efforts involve the united states in addition to publishing two journals and numerous books the institute also publishes two restricted access reports for chinese civilian and military leaders topics include u s policy on taiwan obama administration cybersecurity strategy and u s changes in military deployments in the persian gulf the 34 page report includes a listing gathered from cicir s website of numerous current and former officials and with whom they met most included meetings with mr cui a brief biography in the report states that mr cui has been cicir president since 2005 a notable previous assignment included a stint in new york as first secretary at china s united nations mission a position that specialists on china say is normally reserved for mss officers the report says most cicir officials including mr cui and yuan peng its american studies director either taught or studied at the university of international relations which is closely linked to cicir the university was set up in 1964 to train intelligence personnel for the communist party investigation department and undercover at xinhua news agency the report quotes david shambaugh a george washington university china specialist as stating that cicir s leadership all share lengthy and shadowy careers in the intelligence service the report states that cicir s affiliation with mss is rarely acknowledged in the state run press one exception was a xinhua journal called liaowang that reported in 2009 that the institute is subordinate to mss hong kong press reports quoted by the cia however provide other details of cicir s intelligence work including its role as the intelligence analysis branch of mss hong kong s cheng ming reported in 1995 that cicir worked with mss in comparing and verifying the authenticity of intelligence information obtained from secret channels with open source materials compiled by cicir before submitting intelligence to senior chinese communist party politburo members collecting intelligence the report listed its missions as collecting open source information from major news agencies newspapers and magazines globally translating articles for mss and arranging subscriptions for major english language newspapers for the foreign affairs secretaries of politburo members i don t think american universities or think tanks take cicir s intelligence collection or disinformation tasks seriously said john tkacik a former state department intelligence official instead they take the views of cicir s researchers at face value without attempting to sort out the mss agenda cicir makes a point of giving off the record insights to foreign academics and journalists in order to shape foreign perceptions of chinese international policy especially chinese support of north korea iran syria burma sudan zimbabwe and sudan the institute s researchers overseas including most former cicir scholars also are given intelligence collection duties that include clandestine collection mr tkacik said an example of how cicir influences u s policy can be seen in a classified state department cable from dec 3 2009 that quotes cicir vice president yang mingjie speaking about the pentagon s nuclear posture review mr yang told u s embassy officials that if the pentagon made significant nuclear cuts china would feel increased pressure to be more open about its nuclear buildup and it would influence china to slow or stop its nuclear modernization ideas that analysts say likely would influence obama administration policymakers to favor nuclear weapons cutbacks huntsman officials met often the cia report lists numerous prominent officials and experts who met with senior cicir officials u s ambassador to china jon huntsman jr met with mr cui and cicir vice president wang zaiban on march 25 a little more than a month before he stepped down to discuss the current international situation the report says u s

north korea cuba australia japan poland netherlands afghanistan pakistan denmark russia and uzbekistan larry wortzel a former u s military intelligence officer said he is less concerned about cicir s intelligence activities they are professional about what they do they understand we need info on our side and they need info on theirs so when you put them against the russians the indians the laotians the cambodians or the vietnamese they are easier to work with mr wortzel said noting that cicir officials don t talk about internal matters they will give very good background information and explain the dynamics behind par
