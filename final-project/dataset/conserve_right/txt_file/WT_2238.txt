trial following his impeachment by the u s house and a re election campaign it marks a potential turning point in the middle east and represents a drastic change for american policy toward iran after months of tensions tehran shot down a u s military surveillance drone and seized oil tankers the u s also blames iran for a series of attacks targeting tankers as well as a september assault on saudi arabia s oil industry that temporarily halved its production the tensions take root in trump s decision in may 2018 to withdraw the u s from iran s nuclear deal with world powers struck under his

road near the baghdad airport a senior iraqi security official said the airstrike took place near the cargo area after soleimani left his plane and joined al muhandis and others in a car the official said the plane had arrived from either lebanon or syria two officials from the pmf said suleimani s body was torn to pieces in the attack while they did not find the body of al muhandis a senior politician said soleimani s body was identified by the ring he wore the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to give official statements it s unclear what legal authority the u s relied on to carry out the attack american presidents claim broad authority to act without the approval of the congress when u s personnel or interests are facing an imminent threat the pentagon did not provide evidence to back up its assertion that soleimani was planning new attacks against americans democratic connecticut sen richard blumenthal said trump owes a full explanation to congress and the american people the present authorizations for use of military force in no way cover starting a possible new war this step could bring the most consequential military confrontation in decades blumenthal said but trump allies were quick to praise the action to the iranian government if you want more you will get more tweeted south carolina sen lindsey graham for iran the killing represents more than just the loss of a battlefield commander but also a cultural icon who represented national pride and resilience while facing u s sanctions while careful to avoid involving himself in politics soleimani s profile rose sharply as u s and israeli officials blamed him for iranian proxy attacks abroad while iran s conventional military has suffered under 40 years of american sanctions the guard has built up a ballistic missile program it also can strike asymmetrically in the region through forces like lebanon s hezbollah and yemen s houthi rebels the u s long has blamed iran for car bombings and kidnappings it never claimed as the head of the quds or jersualem force of iran s paramilitary revolutionary guard soleimani led all of its expeditionary forces and frequently shuttled between iraq lebanon and syria quds force members have deployed into syria s long war to support president bashar assad as well as into iraq in the wake of the 2003 u s invasion that toppled dictator saddam hussein a longtime foe of tehran soleimani rose to prominence by advising forces fighting the islamic state group in iraq and in syria on behalf of the embattled assad u s officials say the guard under soleimani taught iraqi militants how to manufacture and use especially deadly roadside bombs against u s troops after the invasion of iraq iran has denied that soleimani himself remains popular among many iranians who see him as a selfless hero fighting iran s enemies abroad soleimani had been rumored dead several times including in a 2006 airplane crash that killed other military officials in northwestern iran and following a 2012 bombing in damascus that killed top aides of assad rumors circulated in november 2015 that soleimani was killed or seriously wounded leading forces loyal to assad as they fought around syria s aleppo soleimani s killing follows the new year s eve attack by iran backed militias on the u s embassy in baghdad the two day embassy attack which ended wednesday prompted trump to order about 750 u s soldiers deployed to the middle east it also prompted secretary of state mike pompeo to postpone his trip to ukraine and four other countries to continue monitoring the ongoing situation in iraq and ensure the safety and security of americans in the middle east state department spokeswoman morgan ortagus said wednesday the breach at the embassy followed u s airstrikes sunday that killed 25 fighters of the iran backed militia in iraq the kataeb hezbollah the u s military said the strikes were in retaliation for last week s killing of an american contractor in a rocket attack on an iraqi military base that the u s blamed on the militia u s officials have suggested they were prepared to engage in further
