over the executive branch as house democrats conduct an impeachment inquiry quiz beyond the front page best of 2019 chief justice roberts and justice ruth bader ginsburg have publicly commented on mr trump in recent years justice ginsburg went as far as calling him a faker and the chief justice sent a sharp rebuke to the commander in chief over the political independence of the judiciary the issue of potential bias was raised about a year after chief justice roberts released an unusual statement indirectly firing back at the president over his politicization of judges based on the presidents who appointed them we do not have obama judges or trump judges bush judges or clinton judges chief justice roberts said in a statement in november 2018 issued from the court s public information office what we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them he said the president received the rare rebuke after

crossed the line of what is permitted by a justice justice ginsburg has apologized for calling mr trump a faker he has no consistency about him he says whatever comes into his head at the moment he really has an ego she told cnn in 2016 how has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns the press seems to be very gentle with him on that in response mr trump called for the senior
