 i was wondering if and when team romney would dust off some of 2008 s oldies but goodies to use as a cudgel against the one and now we have our answer our first hints that romney would target the hillary vote arose during the firestorm over hilary rosen s attacks against ann romney but this spot takes the tactic to a much more overt and aggressive level will it work on one hand last cycle s puma party unity my a phenomenon among disaffected clinton backers almost completely receded by election day the overwhelming majority of hillary s supporters hopped aboard the obama train especially after the clintons played starring and strongly supportive roles at his nominating convention on the other hand i d wager that blue collar predominantly white hillary democrats and indies are the lowest hanging fruit for republicans to reap this cycle reminding this group about the president s profoundly underwhelming record and his lack of fealty to facts in his quest to attain and maintain political power could certainly do some damage back to the other hand for a moment aren t most voters smart enough to understand that rivals within any political party sometimes say harsh things about each other during contested primaries it s not as though the clintons are backing mitt romney for president right then again now that i mention it incidentally the obama lie cited in romney s ad is the discredited outsourcing garbage chicago has been peddling for a few weeks we wrote about the post s destruction of obama s claims at the time they awarded his camp four pincocchios on two consecutive days last week and cited jim pethokoukis careful reporting on the same subject cliffs notes version of the truth the outsourcing attributed to romney either occurred after he left bain capital involved domestic outsourcing moving jobs among states not overseas entailed companies that already had existing overseas holdings and jobs when bain invested in them or addressed firms that expanded their international operations to include overseas call centers in order to service local populations in their native languages the obama campaign unable to run on the president s dismal record has obstinately refused to correct the record now the nonpartisan factcheck org has examined these outsourcing allegations their verdict there s no evidence to substantiate the mendacious anti romney narrative but after reviewing numerous corporate filings with the securities and exchange commission contemporary news accounts company histories and press releases and the evidence offered by both the obama and romney campaigns we found no evidence to support the claim that romney while he was still running bain capital shipped american jobs overseas couple this utterly false storyline with team obama s ongoing and pathetic spin that the obamacare mandate tax isn t a tax and one has to wonder what if anything these guys aren t lying about i ll leave you with three items 1 american crossroads latest ad slamming the obamacare mandate tax 2 since obama is endlessly shanking romney with factually inaccurate accusations of outsourcing might he care to offer the country an explanation for this the obama campaign spent nearly 4 700 on telemarketing services from a canadian telemarketing company called pacific east between march and june a washington free beacon study of federal election filings shows pacific east is not the only foreign telemarketing firm raking in cash from the president s reelection campaign obama paid a call center in manila philippines 78 314 10 for telemarketing services between the start of the campaign and march 3 a delicious bonus question does anyone remember why hillary held that shame on you barack obama press conference in the first place answer she was upbraiding captain hopenchange for distributing campaign mailers that she said unfairly distorted her position on healthcare what was her stance on that issue throughout the 08 campaign she supported wait for it an individual mandate which obama sharply criticized over and over again calling it a tax on the uninsured today his unpopular law revolves around that very same tax even as he laughably insists that it s not a tax despite having hailed the supreme court s decision upholding the legislation as a tax too rich what do they say about karma again alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist twitter fact checks a pair of president trump s tweets update trump responds townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
