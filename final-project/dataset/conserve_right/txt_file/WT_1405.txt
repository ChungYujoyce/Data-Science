apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic rep adam b schiff s opening statement wednesday at the senate impeachment trial described president trump as a serial election cheat who must be stopped before the november vote while the president lobbed insults back at the proceedings from the other side of the atlantic calling mr schiff s crew major sleaze bags mr schiff the house democrats lead impeachment manager prosecuting the case focused his argument on a simple concept the president attempted to cheat in this year s election just like he did in 2016 the california democrat described it as a pattern of cheating that mr trump began by seeking russia s assistance in 2016 and was determined to repeat by forcing ukraine to help him this time see also biden slaps down possible impeachment trial testimony swap we are here today to consider a much more grave matter and that is an attempt to use the powers of the presidency to cheat in an election he said for precisely this reason the president s misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box for we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won mr schiff mentioned russia and election hacking at least 15 times during the opening statement mr trump is on trial for two articles of impeachment abuse of power for asking ukraine to investigate political rival joseph r biden and obstruction of congress for not cooperating with the house impeachment inquiry see also protester erupts at impeachment trial schumer is the devil the president denies wrongdoing and has been defended by senate republicans who are poised to acquit him of the articles of impeachment that house democrats passed in a party line vote on dec 18 still mr schiff urged the senators to convict the president and remove him from office he argued that mr trump put his political benefit above national security and undermined america s fair and free elections the abuse of power charge holds that mr trump withheld official acts a white house visit and nearly 400 million in military aid to pressure ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to investigate mr biden and his son hunter biden hunter biden landed a high paying position on the board of ukrainian energy company burisma holdings while his father as vice president led obama administration policy in that graft riddled country mr trump conducts himself as if he is above the law and scornful of restrictions mr schiff said mr schiff who also led democrats push of trump russian collusion allegations that were discredited by a nearly two year investigation by special counsel robert mueller returned to the collusion theme he recalled that mr trump as a candidate in 2016 joked at a rally that russia should uncover missing emails of democratic nominee hillary clinton mrs clinton purged the emails amid a scandal over her use of a secret personal server while she was secretary of state to drive home the point a video was shown in the chamber of mr trump on the stump calling out russia if you re listening i hope you re able to find the 30 000 emails that are missing i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press hours later mr schiff noted russia hacked the email account of mrs clinton s campaign manager and revealed embarrassing messages including an exchange that expressed anti catholic bias mrs clinton s missing state department emails however were never recovered and the president has made it clear that it will not be the last time asking china only recently to join ukraine in investigating his political opponent he said the opening statement started up to 24 hours of floor time over three days for the house impeachment managers to present their case against mr trump it s not clear whether all of the time will be used it was not for the impeachment trial of president bill clinton in 1999 after the prosecution presents its case the president s legal team will have 24 hours over three days to deliver a defense mr trump didn t wait for his defense team to take the podium this is the greatest witch hunt he said as he prepared to return home from an economic summit in davos switzerland it s horrible for our country our country needs to get back to business mr trump said he wouldn t mind seeing former national security adviser john r bolton testify which democrats have been demanding about what he knows on ukraine but he said he worried that his former aide would reveal too much about private conversations about global leaders harming the executive branch in the end he said it will be up to senators whether to call witnesses i have great respect for the senate as a body and many of the individuals mr trump said this is the greatest witch hunt the president said democrats orchestrated the impeachment to detract from the strong u s economy which the president touted in davos back in washington mr schiff promised senators that house democrats would present extensive evidence and overwhelming evidence of wrongdoing by the president he also prodded the senators to vote to compel more administration documents and more testimony by administration officials to seal the case against mr trump democrats have been clamoring for more evidence at the trial since the house passed the two articles of impeachment senate democrats put up 11 amendments that would have compelled more documents and testimony during a marathon debate of the trial rules tuesday but the republican run chamber shot down each amendment and adopted rules that put off the question of additional witnesses until after the two sides present their cases mr schiff said the senators could still hear from witnesses such as mr bolton secretary of state mike pompeo and acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney you will hear their testimony at the same time as the american people if you allow it mr schiff said while he was making his case on the chamber floor mr trump s surrogates a handful of republican house lawmakers told reporters that mr schiff can t be trusted to present the truth rep jim jordan ohio republican said mr schiff claimed to have more than circumstantial evidence that mr trump colluded with russia but that ended up not being accurate he added that mr schiff said the foreign intelligence surveillance court could be trusted but the justice department inspector general found otherwise he said mr schiff said they would hear from the whistleblower during the house probe and that never happened and claimed not to have communicated with the whistleblower it was later reported that mr schiff s staff did interact with the whistleblower he added but today we are supposed to believe him mr jordan said dismissively rep lee m zeldin new york republican said mr schiff thinks he is the chairman of the house s impeachment committee unfortunately you are not going to see a live fact checker as you are watching adam schiff in the course of the day he said his story essentially trying to write the world s greatest parody is a reliance on presumption on hearsay and lies he is trying to connect dots that aren t actua
