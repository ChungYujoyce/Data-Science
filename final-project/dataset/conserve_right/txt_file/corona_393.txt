left wing activists made multiple false and misleading claims on thursday following president donald trump s white house coronavirus task force press briefing in which the president commented on new scientific findings from the department of homeland security dhs the activists falsely claimed that trump urged americans to inject themselves with disinfectant and told people to drink bleach to understand trump s remarks it s important to first understand the full context of what was said at the press briefing bill bryan under secretary for science and technology at dhs said at the press briefing our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus both surfaces and in the air we ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favorable to the virus bryan talked about the half life of the coronavirus on surfaces like door handles and stainless steel surfaces saying that when they inject uv rays into the mix along with high temperatures and increased humidity that the virus dies quickly the virus does not survive as well in droplets of saliva and that s important because a lot of testing being done is not necessarily being done number one with the covid 19 virus and number two in saliva or respiratory fluids bryan continued and thirdly the virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight under these conditions half life of sars cov 2 in saliva droplets virus does not last long in high temperature humidity sunlight pic twitter com ettru48ite ryan maue ryanmaue april 23 2020 bryan continued by noting that dhs also tested if certain types of disinfectant could kill the coronavirus we ve tested bleach we ve tested isopropyl alcohol on the virus specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids and i can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes bryan said isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds and that s with no manipulation no rubbing just bring it on and leaving it go you rub it and it goes away even faster bryan added we re also looking at other disinfectants specifically looking at the covid 19 virus in saliva immediately following these remarks trump said so i m going to ask bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of if you re totally into that world which i find to be very interesting so supposing when we hit the body with a tremendous whether it s ultraviolet or just very powerful light and i think you said that hasn t been checked but you re going to test it and then i said supposing you brought the light inside the body which you can do either through the skin or in some other way and i think you said you re going to test that too sounds interesting and then i see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute one minute and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs so it d be interesting to check that so that you re going to have to use medical doctors with but it sounds interesting to me so we ll see but the whole concept of the light the way it kills it in one minute that s pretty powerful a few moments later abc news reporter jon karl asked bryan the president mentioned the idea of a cleaner bleach and isopropyl alcohol emerging there s no scenario where that could be injected into a person is there no i m here to talk about the finds that we had in the study bryan responded we don t do that within that lab at our labs trump then clarified his remarks it wouldn t be through injections you re talking about almost a cleaning and sterilization of an area maybe it works maybe it doesn t work but it certainly has a big affect if it s on a stationary object trump later raised the possibility of whether uv rays could kill the coronavirus if it was on a person s skin in particular if it were on their hands if they re outside right and their hands are exposed to the sun will that kill it as though it were a piece of metal or something else trump asked i don t want to say it will at the same rate because it s a non porous surface but what we do know is that we looked at the worst case scenario and the virus lives longer on non porous surfaces bryan responded so porous surfaces it doesn t live quite as long so in theory what you said is correct left wing activist chris d jacksonwrote that trump had urged americans to inject themselves with disinfectant tonight the far left seems more upset about a report suggesting a former treasury secretary is advising joebiden on economic policy than the fact that realdonaldtrump urged americans to inject themselves with disinfectant this is our political reality in a nutshell chris d jackson chrisdjackson april 24 2020 jake maccoby a former speech writer for the obama justice department wrote on twitter that trump had told people to drink bleach trump downplayed the virus then called for rebellion then told people to drink bleach maybe it s time to stop taking his press conferences live
