michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic liangjiahe china the next leader of china spent much of his youth living in a dug out cave xi jinping s seven years in this remote northern community meant toiling alongside rural villagers by day and sleeping on bricks by night in stark contrast to his pampered early years in beijing he was born into the communist elite but after his father fell out of favor with mao zedong and before his later rehabilitation the younger xi was sent to a rural hinterland to learn peasant virtues at age 15 the liangjiahe years are among the scant details known about mr xi s life and personality partly because he himself chronicled them as a formative experience top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens they are part of the vague picture of a man who has drawn little attention during much of his political career but now is poised to become ruling party chief next month and president next year of an increasingly assertive china what is clear is that mr xi has excelled at quietly rising through the ranks by making the most of two facets he has an elite educated background with links to communist china s founding fathers that are a crucial advantage in the country s politics and at the same time he has cultivated a common man mystique that helps him appeal to a broad constituency he even gave up a promising beijing post in his late 20s to go back out to the countryside he did not at first come willingly however to liangjiahe a tiny community of cave dwellings dug into arid hills and fronted by dried mud walls with wooden lattice entryways he tried to escape and was detained villagers remember a tall bookworm who eventually earned their respect he was always very sincere and worked hard alongside us he was also a big reader of really thick books said shi chunyang then a friend of mr xi s and now a local official a man for his times it is in the nature of china s politics that relatively little is known about mr xi s policy leanings he is not associated with any bold reforms aspiring officials get promoted by encouraging economic growth tamping down social unrest and toeing the line set by beijing not by charismatic displays of initiative mr xi s resume in provincial posts suggest he is open to private industry and some administrative reforms as long as they don t jeopardize the communist party s monopoly on power he likes hollywood flicks about world war ii and has a daughter at harvard university under an assumed name though he has signaled he may be a staunch chinese nationalist tall heavyset and married to a popular folk singer in the military mr xi is at ease in groups in contrast to china s typically stiff and aloof leaders such as current president hu jintao a xi administration is expected to pursue a more forceful foreign policy based on beijing s belief that chief rival washington is in decline and that china s rise to global pre eminence is within reach xi was chosen in part because he has the large assertive confident personality to lead in that kind of strategy said andrew nathan a specialist on chinese politics at new york s columbia university mr xi will confront daunting challenges after two decades of fast paced growth and social change the economy is flagging and china is under strain a polarizing gap has left a few wealthy and many struggling and resentful rampant corruption is corroding already low reserves of public trust in officialdom beyond home china is locked in sharp elbowing over territory with japan and southeast asian neighbors at the same time beijing feels hemmed in by the u s which is shoring up ties with countries on china s edge from chemistry to politics as son of one time vice prime minister xi zhongxun the younger xi spent the 1950s in a world of comfortable homes chauffeur driven cars and the best schools when most chinese were desperately poor but the elder xi fell afoul of the increasingly paranoid communist chief and mao demoted him in 1962 the son was dispatched to rural shaanxi province in 1969 as part of mao s campaign to toughen up educated urban youth during the chaotic cultural revolution when caught returning to beijing he was sent to a labor camp for six months back in liangjiahe he helped build irrigation ditches knives are sharpened on the stone people are refined through hardship mr xi said in a rare 2001 interview with a chinese magazine whenever i later encountered trouble i d just think of how hard it had been to get things done back then and nothing would then seem difficult local communist party officials and police in liangjiahe followed reporters on a visit and asked them to leave showing how the party wants to control information about mr xi s past but they did allow brief interviews including with mr shi described by villagers as mr xi s former iron buddy mr shi stood across from the now abandoned one room home where mr xi lived with a local family and recalled the day mr xi departed at age 22 no one wanted to see him go mr shi said rejected for communist party membership nine times owing to his father s political problems mr xi finally gained entry in 1974 and then attended the elite tsinghua university he would later return to liangjiahe only once in 1992 when he gave an alarm clock to each household mr shi said mr xi went on to earn a chemistry degree by which time mao had died and his father been restored to office mr xi next secured a plum position as secretary to defense minister geng biao one of his father s old comrades but mr xi took the unusual step three years later of jumping to a lowly post in rural hebei province because he wanted to struggle work hard and really take on something big mr xi told elite youth magazine s now deceased editor yang xiaohuai mr xi landed in the rural town of zhengding where people traveled by horse cart while there he made the most of state broadcaster china central television s plans to film an adaptation of the classical chinese novel dream of red mansions hoping to create a tourist attraction mr xi built a full scale reproduction of the sprawling estate at the heart of the tale you could tell xi was thinking ahead by doing this he created lots of jobs and lots of revenue for zhengding back when there was very little here said liang qiang
