apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic chengdu china ap china opened the trial for an ex police chief at the center of the country s worst political scandal in decades unexpectedly staging a closed door hearing monday a day earlier than publicly announced authorities justified the closed proceedings by saying state secrets were being discussed in the trial of wang lijun who is charged with defection abuse of power and other crimes it was closed according to chinese law because it involves state secrets said defense lawyer wang yuncai who is not related to her client top stories sex

time on tuesday the court is scheduled to hold the previously announced public portion of the trial though foreign media won t be allowed in and the hearing is expected to go over allegations of bribe taking and other charges the trial was the latest wrinkle in the bizarre monthslong scandal that started when mr wang fled to the u s consulate in february and divulged the murder of a british businessman it resulted in the removal of his boss senior politician bo xilai from the communist leadership and the roiling of the communist party leadership as it prepares a delicate transfer of power to younger leaders during his 33 hour stay at the consulate mr wang claimed that mr bo s wife was involved in the murder apparently unable to get asylum in the u s mr wang turned himself over to a senior state security official from beijing months later mr bo s wife was convicted of the murder after she confessed in court monday s hearing involved two of the charges against mr wang and appeared to center on events in the consulate and the potential cover up the intermediate court in the central city of chengdu heard the charges of defection and abuse of power and touched on state secrets said ms wang his lawyer putting mr wang on trial is a next step for china s leadership in moving past the scandal and dealing with the stickiest issue whether to expel mr bo from the party and prosecute him proof that the scandal s fallout continues to dog chinese leaders is that they have yet to announce a date for a party congress to install the new leadership though it is expected in mid to late october mr wang s almost certain conviction marks the downfall of a prominent colorful policechief who often skirted the law that he made a flamboyant show of enforcing worries about mr wang s renegade behavior likely prompted chinese leaders to order the closed hearing said dali yang director of the university of chicago center in beijing wang lijun by walking into the u s consulate showed that he does not play by the book it was a surprise move to bo and to the party he might not be as easy to control mr yang said a career policeman of more than two decades mr wang made a name for himself as a gang buster in a northeastern province where he met mr bo then a fast rising politician who as the son of a revolutionary veteran had a web of political contacts the two rode to national fame together launching a high profile sweep against organized crime in chongqing an inland megacity where mr bo had been named party chief in magazine cover stories and on television news mr wang was depicted as someone willing to tackle vested interests hundreds of gangsters police and officials were prosecuted and among the 13 people executed was the head of the city s justice bureau behind the headlines the use of torture to extract confessions and arrests to pressure businessmen to steer deals toward mr bo and his allies created enemies at the highest levels his excesses would likely have not gotten him into trouble had he not embarrassed the ruling elite by going to the u s consulate in the nearby city of chengdu and divulging information the party would prefer be handled in secret mr wang s trial is expected to be quick the charges against the youthful looking 52 year old each carry 10 year maximums though the law provides for lengthier sentences for egregious violations in history until relatively recently he who lived by the sword often perished by the sword wang lijun is facing an outcome along that line said steve tsang director of the china policy institute at the university of nottingham in britain he being somebody who has a long record of not delivering justice while in a position requiring him to do so to end up facing the same fate i would call it poetic injustice long before his surprise flight to the consulate mr wang displayed a penchant for drama and obsessive police work he invented law enforcement tools and filed patents for them adjustable poles for mounting surveillance cameras reflective jackets boots for female officers a battery powered fan cooled police helmet for chongqing s muggy summers and a streetlamp that also serves as a closed circuit camera as a senior police officer in the northeastern city of tieling he drove a jeep that he had modified to carry two rows of lamps on its roof so that when he arrived anywhere everyone would know that chief wang is here wrote screenwriter zhou lijun who spent time with mr wang after being tasked by the government to make a tv series about him in 1996 mr wang would jump on the roof of a police car and fire a warning shot into the air with his gun when dealing with small time criminals mr zhou wrote it is not clear why mr wang fled to the consulate though he had recently been sidelined by mr bo in a sign of strained relations between them in january mr bo had him removed as policechief and gave him a less powerful post as vice mayor in charge of sports in a report on
