apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic bangkok when president obama becomes the first american president to visit communist laos this week he will arrive in what is the most heavily bombed country on earth a country where people still face a daily danger from u s explosives dropped during the vietnam war more than 40 years ago but the obama visit which will include a summit with southeast asian leaders is not about the past but the future and whether the u s can remain an effective counterweight to china s ever expanding financial and military clout and while mr obama s pivot to asia remains at best a work in progress as his tenure winds down there are some signs that his hosts welcome the chance to hedge their bets between the superpower across the pacific and the emerging superpower on their doorstep see also obama putin agree to continue seeking deal on syria mr obama who travels to laos from the g 20 summit hosted by china in hangzhou will have bilateral meetings with lao president bounnhang vorachith who was promoted from the vice presidency in january when several other top leaders shifted prompting speculation that vientiane wants to ease away from financial dependence on beijing and revitalize traditional ties with hanoi if there is a shift mr obama would be happy to encourage it the u s strategic interest in laos is to see the country be able to exert a certain degree of strategic autonomy because you don t want to have something akin to the relationship between china and cambodia phuong nguyen analyst at the washington based center for strategic and international studies told the reuters news agency with u s vietnamese relations also warming in recent years the ill will and searing memories of the vietnam war including the bombing campaign that spread to laos and cambodia appear to be a distant memory see also obama pledges to help turkey after coup attempt gets no red carpeted stairs in china obama s diplomatic visit to vientiane certainly isn t the time nor the place to find value or fault in anything the usa did in laos said james mule parker in an interview mr parker 73 was a cia paramilitary case officer in laos from 1971 to 1973 and authored several books about his experiences in laos he fought alongside anti communist lao gen vang pao s thousands of ethnic hmong guerrillas plus the lao army and 4 000 u s special forces trained thai tiger soldiers against invading communist vietnamese that s ancient history mr parker said we have with this obama visit an opportunity to signal to the world our friendship and interest in an invigorated way ahead for our two countries if president obama and mr vorachith are able to put the past behind them the two may find some discomfort in discussing the issue of human rights rights groups are already pressuring mr obama to press the point as the first ever sitting u s president to visit laos president obama should recognize his voice will carry particular weight with his lao government hosts and he should use that leverage to demand laos stop behaving like a tin pot dictatorship and halt its systematic suppression of its people s rights said phil robertson asia division deputy director for new york based human rights watch laos is a one party dictatorship with a horrible human rights record where official impunity to abuse people is pretty much absolute it s a highly corrupt country where national resources are being sold off to unscrupulous investors just to line relevant government officials pockets mr robertson based in bangkok said in an interview last week asean summit in laos mr obama will meet with leaders from asean nations brunei cambodia indonesia laos malaysia myanmar philippines singapore thailand and vietnam many of those countries strongly backed by washington are locked in a territorial tug of war with china over control of the south china sea mr obama will also attend an east asia summit in laos along with china japan south korea australia and russia his china and laos trip almost certainly his last trip to asia before leaving office in january is part of the u s rebalance to asia and the pacific white house press secretary josh earnest said earlier this month one tricky diplomatic task facing mr obama in laos will be his first face to face meeting with outspoken new philippine president rodrigo duterte whose tough crackdown on drug dealers and conflicting signals on the longtime u s alliance have unnerved u s officials mr obama is certainly not going to pull any punches in raising well documented and relevant concerns in his meeting with mr duterte mr earnest said impoverished landlocked laos appears to be trying to leverage its geographical position to get the best possible investments and financial aid balancing its relations among foreign political and economic interests and working those rivalries it has a long land border with vietnam which lies squarely on the route for the new silk road trade strategy that is a pet project of chinese president xi jinping billions of dollars worth of recent chinese investment have poured in for construction projects real estate hotels shopping malls hydroelectric dams anti narcotics programs casinos the mining industry agriculture and other sectors the u s offers scant investment but provides millions of dollars of financing for anti opium crop projects clearance of its unexploded bombs child care education mekong waterway rehabilitation and other programs the pentagon s links with the lao military are negligible said murray hiebert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington the lao military has agreed to work with washington on some english language training for its soldiers but has not accepted the offer to send officers to u s staff colleges mr hiebert wrote in february while analysts perceive competition between china and the u s in laos a deeper role in vientiane s stance has been played by vietnam thanks to ties forged in blood during the vietnam war for many years after the war 40 000 vietnamese soldiers were stationed in laos and hanoi wielded influence over vientiane s foreign affairs defense and other policies thailand is also actively eyeing mountainous laos hydroelectric dams which could generate badly needed electricity for bangkok washington meanwhile helps clear unexploded ordnance uxo that remains from u s bombing raids during the war peppering the countryside and still killing laotian residents each year america has long been the biggest donor to the uxo sector in laos and has continued year on year to increase the amount of funding that it provides to ensure safe land release can take place and the victims of uxo accidents receive the support that they require simon rea country director for england based mines advisory group in laos which clears uxo said in an interview from 1964 to 1973 the u s dropped more than 2 million tons of ordnance on laos during 580 000 bombing missions equal to a planeload of bombs every 8 minutes 24 hours a day for 9 years making laos the most heavily bombed country per capita in history the washington based monitoring group legacies of war said in a statement up to a third of the bombs dropped did not explode leaving laos contaminated over 20 000 people have been killed or injured by uxo in laos since the bombing
