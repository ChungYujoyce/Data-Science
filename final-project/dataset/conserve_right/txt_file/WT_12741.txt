apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the looming 600 billion defense spending crisis required under last year s budget control act was delayed for two months under the compromise tax deal passed by congress this week under the new tax legislation the sequestration will kick in march 1 instead of slashing defense spending during the delay congress provided 24 billion in the legislation with half to be raised from taxes and half from cutting defense and nondefense spending this will give congress time to work on a balanced plan to end the sequester permanently through a combination of additional revenue and spending cuts in a balanced manner the white house said in a fact sheet top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches house armed services committee chairman howard p buck mckeon told reporters that the delay was better than nothing in a statement mr mckeon california republican said he supported the deal with reservations our troops have shouldered an unfairly large share of budget cuts to date in addition to the strains of combat he said rather than shield a wartime military from further reductions this deal leaves the force vulnerable to sequestration s devastating and arbitrary cuts and it leaves congress and the president with much work to do to end the crisis mr mckeon said president obama missed the chance to honor the promise made to u s troops and veterans when he said during the presidential campaign that sequestration would never take place every day of uncertainty over further reductions limits our ability to fight the war in afghanistan keep americans free from harm at home and prevent potential conflict abroad mr mckeon said the immediate impact of the compromise tax law is that the pentagon likely will have to produce two budgets for the white house office of management and budget one for sequestration and one for no sequestration a defense official said the pentagon has been planning for the across the board funding cuts since early december when the office of management and budget issued guidance on the matter to date we ve produced one budget for fiscal 2014 the official told inside the ring at this point the fiscal 2014 budget does not reflect sequestration the official said the pentagon is working with the budget office on guidance regarding the cuts no figures have been issued by the office on how much to cut for the 2014 budget the estimate for the last budget which was never passed was a cut of 9 4 percent or 52 3 billion so far the only comment from defense secretary leon e panetta on the crisis has been a memorandum sent to all pentagon employees warning that civilian furloughs could take place under sequestration the house armed services committee is planning hearings in the coming weeks with testimony from pentagon officials on how the massive defense cuts will be implemented china warships up ante growing tensions between china and its neighbors in asia over maritime disputes took an ominous turn this week with reports from china that new warships were added to chinese maritime patrol forces u s military intelligence agencies have been closely monitoring the chinese for just such an escalation according to a u s official on monday state run media outlets in china reported that the people s liberation army added two destroyers and nine other warships to its lightly armed maritime surveillance fleet a separate sea service that is under control of the communist party s central military commission tencent a major chinese news portal stated monday that the ships were transferred to alleviate the insufficiency of vessels used to protect maritime interests agence france presse reported from beijing the maritime surveillance team s power has been greatly strengthened and its capacity to execute missions sharply improved providing a fundamental guarantee for completing the currently arduous task to protect maritime interests wrote yu zhirong with beijing s research center for chinese marine development in another official press report tensions are especially high between china and japan over beijing s claims to the senkaku islands a group of uninhabited islets located between okinawa and taiwan that china is claiming as its territory the new liberal democratic party government in japan is expected to take a tougher posture toward chinese claims to the senkakus than its more liberal predecessor government the lack of chinese naval forces in disputes among japan the philippines vietnam and india was a key indicator of limited chinese assertiveness according to adm samuel j locklear iii commander of u s forces in the pacific adm locklear said during two speeches in washington last month that the disputes with china had not reached crisis levels so far because the forces involved were limited to coast guard level forces the four star admiral said it was important for all parties to avoid conflict and make sure we don t unnecessarily introduce war fighting apparatus into these decisions or these discussions adm locklear repeated the obama administration s position that washington doesn t take sides in the disputes even though the united states has a defense pact with japan that requires defending tokyo from a chinese attack the new chinese warships will operate in the east china sea where the dispute with japan is taking place and in the south china sea where beijing is claiming control over 90 percent of the sea and challenging claims by the philippines and vietnam n korean missile propaganda north korea on jan 1 published a new
