victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction receiving grant monies or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction as a writer i ve accompanied police officers out on patrol many times a good number of cops have told me that they disliked responding to calls of domestic disputes where they often encounter the aftermath of domestic violence the disputes often involve drugs and alcohol abuse and a backdrop of complicated family conflicts the cops told me that witnessing the suffering of the women and children saddens them and they feel anger toward the person who caused the pain it is often a struggle to remain professional i ve been told while accompanying the cops i ve seen the aftermath of domestic violence and i too was touched by the battered and traumatized women and children over the years i ve listened to a good number of police officers speak about their experiences of dealing with domestic violence the officers explained that domestic violence is one of the most common of all the crimes they encounter there are three times as many cases of reported domestic violence than reported rapes but only one out of ten are ever reported i recall one female sergeant telling me men are sometimes victims of assaults as well she added but it s likely they don t report it out of shame from being beaten by their wives battered women come in all races classes ages and educational and religious backgrounds the sergeant noted they are the wives of doctors lawyers government officials policemen and judges as well as unemployed men many of the women stay in a violent home because they are trapped by economic circumstances and there are very few places a woman with children can go to in an emergency women who are beaten often lose their confidence psychological abuse often accompanies physical abuse often an abusive husband threatens to find the woman if she leaves him and kill her and or the children and sadly in some cases this has happened no person should be subjected to the fear shame and humiliation that an abusive relationship produces and leaving these relationships is not easy the justice department said in a statement on this national domestic violence awareness month let us take the time to educate ourselves about how to support friends or family members who are fighting to free themselves from abuse and unite to give a voice to those who suffer in silence in an emergency victims of domestic violence should call 911 immediately victims can also call the national domestic violence hotline at 1 800 799 safe or visit www thehotline org paul davis covers crime espionage and
