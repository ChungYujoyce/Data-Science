rnia congressman says on sunday morning futures that he believes the investigation of the doj and fbi will ultimately need independent counsel this is a rush transcript from sunday morning futures april 1 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated maria bartiromo fox news channel host good easter sunday morning thanks for joining us some republicans say jeff sessions got it wrong by not naming a second special counsel is north korea or russia the bigger threat to u s security right now and just how much of your personal data is being sold out on facebook instagram and google among others good morning everyone i aposm maria bartiromo thanks for joining us here in apossunday morning futures apos the attorney general for now holding off on appointing a second special counsel looking into doj fbi and hillary clinton investigation but revealing a veteran federal prosecutor is reviewing allegations of wrong doing by all three house judiciary committee member darrell issa plus legal expert alan dershowitz and a former u s attorney bud cummins all on whether justice will be served both north korea and russia say that they can strike anywhere in the usa with a nuclear weapon but which is the bigger threat is washington faces a showdown with moscow plus a potential breakthrough with pyongyang general jack keane is here weighing in should you trust facebook to protect your personal information let alone your life the leak memos sparking a p r crisis this weekend at facebook all that as we look ahead on apossunday morning futures apos right now mixed reactions from lawmakers after attorney general jeff sessions says no for now to a second special counsel sessions instead putting u s attorney john huber of utah in charge of reviewing a range of concerns raised by republicans they includes fisa abuse the claims alleged unlawful dealings related to the clinton foundation and the uranium one controversy joining me right now to talk about all of that is congressman darrell issa he aposs a member of the house oversight house judiciary and foreign affairs committees this morning good to see you sir thank you so much for weighing in rep darrell issa r calif house judiciary committee good morning happy easter bartiromo happy easter to you your thoughts now on jeff sessions saying no not yet on a special counsel for a second special counsel issa well i think the speed with which he goes sort of to this methodical process we can all second guess but the fact that he is going through a process that could and likely will lead to some sort of outside investigator but at the same time going through and saying let aposs have the inspector general look at this for what in his jurisdiction let aposs bring a u s attorney who isn apost tainted by the previous items i think what he is doing is giving credibility to the fact that he is looking to the truth not quickly trying to jump to something to find scape goats he will in my opinion though end up with an outside entity that has to deal with some of the rotted activity of people still at the department of justice and the fbi bartiromo well i think they make a good point because the utah federal prosecutor can in fact seek indictments can bring charges something that michael horowitz in the i g aposs office can apost do issa exactly what michael horowitz has going for him is he aposs been before congress for decades complaining about some of the problems showing us some of the things wrong at department of justice including double standards for how they enforce harassment in the work place other things of that sort and so congress should give him the benefit of the doubt that he aposs going to turn over to if you will be the u s attorney anything that needs to be prosecuted and he will get answers or he will get an outside subpoena i have no doubt about it bartiromo well there aposs a lot to look at from the bias at the top of the fbi and the department of justice against donald trump to really handling the hillary clinton e mail investigation as a so called matter not a criminal investigation do you think that he is equipped to look independently at both of those two things issa i don apost think anyone or even a dozen people could look at all that was done wrong during the obama administration remember eric holder withheld documents lied to congress about what his involvement was and was the first attorney general first cabinet officer ever held and in contempt and he is actually you know still very actively part of the obama network he is one of the lead councils representing california and advising them on some of the absurd things they are doing so we are a long way from getting to the bottom of a lot of it bartiromo well it aposs true not just eric holder but now we aposre talking about new text messages that suggest a meeting at the white house of some sort where brennan was involved clapper was involved and here you have these two individuals on cnn umpteen times a day trashing this president even though they apparently know well they were well aware of what was going on in terms of this incredible bias and is creating a narrative that donald trump had anything to do with the russia meddling issa well perhaps the best way to hide initially their own involvement with russia was in fact to say look at trump look at trump but it is coming back to the there was only one passing of money that we can find to the russians and it was through the democratic national committee and hillary clinton bartiromo right exactly because they pay for the dossier which was used to wiretap carter page and the among others let me ask you this because there has been so much stonewalling do you actually have confidence that you are going to get the documents that have been requested your colleague and the chairman of the judiciary committee joined us two weeks ago and basically suggested he was about to send in subpoena for documents listen to this here aposs what he told us i want to ask about the fallout begin video clip bartiromo congressman let aposs be clear there 1 2 million documents you aposve only seen 3000 of them you aposve been stonewalled for five months rep bob goodlatte r va chairman house judiciary committee we have seen some documents we aposve see more than we saw from the obama administration justice department but we need more documents and we need them now and we need them unredacted by the way maria bartiromo if you keep getting stonewalled and you do not get these the documents are you going to subpoena these documents goodlatte well the answer is yes end video clip bartiromo and of course now we know that the subpoena has gone through the fbi has responded and christopher wray the director said he aposs going to double the amount of people who are coming up with these documents you laugh but you know the truth is i appreciate wray in responding and saying that he is doubling the efforts but if 27 people produce 3 000 documents in less five months do 54 people produce 6000 in the next six months i mean they need to get the documents issa here is the challenge that congress faces and we will leave aside who is in the white house these bureaucracies have gotten very used to using the aposwe have to look through them we had to reject them we have to decide what to get apos and so rather than saying ok we will agree on release later but we will let you look at all of the documents in their original forms that are appropriate they don apost do that and this is in fact probably the area which the constitution needs to be tested because whether it was benghazi or the fast and furious or the irs in every case these institutions these bureaucracies absolutely said we have to look at them first redact them first and decide what you get and then they used us a technique to drift and drag documents i mean it is been a close to a decade since brian terry was gunned down in arizona in the fast and furious case that eric holder was involved in and we still do not have the last of the documents cause we only learned a few weeks ago that eric holder and his justice department didn apost used word searches that would have gotten some of the documents we were asking for so yes we have to have a different system altogether and it is one of the challenges no president no administration wants to say yes we will look at the raw data and yet if you do not have the opportunity what ends up happening is you do not get any kind of real time investigation and the guilty get away they usually retire bartiromo right so is there anything that can be done to get them moving because i appreciate the spirit that christopher wray is showing us by doubling the number people but the point is to make this a priority and send the documents unredacted over to the committee issa exactly there aposs only one privilege that an attorney normally looks for and that is attorney client privilege and that generally doesn apost even exist within the document we ask for and there is only one other privilege of any significance and that is the question of was it communication related to the president covered by that constitutional decision by the court these documents being asked work cover neither of those in most cases what they aposre going to do is they aposre going to redact based on aposlaw enforcement sensitive apos this is a hogwash invention of the department of justice it needs to be ignored to be honest my chairman is a is a good man but he aposs been very slow to not only issue the subpoena but to start saying no we want to at least have in camera review of the documents in real time and if we can apost get that then we need to get into the court system not because it aposs president trump or president obama but because congress needs to have the authority to look at things in real time and right now there has been an elongation i aposll give you an example each of those investigations i mentioned you know benghazi irs and a fast and the furious they all took longer to get not done than it took from the day of the watergate break in to the resignation of richard nixon that aposs a difference in the time it takes to get discovery and that aposs what aposs changing the relationship that the american people object to where no one aposs accountable you know for better or worse nixon was held accountable in the matter of months not decades bartiromo right exactly right and at the end of the day for the irs there was really no there was no accountability i mean what ended up happening to people who targeted of those who they didn apost agree with nothing so you know and american the american people need to be able to trust their government their irs their cia their fbi and the incredible amount of bias here has been shown and now we actually know the next question is how high up does it go was president obama directing all of this issa i have no doubt that valerie jarrett the president were aware of what eric holder and others were doing you know eric holder told us he didn apost text he didn apost email and he said this in under oath and of course as we started getting documents we found out just the opposite he was very very closely directing it as a matter fact my favorite quote is on a t shirt now for my staff about issa and his idiot cronies he was he was very active and that aposs one of the challenges clapper lied to congress and eventually admitted that he been you know not candid but outright lied eric holder lied to congress none of these people had been held accountable for what is in fact a crime bartiromo these are felonies issa yes bartiromo congressman stay with this we got a lot to talk with you about from sanctuary cities in your state california to the fallout for facebook after this data mining scandal as a leak memo from a top executive shows the shocking length the company would go in the name of continued growth and making money congressman darrell issa returns after a short break to discuss all of that call me on twitter mariabartiromo sundayfutures let us know what you aposd like to hear from the congressman as well as alan dershowitz and bud cummins coming up stay with us we aposre looking ahead on apossunday morning futures apos this easter sunday commercial break bartiromo welcome back facebook ceo mark zuckerberg is reportedly planning to testify before congress his company under fire since the revelation of a political consulting firm improperly accessed the data of millions of users facebook aposs public image taking another hit with the release this weekend of a leaked 2016 memo where a top executive prioritizes the company aposs growth at any and all cost even if bullies or terrorists use the site to take human lives i am back with a congressman darrell issa talking about this and congressman i know you aposre a free market guy you were a businessman before becoming a congressman and you watch small government but learning what we have about facebook and about the incredible amount of power these technology companies have should there be better guardrails in place to protect user data issa well i think any time a company is essentially monetizing data there has to be a lot more protection for the consumer you know if you contrast apple and facebook apple has a strong tendency to believe in your privacy they for years all the way back when steve was running the company they instituted protections that are well publicized every employee knows it meaning they get it at all levels from top management down which is going to reduce the chances of your data being falsely used mark zuckerberg for better or worse formed this company by taking other people s data and if you will using it without their full permission and that culture seems to perpetuate itself all the way into a many multibillion dollar dynamo bartiromo yes i know but at this point what can you do what can be done in terms of technology companies and their use of data how can the public feel secure that in fact they aposre not selling their personal information i mean i did a documentary on google almost 10 years ago and it was we won an emmy on it because we reported that google would anonymize your searches after two years why why save my search results for two years that is mine i mean when people go on that search line you aposre putting in there your deepest secrets yousd aposre searching for things that you may not want anybody to know about why does google save them for two years issa well that was a fair question then and i think in the case of facebook in the fair question now is where is government appropriate if you will oversight and regulation and very much as a libertarian i would ask people there are two historic documents or laws that people are aware of most people agree with truth in lending which allows you to know what your real interest rate is and it makes it mandates that would be understandable so that you give consent and people kind of get that and then when we look at other consumer protections that we enjoy including you know protection from under hipaa protection from your healthcare information being used even by a doctor in any inappropriate way as a matter of fact the medical profession has to guard against the laws of that data in a uniquely more secure way so do people agree with the hipaa law the protection of healthcare yes do we believe in truth of lending yes so when we start looking at regulating these industries i think there are good bill whether of appropriate and necessary protections for the consumer that the consumer is going to want bartiromo yes i would imagine so really quick congressman before you go because it aposs your state california now you said orange county voting to go against the century city laws of california will that go anywhere what aposs your take on the current state of play there issa this fight both orange county at the sheriff level and san diego i aposm sorry escondido where the mayor is leading the fight these are examples where you have communities that want to protect their community and see the california laws that actually hurting them and so what was originally a fight with president trump trying to protect 49 states from one bad actor in california is now within the state that people do not want the criminals released in orange county they do not want them released in escondido but let aposs understand if you lease a criminal alien they can go anywhere so the only way to really protect america is at the federal level but i aposm really proud of a lot of the sheriffs who have stood up and said i aposm tired of california tying my hands bartiromo yes you are right it aposs absolutely true we aposll watch that it aposs very courageous congressman it aposs good to see you sir thank you so much issa thank you happy easter again bartiromo and to you congressman darrell issa how serious is the president about pulling the u s military out of syria aposvery soon apos general jack keane joins me on that as look ahead on apossunday morning futures apos back in a moment commercial break bartiromo welcome back president trump freezing more than 200 million of state department funds meant for recovery efforts in syria after two members of the u s led coalition fighting there were killed and after his off the cuff comment during speech in ohio this week that u s troops would be aposout of syria apos aposvery soon apos retired four star general jack keane he aposs chairman of the institute for the study of war he aposs also a fox news senior strategic analyst and general it aposs always a pleasure to see you thanks for joining us this morning jack keane fox news channel senior strategic analyst happy easter good to see you maria bartiromo we aposve spoken a lot the two of us about president obama pulling out of iraq too soon and triggering a lot of pain afterwards first talk to us about that was that one of the president aposs then president obama aposs biggest mistake in the mid east keane he had two major strategic failures one was pulling out of iraq and the consequences were isis that inaudible over the middle east it was absolutely a joke for radical islamist worldwide all of their recruiting went up and we all saw the horrible barbaric consequences of that president obama is accountable for that strategic failure the second was the nuclear deal that we talked about many times bartiromo that aposs right so those were his two major mistakes we aposll talk about the nuclear deal in a moment but first let aposs listen to the president trump in ohio this past week here aposs what he said general begin video clip donald trump president of the united states went knocking the hell out of isis we aposll coming out of syria like very soon let the other people take care of it now very soon very soon we are coming out we aposre going to have 100 percent of the caliphate as they call it sometimes referred to as land taken it all back quickly quickly but we aposre going to be coming out of there real soon they aposre going to get back to our country where we belong where we want to be end video clip bartiromo this concerns you general tell us why is he walking down the same road that president obama did when he pulled out of iraq to soon keane yes pretty much but even worse consequences yes i think you know the president gets advice from people who you know want to have the united states you know pull out of the world and come home and take care about people and grow our economy etc and certainly there aposs some truth to that but the united states is a global leader and the reality is the president went to riyadh last summer and stood there in front of 55 leaders and said i aposm going to stand with you against the number one strategic enemy the iranians i aposm going to stand with you to put down and drive out the radical islamists now if we pull out of syria what we got on hand and what i want the audience to understand is how we end a war is actually more important than how we began it you aposve got to not just win the conflict of the work maria you have to win the peace that follows after that and that aposs about stability and recovery as it pertains to isis and syria there aposs 3000 or so fighters still left between iraq and syria the leaders of isis are down in the euphrates river valley in the southeastern part of syria we aposve got to clean that up and even after we do that we have to help the region in syria there the eastern region stabilize itself and recover if we do not i guarantee you guarantee that isis will re emerge and it will be another jolt in the arm and the barbarism will start all over again the second thing that will happen is we will be turning syria over to the russians to the iranians and hezbollah and they will encroach on israel and it aposs a potential on the horizon between israel and hezbollah all of that is the potential of this and then there aposs this final thing which troubles me because president trump renewed the relationship between the united states on the sunni arabs to stand against the iranians and the radicals he has done that if he pulls out of syria he aposs doing the very same thing that obama has did letting our sunni arabs down it makes no sense to me bartiromo i assume the saudis would not would not like that at all so who is the bigger threat here russia keane russia is a major go ahead bartiromo or the mid east keane what russia is trying to do maria is they are trying to replace the united states as the most influential country that aposs outside the region in the middle easter they have a strategic foothold in the middle east like they aposve not had in the past and it aposs in syria and they aposre going to leverage this against our sunni arabs that is the reality they want they want geopolitical controlling influence why 55 percent of the world aposs economy still passes through the middle east bartiromo wow keane that is the reality of it bartiromo this is really keane and who influences that is major geopolitical influence in the world the united states cannot disengage we did not choose this civil war in syria that is for sure and we didn apost we contributed to isis being in syria that is also for sure we aposve got we aposve got to stay the course here and do what aposs right we aposre not talking about a lot of troops here maria bartiromo right well you make a lot of good points you just said 3000 troops right is that that aposs the number that we aposre talking about keane the enemy has 3000 we aposve got a couple thousand the other thing is we forget history we stayed in europe post world war ii post conflict for stability and recovery in germany in italy and japan we stayed in the korean war in south korea for the same reason we stayed bosnia and herzegovina for ten years after the conflict was over we won the peace in all of those conflicts and as a matter of fact in germany italy japan and korea we still have our troops there bartiromo that is right that aposs right that aposs a good point all right let me move on you aposre making so many important points this morning general let me move on to north korea the month of may is going to be really critical not do we only have a may 12th deadline for the iran deal which many people feel that if it aposs not fixed the president will not renew the u s participation in that iran deal but then you aposve got this north korea meeting the president will meet with kim jong un how extraordinary is it to you that you aposve got the north koreans meeting with south koreans then kim jong un taking a secret mysterious train to beijing to meet with president xi and now of course on the horizon is this deal to me with president trump in the month of may what are you expecting lay out what your positions for us keane well first of all the speed of which this diplomacy has moves has nothing short of remarkable and as largely due to one thing and that aposs the trump administration maximum pressure campaign and also put in the military option back on the table and i aposm hopeful this is this is real on the part of the north koreans and the chinese and it is not just a delaying tactic to advanced their technology which is what they aposve always done but when i think about the framework for this i think what will happen is the north koreans will come in there and they aposll want some concessions i suspect just for having the meeting because that aposs what they aposve done in the past we won apost buy into that they will also way we want to denuclearize the peninsula that aposs an interesting term that president xi and president kim uses bartiromo right keane and what they really mean by that is they want to not just take nukes out of north korea they want to take dissolve the alliance between south korea and the united states and remove the nuclear umbrella that the united states has to protect south korea and they also want to pull all of the u s troops out of south korea and then of course they want the sanctions to be removed that aposs kind of their negotiating points bartiromo general it aposs great to see you this morning thank you so much keane good talking to you maria bartiromo general jack keane joining us right there alan dershowitz and bud cummins on the decision not to appoint a special counsel next stay with us commercial break bartiromo welcome back the justice department dismissing republican calls for a special counsel in the fisa abuse investigation instead attorney general jeff sessions has revealed that he has appointed u s attorney for utah john huber to see if a second special counsel is necessary to determine if the fbi abuse its surveillance authority back in 2016 our panel right now to talk about this alan dershowitz a law professor emeritus at harvard law school and bud cummins is a former u s attorney for the eastern district of arkansas and partner at avenue strategies gentleman it aposs good to see you both thank you so much for joining us alan dershowitz law professor emeritus harvard law school thank you bud cummins former u s attorney eastern district of arkansas good morning bartiromo alan let me kick it off with you because you aposre happy with this decision you think this was the right call on jeff sessions dershowitz it should have been the call that was made when mueller was appointed we should never have seen the appointment of a special counsel as the first step first it should have been done within the justice department investigator general inspector general maybe office of professional responsibility maybe assign an existing career person to do it then let aposs see is evidence of criminal conduct we have to make sure we never confuse political sins with federal crimes and i think this is going about it at the right way in a calibrated step by step way i think it would have been look the answer to having one bad appointment of a special counsel is not to make a second bad appointment of a special counsel i aposm against the criminalization of political differences wither it aposs republicans trying to criminalize democrats or democrats trying to criminalize republicans bartiromo and of course bud the prosecutor can bring charges seek indictments and probably get results even quicker than a second special counsel would have cummins i think the last point the time element is it should not be ignored the appointment of the special counsel almost inherently adds a lot of time to these processes but i agree with the professor dershowitz this is exactly the right call by the attorney general what he aposs trying to do is restore credibility to the process and really i see no reason for the appointment of special counsel right now apparently he does not either and so he has appointed u s attorney john huber to evaluate it and make a report to him and see if he is missing something bartiromo but how can you make the american people who are looking for justice feel content in all of this look we know that there were two side by side investigations going on during the 2016 election one was on hillary clinton one was on donald trump they created this narrative that there would be collusion between trump and the russians we never saw any evidence of such a thing meanwhile hillary clinton with all her e mail and the scandal of having emails all over the place classified emails on anthony weiner aposs laptop for heaven aposs sake and that was just called aposcall it a matterxx apos not a criminal investigation is hillary clinton above the law alan dershowitz no of course no one is above the law but we do have absolute equality when it comes to republicans investigating democrats and democrats investigating republicans one reason that i suggested right from the beginning the appointment of a nonpartisan commission of inquiry to look into the whole election the election has real problems not who got elected not whether it had an influence on the election but the russian attempt to influence the election these are issues that should be investigated in a nonpartisan way what americans do not want to hear is one standard for the republicans one standard for the democrats that aposs what really creates problems of lack of credibility in the justice system bartiromo so assess robert mueller then because so far the charges that he has brought down well it was 13 russians ok we know that but then there was you know paul manafort the charges there are completely unrelated to what we are talking about in terms of potential collusion dershowitz look there are three categories of investigations going on it aposs important to keep them separately one investigating the president aposs constitutionally authorized act pardoning firing that clearly would create a constitutional conflict that we went there then there aposs the purely private acts of the president the allegations by women business allegations those it seems to me are beyond the scope for the special counsel and then there is the hybrid acts of collusion the emoluments but i think they haven apost failed i think they failed to really understand what a constitutional conflict we would have if a president were ever charged with a crime or with impeachable conduct for simply exercising his constitutional authority bartiromo well bud what about that i mean is there a larger plan here in place that the democrats want to take back the house have robert mueller come up with some charges and then give it to congress so that they can move to impeach president trump cummins yes it aposs all politics and the professor dershowitz called it criminalization of politics i call it the weaponization of politics this idea that we have to seek a criminal prosecutor on someone every time they aposre alleged to have committed some wrongdoing is wrongheaded and to do it in the special prosecutor process really compounds the problem because it takes away the secrecy and discretion that a typical investigation you know most of the time we investigate people when i was a prosecutor you did not know about it and they might not know about it until they were charged and sometimes there aposs a decision not to charge and that secrecy has protected their reputation because they don apost they deserve to not have all of their information dragged to the media during the course of investigation bartiromo i understand but don apost we already have evidence of wrongdoing on the democratic side i mean hillary clinton you know the clinton foundation got 145 million around the uranium sale selling 20 percent of the u s stockpile of uranium we know that there was you know grossly negligent approach to her e mail dershowitz but there aposs an enormous difference between political sins and crimes i would be just as much against the cries of lock her up lock her up as i was against bill clinton aposs impeachment we have to be neutral i do not want us to be criminalization whether it aposs directly against republicans or directed against democrats my friends do not understand that my liberal colleagues my colleagues do not understand that they think i aposve suddenly become a conservative republican supporter of trump i voted for hillary clinton i aposm trying my best just to have a neutral approach to criminal justice bartiromo and i aposm sure you aposre really doing a really good job at it but i know that already the conversation leaked between michael flynn and the russian ambassador leaking that was a felony we have evidence of felonies here guys that aposs what i aposm trying to understand how come we don apost see justice bud cummins well it aposs difficult because you know frankly i would hate to see the department of justice under the trump administration attempt to go prosecute hillary clinton for instance unless it was just a laydown clear cut violation because it would it would feed the narrative that it was all political professor dershowitz makes a good point perhaps we ought to explore a commission because what we really need is the truth we need to know if bribes were paid to the foundation because of her position of secretary of state and candidate for president we need to know what happened in some of these instances it aposs not necessarily imperative that hillary clinton sits in a jail cell dershowitz i completely i completely agree you know right now we have republican truth we have democrat truth we need to get to the nonpartisan truth we need to know what the russians actually did we need to know how to stop them from doing it we need to make sure that what happened with e mails never happens again we need to make sure that all of these sins are not repeated and the worst way to do it is in secrecy behind closed doors with a special counsel in front of a grand jury where we never learn anything bartiromo which is why robert mueller aposs investigation is continuing and people are questioning it gentleman stay with us we aposre going to take a short break and then continue this conversation as we look ahead on sunday morning futures we aposll be right back commercial break bartiromo and i aposm back with bud cummins and alan dershowitz you both agree that a second special counsel not a good idea what should the president do at this point dershowitz the president should under no circumstances testify about allegations concerning about his private sex life that aposs what clinton did he has walked into a perjury trap that aposs what got him impeached he should be preparing to defend himself against constitutionally authorized acts he should be preparing right now a big constitutional defense and he should try to testify as little as possible and as constrained a manner as possible bartiromo because the evidence is right in front of us but i mean when you look at the department of justice you believe they can handle all of these cases independently and you don apost you think with the people who have been fired that the cleanout has begun cummins well yes and i believe they have a tradition of operating in a neutral nonpartisan fashion apparently this has been a stumble with mccabe and his crew but they live on credibility when they come to drag your mom and your dad or your brother your sister often take them to jail you have to believe that their doing it because they believe that that person has committed a crime not for political reasons they have to restore their credibility that is what attorney general sessions is trying to do and i hope that the other two branches of government stay out of it i hope that they let him do his job bartiromo well i mean look even bob goodlatte chairman of the judiciary said this is a handful of people who were incredibly biased and who just wanted to abuse their power alan dershowitz well we have to make sure that the american restores the credibility of the justice there is no department more important to the credibility of america than the justice under law that objective justice for both sides we have we have begun to lose that and we have to restore it bartiromo you would think both sides of the aisle agree with that dershowitz in abstract they do but nobody wants justice with a political opponents that is the problem everybody wants justice for themselves and their perfectly happy to see the roles of the law stretched when it comes to their political opponents so they have to have one standard bartiromo really important conversation thank you both for your insights i appreciate it bud cummins alan dershowitz great to see you dershowitz thank you bartiromo thank you so much president trump is doubling down on his promise to build that wall he just sent out a new tweet this morning reacting to hot button issues how will this go over with voters ahead of the midterms our political panel is next stay with us as we look ahead on apossunday morning futures apos commercial break bartiromo welcome back president trump touting his infrastructure plan in a campaign style speech on thursday he renewed his vow to make good on one of his big campaign promises building the wall brad blakeman former deputy assistant to president george w bush is here along with ed rollins former white house adviser to president reagan and a fox news contributor time for the panel good to see you guys ed rollins fox news channel contributor thank you bartiromo the president on his infrastructure plan good idea rollins it aposs great idea it just wasn apost so very well the other day he aposs got to sell this plan because otherwise it aposs not going to happen congress is going to divide it up there aposs no there aposs no unanimity before today and it aposs a very very critical thing to get jobs going and i think he just has to knock it off inaudible he can apost be talking about syria he can apost be talking about north korea south korea when you aposre making infrastructure you have to talk about infrastructure bartiromo you are right because this is something that aposs needed but with all of the talk about no money perhaps i mean look at the spending omnibus 1 3 trillion where the republicans got their butts handed to them because it aposs too much spending where does the money come from and what about those people who push back and say no more spending brad blakeman former deputy assistant to president george w bush well it aposs not money that we want to spend it aposs money we need to spend some of the infrastructure goes back 100 years in our country we cannot continue to have infrastructure that is not maintained or rebuilt so we can be creative in the way we fund this i happen to think that president should announce maga bonds we should be investing bartiromo the make america great bond blakeman right spread and amortize the cost of the improvements although a life of improvement why are ed and i and you pay for an improvement that aposs going to last 50 years spread the wealth private partnerships with public private partnerships there are a lot of ways to fund it where the tax payer today is not going to put the bill bartiromo i like this idea by the way but the president says it aposs only 200 billion only 200 billion in federal funding the rest should come from the private sector rollins but the problem is ever since the interstate highway system we built 40 000 miles it was 80 20 80 percent federal so the states don apost have any money the cities don apost have any money and so you aposve got to get the private sector and you got to convince people that the federal government is really there for the long term and will basically speed up the process of getting these things built and that aposs very important bartiromo alright so this is on the agenda here ahead of the midterms i guess infrastructure possible phase two of the tax plan and possible regulation on opioids rollins i don apost i don apost think any of these is passed i think congress is done bartiromo nothing rollins i think they aposre basically bartiromo this congress is done rollins this congress is done i think they all got to start campaigning republicans are going to start looking at poles and they aposre going to see in trouble and so my sense is you aposve got to just keep pushing pushing and pushing bartiromo can they keep the house rollins it aposs a challenge bartiromo brad what do you think what aposs your prediction for the midterm blakeman it aposs going to be tough look since the civil war lost we know that historically we lost an average of about 33 house seats and two senate seats it aposs going to be very tough to defy history the good thing for republicans is democrats are defending many more seats than we are which means they got to spend a lot of money they don apost have bartiromo well look at what is going on right now in california with orange county saying wait california we do not agree with this blowing off federal law i mean there aposs all of this happening on the left i aposm wondering if this comes up during the midterms rollins well it should there aposs three or four seats in orange county area there are our seats that are competitive that should never be competitive but they are there aposs seven races in california that are competitive and are all republican so at the end of the day we have to get aggressive we can apost just sit there and let the democrats define us bartiromo new members in this administration john bolton larry kudlow getting ready to start how is the president doing right now rollins well he aposs got people that he aposs kind of comfortable with people who support his positions and i think that aposs very important bartiromo brad blakeman political professionals something he did not have with tillerson who is not neither political person or a government person i think now the president is getting his sea legs and he aposs getting competent professional political people to help him bartiromo so you like these changes you look rollins i do i like the changes he it aposs important that i think the president has now decided he know what he aposs doing in his job and he can do it bartiromo all right we will leave it there brad blakeman ed rollins it aposs always a pleasure gentleman rollins thank you blakeman thank you bartirom
