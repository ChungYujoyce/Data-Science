to enjoy all the benefits of our website those committed to the european project must avoid the pitfalls that led to brexit get the new statesman s morning call email there is a part of britain s political spectrum that has failed more than any other in recent years and i belong to it the keen pro europeans i live in berlin my family includes bearers of british italian and german passports and i am a committed believer in the european project hundreds of thousands of brits perhaps even a few million going by a recent british social attitudes survey showing that 15 per centof the country defines itself as european and 4 per centas european above other identities are in a similar position among us are those with european relatives close friends or other links and plenty of others who simply identify culturally with the european project had we been savvier we british europeans could have been a vanguard instead we failed and britain s exit from the eu is the result britain was there at the beginning after all my late and firmly anti brexit grandfather decorated with france s l gion d honneur was among the millions of british troops deployed across europe by the end of the war britain invested vast amounts of blood and treasure in the stabilisation of the continent i get my exercise these days by cycling around berlin s now plane less tempelhof airport the hub of the 1948 49 berlin airlift in which 101 lives including more brits than members of any other nationality were lost in the successful mission to keep west berlin alive and free the direct and logical product of those early attempts to rebuild europe would be the european economic community the prelude to today s eu and a mechanism to bind the continent together and steel it for whatever challenges were to come from its accession to the eec in 1973 britain provided brilliant officials most notably roy jenkins the president of the commission from 1977 to 1981 who dedicated their careers to that european ideal and while governments in london were rarely fully engaged they made their mark margaret thatcher helped to build the single market for example and tony blair helped to make europe more open and outward looking in the world googletag cmd push function googletag display 1x3 it is true that britain was always different an island nation a former imperial power untroubled by experiences of occupation or dictatorship an eccentric place with a unique experience of the war and a distinctive emotional make up as i argue in my cover essay in this week s new statesman but other members of the european project have their own complicated histories neuroses and traits too only britain has drifted from the union and ended up leaving it how that happened provides several lessons for all those on the continent who still believe in the european ideal and want to avoid further brexits the first lesson is not to be complacent britain s elite long took popular consent for eu membership for granted conservative leaders spent decades using europe as a sort of free kick deploying euroscepticism as a no consequences mechanism for demonstrating patriotism and right wing bona fides pro europeans in the tory party were long timid and keen to avoid the subject so too were many leading figures in labour tony blair s flirtation with genuine european leadership including british membership of the euro a move that might have strengthened britain and the eurozone alike was short lived before the party succumbed to gordon brown s realistic but in the long term fatal reluctance even to engage with the subject that helped pave the way to david cameron s 2013 commitment to a referendum and its realisation in 2016 so my first message to pro europeans across europe is stand up to the risk of disintegration however improbable it seems the second lesson is to make the positive case for europe we pro europeans were for too long on the defensive even before uk membership seemed at risk we justified the project with numbers about the immediate prospects for jobs and growth but we never had a big positive story to tell about the long term economic cultural social and geo strategic possibilities of being at the heart of europe britain has lost an empire and not yet found a role wrote dean acheson america s post war secretary of state with a concerted focus britain might easily have made its role the midwife of a more competitive more globally open and more relevant europe but the case was never made for such ambition and the country s role remains unclear so my second message to pro europeans across europe is be bold aim high and do not let yourself be cowed into a defensive position when you have a big positive story to tell the third and by far the most important lesson is to act more boldly to make europe a success britain s vote for brexit in june2016 took place with terrible timing back then the eurozone crisis was recent the migrant crisis of 2015 was even more recent european democracy seemed weak and unaccountable and china and america looked like fairly appealing partners all of this has changed in the interim the eurozone has recovered the migrant crisis has subsided albeit thanks to questionable eu deals with nearby states and both china and the us look more aggressive and authoritarian but none of those things are certain keeping europe attractive means solving its problems tackling the flaws in the euro and the european migration regime genuinely europeanising democratic debates and establishing a credible alternative european pole to china and the us these may seem like abstract long term nice to have goals here in berlin where the german elite potters along in its comfortably cautious way but they may soon turn out to be imperatives my third and final message to pro europeans is do not take your security and prosperity for granted britain is the cautionary tale with a few different turns of fate or strategy the country might have become the most constructive player in europe there are alternate universes a few flutters of butterfly wings from our own in which london worked closely with paris berlin and warsaw from the year 2000 or 2010 to push europe forward make it a credible counterpart to america and china and create a very different global landscape by 2020 but my political tribe the pro europeans let that prospect slip through our fingers we were complacent we were negative we were unambitious and we did not do enough to make europe more successful and now here we are hours at the time of writing from exiting the club altogether and regrets filling our minds britain may or may not make a success of brexit it may or may not return to the eu i file both outcomes in the possible but not probable drawer but the fact of my country s abandonment of the one institution capable of delivering the goal for which so many of its people have given their energies and in some cases lives a peaceful and prosperous europe of which britain is an influential player will always be a tragedy i know that my pro european friends elsewhere in the eu would feel the same way and so i urge the following on them pro europeans on the european continent britain is leaving but you can still learn from our experience dodge our mistakes and avoid finding yourselves in ten years in the same gut wrenching position we brits are in now on the verge of leaving an organisation to which we have committed so much so follow these lessons do not be complacent make the case for a capable and united europe even when it seems difficult and most of all throw your energies into making europe a success it may seem hard but writing as a british european on the eve of brexit it is worthwhile britain
