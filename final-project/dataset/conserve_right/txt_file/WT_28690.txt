relentless push to spur other members to pay more for the defense alliance mr trump who had a sometimes rocky relationship with nato in his first two years in office took a far more upbeat tone as representatives gathered in washington to mark the bloc s 70th anniversary in addition to the persistent funding shortfall mr trump has clashed at times with fellow nato leaders on the correct approach to russia and iran and coordinating international missions in syria and afghanistan tremendous progress has been made mr trump told reporters in an oval office meeting with mr stoltenberg who

poland greece estonia latvia and lithuania met that threshold in 2018 the u s leads the alliance by spending an estimated 3 39 of gdp on defense mr trump has often called on members such as germany which spends 1 23 to shoulder more of the burden germany honestly is not paying their fair share the president said we re paying for a big proportion of nato which is basically protecting europe at the same time they re taking advantage of us on trade despite running a budget surplus the government of german chancellor angela merkel has balked at major increases in the country s military ms merkel who has a strained relationship with mr trump says germany plans to meet only its own goal of 1 5 of gdp for defense by 2024 the president said tuesday that the threshold of 2 may have to go up

that he appreciates the u s support in confronting that situation but some european allies are nervous that ending a long standing ban on midrange tactical nuclear weapons will revive bitter fights of the 1980s over where the weapons will be based the disagreements badly strained the nato alliance the administration sees nato s broad top priority as countering russian aggression it s a threat to the alliance and to the united states i anticipate that all elements of the russian threat will be discussed the state department official said asked by reporters whether russia is a threat mr trump
