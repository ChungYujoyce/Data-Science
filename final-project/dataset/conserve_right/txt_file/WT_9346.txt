apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the head of human rights watch said tuesday the chinese government has not only constructed an orwellian high tech surveillance state at home but is using its growing economic clout to silence critics abroad kenneth roth accused china of carrying out the most intense attack on the global system for enforcing human rights since that system began to emerge in the mid 20th century he warned that if human rights aren t defended the world could face a dystopian future in which no one is beyond the reach of chinese censors and a global rights system so weakened that it can no longer serve as a check on government repression top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots sex at birth hungary bans people

in new york after being denied entry to hong kong where he had been scheduled to release the rights group s annual report it begins with his keynote essay entitled china s global threat to human rights chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said monday it is china s sovereignty to allow one s entry or not he indicated that human rights watch is among organizations that support and instigate anti china activists to engage in radical violent crimes and incite separatist activities hyping hong kong independence he added these organizations deserve sanctions and must pay a price u n spokesman stephane dujarric asked tuesday about roth s denial of entry to hong kong said in principle we support the rights and work of human rights defenders around the world chinese diplomat xing jisheng who attended the u n press launch spoke at the end calling the report very prejudicial saying it has fabrications and telling journalists we completely reject the content xing said the government has made every effort to advance human rights in china and any human rights report that doesn t mention that 700 million chinese people have escaped from poverty over the last 40 years fails to be balanced and neutral roth responded saying the report does mention the emancipation of the chinese people and asked what did we get wrong if there s something wrong we will change it in the essay roth said the chinese communist party is worried that permitting political freedom would jeopardize its grasp on power and is running scared of its own people the consequence under president xi jinping is china s most pervasive and brutal oppression in decades he said roth pointed to the closure of the modest opening that existed briefly in recent years for chinese people to express themselves civic groups shut down independent journalism gone online conversations curtailed ethnic and religious minorities facing severe persecution and severe challenges to hong kong s limited freedoms under one country two systems to avoid a global backlash against its surveillance internet censorship and oppression at home roth said the government is trying to undermine international institutions designed to protect human rights it is increasingly targeting critics of rights violations whether they represent a foreign government are part of an overseas company or university or join real or virtual avenues of public protest using its economic clout and influence and sometimes its veto in the u n security council roth said china has sought to block united nations measures to protect some of the world s most persecuted people he cited china s failure to support syrian civilians facing indiscriminate airstrikes by russian and syrian planes myanmar s rohingya muslims who faced murder rape and arson at the hands of myanmar s army yemen s civilians facing bombardment by a saudi led coalition or venezuelans suffering economic devastation due to the corrupt mismanagement of nicolas maduro human rights organizations say up to 1 million ethnic uighur muslims in china s western xinjiang region have been detained in camps where they are subjected to political indoctrination and pressured to give up their religion the associated press reported last year that some are forced to work in factories and tracked clothing made in one camp to an american sportswear company roth criticized u n secretary general antonio guterres saying despite the u n s central role in promoting human rights he has been unwilling to publicly demand an end to china s mass detention of turkic muslims while heaping praise on beijing s economic prowess and its belt and road infrastructure construction initiative for asia and beyond roth stressed that no other government is simultaneously detaining a million members of an ethnic minority for forced indoctrination and attacking anyone who dares to challenge its repression and while other governments commit serious human rights violations no other government flexes its political muscles with such vigor and determination to undermine the international human rights standards and institutions that could hold it to account he said roth said the report shows that china isn t the only threat to human rights pointing to serious violations by the warring parties in syria and yemen he also cited autocratic populists who come to power by demonizing minorities and retain it by attacking independent journalists judges and activists who try to provide checks and balances on their rule some leaders such as u s president donald trump indian prime minister narendra modi and brazilian president jair bolsonaro bridle at the same body of international human rights law that china undermines galvanizing their publics by shadow boxing with the globalists who dare suggest that governments everywhere should be bound by the same standards roth said he lamented that some governments that once could be counted on to sometimes defend human rights have largely abandoned the cause but even against this backdrop roth said china stands out the result for the human rights cause is a perfect storm a powerful centralized state a coterie of like minded rulers a void of leadership among countries that might have stood for human rights and a disappointing collection of democracies willing to sell the rope that is strangling the system of rights that they purport to uphold he said nonetheless roth said much can still be done to defend human rights worldwide from beijing s frontal attack he urged governments companies universities international institutions and others to stand with people in china and from china who are struggling to secure their rights roth said governments and international financial institutions should offer human rights respecting alternatives to china s no strings loans and development aid he said government should deliberately counter china s divide and conquer strategy for securing silence about its oppression and he said universities and companies should promote
