that in a moment but first the latest on two developing stories the release of an american citizen as part of a prisoner swap with iran and the deadly attack by a saudi military officer targeting americans at a u s naval base in florida national security correspondent jennifer griffin joins us now with the latest on both jennifer jennifer griffin fox news thank you chris u s officials not yet willing to call this terrorism overnight the navy released the victim aposs names all american joshua watson mohammed haitham and scott walters watson a recent naval academy graduate reported to flight school two weeks ago he saved many lives by telling first responders where the shooting took place after being shot several times the shooter a saudi royal air force officer one of 852 saudis being trained in the u s right now used a handgun with an extended magazine to target americans in the pensacola naval air station classroom the fbi is aware of anti american tweets posted on twitter under the shooter aposs name at least six saudis were detained near the attack site one is said to have been videotaping but not all the news involving the middle east was bad this weekend princeton grad student xiyue wang held captive by iran for over three years released in a prisoner exchange for an iranian scientist begin video clip donald trump yeah i think it was a great thing for iran i think it was great to show that we can do something it might have been a precursor as to what can be done end video clip jennifer griffin xiyue aposs wife hua explained to me earlier this year the impact of her husband being detained and held as a spy while doing research in tehran begin video clip jennifer griffin iran says that he aposs a spy hua qu yeah he is not a spy he aposs not a spy he

former fbi agent robert levinson remains missing the president indicating he is willing to talk to tehran the release of american prisoners perhaps a good first step chris chris wallace jennifer thank you and we aposll see you again later in the hour as i said key players in foreign policy and national security gather here each year for the reagan national defense forum earlier i sat down with the secretary of defense mark esper to discuss the threats to american security chris wallace secretary esper welcome back to fox news sunday defense secretary mark esper thanks chris good to be with you chris wallace let aposs start with that terrible shooting in pensacola we know at least one of the people that the saudi officer killed was a recent graduate of the us naval academy did he target americans mark esper well first of all it aposs a very tragic incident our condolences go out to the families of those who were killed and certainly those that were injured as well and so we just want to extend our heartfelt concerns for all of them with regard to your question i don apost know yet i think that aposs why it aposs important to allow the investigation to proceed to understand what exactly he was doing and why chris wallace but i mean it aposs a fact we know that three people were killed were they americans or not i think most people in the crosstalk mark esper my understanding is that they were americans that were killed that aposs my understanding chris wallace and do we have a sense whether he was going after america mark esper don apost know that yet that aposs why i think we need to let the investigation play out chris wallace there are reports that several saudis have been detained and that several of them had been filming the incident first of all is that true and there are some top unintelligible officials willing to say this was a terrorist plot mark esper so some were detained friends of his that were also on that base as i understand it and i also was told that some one or two were filming it what aposs unclear is were they filming it before it began or was it something where they picked up their phones and filmed it once they saw it unfolding that may be a distinction with or without a difference but again that aposs why i think we need to let the investigation play out chris wallace but i mean that would not be a normal response to film one of your colleagues who aposs shooting americans mark esper i don apost know i aposm not trying to pass a judgment on it at this point in time you know today people pull out their phones and film everything and anything that happens chris wallace more than 5 000 foreign nationals are in pentagon training programs are you going to review that entire program and are you going to try to find some better way to vet i understand hindsight aposs 2020 some better way to vet people foreigners who come into this country for this kind of training for any links to extremism mark esper sure well let me say one of the first things i did yesterday in the wake of this incident was i spoke to my deputy secretary the acting navy secretary and others to say i want to immediately make sure we put out an advisory to all of our bases installations and facilities and make sure we aposre taking all necessary precautions appropriate to the particular base to make sure our people are safe and secure that aposs number one number two i ask that we begin a review of what our screening procedures are with regard to foreign nationals coming to the united states my understanding is currently of course they aposre reviewed by department of state they aposre reviewed by department of homeland security and they aposre reviewed by us and i want to make sure that those procedures are full and sufficient now why is that important not just because of safety but overall these types of programs exchanges are very important to our national security we have something that our potential adversaries such as russia and china don apost have which is an elaborate system of alliances and partnerships and the ability to bring foreign students here to train with us to understand american culture is very important to us in building those long term relationships that keep us safer i will tell you during my time in the military i went to west point with kids from other countries i trained at the hellenic military academy in greece for a summer during my time in the army i trained with an officer from africa all those things helped us understand one another and build close partnerships and we need to continue that chris wallace so what you seem to be saying is yes if we need to vet better we aposre going to do it but we aposre not going to throw out those programs mark esper that aposs right chris wallace there are reports that the pentagon is working on a plan considering a plan to send 7 000 more u s troops to the middle east i understand the president has not decided on this yet but what would more u s troops help us do to counter the threat from iran mark esper well first of all i have no plans right now or orders to send 7 000 or 14 000 additional troops to the middle east but what i aposve said consistently certainly to congress and to others is that on a weekly basis daily basis we monitor what aposs happening in the persian gulf we watch what iran is doing to make sure we understand what their intentions are what i aposm trying to do in that theater are a few things number one reassure our allies such as the saudis and the uae and other countries in the region number two affirm the right of countries for freedom of navigation freedom of the seas and number three hold up the international rules based order so what i aposm trying to do from the defense department is deter iranian bad behavior if you aposll recall several months ago they were going after ships in the strait of hormuz they shot down one of our drones we aposve reached a point i think that we aposve deterred further iranian bad behavior but as we see iranian behavior or intentions changing i will change our force posture to maintain that deterrence chris wallace but you say that there are certain things that aren apost doing aren apost going after ships in the persian gulf they aren apost shooting down drones we sent in you sent in 14 000 more troops since may but the iranians continue to ship missiles around the area to iraq to yemen they have recently tested a new missile that apparently would have the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon what would more troops do could they deter that action and are you basically saying we aposre prepared to get into a shooting war with iran mark esper well what i aposve said publicly is we are prepared to respond if depending on what iran does and they need to understand that our restraint should not be interpreted as weakness we are prepared to defend ourselves and our friends and allies if necessary but you hit on two important things for 40 years now since the revolution iran aposs been engaged in a number of activities that have done nothing but undermine the entire region it aposs the malign behavior and any number of countries stretching from africa to afghanistan their missile program their nuclear program hostage taking all those are the things we want in a new and comprehensive agreement with them to get rid of what we want is iran to join and to become a normal nation a normal country chris wallace good luck with that mark esper well we have to do it i mean it aposs like i said they are their hands are in every type of country out there stirring things up lebanon saudi arabia syria yemen and we can go all across this region and talk about iranian bad behavior chris wallace we excuse me we are here at the reagan library and back in 1985 reagan laid out what was known as the reagan doctrine which was that the u s was going to support resistance movements around the world to counter soviet aggression in the last few months this president president trump has pulled u s troops out of northern syria abandoning our kurdish allies he aposs talking now about a peace deal with the taliban and pulling out of afghanistan when it comes to fighting isis when it comes to fighting the taliban isn apost what president trump is now doing the exact opposite of the reagan doctrine mark esper no not at all i mean let aposs look at those two situations we withdrew troops from the border with turkey because our longstanding allies 70 years was going in because of threats they had about terrorist activity coming into turkey and what we told them is you shouldn apost do this we worked hard to get them to not do that we tried to set up a safe zone but the end of day they were committed to doing that and we weren apost going to put our troops in the path chris wallace but my point without getting into a lot of the details is we seem to be pulling back from fighting terrorism where ronald reagan was leaning forward in terms of fighting soviet russia mark esper president reagan knew what the threat was the threat at the time was the ussr and what president trump knows is our long term challenges russia and really china and so the key you mentioned afghanistan we aposve been in that country for 18 19 years the only way forward is through a political agreement so if we can reach a political agreement between the taliban the current afghan government and us to ensure that afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists that aposs a good thing it also allows me us to free up troops to redeploy against those two other countries that we aposre most concerned about in the long term chris wallace all right we have a little bit of time left i want to do a lightning round quick questions and if possible quick answers about troubles unintelligible north korea aposs ambassador to the united nations now says that talks about denuclearization are off the table if they resume nuclear testing long range missile testing what will the u s do mark esper i aposm not going to comment on hypotheticals i will tell you this much my job is to make sure ensure that we are ready prepared to fight and win tonight if necessary i believe we are in a high state of readiness right now but my second task is to enable our diplomats and so those are things we do i work closely with secretary pompeo on these issues and we aposll see i think the talks are always open i aposve said secretary pompeo has said and certainly president trump has said we want to sit down we unintelligible want to have negotiations we want to reach the point where we have denuclearized north korea chris wallace president trump pardoned several members of the military who had either been convicted or were charged with war crimes he stopped an administrative review you said he aposs the commander in chief it aposs his call but as the secretary of defense are you worried that this undermines the military code of justice and may perhaps discourage other service members from reporting illegal or improper conduct mark esper no i don apost i aposm a big believer and supporter of the uniform code of military justice it aposs a very capable system our soldiers are well and soldiers sailors airmen marines are well trained on the laws of armed conflict and look the precedent that trump is not the first person to either pardon or commute somebody there aposs a long history of commanders in chief doing this it aposs their prerogative under the constitution chris wallace finally a couple of questions about impeachment when we last talked a couple of months ago you said you were going to do everything you could to comply with congressional subpoenas of records about the cut off the withholding of aid to ukraine but two days after our conversation the pentagon stonewalled congress didn apost release a single document are you comfortable with that as secretary of defense mark esper well what my general counsel had come forward with is that there were legal and technical issues related to the request that we simply couldn apost honor so that was the reason behind that chris wallace and but do you feel congress has a right to oversight and to be able to see documents from the pentagon about a program that was approved by congress mark esper well they do but provided it aposs done in the right and proper way and i think that was the issue again i think my reputation is pretty good in terms of being very transparent i like to communicate with members of congress but in this case there were my recollection is that there were technical and legal issues that prohibited us from doing exactly what was requested by the congress chris wallace finally you were the secretary of defense this past summer when a lot of these actions were going down with regard to ukraine did president trump ever explain to you tell you why he was holding up u s military aid to ukraine an ally that was and is in a current war with russia mark esper well look i aposm not going to get into that there aposs obviously an inquiry underway on capitol hill i came into this story if you will in late july is when i assumed office at that time chris wallace you aposd been acting as secretary earlier in july mark esper i had for a couple weeks and then i was out of the game for a couple weeks while we waited for my confirmation process i would say this much when i came onto the scene the three things we were looking at were this one is the was the aid necessary vital to the ukrainians in terms of defending against russia number two had ukraine addressed corruption and that was a congressional concern and number three were other countries in the region other allies and partners assisting them and given those three things we decide to support the provision of ukrainian aid at the end of the day the bottom line is most of that aid got out on time and at no time did it have any impact on united states national security chris wallace and you were never told about any political considerations mark esper i aposm not going to get into any of that again there is a congressional inquiry underway and i aposll leave that process unto itself chris wallace mr secretary thank you thank you so much for talking with us you aposve got a lot on your plate defending this country mark esper thank you very much chris wallace thank you so much for doing so chris wallace up next house impeachment investigators make their case to the judiciary committee tomorrow a big step of where democrats write articles of impeachment we aposll talk with congressman david cicilline a top democrat on that committee as fox news sunday continues from the air force one pavilion at the ronald reagan presidential library commercial break chris wallace it aposs a big week on capitol hill on monday house investigators present their evidence on impeachment at a hearing the white house has declined to take part in that same day the justice department aposs inspector general issues his report on how the fbi conducted the russia probe and the ig michael horowitz testifies two days later joining us now congressman david cicilline a top member of the house judiciary committee which would write articles of impeachment congressman democrats on the judiciary committee met this weekend is the plan at this point to vote out articles of impeachment against president trump by the end of this week rep david cicilline d r i well like i don apost think we know because i don apost think we know the timing of it but certainly the judiciary committee will hear from the intelligence committee counsel who will detail that the president of the united states attempted the coerce a foreign leader to interfere in an american presidential election to assist him in his reelection undermining the national security of the united states for his own benefit this is a classic example of an impeachable offense we know that from the scholars we listened to so we aposre going to receive the evidence carefully we aposre going to evaluate that evidence as it applies to the law that is set forth in the constitution and make a judgment about what articles of impeachment but the timetable i think is less clear chris wallace you talk about evidence will the committee focus just on the alleged offenses in terms of what the president did in ukraine or will you go back as some democrats are talking about to the mueller report and what it alleged about potential obstruction of justice by president trump in the russia investigation a subject which has not been discussed at all during the last few months really hasn apost been discussed at all since last july when robert mueller testified david cicilline well the judiciary committee has collected an enormous amount of evidence both in its own work and now of course in the receipt of a 300 page report from the intelligence committee i think it will demonstrate and does demonstrate a pattern of behavior by this president to seek foreign assistance in interfering in an american presidential election and then an effort to obstruct congress aposs review of those circumstances so we aposll look at all the material that we aposve collected all the evidence that has been generated and we aposll make a judgment but again the focus is on the president aposs misconduct the president of the united states asking a foreign government to interfere in an american presidential election this really is what our founders spoke about when they were speaking about impeachment about an abuse of power about using the power of the presidency to advance your own personal or political interests ahead of the national interest chris wallace but david cicilline this is and so i think again chris wallace congressman if you could just answer my question though david cicilline sure chris wallace if i may if you could just answer my question is it going to be just on ukraine or may you look back at the russia probe and potential obstruction of justice there david cicilline look i think all of the potential articles of impeachment are on the table that will be a decision that the judiciary committee makes in consultation with the chairs of the relevant committees and obviously with the leadership of the house but the judiciary committee will have all the evidence and will make a judgment and that the decision will be made by the committee at the appropriate time chris wallace as part of the intelligence committee aposs report earlier this week chairman adam schiff released phone logs of telephone calls between rudy giuliani or one of his associates with the chair rather the top republican the former chair of the house intel committee devin nunes and also with the reporter john solomon republicans are pushing back hard on what adam schiff did here they are begin video clip male speaker i aposve never seen a chairman of a committee abuse their subpoena power to go after other members of congress that they have political disagreements with or members of the press that they have political disagreements with that aposs over the line end video clip crosstalk chris wallace congressman was that the new if i may ask the question first david cicilline sure chris wallace is that the new standard that members of congress can subpoena phone records and then release them about members of congress in the other party or members of the media because that takes us into pretty dangerous territory david cicilline look the intelligence committee has the solemn responsibility of collecting evidence relevant to the impeachment inquiry all the evidence and they use lawful process to do that the real question is why is the republican ranking member of the intelligence committee engaged in the conversation with lev parnas and why is he participating in some way in the very subject matter of this inquiry that aposs the really alarming development and so the committee has the responsibility to collect all the evidence and to carefully evaluate it to use lawful process to do it and i wish my republican colleagues were as concerned about evidence collection and what the evidence showed rather than the embarrassment to one of their colleagues chris wallace but you know let aposs laughs once you open this door everybody is going to go through it so when the republicans are in the majority you have no problem with them subpoenaing your phone records david cicilline look chris wallace and finding out who you aposve been in touch with david cicilline i think it is important that a committee of jurisdiction collect all of the relevant evidence particularly when we aposre focused on something as deadly serious as an impeachment proceeding and this is a serious proceeding we have a responsibility to collect all the evidence whatever it is evaluate it apply the constitutional provisions and when you do that you understand that the president aposs continuing is really a continuous threat to our elections to the integrity of our democracy and we have to move forward with these proceedings no one gets you know runs for congress to impeach a president but we are faced with a very very serious set of misconduct by this president we have a responsibility to honor our oath of office to protect and defend the constitution we simply cannot allow this president or any president to invite foreign interference in our elections you know who gets to decide our elections the american people the citizens of this country not any foreign power that aposs what separates our great country from authoritarian countries all over the world chris wallace congressman some moderate democrats especially some who were elected in swing districts that donald trump carried in 2016 are talking openly about voting against impeachment if it gets to the house floor as a member of democratic house leadership are you sure that the democrats now have the 216 votes they would need to impeach this president david cicilline i think there is no question that the evidence that has been developed during the course of this investigation or this inquiry is overwhelming and uncontested that the president of the united states sought foreign interference to help in his reelection and compromised chris wallace congressman i aposm running out of time so i aposm going to interrupt you there i aposm not talking about the evidence i aposm talking about do you have the votes david cicilline i yeah sure i understand and i fully expect that the vast majority of the members of congress from the democratic caucus will accept that evidence and will move forward with articles of impeachment the real question is why is the party of ronald reagan that prevailed in the cold war willing to accept this kind of foreign interference in our elections chris wallace finally the inspector general michael horowitz issues his report tomorrow and on the russia probe and he reportedly finds that the fbi had adequate cause to pursue that investigation he apparently finds serious misconduct even perhaps criminal activity on the part of some lower level people but he says that the top leadership of the fbi and other agencies were not guided by political bias do you expect that to end the debate over whether or not the fbi was spying on the trump campaign in 2016 as attorney general barr contends david cicilline well you would hope that they would finally end this kind of silly claim that has been made repeatedly by the president and his allies the report is going to say the fbi was fully justified in its investigation of the trump campaign but sadly we have seen before that facts sometimes don apost matter that it they stand in the way of these arguments that they aposre making in an attempt to defend the president aposs grave misconduct so i hope it puts an end to it once and for all but we aposll have to see chris wallace congressman cicilline thank you thanks for your time david cicilline thanks for having me chris wallace and we aposll track developments in your committee this week thank you sir david cicilline thank you thank you chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our panel to discuss impeachment and the ig report as fox news sunday continues from the reagan presidential library in california commercial break chris wallace coming up nancy pelosi says democrats aren apost punching through when it comes to impeachment male speaker fast is not good for impeachment narrow fast impeachments have failed chris wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the showdown over timing coming up on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip donald trump i think adam schiff is a deranged human being i think he grew up with a complex for lots of reasons that are obvious i think he aposs a very sick man adam schiff we should care about this we must care about this and if we don apost care about this we can darn well be assured the president will be back at it doing this all over again end video clip chris wallace the attacks from president trump and intel committee chair adam schiff getting even rougher as house democrats near a final vote on impeachment and it aposs time now for our sunday group here at the reagan library gop strategist karl rove and once again fox news national security correspondent jennifer griffin well karl just as a pure political calculation at this point do house democrats run a greater risk going ahead with impeachment or suddenly deciding to back off karl rove well they aposre not going to back off they aposre going ahead and the real question is going to be how broad is the are the articles of impeachment going to be there aposs an argument going on in now inside the democratic party as to what they ought to indict him for and how broad it ought to be because the calculus is this 31 democrats sit in seats that donald trump audio missing strongly against impeachment and the impeachment issue stoking up republicans in districts that donald trump won four years ago and is likely to carry again chris wallace jen as part of the house intelligence committee report as i just discussed with congressman cicilline adam schiff the chairman released these phone logs of telephone calls between giuliani and one of his associates with the white house with republican congressman devin nunes with a reporter does that take us down a slippery slope jennifer griffin well it certainly seems to and if you listen to republican jim banks he aposs called on the judiciary committee to subpoena adam schiff aposs phone records lindsey graham has said that he will not do that he will not be going down that path but there is this sort of tit for tat the democrats say that they were not subpoenaing devin nunes apos phone records or a journalist aposs phone records john solomon they say that that was captured this metadata was captured chris wallace in other words they were jennifer griffin they were looking at something else chris wallace they were going after the records of giuliani or his associate jennifer griffin most likely lev parnas chris wallace and it turned out they were but i know but they didn apost have to release the phone records jennifer griffin they did not and that was their choice and that is what they aposre getting hammered for karl rove well also rudy giuliani is the president aposs lawyer what about you know confidential relationship between a client and his lawyer they went after rudy giuliani aposs phone records jennifer griffin but do we know it was his phone records and not lev parnas apos who has been indicated chris wallace well but we know that rudy giuliani they had called between rudy giuliani and the white house jennifer griffin they released them chris wallace also they didn apost get that through lev parnas anyway all right let aposs move to the other big story out this week the inspector general going to release his report michael horowitz who aposs been discussing or looking into this for a month and the reports are we aposll see the report the probe itself tomorrow is that the ig is going to say that yes there were some serious problems on the lower levels of the fbi they may have fiddled with a memo that was used as part of the warrant to get the fisa warrant the application to get the fisa warrant but that they aposre going to say that the basic probe of donald trump in 2016 his campaign was with due process had an appropriate basis and that the fbi leaders were not doing it with political bias if that aposs what comes out what does that do to all the conspiracy talk that we hear from the right jennifer griffin well i think it aposs going to be really difficult because the president has says he thinks this is going to be a blockbuster report i think he aposs going to be disappointed from what we aposve seen of the initial leaks of the drafts john durham he aposs been banking on he was the lawyer that barr chris wallace the u s attorney that jennifer griffin the u s chris wallace barr has jennifer griffin chosen to look into aspects of whether the there was a certain professor that was a u s intelligence asset supposedly they did not find that to be the case and so durham seems to be agreeing with horowitz and when horowitz makes his findings tomorrow that they were not spying on the trump campaign that they had a reason to open this fbi investigation i think the president will be disappointed you did mention this lower level lawyer at the fbi kevin clinesmith he aposs not going to come out looking very good they when he presented the fisa court information on carter page he did some sloppy things and they aposre going to have to re look at how those fisa applications are made chris wallace yeah just briefly one of the allegations had been that this professor joseph misfud who spoke to george this gets down a rabbit hole jennifer griffin laughs chris wallace george papadopoulos and said that the russians had dirt on hillary clinton the question was was he an honest person here or was he in fact a set up as some conservatives have suggested of american intelligence agencies and this was all kind of a conspiracy to go after donald trump and one horowitz didn apost find that and he also talked to this u s attorney who aposs investigating as a potential criminal case and he apparently didn apost find it either which brings us up karl to the fact that there are a lot of people from the president to the attorney general from republicans in congress to members of the conservative media who have all been pushing this conspiracy theory or this theory that this was all an attempt to take down donald trump if the ig who is considered a pretty straight shooter michael horowitz says jennifer griffin yeah chris wallace it aposs not true what happens karl rove well i think you need to look at horowitz as an interim report because he is constrained he cannot talk to people who are no longer in government services the inspector general he can only talk to people who are currently in government service so he can apost go out and talk to lisa page and compel her to testify peter strzok et cetera so i think this is interim but is it likely to undermine some of the nuttier conspiracy theories yes but i would say this john durham i think is going to be looking at maybe looking at a much different question which was was the fisa court that granted the authority to wiretap given the fulsome and full and complete information that the fisa court needs to have or were they playing fast and loose with the application for the wiretap which is an entirely different issue but we the ultimate authority in this is going to be durham who can compel testimony from people who are in government service and people who have left government service or were never in government service chris wallace we aposve got a little over a minute go ahead jennifer griffin but karl this horowitz interviewed 100 people a million pages of documents a five hundred page report i don apost think it aposs an interim report and i would also say that durham he will be looking at whether there aposs any evidence of a fisa court misuse or and that aposs where kevin clinesmith will not look good as an fbi chris wallace yeah but jennifer griffin lawyer but i think that durham in the end there is no evidence to suggest that that fisa court application was for carter page that was not the basis for the whole investigation karl rove well i get that i get that but that aposs why i say it aposs a different issue now i look when i say interim he can come to conclusions about a certain range of items where all you need to do is to talk to people who are currently in government service or examining documents that are about people who left but durham has a broader authority as a u s attorney in the special investigation where he can compel testimony from individuals who are no longer in government service and i think he aposs going to look at other things that horowitz can apost come to conclusion about chris wallace so in 20 seconds i get the sense that you there are probably going to be some republicans out there no matter what horowitz finds who are going to say ah we aposve got to wait for the durham report karl rove well and frankly they may not be interested about yeah everybody aposs going to a lot of people are going to say that but what aposs interesting is horowitz may resolve things that they aposre interested in durham may talk about things that they haven apost yet begun to focus on because they don apost fit into the conspiracy chris wallace so laughs it goes on karl rove it goes on chris wallace jen karl thank you both we aposll see you back in washington in what promises to be an intense week up next the u s faces threats from old rivals like russia and growing polarization here at home we aposll ask two national security experts about it when we return to the reagan presidential library in sima california commercial break begin video clip male speaker like ronald reagan president trump came into office with an unshakable vision for the foundation of american power peace through strength male speaker the unity of the country the unity of our allies is worth 10 battleships to us in a fight male speaker the strength of the united states of america lies in our alliances female speaker affirmative male speaker and our ability to work with others end video clip chris wallace just a sample of the top officials and foreign policy experts here at the reagan defense forum about the best strategy to confront threats to the u s earlier i sat down with michele flournoy former undersecretary of defense for policy and former democratic senator sam nunn now co chair of the nuclear threat initiative begin video clip chris wallace thank you both for talking with me senator nunn you received the reagan peace through strength award this weekend and in your speech you say that the threat of confrontation right now between the u s and russia is the greatest since the cuban missile crisis really former democratic senator sam nunn i think that aposs true we aposre not communicating as we did even during the cold war we have a confrontation with them with troops in the same proximity both in the middle east as well as in europe over ukraine we have a collapse of arms control we aposre hanging on with a couple of treaties but there aposs no real regulatory regime we have new technologies like cyber that could be used to basically spook or fool a command and control system of any country that has nuclear weapons as well as warning systems all of those things mean particularly new technologies we need to be communicating but the lines of communication are nowhere near as vigorous as they should be and when you consider u s and russia have 90 percent of the nuclear weapons and 90 percent of the nuclear materials there aposs an acute obligation for these two countries to talk even when we disagree chris wallace michele how seriously do you take the threat of confrontation confrontation between the u s and russia and president putin russian leader just said that he would like to extend the new start treaty before the end of the year it runs out in 2021 your thoughts about that should we take him up on it michele flournoy former undersecretary of defense for policy we should absolutely take him up on the offer to extend start the new start treaty basically provides the strategic framework to create some degree of predictability transparency stability in our nuclear relationships we don apost want to take the lid off that and get into an open competition with russia right now there are definitely issues that need to be solved in renegotiating a future treaty but let aposs keep the current one in place and then open up a new negotiation chris wallace senator nunn when you look at president trump aposs policies around the world what do you see of his that you think he aposs doing right and is there anything you see that you think he aposs doing wrong sam nunn i agree with him in terms of his initiative on north korea i wish there aposd been a game plan and still it needs to be developed to do a step by step process in terms of denuclearization there aposs got to be a win win here but opening with north korea i agree with i agree that he aposs helped increase defense resources i agree that he aposs helped spur the nato allies to do more but in terms of the overall the alliances have been in my view shaken very badly because we don apost have predictability from one day to the next our allies in europe our allies around the world don apost know what aposs going to come from president trump so that is a real weakness and the way he goes about things name calling and so forth it really takes its toll chris wallace michele same question what is president trump doing right in the area of foreign policy national security what aposs he doing wrong michele flournoy well i do think we needed to open our eyes to a more competitive situation with a rising china and i think there aposs been bipartisan support that aposs come along behind that i think the president has certainly supported the increase in defense spending and investment in future capabilities but i agree with senator nunn i think even if we aposre doing some of the right things day to day on our defense relationships and alliances overall we aposre seeing now people don apost know exactly what we stand for because our policies are not consistent we don apost seem to have a cohesive strategy we aposve become an unpredictable if not unreliable ally and so that creates a lot of uncertainty it tempts adversaries to test us to see where the limits are and it i think moves some of our allies to start hedging against the possibility that they can apost count on the united states of america chris wallace michele is there a big threat out there that you think all of us the politicians the media the foreign policy experts are not paying enough attention to michele flournoy i actually think a lot of people in washington understand the challenge of a rising china and the competitive threat that it will pose to us economically technologically from a security point of view even from an influence point of view but i don apost think that aposs understood widely or at least not in any kind of nuanced way i think there aposs a huge opportunity to explain this to the american people not to make china an enemy because you know we want to avoid that but to say look this is a competitive moment we as americans know how to compete let aposs invest in the drivers of our own success our research and development education 21st century technology and so forth so i think with the right leadership and vision you could actually get this country moving again in a much more competitive world chris wallace senator nunn i want to go back to something that you said in your speech you talk about peace through strength at home and one of the things you discuss is the lack of civility and that that is sort of undercutting the unity of the nation and its ability to confront threats how serious an issue do you think that is sam nunn oh i do think it is a serious issue i think when we aposre divided at home we do not have anything like the strength we would otherwise have abroad and i believe every american with that voice and that vote should insist on civility civility doesn apost mean you aposre going to agree it means you don apost demonize the other side and while you aposre disagreeing you recognize that we have to work together to have sensible policy democrats and republicans and independents are all in this together but many days in washington you would never know that so civility is absolutely essential in my view for governance and governance given all those changes in technology may be the most difficult problem we face in terms of the digital age we have many many challenges in governance and right now technology is far outrunning policy chris wallace do you see the push by house democrats for impeachment now as a sign of the breakdown in civility sam nunn well i aposm concerned about it i aposm concerned about the fact that the republicans and democrats are not coming together they aposre people have made up their mind long before the evidence has all been completed and if you aposre thinking about impeachment you have to ask yourself what happens if it goes to the senate if we don apost have republicans on board is it just going to wither away is there going to be any condemnation i think a serious option that ought to be considered in the house is censure censure can condemn the conduct without basically taking away the right of the american people to make the decision on who our leader should be chris wallace but i mean just to follow up on this when you talk to democrats they say no no way and the president no no way so it doesn apost seem like anybody wants to take that off ramp sam nunn well it aposs everybody is against it republicans are against democrats are against it the president is against it but i think the behavior a prima facie case we need to hear all the evidence but a prima facie case is there was a very bad mistake made here in terms of basically extorting a foreign country with appropriated funds that had already been passed to help in a military emergency in exchange for going after a political opponent that aposs a prima facie case and it seems to be that kind of behavior at least has to be condemned but i think censure ought to be looked at very carefully by everybody maybe the fact all parties are against it means it aposs the right way to go chris wallace peace through strength at home what a nice thing to talk and think about it at the reagan library senator nunn michele flournoy thank you both very much sam nunn thank you chris wallace up next our power player of the week one of the world aposs foremost experts on spies and the fascinating gadgets they use to steal secrets commercial break chris wallace if our setting here at the reagan library doesn apost take you back to the cold war our next guest will his life of spies and spycraft has taken him around the world on his own special mission here aposs our power player of the week begin video clip keith melton i aposve always been fascinated in not just what spies did but how they did it chris wallace keith melton is obsessed with spies and how they pull off their missions keith melton it would have been hidden beneath a gentleman aposs waistcoat we call it a detective camera chris wallace he spent decades hunting down spy gadgets amassing the world aposs largest private collection and becoming a historical advisor to u s intelligence agencies keith melton every artifact there is a story usually there aposs a trip often involved some strange country in the middle of the night using currencies and meeting someone at a parking lot at 2 00 a m and it aposs the tracking down that i find fascinating chris wallace melton has donated thousands of pieces to the international spy museum in washington giving visitors the backstory on how espionage shapes their world keith melton i believe it aposs essential that the american public understand the true role of what aposs spies do in our intelligence services and how they represent the first line of defense for the democracy chris wallace the museum reopened this summer in a 162 million building it features james bond aposs astin martin and interactive exhibits like raid team where visitors decide if they aposd make the call to raid what turned out to be osama bin laden aposs compound keith melton how confident are you in your analysis chris wallace well this is a hard one i aposll go i kind of know the ending here i aposll say i aposm highly confident but the centerpiece is melton aposs vast array of spy gadgets like this cia pen and camera keith melton you put it over a document you take a photograph and you smuggle it out and it was we call it the camera that won the cold war chris wallace and then there is this ax keith melton this was my white whale chris wallace melton spent 40 years tracking down one of the world aposs most famous murder weapons used by a soviet spy to kill leon trotsky a rival of the stalin regime keith melton he came up behind him with two hands and just as he was about to strike he closed his eyes and instead of hitting him in the back of the head he hit him in the side of the head chris wallace melton aposs passion took him to berlin after the wall fell the kgb headquarters is the soviet union dissolved when a regime collapses you see it as a buying opportunity keith melton during times of instability artifacts become available chris wallace what makes a good spy keith melton well the best spy is the one you aposve never heard of and information that is obtained that our adversaries don apost know is missing is far more valuable than that they realize has been stolen chris wallace now melton has a new white whale a small crossbow u s intelligence came up with dur
