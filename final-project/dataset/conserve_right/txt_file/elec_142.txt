bare knuckle battle boils down to about 10 key races in the final days the reality is we have 10 great candidates sen jerry moran r kan chairman of the national republican senatorial committee told fox news he added there apos s genuine concern about the direction the country has gone with president obama and his policies from alaska to iowa to louisiana candidates are locked in tight and tough battles with republicans needing a net total of six seats to take control of the senate and presuming they hold their house majority congress the obama factor has loomed large over the races as republicans methodically have tried to tie their rivals to the unpopular president but democrats have done what they can to make these races more about local issues justin barasky spokesman for the democratic senatorial campaign committee brushed off talk of democrats running away from obama unlike the republicans who like to nationalize their races our races are different and will be won on local issues he insisted click for more senate race coverage five days before the big day the map looks like this republicans need six seats and see three pickups as a virtual lock montana south dakota despite a recent scare in that state and west virginia from there republicans would need to win three of the following democrat held seats alaska arkansas colorado iowa louisiana and north carolina then there s the bonus state of new hampshire where republican scott brown has been closing the gap against sen jeanne shaheen republicans though might need to make additional gains in those states with three of their own seats being challenged in georgia kansas and kentucky the outcome continues to be anybody s guess and the possibility of runoffs in louisiana and georgia means the balance of power could be undetermined for weeks after election day the latest fox news poll points to a tight contest though republican voters were more enthusiastic than democrats indicating potentially higher turnout on the question of which party voters would prefer in control the numbers tightened likely voters said they want republicans to win control of the senate by 47 45 percent two weeks ago it was 47 43 percent it is difficult to make a direct connection between generic vote results and individual races but the individual races continue to blow back and forth a quinnipiac university poll on wednesday showed republican joni ernst ahead by 4 points in her iowa senate race against rep bruce braley in north carolina an elon university poll on thursday showed democratic sen kay hagan leading republican thom tillis by just as much though republicans have all the buzz democrats are using the final few days to try and prove everyone wrong blitzing key states with ad buys in the 11th hour hoping to shore up traditional black and women voters and relying on their tried and true digital and field networks getting their voters out to the polls experts agree that not all races will be won or lost on obama but his numbers have spooked enough candidates that he has not been much of a presence on the campaign trail he only just started to campaign vigorously for democrats but is sticking mostly to gubernatorial races democratic strategist dan gerstein said that while negative energy toward the president is a big factor intense hand to hand combat also matters at this stage it could be that one side has a really kickass mobilization field director which could have nothing to do with the fierce ideological struggle between the parties in washington he told

republican david perdue in a cnn opinion research poll released on friday an atlanta constitution poll released later that same day showed perdue up by 2 points the seat currently is held by retiring republican sen saxby chambliss meanwhile democrat alison lundergan grimes after some recent stumbles and questions over whether the party infrastructure was still behind her may be back in the game in her race against senate minority leader mitch mcconnell still mcconnell consistently holds the lead in polls he led by just a point in one survey earlier this month but widened that to 6 in the latest new york times cbs news poll one complication for republicans is in kansas where the democrat dropped out and the independent greg orman has since surged against sen pat roberts an oct 23 rasmussen

said significantly different than where this race was just a few weeks ago election oddsmakers still like the republicans chances number cruncher nate silver s fivethirtyeight blog gives republicans a 64 percent chance of winning the majority as of wednesday one of the most intense fights continues to play out in iowa between ernst and braley this one promises to be one of the most expensive races in 2014 the parties spent over a million each on their candidates in the seven days preceding oct 23 outside organizations also have thrown some 3 3 million in support of ernst during the same time period the most expensive race though remains the north carolina match up between tillis who is trying to unseat hagan the parties have spent over a million in the last week with the total price tag on the race estimated at over 100 million while republicans were getting nervous that former republican sen larry pressler now an independent might pull votes away from their candidate mike rounds in south dakota many still see the race as leaning republican the national republican senatorial committee released an internal poll on oct 22 that found rounds has a double digit lead over both pressler
