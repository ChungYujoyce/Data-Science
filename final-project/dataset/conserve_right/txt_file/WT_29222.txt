tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn here are excerpts from recent editorials in oklahoma newspapers the oklahoman aug 4 2019 oklahoma lawmakers look to tackle medicaid top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey since being named co chairman of a legislative working group that will study an oklahoma specific plan to expand health care coverage sen greg mccortney says he hasn t slept all that well he was joking or perhaps not the challenge ahead is significant and could wind up being for naught because of a looming state question that seeks to fully expand medicaid as many other states have done july 31 was the start of a 90 day window for backers of medicaid expansion to collect the 178 000 valid signatures needed to put the question before voters in november 2020 the potential state question seeks to amend the state constitution to expand medicaid to low income adults ages 18 to 65 whose income doesn t exceed 133 of the federal poverty level if approved it would expand coverage to at least 100 000 uninsured residents under the affordable care act states can add able bodied adults to their medicaid rolls with the feds paying 90 of the costs and the state paying the rest the potential cost to oklahoma has ranged from 150 million per year to 374 million annually proponents say expansion would improve oklahoma s poor health outcomes and help rural hospitals our concern about full scale expansion has been that the state s costs will only continue to rise as has happened in other states where the number of enrollees has far exceeded estimates gov kevin stitt opposes the proposed state question preferring an oklahoma plan crafting one will fall to mccortney r ada and rep marcus mcentire r duncan who will lead the working group that includes 18 legislators nine each from the house and senate and two representatives from stitt s office mccortney said the white house under president trump has been begging states to create good alternatives to expansion allowed under obamacare to me this is our moment he said mccortney would like to provide an incentive to those who will receive the insurance to make decisions that benefit them and the state we need to find ways that they have skin in the game where the er is no longer as good an option as going to your regular doctor he said in addition as with a bill he filed during the 2019 session mccortney would like to see the private market play a significant role in any state centric plan as opposed to government run health care if you can line those things up you can be significantly more successful than traditional medicaid expansion mccortney said this group has much heavy lifting ahead on a complicated subject about which passions run high meanwhile language in the proposed state question is such that if approved by voters it would supersede whatever the legislature comes up with thus we could be left with the legislature creating and approving a plan that works well for oklahoma and then having to hope that voters feel good enough about it that they reject the state question but without the former nothing else matters that is job one enid news eagle aug 5 2019 don t fall victim to latest scams hardly a week goes by without reports of some new scam designed to take money from good people whether by email social media phone or in person scammers seem to stay one step ahead in their quest to steal our money often these scams target the older generation we aren t sure why but maybe it s because they believe older people are more vulnerable or more trusting the older generation grew up in a time where as the old saying goes a man s word is his bond now the saying almost should be trust no one it s a shame it s reached this point but it s a way to avoid a lot of heartache and lost money we can offer a little advice government agencies like social security or the fbi as well as financial institutions aren t going to call you or email you and issue threats if you don t wire money send cash or put money on gift cards immediately if you get a call or email from a relative or friend who claims to be in trouble and needs

trump called monday for strong background checks for gun purchases we agree on saturday a 21 year old gunman opened fire in an el paso texas retail area killing least 22 and leaving two dozen injured hours later a 24 year old man killed nine people in dayton ohio both shooters used assault style rifles the motive in the dayton attack is unclear but the gunman in the el paso shooting left an online racist screed aimed at immigrants prior to his terror attack with his own immigration rhetoric blamed by his political opponents for creating an atmosphere for violence trump tried to change the discussion monday he blamed the media for contributing greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years and announced renewed backing of background checks background checks were part of a multipronged trump response to the mass shooting at marjorie stoneman douglas high school in parkland florida the 2018 initiative also included raising to 21 the age for assault style rifle sales and a ban on bump stocks most of that initiative fell by the wayside the victim of congressional inaction although the trump administration eventually banned bump stocks through bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives rules we supported background checks and raising the age for assault style rifle purchases in 2018 and do so still neither would unduly infringe on anyone s second amendment rights the texas gunman wouldn t have been able to buy his weapon legally if the purchase age were 21 we haven t seen anything to show that either shooter would have failed to pass a background check but the idea still has merit both crimes were horrifying in combination they are the sort of repugnant nightmares that should drive a nation to action except we ve seen it so many times before with so little impact how many savage days must our nat
