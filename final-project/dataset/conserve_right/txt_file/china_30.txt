as the number of confirmed cases of covid 19 rises quickly in the united states and in many other countries around the world the official number of new cases in china the source of the pandemic has fallen dramatically given the record of secrecy duplicity and coverup by the communist government of china there is little cause to take those official figures at anything close to face value nevertheless western media organizations the world health organization and the united nations have taken to referring to china s numbers as confirmed cases comparable to cases in other countries with more open societies and transparent governments giving the impression that china has largely conquered the virus the chinese government departmentresponsible for tracking statistics during the crisis is the national health commission of the people s republic of china the commission s website has been publishing daily updates since late january from the first report on january 25 the number of cases of the now named covid 19 virus skyrocketed from1 287to17 205in just over a week at that point according to the commission 189 583 people had been identified as having had close contact with infected patients on top of this the commission acknowledged on january 26 that more than 5 million people have left wuhan due to the spring festival and epidemic from all appearances the epidemic was poised to sweep the nation of 1 3 billion people exacerbated by the timing an annual festival thattypically generatesnearly 3 billion trips the largest annual human migration in the world against all odds however the national health commission of china a little more than six weeks later reportedno new domestically acquired cases attributing every new case as imported by those returning to china over the last half of march despite the massive dispersion of chinese citizens from the epicenter of the virus wuhan the commission has reported barely one new domestically acquired case per day while in mid march 683 281 people had been identified as having had close contact with infected patients with 9 144 are now under medical observation new cases remained a trickle despite compelling reasons for incredulity at china s official figures on march 16 the united nations published anarticletitled china shows covid 19 coronavirus can be stopped in its tracks the article is based on an interview with a who representative in the country dr gauden galea it is an epidemic that has been nipped as it was growing and stopped in its tracks this is very clear from the data that we have as well as the observations that we can see in society in general he told un news in beijing on saturday but based on the same article dr galea has been in beijing during the course of china s battle with covid 19 except for a quick trip to wuhan on january 21 22 before the city was even locked down and the outbreak was still muted the u n article goes on to say at the time there was no overwhelming demand on the health services though the situation had changed when chinese and international health experts conducted a joint mission a month later a joint mission indicating that the chinese government would have maintained its control over who s access to data and physical sites various media organizations have similarly relied on china s numbers for some pretty dramatic headlines on march 18 the new york times declared china hits a coronavirus milestone no new local infections while the article notes in passing that chinese officials initially concealed and mismanaged the outbreak it goes on to flatly assert that beijing s sledgehammer approach worked to quickly lower the number of infections axios headlineda similar report no new coronavirus cases in wuhan china where global pandemic began while nprwent with china reports no new domestic cases but battles coronavirus imported from abroad eight days later the times again based on china s confirmed numbers told the worldthat the u s now leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases while the article says that the times is engaged in a comprehensive effort to track the details of every confirmed case in the united states collecting information from federal state and local officials apparently the times applied considerably less rigor to acquire information on china on monday however came newsthat china s numbers have indeed been incomplete the wall street journal reported that china said more than 1 500 people who were infected with the virus but haven t shown symptoms weren t included in its national tally of confirmed cases while other countries are struggling to keep up with statistics on cases the change so late in china s experience with the virus raises further questions about china s transparency especially in light of some of the drastic measures the communist government took early on to hush up the extent and seriousness of the epidemic if the past is any indication the chinese government will continue to hide the true consequences of the covid 19 outbreak in that country as best it can but the media and international health authorities would do well to view any data coming out of china with a more skeptical eye photograph by noel celis afp getty images we sent an email to with a link to finish logging in the mega death questions would it have mattered if china reported accurately and who raised alarm bells sooner we have a leader with a cumulative 16 000 lies and counting since sworn in would his priority concerns have shifted say by feb 1st even if he shifted how many would have even believed him sorry we lost trust in everything we needed to see the deaths and the horrible extended suffocation with each death to start questioning the irony is we lost trust in everything around us at the most prosperous time in the history of mankind what does that say about human nature also at the height of prosperity most americans were just one pay check away from bankruptcy what does it say about our economic system with closed societies like this i would request more reporting on 2nd and 3rd order statistics for instance cell phone subscription rates have been getting some play on
