memorial to taiwan s former leader nonsense the shopkeeper snapped back he was a great historical figure a great man top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore some 32 years after his death the man who became synonymous with the island s split with mainland china has been thrust back into the political spotlight as taiwan s two main political parties seek an issue to galvanize public opinion before presidential elections next year to the opposition nationalist kuomintang kmt party whose original members gen chiang led to taiwan after they were driven from the mainland in 1949 by mao tse tung s communists he remains a symbol of eventual reunification the ruling democratic progressive party dpp of chen shui bian president of the republic of china taiwan draws much of its support from the people on the island for the arrival of ching and favors formal independence the party considers gen chiang a brutal dictator whose 25 years in power amounted to a reign of terror both parties presidential candidates nominally favor closer ties with beijing so in an attempt to seize the initiative and to the fury of the nationalists the government has hit on the idea of writing gen chiang out of history as a way of energizing its political base nowhere is the debate more polarized than at the blue roofed pagoda in the center of the capital taipei until a month ago the centerpiece of the chiang kai shek memorial park now the pagoda is the national taiwan democracy memorial hall festooned in scaffolding as workers set about removing every mention of gen chiang s name inside it is packed with chiang memorabilia including his bulletproof limousines and a model of his office with a mannequin of the old leader seated at his desk but now a rival exhibition is in the main hall featuring films of old military parades the shackles worn by political prisoners and an array of propaganda leaflets and previously banned texts all topped off with large banners that read

government were driven out by the communists in 1949 since the split beijing has insisted that taiwan is still part of china and has warned taipei that any attempt to declare full independence will result in military action despite regular saber rattling economic ties between the two are becoming closer now china hopes against the odds that taiwan will be encouraged by the example of hong kong which just celebrated 10 years of chinese rule to return to the fold china refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes taiwan the united nations switched its recognition in
