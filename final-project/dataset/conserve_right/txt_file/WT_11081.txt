beijing as a path to prosperity and influence probably never the agreement by president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping on a cease fire on tariffs postpones the threat of more disruption for china s exporters and their asian suppliers some economists said xi might be ready to negotiate in earnest still beijing gave no sign of a changed stance on technology ambitions that

to cancel its industry policies or major industry and technology development plans said economist cui fan of the university of international business and economics in beijing at his weekend meeting with xi in argentina trump agreed to postpone planned u s tariff hikes on chinese imports by 90 days while the two sides negotiate the 90 day clock starts january 1 xi revived promises to narrow china s multibillion dollar trade surplus with the united states by purchasing more american exports the outcome was as good as we could have expected the chairman of the american chamber of commerce in china william zarit said in a statement also late sunday trump said on twitter that beijing agreed to cut import duties on u s autos there was no chinese confirmation of the move which would have little impact on trade because most american vehicles sold in china are made here treasury secretary steven mnuchin told reporters at the white house monday that there was an an immediate focus on reducing auto tariffs though he did not provide details or timing asked if there was a specific agreement to remove the tariffs he said yes there was yet larry kudlow the top white house economic

throat but both leaders face a mix of economic nationalists free trade advocates and other conflicting forces at home the outcome wasn t the result of a significant change by china louis kuijs of oxford economics said in a report washington instead chose to see beijing s argument that it already is making changes in a more positive light one sign of how far apart the two sides are china s foreign minister announced in buenos aires that trump agreed to stop raising tariffs rather than that he promised a 90 day suspension wang yi failed to mention industrial policy or trump s demand that beijing make progress toward changing it or face renewed increases those omissions suggest beijing doesn t recognize how important those demands are to trump said nick marro of the economist intelligence unit as a result we expect trade hostilities to resume in 2019 marro said in a report trump imposed a tariff hike of 25 percent on 50 billion of chinese imports in july over complaints beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology trump hit an additional 200 billion of chinese goods with a 10 percent tariff that had been due to rise to 25 percent on jan 1 china

at renmin university in beijing cui put the odds of an agreement at higher than 50 percent but said he had no idea how long that might take the tariffs battle has overshadowed changes xi s government has announced this year while beijing retaliated for u s tariff hikes by imposing penalty charges on american soybeans autos and other goods it cut duties on factory machinery and other imports from other countries the government also has promised to ease limits on foreign ownership of automakers insurance ventures and other companies business groups have welcomed those changes but say they don t address more important complaints about a thicket of rules limiting access to china s finance logistics and other industries companies want a genuine response with measurable goals said kenneth jarrett the president of the american chamber of commerce in shanghai in an email a measure of progress will be whether beijing offers meaningful concessions on technology said hirson wright and
