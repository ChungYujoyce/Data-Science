apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic india s economy has long labored in the shadow of its great asian rival but now officials in new delhi and private economists say beijing s recent stumbles could provide a big opportunity for india to close the gap while china s stock markets have tanked amid mounting reports of slowing growth india is poised to steal the mantle as the world s fastest growing major economy while sidestepping many of the problems that face other emerging economies as china cools i see this as a great opportunity indian finance minister arun jaitley told the bbc last

percent growth rate mr jaitley said so the world needs other engines to carry the growth process and in a slowdown environment in the world an economy which can grow at 8 to 9 percent like india

brussels based economic think tank bruegel this week the pervasive global weakness ultimately does the greater harm especially because india is not competitive he added china has been the linchpin of
