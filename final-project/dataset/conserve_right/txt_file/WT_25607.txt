tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn new york ap feeling lost after donald trump won the u s presidential election sara bareilles found herself in a meditation class to help deal with the new american reality i felt like the world was on fire and i didn t have any tools to just cope with the idea that i was in a catastrophe she said it was just like apocalyptic for me the one thing she could do write songs top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick her emotions combined with navigating through an increasingly divided country led to her latest album amidst the chaos for me the thing that always stays the most important is to feel that i m being authentic and truthful in terms of what my messaging is bareilles said and i think i ve gotten less afraid chaos released last month marks her return to pop music after a nearly six year hiatus it follows 2013 s the blessed unrest which boasted the successful single brave and scored her a grammy nomination for album of the year during that gap she wrote music for and later starred in the broadway musical waitress she s earned two tony award nominations and released the theater album what s inside songs from waitress in 2015 bareilles said theater took over my whole life and she wanted to write music for herself again that s when she got in touch with iconic producer t bone burnett who has won 13 grammys and an oscar the algorithms may place her in more of a pop place with katy perry or something like that but as an artist as a songwriter she s much closer to dylan burnett said labeling chaos a political album however is fair and unfair it s filled with camouflaged love songs like no such thing and if i can t have you those are basically direct love songs to the obamas which i feel like at some point i m gonna get a cease and desist because i m such a fan girl bareilles said with a laugh i m a proud believer in their messaging and their leadership and their grace so i found that after the election i was really heartbroken i think a lot of people were but don t be confused chaos is not anti trump music as there are no mentions of the president by name on the project instead it features bareilles speaking out more than ever i m 39 now i turn 40 this year she said when i look back on my life i want to feel like i was outspoken for the things that really fall into my belief system and the causes and the people that i believe deserve advocacy i really want to be someone who speaks up for them she added with a sly smile if that s upsetting sorry not sorry the bareilles burnett combo has been decades in the making even if he was unaware he s been on my bucket list my whole life she said wrote letters to him when i was in my teens burnett helming the project gave her the opportunity to sit at a master s footsteps i had a little journal with me and there were so many bits of wisdom and every time t bone would say something it sounded like a freakin fortune cookie but what might be surprising to bareilles is that burnett 71 reciprocates the sentiment i look at her as a teacher as well he said i m almost twice as old as she is so i can understand how i could slip into a teacher role i ve certainly had a lot of experience she s a smart person and i have great respect for sara so much respect he said her song orpheus a tune about being fearless and hopeful in a chaotic world is one of the best songs i ve ever heard the confidence burnett stirred up gave bareilles who will launch a tour this fall the freedom to try things she had never accomplished before for instance her song saint honesty was recorded in one take burnett said love made it possible i just remember loving her and appreciating what she was doing he said and if you genuinely love the thing that you re doing and the people you re working with it s an easy job love is a concurrent theme pulsating through bareilles music while there are songs like armor birthed from her women s march participation and a safe place to land a collaboration with frequent trump critic john legend created when she and co writer lori mckenna saw footage of detained immigrant children last year it s still an album filled with stories from the heart love has always been my deepest motivator said bareilles who wrote the track poetry by dead men about her boyfriend i think that if there s any one message that i believe is worth sending it s that to love and be loved this is the greatest gift follow ap entertainment journalist gary gerard hamilton at http www
