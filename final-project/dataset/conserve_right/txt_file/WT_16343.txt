apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic at a time of maximum tension in the u s china relationship news of the arrest last weekend of a top chinese tech official in canada managed to set off multiple shock waves thursday threatening to buckle global stock markets and wipe out a big chunk of the recent wall street gains president trump is fond of trumpeting the arrest shines a harsh light on u s and allied concerns about chinese state backed corporate giants massively complicating a trade war truce just negotiated by mr trump and chinese president xi jinping virtually at the same moment mr trump and mr xi were working out their deal over dinner at the group of 20 nations summit in argentina saturday canadian officials were arresting meng wanzhou chief financial officer of huawei technologies co a crown jewel of china s burgeoning high tech industry at the request of u s officials top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ms meng who happens to be the daughter of the company s founder was reportedly being held on suspicion of violating u s sanctions against trading with iran the arrest angered the chinese government set off a furious burst of outraged nationalism on chinese social media and briefly sent the dow jones index down nearly 800 points on fears it could reignite the simmering trade war between the globe s two economic superpowers while chinese government spokesman stopped well short of declaring a trade deal off the fact that ms meng was being held because of the u s iran sanctions was a particular sore spot huawei a global leader in telecommunications and the world s second biggest smartphone manufacturer has long been a source of worry for the u s and its allies given its close ties to the chinese government and china s military leaders the u s has moved to limit huawei s role in sensitive national security contracts and nations such as new zealand and australia recently banned the company from bidding on lucrative new 5g wireless communications networks contracts investors who staged a rally late in the trading day were whipsawed by a string of conflicting developments unsure how the trade and huawei arrest were related who had ordered what and whether the meng arrest would limit mr xi s maneuvering room to cut a deal canadian prime minister justin trudeau said thursday he had been aware of the pending arrest but denied his government had any involvement in the apprehension it occurred when ms meng transferred flights at vancouver airport at the white house national security adviser john bolton said that the justice department had informed him of its plans for ms meng but added that he was unsure if mr trump knew of the operation before it occurred these kinds of things happen with some frequency mr bolton said in an interview with national public radio we certainly don t inform the president on every one of them chinese officials meanwhile said thursday ms meng broke no u s or canadian laws and demanded canada immediately correct the mistake and release her it was not clear why chinese officials waited until the story broke in the canadian press before lodging a public protest of ms meng s detention an opinion published in the global times a leading business paper known for reflecting the chinese communist party s foreign policy views accused washington of resorting to despicable hooliganism and maliciously picking holes in huawei through the u s legal system mr bolton refused to provide specifics on what the justice department was seeking in its extradition request and reports only offered the briefest details of an investigation launched earlier this year by the justice treasury and commerce departments into huawei activity that could have violated u s economic sanctions against iran more information is expected to emerge on friday in the eastern district of new york where a bail hearing has been scheduled for ms meng the trade conflict driven by mr trump s desire to push china to lower its trade barriers to american businesses appeared to be cooling after he and mr xi gathered on saturday night in buenos aires and declared the 90 day truce improving washington s hand despite u s denials of a linkage chinese analysts viewed ms meng s arrest as a calculated act by washington to improve its hand in the trade standoff liu weidong china u s affairs expert at the chinese academy of social sciences think tank in beijing predicted that the trump administration would use more legal measures against china during the 90 day truce we ll see more cases like this over the next three months he told the south china morning post hong kong s leading english language newspaper there will be more sanctioning of china s state owned enterprises and individuals to boost momentum on the u s side earlier this year the united states nearly drove huawei s biggest chinese rival zte corp out of business for selling equipment to north korea and iran in violation of u s sanctions according to the associated press president trump issued a reprieve after a personal appeal from mr xi zte got off with paying a 1 billion fine changing its board and management and agreeing to let american regulators monitor its operations but some u s analysts expressed skepticism that ms meng s arrest was part of a coordinated plan to exert pressure in the trade war david dollar a senior fellow and china scholar at the brookings institution said in an interview that he believed the move was what u s officials said it was a move to punish huawei for trading
