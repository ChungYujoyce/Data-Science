imagine hillary clinton s relief come wednesday morning when she no longer has to grovel before new hampshire s famously prickly primary electorate it means no credibility leapfrogging as in 2008 when following a third place humiliation in iowa she told a new hampshire debate audience i m running on 35 years of change or on thursday night in durham new hampshire with clinton repeatedly invoking the bin laden raid be it her hard work on behalf of president obama or her hard work post obama on the speech circuit about thursday night s democratic debate the only time hillary clinton and vermont sen bernie sanders will meet before tuesday s granite state primary some observations a damsel in distress eight years ago in new hampshire hillary s back was against the wall another decisive loss to barack obama and her campaign would come to an abrupt end we remember it now as the week in which hillary departed from her icier norm and shed a tear the question in 2016 is clinton s current position anything to cry about yes she ended up in a dead heat in iowa with sanders despite enjoying a 40 point lead there last summer new hampshire is problematic it s a 20 point deficit if this post iowa nbc news marist poll is to believed but sanders is no obama neither in his organizational skills or ability to build a majority coalition among democratic voters unlike 2008 when she was on the wrong side of history with a party and a nation looking to make a larger statement clinton needn t panic in the moment which begs this question about the candidate other than if and when she ll shed a tear between now and tuesday why can t she be herself as the clinton team ponders how to move on post new hampshire it might want to place a call to the past campaigns of mitt romney john mccain and bob dole all were presidential nominees in their 60 s or 70 s running a second in dole s case a third and final time as their party s establishment choices all made the tactical error of election year conversions to more ideological personae that rang hollow with their party s grassroots activists of course all three lost the same s true of hillary at present atop the democratic pyramid longer than americans have owned iphones she s a known quantify resume solid most likely a dealmaker like her husband should she get his former job yet her oft repeated i m a progressive who likes to get things done sounds too much like a catchphrase when stacked up against a 74 year old fervent socialist who says what he means and means what he says leninist though it may be from the debate s outset an edgy looking clinton was intense and intent on making the point that sanders 18 trillion wish list of expansive government is but pipe dream she s right of course but she s missing the point successful democratic presidential candidates thrive on personality and passion the party s most fabled standard bearers jfk bill clinton obama ran as optimists not scolds the sooner someone convinces clinton that it s time to shift from upbraid to upbeat and stop trying to beat up bernie the better her long term prospects bernie didn t burn her when the debate reached its big expected moment clinton and her goldman sachs honoraria on the heels of sanders s ad attacking goldman sachs economic impact bernie whiffed sanders didn t use clinton s willie sutton like defense of accepting 675 00 from goldman sachs for three speeches that s what they offered against her mnbc s rachel maddow had to bring it up as clinton repeatedly invoked unspecified hedge fund billionaires vested in her political demise sanders passed on any mention of clinton s son in law who is a hedge fund manager making a quick buck is a clinton family trait bill and hillary have amassed over 25 million in speaking fees since 2014 daughter chelsea earned 600 000 annually as an nbc news special correspondent by one estimate she made about 26 724 for each minute she appeared on air then again probably a sore subject at a msnbc run debate but it ties to a larger point that will haunt hillary come the general election as with the server controversy the clintons have a penchant for cutting corners offer strained justifications and live by a different set of standards and rules it s part of why voters struggle with hillary s trustworthiness yet sanders lacks the cutthroat skill to exploit it clinton s lucky a more adroit rival s not in this race what went missing bill clinton went largely unmentioned in the 90 minute debate in what may be a campaign first this election cycle america was spared any talk of donald trump trump wants a recount in iowa as do some democrats to its credit msnbc raised the topic though it should have been in the debate s opening moments not 80 minutes later msnbc missed the chance to press sanders on whether he ll endorse clinton should she prevail in 2009 clinton joined her former rival s administration is there a place for sanders in a hillary administration she dodged a question about making him a running mate but said sanders would be her first courtesy call should she become the nominee earlier this week gallup released this analysis finding that 20 u s states are red solidly or leaning republican versus only 14 blue democratic states in 2009 gallup painted 33 states blue and only five red as the two candidates argued over which one of them would be the more devoutly progressive after eight years of a decidedly liberal president the irony was front and center and to the left hillary or bernie will win this democratic battle meanwhile their party s
