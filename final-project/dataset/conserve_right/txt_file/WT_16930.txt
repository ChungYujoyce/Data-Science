of the military crackdown china had won admiration for the beijing olympics the previous year it was gearing up for its first global fair the shanghai expo and many were touting it as the economic engine to help pull the world out of the global financial crisis i felt like the world was betraying the idea of democracy giving in to china he said but we the chinese democracy activists want to carry on our own mission to finish the unfinished business in the last five years he has tried four times to go home to see his ailing parents kneel before them and beg for their forgiveness for their suffering even if he must do it within the walls of a prison but like many other dissidents he is not only wanted for arrest but prevented from returning his parents have been denied permission to visit him not being able to see the parents being able to step back on the country that you care so much about that is painful and that is harsh and unjust he said but my parents that i haven t seen so much have also brought me up to be a person who does the right thing and i know what i have done in 1989 was the right thing the right thing to do while some have spent the past quarter century in exile others have been consigned to a life under surveillance the reform minded communist party general secretary zhao ziyang who expressed sympathy for some student demands during the protests was accused of splitting the party and spent the last 16 years of his life under house arrest his aide bao tong was imprisoned for seven years since his release in 1996 he has lived under house arrest his moves observed his visitors screened by security services who sit at a desk in the lobby of his high rise apartment building a reporter from the associated press was followed into an elevator and stopped from going up to bao s floor but another managed to go up in a second elevator in the meantime in his apartment in western beijing with photos of zhao on the shelves and walls bao spoke of his disappointment as how despite the passing of 25 years it is as if time has stopped for china back then they feared the students and deployed tanks and guns against these students he said today they don t dare to tell this to the public they don t dare to tell the truth to the chinese people tell the whole world what really happened bao says at least 99 percent of the responsibility for deploying the army in 1989 lies with china s then leader deng xiaoping who died in 1997 i think deng took this decision because he wanted to safeguard one party rule and its governing of china said bao he feared the people would become the masters of this country and would leave the party out and then the party would not be able to continue being the master of china he has already passed away and his successors his heirs in the party still do not dare to point out and say deng xiaoping made a mistake he said wang nan 19 was about to finish high school out of curiosity he took his camera and joined groups of people who had occupied the square in the heart of beijing his mother zhang xianling spent days looking for him only to be told through unofficial channels that wang had been shot in the forehead by troops enforcing martial law medical students had tried to help him but couldn t get him to a hospital because the area was sealed off zhang was told her son died at 3 30 a m on june 4 near the great hall of the people the seat of china s ceremonial legislature she keeps his letters photos student card and library card in a box in her living room along with his death certificate and a photo taken by one of the medical students of his half buried plastic wrapped body she has never looked at the photo now she is a member of the tiananmen mothers a group that campaigns for the truth about the event to be revealed and for criminal and historical accountability and acts as a support network when a member falls ill every year zhang s freedom is restricted from the first weekend in april to the end of the june 4 anniversary to stop her from speaking out about the event sometimes police drive her to the cemetery to visit her son s grave to make sure no journalists or sympathizers accompany her the scars will be in my heart forever said zhang at her beijing home perhaps the way we commemorate this tragedy has changed before i used to cry and cry now i have no more tears i have become stronger but my determination has not faded and i will continue with my peaceful and rational quest to condemn the brutality of using violence to suppress the people we chinese people have suffered too much already a teenage soldier in the people s liberation army chen guang was assigned to clean up the protest site the morning after he later left the army to become an artist but his
