to enjoy all the benefits of our website in a world fraught with dangers and uncertainties there will be a flight to nationalistsolutions get the new statesman s morning call email in this epidemic i m hearing too many people say effectively this is a great opportunity for x when x is something they always wanted anyway actually it s not up until now we ve been viewing the coronavirus crisis through two lenses epidemiology and economics and both present grim pictures but the geopolitical dimension looks equally grim in the next four weeks we are likely to see the healthcare services of the uk the us and spain pushed to the same breaking point as italy s that is beyond socially acceptable levels of triage where people begin to die without treatment after that it is likely that the disease will beginto spread in poverty stricken countries of the global south while this will create the opportunity for all forms of human kindness and collaboration it will also open the door to several negative scenarios in the worst case scenario the global order falls apart security experts identify three fragile states that could collapse under the stress because their health and governance systems are already chaotic or dysfunctional iran syria and north korea of these as far as we know only iran has an urgent problem made worse by us sanctions and the reaction of the mullahs for whose response whauden s phrase the elderly rubbish dictators talk seems apt if north korea s governance systems were to be overwhelmed there is a ready and giant ally china who could intervene tohelp in syria already divided into turkish and russian spheres of interest there could bea route to stabilisation iran meanwhile is a regional superpower surrounded by politically and religiously hostile countries with an 81 million strong population already gripped by the spirit of revolt the fragility of these and other states would be manageable if the us were showing any semblance of the leadership role it has claimed for itself since the second world war but it is not it is instead scrambling its diplomatsto grab as much of the world s testing and ventilator capacity as possible an effort that will be redoubled once a vaccine is developed though donald trump won t admit it the us is now a supplicant to countries it has strong armed in the past in turn the us s lack of leadership

collaborative global order that prioritises human life prosperity and wellbeing at one level china is simply stepping into a vacuum leveraging its world beating manufacturing power to make amends for failing to contain the virus early on but uk security experts believe it is also consciously shaping the world that comes out of the epidemic both in terms of diplomatic influence and popularising its own governance model at this year s munich security conference the buzzword was westlessness the fear that in response to the success of authoritarian nationalist regimes in china and russia popular belief in democracy and human rights in western democracies is itself on the wane it s a threat felt most acutely in europe in march last year the european commission described china as simultaneously a partner an economic competitor and a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance if china s containment policy which could only have been enacted by an authoritarian state actually works while trump lets a million americans die for the sake of a stock market valuation millions of people across the world will draw political conclusions they will see that the west as a concept is disintegrating and that highly commercialised and atomised democratic societies cannot even protect themselves against a bat virus let alone benignly administrate the global order and that narrative is not being left to quietly mature in people s brains russian state tv this week told viewers that the eu had effectively collapsed showing images of razor wire and vehicle checkpoints according to a

presented as a form of foreign aggression while to english spanish arabic and italian audiences russian propaganda efforts focus primarily on conspiracy theories about global elites deliberately weaponising or exploiting the virus for their own ends says the report propaganda recorded on the european external action service database and traceable to russian influenced outlets includes that the virus started in latvia that it was created in a laboratory that it has been created as a pretext for western powers to save their economies by printing money that some americans had the virus in september and the us suppressed the news that liberalism created the coronavirus and that it is a biological weapon created by america to depopulate the world the aim as with all disinformation tactics is to exacerbate tensions that already exist to undermine people s trust in their own governments and their attachment to freedom of speech and human rights so as we move now into the decisive phase of fighting the virus with huge economic disruption combined with acute distress among families and communities we need to understand that all social and political elites are engaged in a battle
