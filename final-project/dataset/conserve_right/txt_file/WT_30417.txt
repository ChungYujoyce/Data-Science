r for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn rep adam schiff seems to run hot and cold on felix sater a former business associate of president trump who democrats at one point thought was the key to proving collusion between russia and mr trump s 2016 campaign lately mr schiff chairman of the house intelligence committee has been running hot again after months of publicly ignoring mr sater mr schiff in a fit of activity announced a hearing and then when mr sater was a no show the chairman issued a subpoena commanding him to appear top stories gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning the abrupt renewed focus on mr sater surprised republicans who wonder about the sudden urgency in getting testimony from a man who has testified to the committee before and participated in special counsel robert mueller s lengthy probe it doesn t make any sense to us rep john ratcliffe texas republican told the washington times we weren t sure why he was coming the last time we are not sure why it was rescheduled last time we are not sure why it was rescheduled this time or as republican rep rick crawford put it it s unusual to take an interest at this point mr sater was a key figure in working on the scuttled plans to build a trump tower in moscow the russian born real estate developer served as middleman between the trump organization and russian businessmen on the project along with mr trump s former personal lawyer michael cohen mr sater was supposed to be one of the people who could shed light on the leverage democrats suspected russia held over mr trump moments after cohen s testimony to the house oversight and reform committee in february mr schiff announced mr sater would testify publicly to his own panel in march it was supposed to be mr schiff s first open hearing since ascending to the chairmanship he pledged the committee was going to try to do as much as we can in the open with mr sater the hearing was pushed back because of scheduling conflicts then mr mueller submitted his report to the justice department and the entire trump russia narrative was rewritten several times over and mr sater seemed to slip in importance during a three hour hearing last month where russia s overtures to the trump campaign were debated the aborted trump tower deal was mentioned frequently mr sater s name was conspicuously absent however democrats insist they never lost interest what we are wrestling with is an issue of bandwidth mr schiff said after one of his public hearings on media manipulation and the 2020 election mr schiff calls the moscow trump tower project a counterintelligence nightmare that may or may not be criminal rep jim himes connecticut democrat said he still has more questions for mr sater i think it would be helpful for us to have a better understanding of his interactions during the campaign in particular with the russians he was sort of the link on trump tower moscow and i m not sure we have all the information on that he told the washington times but republicans scoffed at mr schiff s explanation backing off of mr sater is something adam schiff should be pressed on because he made a point of that in the proceedings we had with cohen mr crawford said for whatever reason i think democrats thought better of it i think the narrative changes day to day so what you hear from adam schiff today may not be what you hear from adam schiff tomorrow mr crawford also wondered why the democrats original plan to hold an open hearing has become a private hearing shielded from the public i think it s a little inconsistent he said mr sater skipped his appearance june 21 leaving mr schiff fuming in an email to the washington times on the evening before his scheduled testimony mr sater said he intended to testify and planned to make a statement after his testimony he didn t mention any health issues but that s what his attorney robert s wolf told the public in explaining his no show mr sater said in an interview with politico he took a powerful sedative because of his illness and slept through his alarm he did not respond to follow up questions from the washington times republicans on the committee questioned the need to subpoena someone who has said he is willing to talk and who has already talked with the special counsel mueller has done his thing i m not sure what they are after by talking with him said rep brad wenstrup ohio republican when asked what the democrats expected to hear from mr sater at this point mr wenstrup shrugged and said you got me several democrats on the committee declined to comment about the necessity of a subpoena a russian born brooklyn real estate developer and convicted felon mr sater is mentioned 104 times in the mueller report he is portrayed as a man eager to boost mr trump s presidential prospects through the trump tower deal buddy our boy can become president of the usa and we can engineer it mr sater wrote in a november 2015 email to cohen discussing the project it was also mr sater s idea to offer russian president vladimir putin a free penthouse in the moscow building saying other wealthy russians would pay a hefty price to live in the same building as their country s leader analysts say it s surprising democrats eager to hang mr trump s russian connections around his neck haven t pushed harder for mr sater given his ties to both while the mueller report talks about felix sater quite a bit and the issues laid out on him in the report are not a good look for the president ultimately the special counsel didn t find a indictable crime while at the same time key members of the committee including chairman schiff went from saying sater was critical to the whole inquiry to not forcing him to testify said jamil n jaffer former senior counsel for the intelligence committee and executive director of the national security institute at george mason university s antonin scalia law school that appears to be a significant change and the question is why mr jaffer continued this is important because at the end of the day if himes or schiff really wanted sater to testify they d be requiring his testimony that suggests they don t think he s as important or at least as impor
