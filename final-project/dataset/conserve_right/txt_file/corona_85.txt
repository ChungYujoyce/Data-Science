rating false numerous media outlets have reported that dr anthony fauci the head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and most prominent face on president donald trump s coronavirus task force contradicted secretary of state mike pompeo s claim that there is enormous evidence that the coronavirus outbreak originated in the wuhan institute of virology fauci s full comments can be found in an interview with national geographic numerous liberal media outlets have claimed with blaring headlines that fauci s comments contradict pompeo s for example q sure but what if scientists found the virus outside the lab brought it back and then it escaped a but that means it was in the wild to begin with that s why i don t get what they re talking about and why i don t spend a lot of time going in on this circular argument fauci does not dismiss or deny this theory nowhere in this answer does he indicate that he does not believe it or has evidence to contradict it what he does say is that it does not matter to him as a scientist who is trying to figure out how to defeat the virus whether the outbreak started in a wet market as a result of faulty lab procedures or anywhere else so he doesn t think about it or consider it googletag cmd push function googletag display div gpt ad in content 300x250 102 that is clearly not a denial or a contradiction or a statement that he does not believe the theory it is a statement that the question is outside his purview so he does not care other people of course might very well care whether negligent containment procedures led to the outbreak of the coronavirus and a full accounting of its origin might be important in shaping united states policy in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic but it is not surprising that fauci whose sole concern ought to be minimizing the public health impact of the pandemic would not care a statement of indifference however is not a denial or dismissal of the theory nor is it a statement that he does not believe it for these reasons the claim that fauci contradicted pompeo s claim is false
