apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic westerville ohio sen elizabeth warren got a first taste of what it is like to be the front runner on the debate stage tuesday when her rivals ganged up on her and questioned whether her tax the rich rhetoric was too punitive for an already polarized nation the more moderate 2020 democratic hopefuls took aim at ms warren s far left agenda and plans for a wealth tax to finance a host of new benefits from tuition free college to universal childcare we need to be focused on lifting people up and sometimes i think that sen warren is more focused on being punitive or putting some part of the country against the other said former rep beto o rourke of texas see also winners and losers from the democratic debate ms warren was baffled by his charge i am shocked at the notion that anyone thinks i am punitive she said the aggressive challenges to the massachusetts senator coupled with deferential treatment of former vice president joseph r biden underscored ms warren s new status as the leader in the race in going after ms warren the democrats clashed on familiar ground during the party s fourth primary debate including how far to go toward a government run medicare for all health care system see also 2020 democrats embrace trump impeachment mr biden batted away questions about his son hunter s sweetheart foreign business deals by saying in the democratic debate tuesday that president trump s corruption was the real issue the other top democratic presidential hopefuls cooperated giving mr biden a wide berth to avoid the questions of nepotism and corruption involving hunter biden instead they piled on in demonizing mr trump and trying to one up one another on how strongly they vouched for the constitutional necessity not just to impeach him but also remove him from office this is about trump s corruption that is what we should be focused on mr biden said what i think is so important is that we speak of how important it is to remove this man from office sen cory a booker of new jersey who is struggling in the polls came to mr biden s defense he said the only person enjoying watching mr biden answer for his son s lucrative overseas paydays was mr trump he should not have to defend himself said mr booker appearing as if he was auditioning for a spot on a biden ticket hunter biden s lucrative business deals in ukraine and china while his father was vice president now dog the elder mr biden s campaign his 600 000 a year job on the board of a ukrainian natural gas company is also at the center of the house democrats impeachment inquiry mr trump is accused of abusing his office when he asked the ukrainian president to investigate the bidens while going after ms warren in the party s fourth primary debate the democratic contenders often clashed on familiar ground such as how far to go toward a government run medicare for all health care system south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg took ms warren to task over her reluctance to say whether she will raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her medicare for all vision i have made clear what my principles are here and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hard working middle class families costs will go down ms warren said when asked directly whether her plan would lead to middle class tax increases mr buttigieg frequently took on a more forceful tone contrasting with past low key debate performances he is considered in the best position to the race to emerge as the more moderate alternative to ms warren should mr biden s campaign collapse turning to ms warren mr buttigieg said voters are fed up with elected leaders that are unwilling to answer yes or no questions pressing her to say whether she d raise taxes as sen bernard sanders admits will be necessary for medicare for all this is why people here in the midwest are so frustrated with washington in general and capitol hill in particular mr buttigieg said to ms warren your signature senator is to have a plan for everything except this entrepreneur andrew yang slammed her proposed wealth tax he warned that the idea failed when tried in other countries the problem is that it has been tried in germany france denmark sweden and all those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they projected he said if we can t learn from the failed experience of other countries what can we learn from the candidates found agreement on the impeachment question ms warren said house democrats impeachment push wasn t a distraction from the party s agenda sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics and i think that is the case with this impeachment inquiry she said mr sanders agreed and called mr trump the most corrupt president in the nation s history this is a president who is enriching himself while using the oval office to do that and that is outrageous mr sanders said while popular among democrats the impeachment question is not a slam dunk among all americans a quinnipiac poll this week showed that 46 of americans approve of impeachment and removal of mr trump compared to 48 who say he should not be impeached and removed from office shortly before the candidates joined in an impeachment frenzy on the debate stage house speaker nancy pelosi announced that the decision to launch an impeachment inquiry would not be put to a vote the announcement fueled republican criticism that the inquiry was an unfair partisan exercise mr biden and ms warren stood shoulder to shoulder at center stage on the campus of otterbein university flanked by 10 of their rivals in the largest primary debate in history the showdown was the first to play out since the house launched an official impeachment inquiry mr sanders of vermont suffered a heart attack and ms warren emerged as mr biden s top rival ms warren has been on the rise in polls sprinting past mr biden in iowa and new hampshire the two states that host the opening contests in february mr biden has struggled to match the appeal ms warren and mr sanders have with far left activists and he has trailed them and mr buttigieg in the latest fundraising reports fueling more doubt about his staying power and cutting into the initial belief that he is the most electable candidate mr biden meanwhile has become mr trump s top target after the bombshell whistleblower complaint accusing the president of using u s military assistance to pressure ukraine s president to investigate the business dealings of mr biden and his son hunter mr trump has spun the accusation into an attack against mr biden saying the democrat and his family are the corrupt ones and running with that message in attack ads hunter biden has tried to stop the bleeding by announcing he is leaving the board of a chinese private equity company and forgoing all foreign work if his father becomes president the former vice president says mr trump is afraid of facing him in the general election the showdown in the columbus suburbs was viewed as a make or break opportunity for some of the lower tier candidates the democratic national committee heightened the fundraising and polling thresholds to qualify for the fifth debate in georgia next month as of tuesday former housing and urban development secretary julian castro rep tulsi gabbard of hawaii sen amy klobuchar of minnesota and mr o rourke were in jeopardy of missing the cut the dnc is requiring candidates to get at least 5 in at least two approved polls in iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina or 3 in at least four national or early state polls the decision to hold tuesday s debate in the columbus suburbs fueled speculation over the role ohio will play in the 2020 election barack obama carried ohio in 2008 and 2012 and mr trump carried the state by 8 percentage points in 2016 over democrat hillary clinton the trump campaign meanwhile launched a pre emptive strike against the candidates by flying a 35 by 105 foot banner over the city that read in all capital letters socialism destroys ohio jobs vote trump while democrats will use the debate stage to paint a glamorous view of their socialist agenda team trump is here to expose the truth behind their job killing policies and remind ohioans what s at stake in 2020 said tim murta
