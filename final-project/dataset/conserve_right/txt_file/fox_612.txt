to enjoy all the benefits of our website the problem we are facing today is less oppression and more lack of identity apathy division and no trust says srdja popovic the serbian guru of political activism squint and 2019 seems to be a rerun of 1989 that iconic year that becamesynonymous with people powered revolution and the fall of the berlin wall then as now demonstrations have taken place on the streets in different countries in hong kong and prague santiago and beirut belgrade tbilisi and basra all clamouring for change but there is a crucial difference the protests we associate with 1989 seemed part of one clear historical narrative the battle of democracy against authoritarianism of open versus closed societies they appealed to a version of history where democracy would prevail today s protest movements don t coalesce this way while those in prague and chile have taken place in democracies the protests in hong kong have unfolded in a place where democracy is being rolled back common themes such as corruption and inequality reappear but they do not amount to a coherent ideology the demands of protestors are often local and tactical nor do they have a clear geopolitical aim when i met protestors in tbilisi georgia this past summer they expressed their desire to be part of europe but what does that mean exactly when rulers such as hungary s viktor orb n have learned how to be both inside and outside the eu remaining a member state while taking control of the country s judiciary and media i began to understand how the narrative of grand pro democracy protests had come undone when spending time with srdja popovic the serbian guru of political activism in 2017 as you read this popovic who is 46 might be in asia or latin america eastern europe or the middle east

2009 rose orange and green respectively popovic then tutored leaders in egypt tunisia and syria who would become the activists behind the arab spring protests between 2010 and 2011 for popovic these

democratisation and the failure of the arab spring a decade later undermined the notion that democratisation would be inevitable most importantly rulers themselves have become more flexible in adapting their ideology making it harder for protest movements to define what exactly they are opposed to and the alternative vision they want to promote the chinese communist party is not so communist any more the kremlin mixes overtures to soviet greatness with western reality tv shows and shopping when the leadership embraces different identities so slickly how is the opposition meant to find a space to project theirs the problem we are facing today is less oppression and more lack of identity apathy division and no trust says popovic there are more tools to change things than before but there s less will to do so popovic has remained indefatigable however anyone who attends one ofhis workshops will experience the sense that revolutionary change is imminent even if some of the lessons have changed over time sometimes popovic finds himself teaching his students not so much how to overturn authoritarian regimes but how to defend democracies increasingly he is asked to work in countries where democracy was considered until recently a political certainty popovic measures success not so much by how many regimes he has helped topple but how many activists have overcome apathy and are now able to build networks and coalitions it is perhaps these less immediately tangible factors that the various protest movements in 2019 have in common from china to latin america protesters are using digital tools to build coalitions governments meanwhile deploy cyber attacks to break them up though there is no single political vision unifying the protests they have a
