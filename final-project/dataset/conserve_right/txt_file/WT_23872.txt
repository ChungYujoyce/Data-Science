they ask for u s asylum will be detained or turned away but in recent months the number of families crossing into the u s has climbed to record highs pushing the system to the breaking point as a result the government is releasing families faster in greater numbers and at points farther removed from the border since dec 21 immigration and customs enforcement has set free more than 125 000 people who came into the u s as families customs and border protection is also overloaded and instead of holding families for up to 72 hours before turning them over to ice it has started releasing

immigration authorities have to drop off families by the busload at places not designed to take them in like the greyhound station in phoenix the bus company is no longer allowing anyone without a ticket to wait inside so immigrant families including little children stand outside until a volunteer can get them in touch with a relative to buy them a ticket that sometimes takes hours the federal
