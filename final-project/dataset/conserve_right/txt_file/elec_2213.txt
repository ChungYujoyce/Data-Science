msnbc s chris hayes attacked infowars alex jones and matt drudge merely for raising questions about hillary s health labeling the entire issue a baseless conspiracy hayes played a segment from our viral video claiming it was discredited because it had been slowed down before proceeding to play a sped up version of the clip after lambasting matt drudge for posting a photo of hillary being helped up some steps and drawing attention to her numerous falls hayes then castigated fox news claiming that sean hannity s medical panel did not agree with him that there were questions about hillary s health in reality dr marc siegel has repeatedly called for the release of clinton s medical history asserting only two days ago along with neurosurgeon dr ben carson that hillary s fall in 2012 could have caused brain damage that lead to long term problems with memory thinking dizziness and walking fox news dr david samadi also said yesterday that hillary s behavior suggests some kind of neurological issue a few days previously fox news featured neurologist dr fiona gupta who concurred with siegel that the release of the records was in the public interest and that clinton had a long history of unexplained falls that led to post concussive syndrome hayes failed to include any of this in his hit piece because it completely contradicts his baseless conspiracy that no medical experts think hillary has health problems the likes of neurologist dr daniel kassicieh and dr nicholas c bambakidis who have also shared concerns about hillary s health were not mention in hayes hit piece hayes also failed to mention the numerous secret service agents nypd officers and others who have said that hillary has major health problems with dizziness and walking difficulties his assertion that the entire controversy over hillary s health literally came from infowars is also completely inaccurate questions have been swirling since 2014 breitbart reported on them back in january which prominent medical expert did hayes feature on his show to authoritatively debunk suspicions about hillary s health charlie pierce a sports writer and a game show panelist well i m convinced pierce proceeded to trot out the usual ad hominems this is just nuts this is just completely crazy without having any actual evidence to refute the assertions made by medical experts and security professionals who oversaw hillary s events the majority of the american public also don t appear to think questions over hillary s health are a baseless conspiracy with a rasmussen poll finding that 59 of them want to see clinton s medical history sorry chris but having a game show panelist roll his eyes at questions shared by the clear majority of the american people isn t going to change this narrative subscribe on youtube follow on twitter follow prisonplanet cdata function d s id var js fjs d getelementsbytagname s 0 p http test d location http https if d getelementbyid id js d createelement s js id id js src p platform twitter com widgets js fjs parentnode insertbefore js fjs document script twitter wjs gt facebook https www facebook com paul j watson 71 paul joseph watson is the editor at large of infowars com and prison planet com save 40 to 60 off our best selling products during our memorial day super sale get the latest breaking news specials from alex jones and the infowars crew since lockdowns began have you broken the lockdown and or social distancing rules view results
