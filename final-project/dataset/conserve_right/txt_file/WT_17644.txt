apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic hong kong the tense u s chinese relationship is playing out on the olympic stage as accusations of doping and poor sportsmanship on both sides and a thirst to one up each other in medal count highlight the friction between the world s only superpower and its burgeoning asian rival forget the cold war this is the gold silver and bronze war while the two nations are in a close race for overall medals with the united states holding a 37 34 lead thursday the games themselves have taken an edgier turn with finger pointing and name calling which intensified after one chinese women s badminton doubles team was disqualified wednesday for throwing its match in order to draw a weaker rival in a later round top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time u s athletic heavyweights such as tennis star serena williams blasted the chinese for the dishonor they have brought on the olympic games no one wants to tank never never never in competition she said in hong kong a recent editorial in the sun tabloid charged that crushing the u s at the london games wouldn t be just a sports victory it would dispel all doubts that china has become a near equal to the u s in economic might the olympic bad blood is merely a backdrop to a larger issue as china tries to use the games as a platform to show that it has become a major player on the world stage a strategy that began with the 2008 games in beijing it s tied in with this story that the communist party is trying to tell china is developing and it s taking its place at the top and sport gets mixed up in that said daniel r hammond who lectures in chinese politics and society at the university of edinburgh in scotland there s an element there in how the chinese government views itself how it wants to be viewed internationally and the image it wants to project of a nation taking its place in the world he said a history of gamesmanship it s not the first time international politics and global tensions have dominated the games in 1936 adolf hitler attempted to use the berlin olympics to showcase nazi germany but u s track and field star jesse owens four gold medals undermined that effort disproving hitler s boasts of aryan superiority in front of the world the 1964 games in tokyo were a chance for japan to revel in the progress it had made since world war ii which devastated its economy perhaps the most famous victory in american olympic history was the u s hockey team s defeat of the soviets at the winter games in lake placid n y in 1980 that win has entered the sports and social lexicon as the miracle on ice a few months later the u s boycotted the summer games in moscow in retaliation for the soviet invasion of afghanistan the soviets followed suit four years later by refusing to take part in the los angeles summer games russia s olympic performance has waned considerably since the fall of the soviet union and its longtime rivalry with the u s largely has become an afterthought in 1988 soviet athletes led the board with 132 medals overall in the london games russians are placing 11th overall with 11 medals far below the hauls of competitors from the u s china japan and other nations the end of the u s soviet olympic animosity has opened the door for china which makes no bones about its desire to best the americans and chinese media have been fueling that fire for the longest time the u s has occupied an enviably insurmountable position in the olympic medal tally one that matches its superpower status the sun editorial says but since china re joined the olympic fray in the 1980s it has been scoring ever more medals in every successive game that also is emblematic of china s ever strengthening economy it goes without saying that in the london games all eyes will be on how china and the u s duke it out on the medal chart in recent years the chinese have closed the gap in the 2004 summer olympics in athens china took home 63 medals 40 fewer than the u s in 2008 china claimed 100 medals 10 fewer than the u s for chinese athletes an olympic victory would elevate them to rock star status especially if it comes at the expense of the united states athletes feel obliged to bring glory to both the country and their families said julie wang a senior international officer at leeds university in england who grew up in china after winning a medal especially a gold one they are secured almost for life both financially and socially trouble in the water with politics as the backdrop u s and chinese athletes have taken verbal jabs at each other the chinese were criticized after their top female swimmer 16 year old ye shiwen set the olympic record in the 400 meter individual medley shaving five seconds off the old record and swimming the last leg of the race faster than american male swimmer and gold medalist ryan lochte many observers most notably american john leonard executive director of the world swimming coaches association have speculated that ye s performance was too good to be true the one thing i will say is that history in our sport will tell you that every time we see something and i will put quotation marks around this unbelievable history shows us that it turns out later on there was doping involved he told british media mr leonard went on to compare ye s performance with that of east german athletes who were notorious for their use of steroids during the cold war as well as irish swimmer michelle smith now michelle de bruin who was caught in a doping scandal after the 1996 summer games in atlanta we want to be very careful about calling it doping he said the u s olympic team quickly distanced itself from his comments though pundits and analysts have shared his speculation ye called the accusations a case of sour grapes but said the american suspicions have tainted her victory they also have angered many in the chinese olympic delegation who have responded with tit for tat accusations leveled at the top u s performer michael phelps who this week became the most decorated olympian the sydney morning herald quoted china s former olympic doctor questioning phelps achievements and insinuating performance enhancing skullduggery dating back to mr phelps record breaking accomplishments at the beijing games the americans have made many extraordinary performances but without evidence we have kept silent said chen zhanghao who himself has been linked to doping chinese athletes i suspect phelps but without evidence i have to recognize that we should be grounded in facts mr leonard meanwhile has stuck to his insinuations telling yahoo sports if people don t speak out when they see something suspicious the public is going to think nonsensical splits were real then doping is going to have free reign for anything we don t know about right now it s an anomaly regardless of where it comes from take china s history completely out of it an anomaly needs to be pointed out and it s the only anomaly of the week it is not unusual for rivals to accuse one another without evidence of cheating but it is rare that they happen on nationalistic lines there is no evidence that ye has cheated but china s swim teams have failed drug tests in the past eleven swimmers failed steroid tests at the 1994 asian games in addition human growth hormone was found in one chinese swimmer s locker and four chinese athletes tested positive at the 1998 world championships since 1990 40 chinese swimmers have failed drug tests despite the u s chinese bitterness fans of the games in london seemed largely oblivious of the rivalry and many are taking pride in the impact of britain s olympic showcase i thought the opening ceremony was fantastic i m usually quite skepticalof opening ceremonies but this one was spectacular said patrick mcdaid an assistant manager at a shop in south london it was quirky enough for us brits and it really got people talking everyone seems to be in good spirits special
