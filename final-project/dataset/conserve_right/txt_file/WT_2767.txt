secretary rick perry was one of the survivors in president donald trump s cabinet avoiding scandals that have taken out higher profile figures by ellen knickmeyer and matthew daly associated press washington ap long after more flamboyant colleagues flamed out of president donald trump s favor amid ethics scandals low profile and folksy rick perry survived in the cabinet in part by steering clear of controversy until now the former texas governor said thursday he was quitting as energy secretary by year s end the announcement came as the house impeachment investigation highlighted his work in ukraine where he promoted u s natural gas and where trump hoped to find dirt on democratic rival joe biden trump said that perry one of his longest serving cabinet members had planned for months to leave but the timing of the announcement of perry s departure fits a trump pattern said governance expert kathryn dunn tenpas of the brookings institution her work shows there has been more turnover in trump s cabinet than under any president since at least ronald reagan the more important the issue is to the president the more likely you re on the chopping block tenpas said no evidence has emerged that perry explicitly pressured ukrainian officials to comply with trump s push to investigate a ukraine natural gas company where biden s son hunter was a board member it s a central part of the impeachment investigation perry an evangelical who takes part in weekly cabinet bible studies told a christian broadcast news outlet his month that god as my witness he never heard any administration figure specifically mention either biden in discussions about corruption investigations in ukraine perry did publicly pressure ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskiy for unspecified reforms in the energy sector however including in comments at zelenskiy s may inauguration that was one of several perry trips and meetings putting him in contact with ukraine and u s figures playing pivotal roles in the actions now being studied by the house committees investigating impeachment perry also was present for at least part of a white house meeting in july with then national security

to block members of his administration from testifying before lawmakers who are investigating whether trump used the powers of his office for personal political aims in ukraine the energy department on friday refused to comply with a house subpoena for perry a top state department official george kent has testified that the white house deputized perry ukraine envoy kurt volker and trump s

countries escape the political dominance that russia s control of the region s energy supply has helped give moscow perry s texas roots gave him ties with the oil and gas companies exporting to europe but there are no allegations that perry improperly arranged natural gas deals to benefit oil friends corruption in ukraine can make doing business there dodgy and ukraine lacks the giant natural gas terminals and other facilities to import much natural gas shipments directly energy experts say that s made it less of a targeted customer for western natural gas sales than for example poland poland has done much better economically than ukraine since the breakup of the soviet union enabling polish leaders to win favor with trump by buying u s warplanes and natural gas perry has acknowledged that he consulted on ukraine matters with trump s personal lawyer rudy giuliani giuliani served as one of trump s main back channel movers in the administration s 2020 related political efforts in ukraine in talks bypassing official u s government channels the u s has indicted associates of giuliani on allegations they illegally tried to funnel cash to republican politicians using a natural gas company
