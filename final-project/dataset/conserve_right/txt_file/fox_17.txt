hello again from fox news in washington two months into the coronavirus pandemic some 30 states are now easing their lockdown measures even as cases here pass the 1 1 million mark and health experts warn of a second wave but there is a new medical breakthrough the first drug that appears to help patients recover faster now cleared for use by the fda in a moment we aposll talk exclusively with dr deborah birx coordinator of the white house coronavirus task force but first let aposs bring in mark meredith with the latest on the patchwork reopening of this country mark mark meredith fox news correspondent chris protesters in several states continue to demand that governors loosen public health restrictions but some fear easing now may lead to a worse outbreak down the road begin videotape governor gretchen whitmer d michigan i know that people are itching to get back to work and i get it meredith michigan aposs governor is refusing to even as governors and many other states say now the time is to reopen governor ron desantis r florida opening the parks backup is consistent with my safe smart step by step plan to reopen florida meredith health officials had urged reopening only after reporting a 14 day decline in new cases but with outrage growing and job losses piling up many governors are charting their own path unidentified female cheers meredith in texas malls and restaurants are reopening with limited capacity unidentified male we aposre going to kind of slow down the operations a little bit and work with about 60 people meredith in pennsylvania golf courses are back open while in washington president trump says he aposs considering economic retaliation against china trump we aposre not happy obviously with what happened this is a bad situation meredith an australian newspaper reports the u s and its allies have intelligence china intentionally destroyed evidence tied to the outbreak and even silenced medical experts as the virus first began to spread end videotape meredith on friday the labor department will release the april jobs report white house officials say they expect the unemployment rate will skyrocket it aposs something president trump could talk about a little bit more when he gets back from camp david he aposs going to be coming back this afternoon for a fox news town hall later tonight chris wallace mark meredith reporting from the white house mark thank you joining us now dr deborah birx coordinator of the white house coronavirus task force doctor welcome to fox news sunday dr deborah birx coordinator white house coronavirus task force thank you wallace where are we with the virus are we past the peak are we on the downslope now and given that just a few days ago the white house was projecting 60 000 fatalities and we are already up to 66 000 how many more fatalities should we expect in this country birx well first let me start with our projections have always been between 100 000 and 240 000 american lives lost and that aposs with full mitigation and us learning from each other of how to social distance every single metro area and every single outbreak across the country is different and so whereas new orleans and now detroit and some of our other metros showing significant decline others are just reaching steady state we are encouraged that the new york and new jersey metro areas are starting to see a decline after a long flat curve wallace as we said about half the states more than half the states have started in some way shape or form reopening but we aposve crunched the numbers doctor and not a single state has met the white house gating guidelines of two weeks of steady decline in new cases are you concerned about this patchwork reopening and why leave it up the governors why not set a firm if not binding a firm national policy on when states can reopen birx well i think federal guidelines are a pretty firm policy of what we think is important from a public health standpoint we also made it possible for states to open counties independently of the entire state because again some of these outbreaks are very local and have to be studied and understood that way and so as states reopen we really want them to follow the gating criteria but we also made it very clear to the american people this is what you need to continue to do to protect yourself you need to continue to social distance you need to continue to practice scrupulous hand washing you need to know where your hands and where they have been and what they have touched and make sure you don apost touch your face and i think most importantly if you have any pre existing conditions through phase one and phase two of any reopening we have asked you to continue to shelter in place we know who aposs a particular risk for a very difficult course with this virus and we cannot emphasize enough how strongly we feel if you have a coexisting condition to continue to shelter in place wallace but clearly when you leave it up to individual governors and governors are not observing the two week decline before they open that sends a very mixed message to a lot of those individuals you aposre talking about appealing to i want to play something that dr anthony fauci your colleague on the task force said this week here it is begin video clip dr anthony fauci director national institute of allergy and infectious diseases we give the governors the opportunity to be very flexible but you have to have the core principles of the guidelines you can apost just leap over things and get into a situation where you aposre really tempting a rebound end video clip wallace do you share dr fauci aposs guidelines about this patchwork reopening that some governors some states are jumping the guidelines and risk a rebound birx we made it very clear that the guidelines are based on very strong evidence and data and that is the way dr fauci has also driven we want to make sure that every individual every employer and every person knows how to keep themselves safe in this situation we aposve made it clear what the gating criteria is and we aposve asked every governor because i know they aposre also concerned about every single person in their state we aposve asked every governor to post on their website and on a dashboard where exactly they are in the gating criteria but also to make all the information available to the public and to have sites sophisticated sites like florida does that many other like massachusetts does so people can see where the viruses in their community because an educated community can really take action to understand how to protect themselves wallace well let aposs talk about how educated some of the communities are i aposm going to do a lightning round quick questions quick answers about some of the activities that people are engaging in around the country first of all california where this past week thousands of people were massing on beaches in very close quarters simple question is that safe birx if it aposs done with social distancing yes if it aposs not done with social distancing no wallace well i don apost know that you can see the video there was no social distancing which was one of the reasons the governor shot those beaches all right let aposs talk about a different issue because we are seeing a lot of governors open up things like beauty salons and spas where people come into very close contact you aposre getting a haircut you aposre getting a massage with each other question if both sides both parties are wearing masks is that safe birx it aposs safer but we aposve made it clear that that is not a good phase one activity and i think the president has made that clear when he discussed the case in georgia wallace well you know that aposs happening all over the country right now let me ask about one more activity big crowds of protesters that went into the michigan state capitol without masks massing together in close quarters i aposm not asking you about their first amendment right to protest that of course they have but from a public health standpoint is that safe birx it aposs devastatingly worrisome to me personally because if they go home and infect their grandmother or their grandfather who has a comorbid condition and they have a serious or a very or an unfortunate outcome they will feel guilty for the rest of our lives so we need to protect each other at the same time we aposre voicing our discontent wallace let aposs talk about remdesivir the fda gave emergency approval to use of this drug to help people have the virus is it a silver bullet in terms of reducing lethality keeping people from dying and also in terms of side effects birx well first it aposs only half the data and the data safety monitoring board an independent group thought that the improvement was compelling enough and significantly enough to actually say that they couldn apost continue the trial as it was and the placebo arm had to receive the effective drug so it aposs a first step forward in parallel we have a whole series of therapeutics including plasma and also monoclonal antibodies being worked through we are we are concentrating on vaccines as well as therapeutic bridges to ensure that the american people and do well with this virus eventually we really want to ensure there aposs both therapeutic available and vaccines available rapidly wallace then there aposs operation warp speed which is the trump administration aposs effort to try to develop a vaccine by next january now you and dr fauci have talked sort of the rule of thumb is 12 months to 18 months that would be considerably shorter than that timetable next january is that realistic birx the way that it aposs possible is if you bring forward five or six different classes of candidates which the operation warp speed has done and so it aposs not relying on a single vaccine platform it aposs relying on several different candidates that are made differently and act differently and then it aposs about doing compressed phase one phase two phase three trials in an overlapping way moving forward when you have a good safety and immunogenicity data but not with the level of pauses that are often present in vaccine development and so on paper it aposs possible it aposs whether we can execute and execute around the globe because you also for phase three have to have active viral transmission in the community in order to study its efficacy wallace finally doctor and i aposve got about a minute left there is a new report out of australia this weekend that five intelligence agencies including the u s have put together a dossier that indicates that the chinese government in the early stages either hid or covered up the fact of the coronavirus and its spread in japan i aposm not going to ask you to comment in any way on intelligence but from a public health standpoint did the lack of transparency from china in the early days in january february even into march did that slowed on the public health response in this country birx wherever that first jump occurs whether it aposs from animal to human or lab to human it doesn apost really matter whoever wherever that happens you have to over communicate because that aposs because that aposs when you get the first instance of how transmittable this virus is what are the people that it aposs particularly susceptible to that didn apost happen and it didn apost happen until late and you know it didn apost happen until mid january that they even talked about human to human transmission and that really and when you see how many countries now are infected that did fan the virus across the globe wallace dr birx thank you thanks for your time during these very busy days and doctor please come back up next the white house social distance guidelines have now expired and most states are starting to lift their stay at home orders we aposll talk with two governors facing very different situations that aposs next commercial break wallace many states across the country are beginning to relax restrictions and get back to business while others are more cautious about lifting stay at home orders we want to discuss the patchwork of re openings in hard hit new jersey governor phil murphy but first to mississippi and governor tate reeves governor you already have gone from a stay at home order to a safer at home order and you were going to lift that lift up the restrictions even a little bit more on friday two days ago until you saw a new spike in cases in your state so where are you now in mississippi gov tate reeves r mississippi well thank you for having me on chris what i will tell you is we had a one day spike we went up to 392 cases that reported early friday morning we didn apost have time to analyze the data before we made the announcement and we are trying to be very cautious and so we said let aposs analyze the data over the weekend and what we have found is that it was really a data dump we got a large number of tests that came in from out of state private labs but we found is yesterday we reported 220 new cases this morning or later today we aposll report less than 110 new cases so it was a one day blip but we wanted to make sure we investigate that data before we make a final decision so we delayed it wallace i want to put up a number of new cases you aposve had over this past week because that aposs what the white house guidelines say you should look at and you aposll see that you went from 281 cases a week ago friday down to 183 and then back up pretty sharply even before you hit that 397 figure two days ago which raises the question what i was asking dr birx governor why are you reopening mississippi at all when you haven apost met the white house guidelines of a steady downward trajectory for two straight weeks reeves well that aposs a great question chris and it aposs a fair question and what i would tell you is that you have to understand that mississippi is different than new york and mississippi is different than new jersey in those two instances by the way my neighbor to the west was the same in louisiana they had a huge spike in cases over a very short period of time and then but mississippi is not like that what we have seen for the last 35 to 40 days we aposve been between 200 and 300 cases without a spike our hospital system is not stressed we have less than 100 people in our state owned ventilators and so as i talked to the president the vice president in the coronavirus task force i spoke personally with dr birx and we agree that sometimes the models are just different for different states just like they aposre different for various counties and we believe that that particular gating criteria just doesn apost work in states like ours who have never had more than 300 cases in any one day with the exception of friday and that data dump wallace governor we think of protests as something happening in blue democratic states but in fact last weekend you had a demonstration outside the governor aposs mansion in jackson mississippi people are demanding a total reopening as the republican governor of a red state what do you think of those protests and what do you say to those people reeves well i think a fundamental right of our government is to be able to protest our leaders and you know most of the people that were protesting voted for me last year we had election in 2019 and most of them were for me but you aposve got to understand chris we have a public health crisis in this country there aposs no doubt about it but we also have an economic crisis and so when i look at those protesters i know they were protesting for the 200 000 mississippians that have lost their jobs in the last six weeks we have an economic crisis in the short term we have a long term economic crisis that aposs going to be very difficult for this country and i understand and i feel their pain and we aposre doing everything in our power to get our state back open as soon as possible wallace you aposve also got a fight with your republican state controlled legislature i want to point out same party as you are the legislature which has voted to strip you of sole authority to spend the 1 billion plus in federal aid to your state that congress voted you have sole authority they voted to strip you they passed the bill first of all what are we to make of this controversy and secondly are you going to veto the bill and maintain sole authority reeves it aposs an absolute terrible tragedy that they have tried to do this particular power grab in the middle of an emergency we have had long standing 40 year laws in mississippi which recognized that in an emergency you aposve got to have an executive you aposve got to have someone that makes decisions and gets things done the monies in the cares act were sent to the states and sent to the governors so that we can get money out to our people we don apost have time for committee meetings we don apost have time for committee hearings we don apost have time for politicians to cut deals what we need in mississippi is to get that money in the pocket of the 200 000 mississippians who have lost their jobs i aposm terribly disappointed in our legislative leadership i think they made a huge mistake that was round one in this battle but we aposre going to continue fighting it because we aposre going to stand up for the people of this state wallace but just briefly are you going to veto the bill they passed reeves we aposre deciding what we aposre going to do right now we have a couple of days to do that and we aposll make a decision in the coming days wallace governor reeves thank you we wish you and the residents of your state of mississippi the very best during these tough times thank you governor now let aposs turn to new jersey and governor phil murphy governor new jersey is in a different situation obviously then mississippi you aposre under almost total lockdown this weekend you aposre reopening parks and some golf courses but you aposre not reopening your state aposs famous beaches question what are the chances that you aposre going to be in a very different state and largely reopen come memorial day on the start of summer gov phil murphy d new jersey listen i aposll be the happiest guy in new jersey if not america if we are chris i think it aposs too early to tell for lots of reasons including our neighbors we aposre in a different place than we were we we decided to open state and county parks this weekend as you rightly pointed out i have to say yesterday the reports in compliance was very high in terms of social distancing and not congregating that sort of behavior as we as we flatten the curve aposs and remember we aposve been crushed over 7 700 people have died in new jersey from covid 19 but as we as we push these curves down and folks continue to comply and and keep social distancing that aposs the best weapon we aposve got to to get the best outcome by the time we do get to memorial day wallace you as you aposve just pointed out your state has the second highest number of cases in the country to new york you have the second highest number of deaths and just this past week new jersey your state has its single highest single single day number of deaths like other other governors however you have protesters as governor reeves does in mississippi saying hey it aposs time to reopen these protesters are out in the street what do you say to them murphy listen i have no i don apost begrudge their right to protest i wish they would do it virtually and unsafely my biggest issue is they were congregating without face masks but the overwhelming amount of folks in our state believe that we aposre we aposre on the right path and it aposs it aposs painful i mean folks have been staying in now for weeks the stay at home reality has been with us for for many many weeks and and partly the the state park step we took was partly for mental health reasons for folks to get out and be able to get some fresh air and stay away from each other so so i don apost begrudge folks right to protest but we aposve got to call we we aposve got to make our decisions based on the science the data the facts and they all suggest as you as you rightfully point out we aposre not out of this yet now the the fatalities bless their souls we have to point out are folks who were infected some number of weeks ago so in the here and now hospitalizations are down ventilator use is down the positive curve testing curve is flattening so those are all good signs but we aposre not in the end zone yet wallace i want to pick up on this question of science because you set six principles for reopening and the first of your six principles the first principle is that there has to be as dr birx had talked about this steady decline in new cases for 14 days you haven apost reached it as best we can tell not a single state has reached it and get a number of your fellow governors have started to reopen their states you said this week data drives dates are some of your fellow governors making a mistake not being driven by the data murphy listen chris my nose is pressed against the new jersey glass honestly so i can apost speak for what they aposre looking at i do know in our state and as we coordinate with our regional partners most notably our neighbors new york pennsylvania delaware we have to make the call based on data and science we aposre the densest state in america and this region is the densest region in america in our northern counties we aposre part of the of the new york city and remain so of the new york city metro flare up of this whole virus so we aposve got to be exceedingly careful and as and as much as i want to open things back up tomorrow we aposre just not there yet and we aposve got to make these calls particularly given our density based on the facts wallace a couple of more questions i want to get in with you governor you met with president trump this week and i think it aposs fair to say that you aposre getting along better with the president than almost any other democratic governor he announced this week he aposs sending new jersey half a million new tests 750 000 swabs do you think that your good personal relationship with the president has made a difference in terms of what new jersey has gotten murphy listen i we aposve been able to find common ground chris let there be no doubt about it the president knows new jersey he and his team have been extremely responsive in our hour of need whether it was ventilators as you rightfully point out we aposve got a huge amount of supplies to test we aposre getting personal protective equipment just the other day confirmed direct to our nursing homes we just announced 1 7 billion into our hospital systems listen i think we aposve been able to find common ground again based on the science based on the facts and the reality and in our in our hour of need i have to thank the president and his team they have been there for us and i appreciate that enormously wallace one area however governor where you haven apost gotten help either from the president or from senate republicans is on the question is state aid federal aid passed by congress signed by the president to go to states like yours to pay for first responders teachers and all the services where you the huge revenue hit that you aposve taken because of the coronavirus you said this week your word that if you don apost get state aid it aposs going to be armageddon murphy yes listen we had a very good conversation about this i have to say with the president but that aposs the facts this isn apost about the old legacy stuff we aposre we aposve we aposve been taking care of that this is about firefighters police ems teachers at the point of attack we aposre already seeing some layoffs in new jersey we need a big slug of federal direct cash assistance and it aposs not not just new jersey and it aposs not just blue states and it and it would make a huge difference it clearly would be a huge win for the residents who are being served it would be a huge win for those first line responders and their families working families i think frankly it aposs a huge win for the president to be able to say you know what with this cash assistance we were able to keep serving folks across the country in both red and blue states and we kept folks employed at a time where we desperately need to keep folks employed wallace governor murphy thank you thanks for joining us today and good luck to you and the residents of your state of new jersey thank you sir 930 governor phil murphy d nj keeps serving folks across the country in both red and blue states and we kept folks employed at a time we desperately need to keep folks employed chris wallace fox anchor governor murphy thank you thanks for joining us today and good luck to you and the residents of your state of new jersey thank you sir up next we aposre going to bring in our sunday group to discuss the debate over when and how to reopen and get back to something approaching normal commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states have to have safety but at the same time people want this country open the people here want it open jared kushner adviser to the president i think that we aposve achieved all the different milestones that are needed so the government federal government rose to the challenge and this is a great success story end video clip wallace president trump and his son in law and advisor jared kushner turning the page on the messaging coming from the white house these days and it aposs time now for our sunday group anchor of the daily briefing dana perino executive director of the serve america pac marie harf and guy benson of fox news radio dana the president and his team are clearly now pushing this it aposs time to start reopening the country narrative but as we pointed out not a single state has met even though a bunch of states are reopening not a single state has met the white house gating guidelines of two weeks of steady decline in new cases before you aposre supposed to go to phase one and recent polls show that that when people are asked to choose they aposre more concerned about safety even if it means staying sheltered for a while longer than in reopening at least that aposs what the public polls say i guess my question is how big a risk do you think the president is taking and pushing at this point as much as he is for reopening dana perino anchor the daily briefing well that aposs a very interesting dance in a way that the president has to do from the very beginning which was how do you convince people to all work together to flatten the curve and america really did respond quite well and you saw that the curve is flattening in many places but now there aposs a bit of a plateau of what do we do if there aposs a plateau and in the meantime you have all of these people you know you said earlier chris 66 000 people who have died and one of the things that aposs really on the hearts of the people who lost loved one is that those people mostly had to die alone because of the social distancing guidelines they couldn apost be there to hold their loved ones hands when they died so there is grief on that end but at the same time there is no doubt the economy and the economic impacts of this are devastating when you have car lines up to six miles in san antonio for people to get food these are people who were working through no fault of their own they find themselves in this position they aposve probably never asked the government or a charity for help and they aposre looking at this saying there aposs no problems at my hospital but doctors and nurses at our hospitals are being laid off because there aposs no elective surgeries you just heard from governor murphy who said that they aposre seeing that firefighters police officers are starting to be laid off in these states so it aposs going to be very important for the president to figure out how to strike the balance and i think there aposs one thing that they can do in terms of saying what a great job they aposve done so far but they also need to be very clear eyed with everyone in the country about the challenges that we face because they are enormous wallace marie let let let aposs talk about it though because you do see republican governors pushing moving to reopen their states you do see these growing protests in the street so i mean there is a push to get the country going again and obviously the 66 000 people who have died even the million with the new cases but you know we aposre talking about 30 million people in the last six weeks who have lost their jobs marie harf fox news contributor it was so interesting hearing the governor of mississippi talking about how when he got new data he changed his plans when he had scheduled to reopen parts of the economy so we are about to embark on a situation where we will see if people can on their own social distance if people with you know independent of government regulations or stay at home orders can act responsibly and if they can apost and if we see spikes in some of these places will these governors be willing to change course in midstream that aposs something we will all see together in real time but the bottom line is we still need more testing we still need more contact tracing we still need more therapeutic treatments you heard dr birx we aposve heard dr fauci talk about that and so the economy even if we open nail salons hair salons chris the economy isn apost really going to get going again until we can travel until we can move around the country it will not get going again in a real meaningful way by opening small businesses in certain places and so we have to get all of those things i just mentioned to eventually get to a place where the economy really can open back up that is not happening anytime soon wallace here is one of the republican governors florida governor ron desantis talking this week as he was starting to reopen his state take a look begin video clip gov ron desantis r fl what is our biggest obstacle fear fear of the unknown fear sparked by constant doom and gloom and hysteria that has permeated our culture for the last six weeks end video clip wallace guy you know it aposs awfully interesting as the virus begins to wane at least a little bit we see and maybe it aposs because people feel free freer to do it the politics starting to to resume and to grow and you aposve got red state governors not all of them and we just pointed out tate reeves who who made a a a switch when he saw the data of a spike in cases in mississippi but generally speaking red state governors pushing more for reopening blue state governors democrats talking more about leaving the restrictions on longer it i mean it aposs a it aposs a very interesting dichotomy and it aposs really follows a political breakdown guy benson fox news contributor although there have been governors chris on the democratic side who were part of this first round of reopening efforts as well so it aposs not perfectly red and blue i think some of it is regional i think some of it is based on the data that we heard dr birx talk about which is different in these various states but i think the clip from governor desantis if you watch that entire speech that he gave he was really juxtaposing the predictions of the numbers in florida which were horrific versus the numbers that we aposre actually seeing in florida which are still very sad every death is horrible but nowhere near what the projections had shown and so i think he was saying we have to keep our heads we have to keep things in proper perspective and remember we were told that x y and z was going to happen what we aposre seeing is a b and c let aposs try to balance this properly i mean it is awfully difficult chris because you of course grieve for the 66 plus thousand americans who have died there are concerns that those numbers are still going up in certain areas more than others but you talk to even small business owners who had thriving businesses who did everything right and were doing everything well and now they aposre wondering can we ever reopen what aposs going to happen to my life what aposs going to happen to my employees life that is also a humanitarian crisis that is very acute for a lot of people who aren apost sitting in studios like we are and who are looking every day very anxiously when can this happen again i think the biggest component is when will the american people feel confident to reopen the economy because some of these businesses reopened and had very few customers because people still aren apost confident and this sort of juggling act continues and it aposs it aposs very painful wallace all right panel we have to take a break here but when we come back joe biden denies a sexual assault allegation and calls on the national archives to release his personnel records we aposll discuss the impact on the 2020 race next commercial break begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate and the facts in this case do not exist they never happened and there aposs so many inconsistencies in what has been said in this case so yes look at the facts and i assure you it did not happen period end video clip wallace presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden on friday flatly denying the allegation he sexually assaulted a staffer back in 1993 and we aposre back now with the panel guy what did you think of joe biden aposs denial on friday does it end this controversy and given the fact that that several women have made similar allegations against donald trump how big a role does it play in the 2020 election benson i don apost think that it aposs over because there are more questions i think that need to be asked and answered on this front i just find it very interesting chris that as we aposre having this discussion about joe biden look i watched the interview i think that he deserves the presumption of innocence i think accused parties do in every case that aposs how things work in this country and i would say on one hand there is significantly more contemporaneous evidence against biden including five people who say that tara reade told them at the time that this had happened in the early to mid apos90s that phone call that her mother placed to larry king live far more contemporaneous evidence against biden than there ever was against brett kavanaugh but i aposm not sure it aposs decisive and i think that for us to all pile on and i see some people saying biden should drop out of the race a lot of people on the far left and some people on the right i don apost think that that aposs fair because i don apost think we know what happened there aposs a lot of murkiness and there are inconsistencies in reade aposs story but anyone who aposs rediscovering skepticism and the importance of evidence and looking at inconsistencies in stories that aposs fine but if they had a different standard for brett kavanaugh many many on the left did and in the media they owe kavanaugh an apology wallace i want to pick up on that with you marie because during the brett kavanaugh case there were a lot of democrats especially a lot of leading democratic women in congress and and just in public life who were saying women must be believed women must be taken seriously and a lot of those same women said that they stood with joe biden on these allegations before biden even denied the allegations on friday i mean isn apost that hypocrisy harf well what many women on the democratic side were saying with brett kavanaugh at the time was that they wanted a full fbi investigation and that believing women means taking their claims seriously and investigating them and joe biden himself has come out and called for an investigation into tara reade aposs accusations he has asked the senate secretary who would have any personnel records any files like that to comb through their records that aposs a level of transparency that not many politicians have had when they aposve been accused of sexual assault and so for someone who went through a very thorough vetting is the vice president did when he was running with president obama with candidate obama none of this ever came up nothing like this has ever been rumored to be the case certainly for someone who aposs been this vetted the vice president had said look investigate it that aposs what believing women means taking them seriously and investigating it in this case there is no concrete evidence at all of assault wallace i aposm going to call an audible here and let aposs move to another big story this week and that aposs the case of general michael flynn who was pled guilty for lying he pled guilty twice for lying to the fbi this week new documents came out that indicated that before they interviewed michael flynn the fbi talked about seeing if they could catch him in a lie and here is new white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany on his whole issue on friday begin video clip kayleigh mcenany white house press secretary i aposm glad they kept such good documentation of their intent to slow walk general flynn into a trap into essentially create as i mentioned a grave miscarriage of justice end video clip wallace dana from what you see is this a miscarriage of justice what happen to michael flynn and particularly given what we aposre now learning about the fbi and what do you make of the president aposs talk that he would at least consider bringing michael flynn whom he fired because he had allegedly lied to the vice president bringing him back into the white house perino well i think the i think that we might be over reading the president aposs answer on that a little bit he never likes to close off possibilities for him in the future so i don apost think that he was saying i aposm definitely going to bring michael flynn back but he has maintained from the beginning that this is a good man a war hero somebody who was treated unfairly by the justice department and i think that everybody should be able to look at the attorney general william barr aposs decision here to ask a u s attorney to give this a fair review and release documents because there is question so we have those documents so far the investigation is ongoing now the judge also has some decisions to make in the case what happened next do they throw out the case will the justice department try to re prosecute and i also think that there are still some questions about how did this all happen in the first place and you know there aposs political appointees at the justice department and the fbi from the previous administration who have been very quiet and i think in this investigation they aposre probably going to have to come out and explain a little bit more if they want to help all of us understand what in the world was going on back then wallace marie what do you think of the of the fbi documents that were released this week and the claim by some people that they exonerate general flynn and as you just heard kayleigh mcenany say that this was a miscarriage of justice harf well they certainly don apost exonerate michael flynn and i think the documents show an fbi that was trying to figure out the best way to handle a very politically sensitive investigation with michael flynn and the bottom line is that michael flynn lied not just to the vice president but to the fbi he is a highly trained military intelligence officer chris he is not someone who aposs taken for a ride or a rube he is not stupid he he decided when he had the choice when he was required to tell the truth under oath he decided to lie he pled guilty to it and so whatever internal deliberations the fbi was having that still remains the fact wallace do do are you troubled at all by these documents that we aposre seeing now in which people are discussing you know we aposre going to interview flynn and you know should we try to catch him in a lie also should we get him fired which seems like an odd thing for a law enforcement agency to do is there nothing in those documents that troubles you marie harf there aposs nothing in these documents that shows me that this is a politically motivated investigation and they aposre asking questions about how to handle that that happens all the time in fbi investigations but michael flynn is the one who chose to lie about his contact with foreign governments including the russians so of course i want more information about this chris but nothing i aposve seen tells me that this wasn apost a good investigation wallace guy your thoughts about about the overall investigation of michael flynn and what we learned or didn apost learn this week about it benson i think a big question is why that interview took place at all and if you read kimberley strassel aposs column in the wall street journal it is pretty devastating i think it aposs totally possible to say he was railroaded and there was misconduct at the fbi but also to marie aposs point he didn apost choose to lie to the vice president he did have some very shady dealings for example with the government of turkey maybe he shouldn apost have been in that position in the first place right so you can maybe say perhaps he wasn apost the best pick for a national security advisor that doesn apost mean there wasn apost abuse and i think some of the documents we saw this week point to abuse wallace it well we aposve got about 30 seconds what what are you most troubled by where do you see possible abuse benson well i think mostly it aposs the pretenses under which that interview was set up in the first place right where they were basically saying and comey the former fbi director admitted this he sent the agents there using sort of a chaotic new white house to sort of get this this fbi investigation to come to the white house doorstep and it just the notes in the in the actual documents about saying trying to get him to lie try to get him fired it doesn apost smell great wallace all right panel thank you the smell test and it doesn apost pass it we aposll see you next sunday up next our power players of the week
