right to rule if anyone tries to attack china on this issue china will resolutely fight back said shi yinhong professor of international studies at renmin university chinese leaders may think if china doesn t fight back it will hurt china even more chinese diplomats are increasingly taking to twitter and facebook platforms that are blocked in their own country they re following in the footsteps of zhao lijian a pioneering firebrand whose tweets while stationed in pakistan attracted a huge following and also led america s former u n ambassador susan rice to call him a racist disgrace who should be dismissed instead china promoted him to foreign ministry spokesman xi has clearly indicated a preference for wolf warrior diplomats said carl minzner an expert on chinese politics at fordham law school in new york city these new style diplomats are reading the tea leaves and are using bombastic language overseas as a tool to garner attention from nationalistic audiences at home both among the party elite and among society at large regardless of the impact on china s image abroad minzner said overseas the newly strident tone has been less appreciated the french foreign minister summoned the chinese ambassador after an embassy statement in apparent response to western criticism accused french nursing home workers of deserting and letting their residents die from starvation and disease the

russia s playbook it has mobilized thousands of bots to tweet the communist party line according to twitter china has pumped funds into state media outlets broadcasting in swahili arabic spanish and dozens of other languages in the past china s diplomacy was far away from the people said chu yin a professor at china s university of international relations now chinese diplomats feel it s safe for them to show they are tough being tough won t be wrong at least in thailand the embassy on facebook called critics disrespectful and accused them of betraying history in a social media battle over the origin of the virus and the status of hong kong and taiwan in sri lanka the mission erupted in fury this month after twitter suspended its account demanding free speech and accusing the tech giant of double standards twitter reversed the suspension the next day beijing s diplomats see the virus as a chance to assert leadership among countries critical of the west many leaders have praised china for sending medical equipment and teams with one flight greeted by the president of serbia kissing the chinese flag in the 1990s some in china dismissed their diplomats as the ministry of traitors
