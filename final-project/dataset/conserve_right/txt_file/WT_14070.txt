chael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic as the prospects for president obama s signature asian trade deal look increasingly bleak the question has become if not the tpp then what for the u s there may be no plan b presidential candidates hillary clinton and donald trump have gone on record against the proposed trans pacific partnership and analysts warn that walking away from the agreement would allow china and japan to set their own rules for trade and investment in the globe s most dynamic economic region the massive free trade deal involving the u s and 11 other pacific rim nations covering 40 percent of the global economy is the centerpiece of mr obama s proposed pivot to asia in addition to diplomatic security and political payoffs top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender mr obama and visiting singaporean prime minister lee hsien loong warned tuesday about the implications of a failed tpp china would step in mr obama said and beijing is not worried about labor standards or environmental standards or human trafficking or anti corruption measures incorporated into the agreement you ll get a low standard lowest common denominator trade deal the president said gary hufbauer a trade analyst at the peterson institute for international economics said china which is not a party to the tpp has options to exploit a potential failure of the tpp if the deal collapses mr hufbauer said leaders in beijing might see it as a big vacuum that china could attempt to fill to become the leader of the world trading system but they might also take a very different tack on their approach than in the past regardless if the u s stumbles the plate for leadership is there for china to take china is pursuing a regional economic accord of its own the regional comprehensive economic partnership a 16 nation bloc involving many of the same nations as the tpp mr hufbauer said china is notorious for trade agreements that offer fewer provisions on the environment labor and intellectual property and are less strict on removing trade barriers he said the regional comprehensive economic partnership is less rigorous than the tpp but that china might raise its sights if the agreement fails if china really saw this as a strategic opportunity to have leadership on the world stage it would try to invigorate the world trade organization and use that organization to open its own market he said it also might rehash the rcep from a light agreement to a deep agreement daniel j ikenson director of the herbert a stiefel center for trade policy studies at the cato institute faulted mr obama s marketing strategy large swaths of the republican party which historically has backed large trade agreements won t sign on to the tpp mr obama has been a poor salesman mr ikenson said he s saying we have to do trade agreements or we ll get gobbled up by china there s a more nuanced way of saying it mr ikenson predicted that u s businesses will be on the outside looking in if the tpp fails and that the effects wouldn t be solely economic u s credibility will take huge hit he said these other governments have all been banking on it and if we can t ratify it here it will be a long time until they trust the u s again left at the altar commerce secretary penny pritzker made an explicit national security argument in a pitch wednesday to employees of the high tech qualcomm inc in san diego she noted that 100 trade deals have been struck across the asian pacific market since 2000 many of which do not include u s interests ladies and gentlemen let s be frank mr pritzker said according to the times of san diego the world is watching american leadership and prosperity are at stake with this agreement singapore s mr lee on tuesday said many rising pacific rim economies have taken political risks of their own and that congress rejection of the tpp could sour washington s relations in the region your partners your friends who have come to the table who have negotiated each one of them has overcome some domestic political objection some sensitivity some political cost to come to the table and make this deal mr lee said and if at the end waiting at the altar the bride doesn t arrive i think there are people who are going to be very hurt claude barfield a trade analyst at the american enterprise institute said the other parties to the agreement will go ahead and pass it without us they could negotiate among themselves there s nothing to stop the other 11 from going beyond tpp rules he said if japan musters legislative support for the tpp mr hufbauer said the agreement would have enough weight to proceed without u s participation japan would say we don t want all the leadership to go to china we re the remaining big country let s go ahead with tpp led by us forget about the u s we ll take the leadership mr hufbauer said and for many tpp countries access to japan is a big plus mr hufbauer said a president hillary clinton would rebrand the agreement to sell it to congress as her husband president bill clinton did in 1993 with the north american free trade agreement mr barfield said mrs clinton would add more labor and environmental protections i think hillary clinton will find a way mr ikenson said it needs to be good for u s workers raise wages and increase security i think she can make the case for it mr ikenson said the same goes for mr trump who has pledged to rip up the deal if elected trump would realize that this would increase his power as the commander in chief mr ikenson said what better way to make america great again than by putting it at the fore
