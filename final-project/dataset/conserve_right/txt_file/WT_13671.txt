way to learn about this unusual slice of jewish and shanghai history is on a tour with an israeli expat named dvir bar gal but be warned this is no superficial glance at the highlights this is a five hour 60 minicourse with mr bar gal as professor with his encyclopedic knowledge and intense passion he brings to life a vanished world attracting visitors from every continent many of them descended from the jews who only survived world war ii because they found refuge in shanghai no other place in the whole world saved so many jewish lives mr bar gal says adding there is no anti semitism in china mr bar gal begins the tour on the bustling bund explaining how jewish merchants from baghdad helped build nanjing road into the neighborhood s commercial center in the 19th century the landmark peace hotel now owned by the fairmont chain was built in the 1920s by victor sassoon part of a famous and wealthy sephardic jewish family among the community s rags to riches tales was that of silas hardoon who started as a night watchman for the sassoons and became a powerful real estate developer helping to turn nanjing road into the fifth avenue of china in the early 20th century eventually he became the richest jew in asia the real estate king of shanghai mr bar gal says the kadoorie family which founded the china light power co and today owns the peninsula hotel group also is descended from sephardic jews who got their start with the sassoons a second layer was added to shanghai s jewish community when several thousand jews fleeing persecution in czarist russia arrived at the turn of the 20th century many settled in shanghai s french concession district and opened small businesses the third layer of shanghai s jews consisted of european refugees fleeing the nazis in the 1930s walking past small shops and tenements in hongkou today past street vendors and bicyclists all of them chinese mr bar gal says imagine here a deli a bakery a grocery a restaurant a pharmacy run by jews trying to re create familiar rhythms of european life in their new city so many of the residents were austrian that the area was known as little vienna a chinese diplomat who worked in austria during world war ii feng shan ho is part of the story defying orders from his superiors ho issued lifesaving visas that allowed jews to leave most of them traveling by boat from italy to shanghai everyone else rejected them mr bar gal says referring to the limits other countries including the u s placed on admitting jewish refugees in the late 1930s shanghai was the only option shanghai was open to jewish arrivals despite the fact that the city was under control of the japanese who were nazi allies a japanese diplomat in lithuania chiune sugihara also issued thousands of visas that allowed jews to escape europe for japan or china eventually however japanese officials forced all stateless people living in shanghai to move to hongkou and turned it into a ghetto some 20 000 jews were crammed into the neighborhood living as many as 30 to a room mr bar gal says disease and starvation were rampant though the jews tried to help themselves by setting up clinics soup kitchens schools and shelters where we walk today we are in the heart of the ghetto mr bar gal says a stone monument in huoshan park a peaceful place with trees and benches offers a description of the neighborhood in chinese hebrew and english as a designated area for stateless refugees bordered by gongping tongbei huimin and zhoujiazui roads but many buildings that once housed the refugees have been torn down and more are slated for demolition mr bar gal s tour also stops at the shanghai jewish refugees museum and ohel moshe synagogue where artifacts including passports photos and a
