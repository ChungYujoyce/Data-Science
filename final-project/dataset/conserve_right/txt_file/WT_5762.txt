ed for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive sir walter scott wrote in his epic poem marmion this legendary admonition applies to the sticky troubles president trump has gotten himself into as a result of his revised retelling of the disturbing conversation he had with ukraine president volodymyr zelensky according to the u s intelligence whistleblower s report mr trump asked mr zelensky to do him a favor by digging up political dirt on former vice president joe biden to use in the 2020 presidential election if mr biden is his opponent top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey mr trump flatly denied that he ever suggested that in any way shape or manner in remarks to reporters on oct 2 mr trump said well the whistleblower was very inaccurate the whistleblower started this whole thing by writing a report on the conversation i had with the president of ukraine and the conversation was perfect it couldn t have been nicer then a week later on oct 9 mr trump tweeted this the whistleblower s facts have been so incorrect about my no pressure conversation with the ukrainian president well not exactly here s what the washington post s fact checker glenn kessler found out despite trump s repeated claim that the whistleblower was very inaccurate or so incorrect many of the details of the whistleblower complaint have already been confirmed by additional information documents and reporting in his july 25 phone call to mr zelensky mr trump asked the ukrainian president to initiate or continue an investigation into joe biden mr kessler confirmed this week furthermore he writes the rough transcript released by the white house shows trump telling zelensky there s a lot of talk about biden s son that biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general william p barr would be great biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it it sounds horrible to me mr kessler notes that the ellipsis in the above appears in the white house document suggesting something may have been removed before release as we have documented trump s claim that biden stopped the prosecution of his son hunter is false he adds what s not gotten much attention is the white house s efforts to restrict access to records related to the call mr kessler adds the whistleblower said that the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature mr kessler reports notably the white house has confirmed this is true the whistleblower wrote adding it underscored to me that white house officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call meantime cnn has reported that at least one national security council official alerted the white house s national security lawyers about the concerns according to the whistleblower s account this resulted in the white house s national security lawyers ordering the transcript to be moved to prevent more people from seeing it mr kessler reported at the same time he cautions that the rough transcript released by the white house has a warning note that it is not verbatim the fact there are a number of ellipses in the document not common in official white house summaries it s unclear whether there is a more complete version available well it is very likely that there is in the whistleblower s possession and of course in his testimony if and when he appears before the house s impeachment inquiry the case against the president as mr kessler has detailed in his fact checking column is that he has used the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign power in the 2020 u s election with the exception of some minor details virtually all of the specific points of the complaint have held up and been confirmed he writes trump has no basis to claim the whistleblower complaint is very inaccurate he says mr kessler awards pinocchios for not telling the truth in this case he says the president earns four of them donald lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to the washing
