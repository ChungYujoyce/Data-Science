tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn for those wondering why the white house needs an independent climate panel supporters recommend starting with the fourth national climate assessment the federal report released in november was hailed as evidence that president trump s own scientists were on board with dire climate disaster forecasts even though the document was prepared with the help of leading activists and a former obama administration climate official the panel is absolutely necessary because what happens is the federal government puts out these biased pieces of propaganda and then the environmental left trumpets it and says even the trump administration says this said james taylor senior fellow for energy and the environment for the free market think tank

individuals in a letter urging mr trump to approve the president s commission on climate security an effort spearheaded by princeton physicist william happer now under consideration at the white house in our view an independent review of these reports is long overdue the letter reads serious problems and shortcomings have been raised repeatedly in the past by highly qualified scientists only to be ignored or dismissed by the federal agencies in charge of producing the reports among the signers are right of center advocacy groups like the competitive enterprise institute freedomworks cfact and

order a president s commission on climate security read here https t co sqdqlzmpwo the letter comes in reaction to furious pushback on the left with mr happer who holds a doctorate in physics bearing the brunt of the outrage including having his scientific credentials questioned and being called a denialist by the new york times and a denier by top house democrats mr happer who serves as a national security council senior director took another hit wednesday from penn state atmospheric sciences professor michael e mann who referred to him as a propagandist and the proposed panel as disastrous americans should not be fooled by the stalinist tactics being used by the white house to try to discredit the findings of mainstream climate scientists mr mann who has a doctorate in geology and geophysics said in an op ed for the guardian newspaper in britain the article was co written with bob ward policy and communications director at the london school of economics grantham research institute on climate change and the environment and accused the administration of seeking to promote an alternative official explanation for climate change my new guardian article with

another action by your administration in a line of many that run counter to the overwhelming scientific consensus on the causes and impacts of climate change two obama cabinet secretaries john f kerry and chuck hagel said they are deeply concerned about reports that national security council officials are considering forming a committee to dispute and undermine military and intelligence judgments on the threat posed by climate change this includes second guessing the scientific sources used to assess the threat such as the rigorously peer reviewed national climate assessment and applying that to national security policy said the march 5 letter which was signed by 58 military and national security figures the panel s backers argue that an independent review body comprised of scientists with a range of viewpoints would improve the federal government s climate findings by applying another level of scrutiny mr spencer principal research scientist at the university of alabama in huntsville took issue with claims that the panel would be focused on undermining legitimate research instead the committee will address the uncertainties the exaggerations and the misrepresentations of what is known and isn t known about human caused climate change issues the public is generally unaware of said mr spencer who holds a doctorate in meteorology if the science really is settled people should not be afraid of a review he said myron ebell director of the cei s center for energy and environment ticked off what he sees as problems with federal climate analyses citing outdated climate sensitivity models unrealistically dire scenarios and adjustments to surface temperature data that inevitably show more warming recent research suggests that climate sensitivity is at the low end and of course what gets put into these reports is always the high end said mr ebell a member of the trump transition team one reason said mr taylor is that the federal workforce is replete with climate catastrophe advocates left over from previous administrations meaning the deck is stacked even before they put these reports together mr trump has come under fire on the left for announcing he would pull out of the 2015 paris climate agreement and his skeptical attitude toward predictions of global catastrophe providing a stark contrast to congressional democrats who have held more than a dozen climate related hearings this year given the previous statements you have made that fly in the face of explicit scientific evidence and the findings of your own dod and director of national intelligence we have serious concerns about any effort to construct a secret committee to question the basic scientific fact of climate change said the house democratic chairs letter the white house has not publicly acknowledged the existence of the proposed panel and there is no timeline for a decision although speculation is that a decision could come within the month mr ebell said the president should bear in mind a key distinction between those who support the panel s formation and those who don t there s a really a big difference between our letter and those letters that are opposed mr ebell said and that is that our letter was written by p
