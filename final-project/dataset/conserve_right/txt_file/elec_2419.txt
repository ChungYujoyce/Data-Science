first the voters are always reluctant to replace a president in a time of peace and prosperity regardless of his perceived flaws second a transparently partisan impeachment vote in the house followed by a fair trial and acquittal in the senate will seriously damage the democratic brand while sparking an internal civil war between its moderate and left wing factions finally this ideological conflict within the opposition party will result in the nomination of a weak compromise candidate to face a vindicated and politically stronger incumbent president awash in cash and supported by highly motivated voters anyone doubting this last point should peruse this article from the bbc about trump s recent minnesota rally the centre of the city is a bobbing sea of red and white the slogan is on t shirts women for trump pilots for trump cops for trump this was in minneapolis mind you just after house speaker nancy pelosi announced that the democrats would launch an impeachment inquiry into the president s purported misdeeds they weren t impressed by pelosi s decree if anything it has galvanized the thousands of supporters some of whom queued for days to be at the front of the target center crowd usa today reports a very similar phenomenon while trump has faced intense criticism in washington he has reveled in the rock star reception he has received at rallies thousands of miles away in minneapolis and dallas supporters echo the president s attacks on impeachment house democrats and what trump calls the swamp of washington d c like the president they view impeachment as an illegitimate effort to take him down impeachment many said will wind up re electing trump in 2020 imagine what these rallies will be like after house democrats impeach him and he is acquitted in the senate trump will repeatedly remind his supporters that after two partisan witch hunts perpetrated by unscrupulous antagonists with little regard for evidence and less for ethics he is still standing and ready to take on any challenger the democrats nominate moreover he will hang the embarrassingly inept mueller investigation and the inevitable implosion of impeachment around the neck of that unfortunate candidate trump will force him to explain why the democrats wasted two years in the house and accomplished nothing but failed attempts to oust him the 2020 democratic nominee will be joe biden elizabeth warren or bernie sanders all of these people have called for trump s impeachment two of the three are inconveniently members of the upper chamber of congress that will eventually acquit him if biden is the nominee the president will remind voters that the former vp is on video bragging about doing exactly what he calls an impeachable offense in trump s case threatening to withhold aid to ukraine in a quid pro quo arrangement ironically impeachment is actually a blessing in disguise for the trump campaign robert reich secretary of labor in the clinton administration writes in the guardian impeachment is sucking huge amounts of oxygen from the political air and will continue to do so for months meanwhile trump s campaign is in full gear his fundraising machinery the republican national committee super pacs his official campaign has raised more than 736m that s more than any presidential candidate at this point in a campaign trump has never stopped campaigning it s time for democrats to hunker down what reich means is that trump is stealing a march on them while congressional democrats waste their time on impeachment and half a dozen megalomaniacs are still participating in a magical mystery tour in which people like beto o rourke cory booker andrew yang julian castro pete buttigieg and tom steyer pose as presidential candidates while all these second and third stringers try to bring joe biden elizabeth warren or bernie sanders down a peg adam schiff is holding secret interrogations of various trump officials past and present and leaking out of context quotes that have far more to do with public relations than impeachment all of this nonsense plays into president trump s hand during a time of peace and prosperity trump is bringing troops home from abroad and the most recent jobs report released by the bureau of labor statistics was full of good news in september the unemployment rate declined by 0 2 percentage points to 3 5 percent the last time the rate was this low was in december 1969 when it also was 3 5 percent hispanic unemployment fell to 3 9 percent a record low and black unemployment is at an all time low of 5 5 percent is this news reaching voters in north carolina which will be an important 2020 swing state a new poll suggests that it does indeed the october meredith poll asked state voters their preferences in matchups involving trump and the five leading democratic challengers for the party s nomination former vice president joe biden sens elizabeth warren mass bernie sanders vt kamala harris calif and mayor pete buttigieg of south bend ind the poll results had trump with slight leads over biden and warren but larger leads over sanders harris and buttigieg this is a state poll of course and thus more useful than the national surveys typically discussed in the media the 2020 election like all presidential contests will involve 51 separate races 50 states plus d c few will be decided based on a partisan impeachment process that ends in the acquittal of the president nor will a majority of voters in the important swing states be inclined to support a weak candidate nominated by a fragmented party whose only consistent principle is animosity toward donald trump in the end the choice will be peace and prosperity versus incoherent rage trump s voters will be out in force and will choose the
