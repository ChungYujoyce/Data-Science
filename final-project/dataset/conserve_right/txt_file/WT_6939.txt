 persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the united states and china are escalating their military duel near taiwan by flying strategic bombers near the island state in recent days the people s liberation army air force plaaf sent several h 6 bombers near taiwan on feb 10 including one that provocatively crossed the middle dividing line between the mainland and taiwan prompting taipei s military to scramble f 16 jets to intercept and shadow the bomber a day later the u s pacific air force flew two b 52 nuclear capable bombers near taiwan in an apparent response the chinese and u s flights come close on the heels of the reelection of independence leaning taiwanese president tsai ing wen whose decisive victory was seen as a rebuke of chinese pressure tactics in places such as hong kong top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender retired navy capt jim fanell said the recent bomber flights near taiwan indicate that the chinese government is stepping up military pressure on taiwan after ms tsai s election victory last month even as beijing is consumed with the fight to control the covid 19 outbreak the fact president tsai and her democratic progressive party remained in power comes as a direct refutation of communist china s assertion of sovereignty over the island said capt fanell a former pacific fleet intelligence chief as such it comes as no surprise that the pla would escalate tensions by deploying plaaf bombers around the island and crossing the center line inside the taiwan strait air force maj victoria hight a spokeswoman for the pacific air forces confirmed in a statement last week that two u s air force b 52h stratofortress bombers flew from andersen air force base guam and conducted synchronized training south of the taiwan strait an air force mc 130j commando ii aircraft based at kadena air base japan joined the bombers during the flight feb 11 before returning to guam u s aircraft regularly operate throughout the region in support of allies partners and in defense of a free and open indo pacific said maj hight noting that the military has conducted similar flights for more than 15 years as part of regional continuous bomber operations u s military officials say publicly that the bomber flights were not meant as a direct challenge to china and air force lt nikita thorpe another spokeswoman said the bomber flights are not related to any specific situation or nation the u s military has maintained a deployed strategic bomber presence in the pacific since march 2004 she said the bomber flights provide adm philip davidson commander of the hawaii based indo pacific command with flexible response capabilities in the region lt thorpe said chinese officials say the taiwan strait flights were intended not as a provocation but as a training exercise the people s liberation army eastern theater command said in a statement last week that its forces carried out air ground assault and fire support drills to further refine and test their multi service joint combat capabilities china carried out its military activities last week while the ruling communist party was grappling with the health and political crisis spawned by the spread of a new coronavirus that causes a deadly respiratory disease called covid 19 the outbreak originated in the city of wuhan in hubei province regarding the chinese flights taiwan s government run central news agency said one chinese h 6 bomber crossed over the center line dividing the 100 mile taiwan strait prompting protests from taipei for straying into taiwanese airspace meaningless and unnecessary ms tsai said on facebook that chinese military aircraft circumnavigated around taiwan and neighboring countries and the nation s military services monitored and surveilled their entire route and immediately sent fighter jets to respond i would like to remind the chinese government that choosing to take military action during the outbreak of wuhan pneumonia in china is not only meaningless but also unnecessary ms tsai said the only thing the chinese government should be doing is to control the pneumonia epidemic in wuhan as swiftly as possible because then and only then can regional and global tensions be eased in addition to the h 6 bombers chinese military aircraft involved in the exercises included j 11 jet fighters and kj 500 early warning aircraft the flight route transited the bashi channel off southern taiwan and headed eastward into the pacific before turning around and going across the miyako strait north of taiwan and near japan s senkaku islands which china has claimed as its territory capt fanell said the use of pla aircraft to threaten taiwan while thousands of chinese are dying from a viral disease should be a wake up call to defense planners in taipei honolulu and washington d c long held assumptions that beijing would not ever attempt to invade taiwan need to be jettisoned now and immediate counteractions implemented to deter such a decision he said capt fanell said the u s military should begin force deployments to taiwan beginning with port calls by navy warships and air force aircraft time is not a friend he said firm unambiguous deterrent actions are needed now rick fisher a china military affairs analyst said deterring pla bombers will become more difficult in the coming decade once china s new h 20 flying wing stealth bomber is deployed chinese sources have indicated that the bomber will weigh 200 tons and will be large enough to carry ballistic missile payloads he added this means that detecting pla bombers will become far more difficult he said mr fisher said the plaaf has about 100 h 6 bombers capable of carrying six 932 mile range cj 10 land attack cruise missiles or 250 mile range yj 12 supersonic anti ship missiles it is also likely that the h 6 can fire an air launched ballistic missile with a range of up to 1 300 miles since 2016 the plaaf and the pla navy have been increasing their presence on the east side of taiwan in a clear campaign to terrorize that island democracy mr fisher said to prevent a chinese takeover the trump administration needs to upgrade taiwan s military and defense capabilities he said and should consider selling taipei systems such as the terminal high altitude area defense thaad or sm 3 surface to air missiles that can defeat pla bombers before they launch their cruise missiles alexander huang a professor at tamkang university in taipei said the chinese leadership probably designed the exercises during the virus crisis as a show of strength putting pressure on taiwan is a side effect mr huang told voice of america the current chinese move first it wanted to show the world that even with the coronavirus the people s liberation army still has time and capability to do the regular training f
