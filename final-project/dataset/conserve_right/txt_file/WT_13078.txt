poison and location in an isolated hotel that meant xinhua said that although she had a weakened ability to control herself gu knew the consequences of the alleged crime and therefore she should be identified as having the capacity to accept full criminal responsibility xinhua quoted gu as saying the case has produced great losses to the party and the country for which i ought to shoulder the responsibility and that she was grateful to the humanitarian care shown to her by those who handled the case i solemnly tell the court that in order to maintain the dignity of the law i will accept and calmly face any sentence and i also expect a fair and just court decision she said the report detailed the help gu had from four police officers in chongqing a verdict against them will also be

accompany heywood from beijing to chongqing where he checked into the lucky holiday hotel there gu drank wine and tea with heywood until he became drunk and asked for some water xinhua said gu then put the bottle of cyanide compound she had prepared into heywood s mouth gu then spread capsulated drugs on the hotel floor to make it seem like heywood had taken them xinhua said and put a do not
