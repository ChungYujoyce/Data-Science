during a wednesday morning interview on the tom roten morning show in west virginia republican sen rand paul said that polls showing hillary clinton with a lead over donald trump are designed to suppress turnout you know i think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout so when trump says the thing s rigged i m not sure exactly what he means and i m not sure i always agree with him paul said but i do think that when we say over and over someone can t win that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout paul reminded the listeners of an election in kentucky where liberal news outlets had a republican candidate down by as many as 8 points and yet the republican went on to win by 8in 2015 in kentucky in our governor s race in 2015 the media said over and over and over again the democrats were up 8 points paul said the hope i think was to depress republican turnout and these were coming from liberal newspapers in our state and turns out the republicans won by 8 they were off like by 16 14 16 points and but i think some of that is intentional the polls are put out you know to make it either look closer than it is or to make it look like democrats have a better chance and i think it s done by design to try to dampen turnout alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
