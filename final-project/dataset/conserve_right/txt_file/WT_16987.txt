waters and drowned while his uncle and his brother remained missing a drunken man drowned in flooding in a nearby village provincial disaster officer marvin guiang said nalgae roared through parts of luzon that had been saturated by typhoon nesat which trapped thousands on rooftops and sent huge waves that breached a seawall in manila bay nesat then pummeled southern china and was downgraded to a tropical storm just before churning into northern vietnam on friday where 20 000 people were evacuated seven towns north of manila were still flooded sunday including calumpit in rice growing bulacan province where hundreds of residents remained trapped on rooftops in four villages for the fourth day many desperately waving for help rescuers aboard rubber boats could not reach them because of narrow alleys two air force helicopters were ordered deployed to drop water and food packs to the marooned villagers officials said calumpit mayor james de jesus said floodwaters were receding later sunday sparking hope the crisis would end sooner local leaders have been asked to help distribute relief supplies to residents in areas in the four villages that could now be accessed he said it s still critical there are still houses which could not be reached de jesus told dzbb radio benito ramos who heads the office of civil defense said he was concerned that freshly dumped rains by nalgae may flow down from the mountainous north to the central luzon provinces of bulacan and pampanga which act like a catch basin especially during high tide in nearby manila bay some officials said water released from nearby dams had exacerbated the floods ramos criticized those villagers who refused to leave their flooded homes despite orders to evacuate during a nationally televised meeting with disaster response agencies president benigno aquino iii ordered authorities to study how villagers and fishermen can be forced to follow storm warnings to prevent casualties in the future in the last four months prolonged monsoon flooding typhoons and storms across southeast asia china japan and south asia have left more than 600 people dead or missing in india alone the damage is estimated to be worth 1 billion several studies point to an intensification of the asian summer monsoon rainfall with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations according to the state run indian institute of tropical meteorology still it is not clear that the damaging weather is entirely due to climate change it said the damage on agriculture and infrastructure from the earlier typhoon in the philippines was estimated at 200 million rice and vegetables could be obtained from the country s south in case of supply shortfalls due to damaged farms and blocked roads in the north officials said nalgae was the 17th weather disturbance this year to batter the disaster prone philippines which is lashed by about 20 storms and typhoons annually a low pressure area has been monitored 435 miles 700 kilometers off the archipelago and could either dissipate or strengthen into another storm in the next few days forecaster gener quitlong said associated press writers oliver teves in manila margie mason in
