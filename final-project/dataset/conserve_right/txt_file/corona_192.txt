the 15 second ad sounds like it d fit better in a dystopian science fiction movie than the present day united states at domino s we pride ourselves on handcrafted pizza a narrator reads but after leaving our 450 degree ovens the only hands that touch them are yours get them with contactless delivery from domino s the voiceover brims with a cheery aloofness that distinguishes the spot from the scores of somber commercials that have sprung up in recent months but the subtext is clear trust us you won t contract coronavirus from eating our pizza everything has changed in the months since covid 19 has reared its ugly head 80 000 are dead nearly 1 5 million are confirmed to be infected and tens of millions are out of work schools workplaces and community groups have shifted online sports seasons movie premieres and vacation plans have been put on hold but even within our new normal of sheltering in place social distancing and mask wearing something else has been evolving our relationships with one another it happened subtly at first you might have begun opening doors with your shirt sleeve or ceased shaking hands you stopped frequenting your favorite coffee shop or taking public transportation eventually you caved and bought a mask trips to the grocery store have become fewer and farther between and you find yourself recoiling if you turn the corner into a new aisle and see another shopper heading your way when the elevator s brakes kick into gear you now cringe knowing someone else is about to join you in your suddenly too small metal box nine weeks into the age of covid 19 we ve learned more about the virus how it spreads and what it does to our bodies and we ve evolved into amateur epidemiologists in the process date nights have become possible hotspots our parents and grandparents are now high risk populations where we once saw friends and neighbors we now see potential vectors when we get amazon packages in the mail said d j gallant a loan underwriter who lives just outside of minneapolis i ll bring the amazon package in and take a set of wipes or a rag and spray it down with some disinfectant disinfect the whole box open the box disinfect whatever s inside you re pretty sure everything s okay but you don t want to take any chances gallant s 9 month old daughter has a compromised immune system and his wife is a labor and delivery nurse at a local hospital so he s taking extra precautions but he s far from alone in a recent nbc news wall street journal poll 73 percent of americans reported being very or somewhat worried about the possibility that they or someone in their immediate family might catch covid 19 forty five percent said they were concerned about leaving their homes for groceries or other supplies and 69 percent in a usa today ipsos survey claimed they stopped attending social events because of the coronavirus outbreak the invisible enemy as president trump has grown fond of calling it spreads primarily from person to person the centers for disease control cdc says it may be possible to contract covid 19 by touching a surface with the virus on it but concludes that the main driver of transmission is through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs sneezes or talks some studies are finding evidence inconclusive as of now that the coronavirus may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols dr roderick kramer a social psychologist at stanford university published an article for harvard business review back in 2002 introducing the concept of prudent paranoia a heightened sense of vigilance that can prove beneficial rather than destructive for the person wielding it the piece was written against the backdrop of the 9 11 attacks and focuses primarily on competition in the workplace but kramer believes the theory remains relevant in the current climate there s just a really evident wariness and concern he tells the dispatch in talking to my kids who are both 25 and 30 years old they ve been worried about infecting their parents and other family members so there is that kind of prudent wariness kramer has spent decades studying trust distrust and paranoia elevated suspicion is common throughout history but he says it typically exists within an in group out group context where people make sinister or problematic assumptions about another person s motives based on race or nationality decades of research on ethnocentrism and intergroup hostility show how easily antipathy fear anxiety and active distrust and suspicion ferment even under minimal informational conditions he said the fbi s warning in late march against a surge in hate crimes against asian americans is just the most recent example of this phenomenon but the pandemic is doing something different sowing doubt and uncertainty within existing social circles i live on the stanford campus in a faculty area so it s all faculty kramer explained these are our friends and walking down the street people look at you some people seem to be reluctant even to say hello and they re extremely uncomfortable looking and you ll see people turn around as you re heading towards them even though it s a very wide street i ve really been shocked it s almost like a kind of mccarthy type paranoia for the economy to reopen in any meaningful way political and public health leaders will need to find ways to assuage this paranoia if you don t have enough faith in your neighbor to say hello after all you re probably unlikely to get on an airplane go to the gym or order pizza that s been touched by human hands the trump administration seems to understand this which is why the white house is reportedly looking to message this week that the american people can have confidence as they begin to go back out into the public square that could prove difficult only 23 percent of respondents in an associated press norc center poll have quite a bit of trust in information about the coronavirus conveyed by president trump state and local governments and public health agencies like the cdc inspire much more confidence among the public but their outlooks tend to be less rosy the human mind s negativity bias or tendency to weight bad news more heavily than good may provide additional credence to these public health officials in this instance precisely because their outlook tends to be less rosy infectious disease expert dr anthony fauci for example is set to testify on tuesday before the senate health committee where he hopes to convey the danger of trying to open the country prematurely in an email to the new york times fauci said that ignoring the coronavirus task force s opening up america again guidelines risks multiple outbreaks throughout the country that will result in needless suffering and death and set us back on our quest to return to normal that s the message that s breaking through in most of the country where a majority of americans continue to support lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus even if trump or minnesota gov tim walz or wisconsin gov tony evers came out and said guess what we re going to open everything up everything s good to go tomorrow gallant hypothesized no yeah it sucks it s inconvenient but i do not think i will go about my regular kind of day to day until probably next year as a millennial gallant s risk of severe complications resulting from a coronavirus infection are relatively low the confirmed case fatality rate for 30 39 year olds based on data from south korea italy china and spain is likely somewhere between 0 1 percent and 0 3 percent but while statistics like those may be reassuring on a macro level individual americans don t want to become statistics themselves if my wife were to get infected or somebody were to get infected gallant said trailing off most of the time it s fine but if you end up in that part that needs critical care you can just straight up die we had a 5 percent chance of something happening to our daughter with a viral infection she had when she was born and turns out we hit the odds on that he added i would rather just play it safe photograph by john nacion nurphoto getty images we sent an email to with a link to finish logging in in general those at the dispatch would rather focus on trump and the administration rather than the missteps of the cdc and fda in february which lost us time ok i prefer to focus on the media and their motivations nicolle wallace of msnbc said it perfectly the only good thing about this virus is that it has hurt trump that sentiment has led much of the reporting healthy fear is good irrational feat is bad we have been locked up nearly 8 weeks with just under 1 400 000 million confirmed infections and 80 000 deaths we do we never seem highlight the overwhelming vast majority who must have recovered by now otherwise see dead bodies in the streets that figure by the way underreports a huge number of asymptomatic and mildly sick who never got tested perhaps 10 million to 20 million more are suspected to have been infected it is true that seemingly healthy people have died but half the deaths are from people in nursing homes and those had preexisting conditions we generally know who should be hyper fearful if you are a black male obese and have hypertension and diabetes freak out and don t leave your house you will likely get very sick the media sticks with if it bleeds it leads editorial content first is was trump left us with no ventilators people will die now its testing kits that is trump fault alone the message is don t go out don t open up the economy anything to hurt trump the media s tds has infected the coverage 80 000 deaths are horrible more people will die the virus is not gone but unless the media allow us to open up we won t the economic arrmagedden will have its own complications and as nicolle wallace said that is a winner for the media bill maher wanted a recession he may get a depression happy days for the resistance so to harken back to jonah s recent takes are we witnessing the erosion of social capital due to this pandemic and i hope low risk people would also be motivated to avoid catching the virus so as not to spread it to someone who is higher risk failed to load posts
