panicking about a global pandemic won t help experts say but neither will denying the reality that novel coronavirus is a totally different disease from influenza as could be its potential impact if the disease is allowed to spread hundreds of thousands of people die from the flu every year a fact some people have pointed out in an effort to quell anxiety about the coronavirus so why are people social distancing for coronavirus if they don t do it for the flu conventional wisdom in the u s now holds that everyone should wash their hands for 20 seconds elbow bump rather than shake hands stop buying face masks so there are enough for health care workers note that airplane air is filtered 20 to 30 times an hour and avoid cruise ships long lines with people standing six feet apart stretch

home toilet paper is golden in an apocalypse one customer told mynorthwest com it may seem like a lifetime ago given current declarations of bearmageddon as stock markets have swung wildly lower and

americans died from the flu nothing is shut down life the economy go on he added this week the president said nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won this is additive not in place of yes the flu kills thousands of people every year but we re going to have more deaths as this dramatic change of heart illustrates we still have a lot to learn about the novel coronavirus and that alone experts say should be enough to motivate communities to work together to slow its progress studies suggest the differences between the flu and coronavirus are far starker than some people suggest in fact health professionals point out important distinctions between covid 19 the disease caused by the virus sars cov 2 and other viruses they don t advise mass hysteria obviously but they also don t believe that doing nothing and or going about business as usual is a smart move governments around the world are struggling to stop the spread of the pandemic an epidemic is a disease that infects regions or a community the spanish flu from 1918 to 1919 and black death from 1347 to 1351 were two of the most extreme pandemics ever recorded coronavirus had killed at least 3 170 people in the u s as of tuesday 914 of which were in new york city according to data aggregated by johns hopkins university there were 164 610 confirmed cases new york state accounts for roughly 50 of the u s total which accounts for 19 5 of the global total worldwide there were 800 049 confirmed cases of the virus and 38 714 deaths recommended it s appalling to attach a dollar number to a human life for noneconomists how can you choose between saving the u s economy from coronavirus and saving lives so what are the differences between the new coronavirus and the flu for starters there is no vaccine for covid 19 and one will likely take at least a year to develop and to get one to market and unlike with influenza viruses for which there are several vaccines humans have not built up an immunity over multiple generations what s worse doctors fear the virus will mutate of course there are similarities between influenza and covid 19 both viruses are untreatable with antibiotics and they have almost identical symptoms fever coughing night sweats aching bones tiredness and in more severe cases of both viruses nausea and even diarrhea in the most severe cases they can both be spread through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing but doctors say their differences are just as varied it s a little simple to think the novel coronavirus is just like flu amesh adalja a senior scholar at the john hopkins center for health security and a spokesman for the infectious diseases society of america told marketwatch we don t want another flu he said this is additive not in place of yes the flu kills thousands of people every year but we re going to have more deaths dispatches from the front lines of a pandemic they ve likened it to a war where the number of casualties just keep on coming italians find solidarity resilience and music during the coronavirus lockdown there are reported to be some 1 billion influenza infections worldwide each year with up to 45 million cases in the u s per year tens of thousands of u s deaths and 291 000 to 646 000 deaths worldwide the seasonal flu has a fatality rate of less than 1 anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases estimates that the flu fatality rate is closer to 0 1 but even accounting for the mild yet undiagnosed cases of covid 19 he said it would still make it roughly 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu another reason not to compare the two viruses influenza has likely been around for more than 2 000 years the flu has been with us since the birth of modern medicine said adalja scientists say the novel influenza a viruses in humans lead to a pandemic approximately once every 40 years but again flu vaccines exist flu has likely been around for 2 000 years this coronavirus is three months old and as yet there is no vaccine hippocrates of kos the greek physician who was born around 460 b c mentioned what we now know as the modern influenza virus in his writings some historians say he called it the fever of perinthus others wonder whether this was flu another illness or a combination of illnesses in 1173 and 1500 two other influenza outbreaks were described though in scant detail the name influenza originated in the 15th century in italy from an epidemic attributed to the influence of the stars which according to historical documents raged across europe and perhaps in asia and africa a 2016 paper in the journal of preventive medicine and hygiene reported scholars and historians debate whether influenza was already present in the new world or whether it was carried by contaminated pigs transported on ships it added some aztec texts speak of a pestilential catarrh outbreak in 1450 1456 in an area now corresponding to mexico but these manuscripts are difficult to interpret correctly and this hypothesis seems controversial what has all this got to do with covid 19 there is an advantage to coming down with a virus that has been around for hundreds of years if not a couple of thousand humans ideally will have built up more natural defenses to fight it complicating matters influenza and covid 19 come from different virus families and covid 19 is brand new there are four other strains of the coronavirus but the attack rate of this virus is relatively high as there is no immunity to it adalja said dispatches from the front lines of a pandemic aussies are a relaxed bunch but this will test us all australians flock to the beaches at the end of summer and brace for the start of flu season to put that in perspective in 2017 to 2018 the worst flu season on record in the u s outside of a pandemic approximately 80 000 americans died the four other coronavirus strains that already exist are responsible for around 25 of our common colds adalja added but it doesn t seem like there is cross immunity with this coronavirus as there are with the other coronaviruses he added in other words the natural defense systems in our body that help us ward off flu are unlikely to apply here luis ostrosky a member of the infectious diseases society of america said humans have a herd immunity to flu when there are enough people in the community who are immune it protects people who are not immune he said that is the case with flu but not with covid 19 ostrosky said this is especially critical when there are no vaccines or therapeutic treatments for a virus both can be spread from person to person through droplets in the air from an infected person coughing sneezing or talking wrote lisa maragakis the senior director of infection prevention at johns hopkins medicine in baltimore based on the estimated distance that viruses travel scientists recommend people stay at least six feet away from one another in enclosed public spaces in the meantime the virus continues to spread likely helped by younger healthier people who have mild symptoms or who are asymptomatic passing it onto those in the higher risk categories unlike coronavirus according to the cdc children younger than five years old especially those younger than two are at high risk of developing serious flu related complications governments around the world are racing to stem the spread of covid 19 in an interview on march 27 with trevor noah host of the daily show on comedy central viac 1 17 fauci said even though you are young you are not absolutely invulnerable fauci said there are cases of young people in the 20s 30s 40s requiring intensive care so if you think you re completely invulnerable you re incorrect dispatches from the front lines of a pandemic the lack of an all island response has also rattled communities on both sides of the irish border pubs close due to coronavirus government issues new strict rules for funerals estimates of coronavirus fatality rates vary depending on the sample size country and source the upshot is until testing is more widely available it s hard to know for sure so what percentage of patients who test positive could die the answer is to say the lest foggy one thing most estimates agree on it s far higher than the flu estimates vary from 1 to 2 some even higher covid 19 rates may fall closer to those of the flu assuming many more people are infected jama released a paper earlier this month analyzing data from the chinese center for disease control and prevention on 72 314 covid 19 cases in mainland china last month the largest such sample of this kind the sample s overall case fatality rate was 2 3 in line with the earlier estimates a study published by nature earlier this month said the fatality rate was up to 1 4 using a sample size of 48 557 as of feb 19 but the authors cautioned the precise fatality risk estimates may not be generalizable to those outside the original epicenter especially during subsequent phases of the epidemic as coronavirus spreads it threatens to put a much greater burden on health systems than flu does the jama study said fatality rates also varied dramatically depending on the age of the individual no deaths occurred in those 9 and younger but cases in those aged 70 to 79 carried an 8 fatality rate and those aged 80 years and older had a fatality rate of 14 8 the fatality rate was 49 among critical cases and elevated among those with pre existing conditions to between 5 6 and 10 3 depending on the condition other differences between coronavirus and flu lie in what we don t know adults with the flu which has an average incubation period of two days can infect others 24 hours before symptoms develop and five to seven days after becoming sick the novel coronavirus has a median incubation period of 5 1 days longer than those of other human coronaviruses three days that cause the common cold coronavirus appears to be transmitted with ease to around 2 3 people by each person infected in the community said antigone barton the editor of sciencespeaks a medical website drug companies and the medical community she said are scrambling to come up with a vaccine before more people die and health services are overwhelmed with sick people showing up at their doors the potential demand for hospital beds ventilators masks and medications and the pressure all of this would put on staff worries her because there s no proven therapy or vaccine barton said as coronavirus spreads it threatens to put a much greater burden on health systems than flu does and greater than most or many are prepared for this story was updated with new coronavirus data how covid 19 is
