britain germany russia and china scrambling to save the nuclear deal state department officials denied charges that the new u s blueprint amounted to a policy of regime change for iran s mullahs this is a very reasonable and realistic list brian hook senior policy adviser to mr pompeo told fox news these are all positions that the u s and our european allies have held at one time or another mr hook said the trump administration was planning a summit of like minded nations to start implementing the tougher stance against iran the speech sparked a swift rejection from tehran where iranian president hassan rouhani a major supporter of the 2015 deal reacted with defiance who are you to decide for iran and the world mr rouhani told iranian state media the world today does not accept america to decide for the world as countries are independent that era is over iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif dismissed washington s strategy as a sham and said tehran is working with the other countries to keep the deal alive the key audience for mr pompeo s speech may have been france germany and britain which have been trying to keep iran from pulling out of the deal while determining whether they can still work with mr trump on a new accord all three noted that international inspectors affirmed that iran has honored its commitments to curb its nuclear programs but they fear a revival of american sanctions could cause the entire deal to collapse british foreign secretary boris johnson warned that the trump administration s jumbo iran negotiation seeking so many concessions on so many fronts from iran would be very very difficult to achieve in anything like a reasonable timetable european countries are trying to find ways to shield their companies from u s sanctions while russia and china insist they will continue to do business with tehran major european companies have begun buckling however french energy giant total s a danish tanker operator maersk and german insurer allianz last week announced plans to wind down business in iran because of fears of renewed u s sanctions loser deal mr pompeo a longtime critic of the 2015 nuclear deal when he was in congress argued that the obama administration had made a catastrophically bad bet that iran would moderate its activities and other military programs after the nuclear deal was signed the accord he said in his address to the heritage foundation proved to be a loser with huge negative repercussions throughout the middle east the plan permitted the iranian regime to use money from the nuclear deal to boost the economic fortunes of a struggling people but the regime s leaders refused to do so he said instead the government spent its newfound treasure fueling proxy wars across the middle east mr pompeo did not specifically address whether washington was pursuing regime change but he said iran s rulers faced some tough questions next year marks the 40th anniversary of the islamic revolution in iran mr pompeo said at this milestone we have to ask what has the revolution given the iranian people the regime reaps a harvest of suffering and death in the middle east at the expense of its own people mr hook told fox news that the u s government was not explicitly seeking to overthrow the islamic republic the only thing we want to see changed is the behavior of the iranian regime he said but after a speech laden with tough rhetoric and veiled threats mr pompeo held out the prospect of a new deal with iran if tehran complied including the end of all sanctions full diplomatic relations and even economic aid israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu praised the trump administration s tough stance no enrichment tough sanctions and iran should get out of syria mr netanyahu said we

policy chief federica mogherini said mr pompeo has not shown how resolving any of iran s problematic non nuclear activities would be easier outside of the deal secretary pompeo s speech has not demonstrated how walking away from the nuclear deal has made or will make the region safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation or how it puts us in a better position to influence iran s conduct in areas outside the scope of the deal she said there is no alternative mr pompeo appeared to anticipate a negative first impression from the european allies and said it would make little difference for mr trump i know our allies in europe may try to keep the old nuclear deal going with tehran that is their decision to make mr pompeo s
