 las vegas nevada he d be crazy not to bring upthis investigative series especially since a most of the media had to be dragged into covering the story and tonight is trump s last big chance to make a direct and unfiltered pitch to tens of millions of voters and b two of the stars of project veritas show have been fired or resigned there s blood in the water scott foval got the axe on monday night then bob creamerfell on his sword the followingevening with both villains felled by their own conduct trump has a chance to take this story mainstream assuming moderator chris wallace doesn t beat him to the punch by challenging clinton about the outrageous actions of operatives who are directly tied to her campaign will he thetea leaves say yes and trump is now citing james o keefe because 2016 that tweet encapsulates the prevailing msm perspective that o keefe s reporting is a weird sideshow that should be ignored by the professionals but what those videos particularlythe first one depict is pretty explosive stuff and the subsequent firing and resignation haveonlyfueled the story because trump has been pre excusing his increasingly likely november loss with cries of rigging side note read this piece on that over broadcharge he ll probably be tempted to trumpetthe second clip which is being hailed by someas proof of widespread voter fraud by democrats who also confess tofixing elections for 50 years but i m afraidthere s a bit less to that video than meets the eye having watched it twice it s clear that the featuredshadowy characters have no compunction whatsoever about spitballing ideas on how to commit voter fraud on a mass scale but there s no smoking gun that they ve done so or are actively planningto do so foval speaks in theory about one if filled scheme which undercoverproject veritas investigators seem to be at least co hatching while creamer worries that our lawyers may raise reg flags about it foval later says creamer would have to be out of the loop wink wink on any follow through dreamer activistcesar vargas vaguely mentions the possibility of maybe entertaining a fraud push in 2018 at the end of the video but even that s hedged plus within its limited context it s not entirely clear to me thatfoval s half century remark referred to bussing in illegal voters as opposed to astroturfprotesters though he later discusses how one might transport illegal voters to another state without getting caught none of this is to say that this installment reflects well on any of its targets it most certainly does not at the very least they all appeartotally comfortable with the idea of fraud and foval s fertile imagination dreams up a number of methods to subvert election laws while making it difficult for authorities to prove wrongdoing for his part vargas mentions that perhaps this proposed form ofcheating would be more attractive if trump wins suggesting that perhaps it wouldn t feel as urgentif hillary clinton is elected because voter id laws would be loosened and we would have immigration reform it s all ugly andcynical and it would be illegal if there were any proof that they d actually done these things maybe such evidence is lurking in a yet unreleased video my point is that the extraordinary claim that massive voter fraud is rigging an entirenationwide election requires extraordinary concrete evidence to prove this video showcases thevery bad intentions and lack of scruples of some hardcore clinton aligned operators but falls far short of affirming trump sgrossly exaggerated implication to my eyes and ears the more airtight evidence is contained inthe original video which clearly demonstrates dnc and clinton contracted operatives deliberately trying to spark violent confrontations at trump rallies hoping that the media will pass the resulting fireworks off as genuine grassroots opposition to trump while blaming the hateful climate entirely on the gopcandidate which is precisely what happened it s all so deplorable tonight s third and last presidential debate begins at 9pm et and will last approximately90 minutes we ll have full team coverage right here at townhall it s getting to bekitchen sink time for donald trump but even if it weren t pressuring clinton to defend the seedy underbelly of her party and campaign would be worthwhile i ll be shocked if it doesn t come up and if hillary pushes back with predictablepearl clutchingabout trump s rhetoric eroding public faith in our electoralsystem which his ham fisted destructive theorizing actuallydoes he has an opportunity to turn the tables and highlight her selective outrage their agitators shut down a political rally by stoking fears of violence then they ll moan about trump undermining faith in the system https t co 8g3qodix1e buckle up for this evening s final round trump needs to reset the race launching moreharebrained complaints about rigging would be counter productive especially as he risks deflating on the centralattraction of his campaign when you relosing the change election question to hillary clinton you re really blowing it focus alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn
