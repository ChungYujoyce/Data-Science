attacks on president trump apos s pandemic preparedness drawing what could be one of the most consequential battle lines of the presidential race amid the coronavirus crisis a widely cited usa today fact check whichfoundthat the obama administration had allowed the n95 mask stockpile to deplete has become a flashpoint in that increasingly murky and numbers heavy debate in itsfiscal2011 budget submitted in early 2010 the obama administration explicitly sought a reduction in the sns cdc requests 523 533 000 for the strategic national stockpile in fy 2011 a decrease of 72 216 000 below the fy 2010 omnibus the budget request reads the document went on to make clear that 68 515 000 would separately be transferred to the sns from the fiscal2009 appropriation for an h1n1 related fund meaning that overall the strategic stockpile would receive 592 048 000 a reduction of only a few milliondollars from the previous year a top biden adviser told fox news on thursday that the fiscal 2011 budget was almost identical to the previous year apos s budget and pointed out that the 2011 cuts constituted a reduction of less than 1 percentage point president donald trump listens as dr deborah birx white house coronavirus response coordinator speaks during a coronavirus task force briefing at the white house sunday april 5 2020 in washington ap photo patrick semansky the obama administration alsosought a 47 572 million cut to the stockpile infiscal 2013 a 38 190 million cut to the stockpile in fiscal2014 and a smaller drop of at least several million dollarsin fiscal 2015 however the budget control act legislation passed after the tea party wave mandatinga bipartisan super committee find ways to cut discretionary spending or else trigger across the board cuts known as sequestration became law in august 2011and influenced those cuts the biden campaign told fox news indeed the obama administration apos s budget requests implicitly reference the budget control act several times the fiscal2013 budget for example states that the current fiscal climate necessitates scaling back even though the sns is a key resource and the fiscal 2015 budget states cdc has always sought to maximize the effectiveness of resources and investments and is even more focused on doing so in the current fiscal environment inside george w bush apos s push to prevent a pandemic and where we went wrong even as those cuts took place the biden advisertold fox news the obama administration worked to modernize the strategic stockpile the line by linebudget cuts the adviser said could mislead because the qualitative story of the stockpile of those years is actually one of modernization particularly concerning the massproduction of masks and the ability to reuse masks those plans weren apos t acted on by the trump administration the biden adviser said not so the trump campaign counters sleepy joe doesn t want to accept responsibility for leaving america unprepared for a pandemic but the facts are the facts trump campaign deputy director of communications matt wolking told fox news biden made no effort to replenish the supply of masks in the strategic national stockpile after the 2009 swine flu despite multiple warnings from experts wolking continued biden s administration also repeatedly tried to cut funding for the stockpile including before any budget caps existed regardless the obama biden budget proposals repeatedly ignored the caps so they are no excuse biden s defenses simply don t hold water the ebola and zika virus outbreaks prompted the obama administration to seek budget supplementals that could have replenished the sns by2016 but securing congressional authorization proved challenging in 2016 when congress green lit funds to combat thezika virus the cdc received less than half of what the obama administration sought the trump administration apos s fiscal 2021budget request released in february said the stockpile apos s funding should be maintained at 705 million fox news has reported that the george w bush administration was heavily focused on pandemic response beginning in 2005 including by greatly expanding the stockpile and implementing war games and regular briefings but those efforts weren apos t maintained in the following decade in its own statement to fox news the biden campaign took aim squarely at the current administration while blaming congress for past budget constraints the obama biden administration maintained consistent funding for the strategic national stockpile in the midst of a massive budget squeeze put together a white house office and comprehensive playbook focused on pandemic response and successfully handled dangerous outbreaks in 2009 and 2014 biden campaign spokesperson michael gwin told fox news dems journos change tune after hitting trump on china travel ban instead of building on the strong foundation left to him by the obama biden administration trump scrapped the office threw out the playbook and wasted months ignoring the threat of the coronavirus instead of securing ventilators personal protective equipment and other life saving supplies gwin continued a man wearing a mask walks through new york s times square thursday april 9 2020 during the coronavirus epidemic ap photo mark lennihan trump counters that the obama biden administration left his own with empty cupboards a politifact analysis notes that while the inventory was not actually bare there still was not enough to handle the coronavirus pandemic particularly when it came to n95 masks depleted in the wake of h1n1 recalling the budget battles of the prior administration the analysis notes stockpile funding dropped to its lowest level in 2013 about 477 million but those levels have steadily grown since including under trump the trump campaign has also arguedthat biden hasmisstated trump apos s record and mishandled the crisis for example biden condemned trump apos s xenophobia shortly after he announced a restriction on travel from china on jan 31 although the biden team has denied that the former vice president was referring specifically to the travel ban those travel restrictions have been adopted by other countries and experts credit them with saving lives johns hopkins u s more prepared for pandemic than any other country additionally biden hasclaimedthat trump himself successfully slashed the cdc budget and biden has suggested that he would never pursue similar cuts the associated presshas notedthat those claims distort the facts with factcheck orgpointing outthat cdc funding has actually increased under the current administration largely because congress insisted on maintaining funding levels for both cdc and the national institutes of health nih even as the trump administration sought the cdc cuts nevertheless speaking to abc news apos this week on march 1 bidenclaimed they ve cut the funding for the cdc biden stepped up his attacks on social media as
