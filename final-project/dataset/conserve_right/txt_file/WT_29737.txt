help set up an anti terrorism office a series of promotions over the next 18 years at what is now called customs and border protection culminated sunday when president donald trump named mcaleenan to serve as acting homeland security secretary when nielsen leaves office later this week top stories trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens it is in some ways an unusual choice trump and his supporters have railed against both obama administration policies and career government officials but in picking mcaleenan trump will have as his point person on politically charged border issues someone who served as a top obama administration immigration official in addition to serving under president george w bush yet mcaleenan appears to have endeared himself to trump who tweeted sunday i have confidence that kevin will do a great job while avoiding fire breathing ideological rhetoric and keeping a relatively low profile mcaleenan played a critical role executing some of trump s most controversial policies as customs and border protection commissioner he helped put in practice a zero tolerance policy on illegal entries that caused thousands of children to be separated from their families at the border he also oversaw the rapid spread of a practice to limit the number of asylum seekers who can enter the country at border crossings with mexico which he blames on processing constraints he has also shown strong interest in understanding why large numbers of central american families are coming to the u s traveling to guatemala s western highlands last year on a fact finding mission he put renewed emphasis on providing medical attention to migrants after two guatemalan children died in u s custody but mcaleenan angered many democrats when he didn t mention the death of one of those children a girl during congressional testimony last year rep joaquin castro a texas democrat and chairman of the congressional hispanic caucus said he called for mcaleenan s resignation after the omission which mcaleenan said was an effort to avoid politicizing the little girl s death he cannot be trusted as acting dhs secretary based on his record of prioritizing trump s harmful policies that undermine national security and the economy and hurt vulnerable families and children at the border castro said the hispanic caucus will continue to hold the trump administration accountable for its actions against immigrants and against the will of the american people still mcaleenan was confirmed as customs and border protection commissioner on a 77 19 senate vote last year and has won praise from former colleagues and politicians across the political spectrum for his sharp intellect as commissioner he oversaw 60 000 employees and managed an annual budget of more than 13 billion kevin is a true patriot said gil kerlikowske customs and border protection commissioner from 2014 to 2017 and former police chief in seattle and buffalo new york he s incredibly smart he s got a great intellect he s very thoughtful and he has a level of integrity and honesty that is very impressive in my whole career i can probably count on one hand the number of people that i ve worked with that have reached kevin s level in all of those areas jay ahern acting head of customs and border protection in the administration of george w bush said mcaleenan is a quick study who can recall important data when he needs it he praised mcaleenan s humility as border chief you want someone who has a certain amount of compassion for the people they encounter ahern said you have to have that humanitarian side to be a leader for this that may be at odds with the president s hardline policies ahern said but kevin has the ability to be very flexible and understanding of the political direction and can strike that right balance mcaleenan says was influenced at university of chicago law school in the 1990s by a professor gidon gottlieb who warned that that the u s was ill prepared for a terrorist attack he pounded the table and basically said we re waiting for a pearl harbor style terrorist attack mcaleenan told the ap he was right unfortunately after working on counterterrorism issues he supervised customs and border protection operations at los angeles international airport from 2006 to 2008 the best job i ll ever have he said in the 2017 interview from there he steadily climbed the ranks white house spokesman hogan gidley said monday that mcaleenan is extremely knowledgeable and wants to work with trump to put the president s policies into effect there s no daylight between the two of em
