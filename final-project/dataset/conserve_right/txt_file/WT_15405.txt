to steal military secrets for beijing s program to build and operate aircraft carriers the russian national aleksandr yermakov was blocked from attempting to transfer to china classified data that would have significantly accelerated the chinese army s effort to field its own operational aircraft carrier according to reports in the ukrainian newspaper segodnya and other news outlets china s military announced last year that it had begun construction of its first aircraft carrier confirming pentagon and u s intelligence reports that beijing was seeking the power projection platform that requires highly skilled pilots who can take off and land from the relatively short space of a carrier deck at sea top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots u s and defense and intelligence officials said china s deployment of an aircraft carrier would pose significant problems for u s plans to defend democratic taiwan if the communist mainland were to use force to retake the island which broke away after china s civil war it not only extends the range of chinese strike aircraft that would take out taiwanese military installations but it also would complicate u s navy assistance of the republic of china s defense if the mainland should attack said a naval officer and chinese carrier program specialist assigned to the pentagon china s intelligence service directed yermakov to steal classified information about ukraine s land based naval aviation testing and training complex or nitka its russian acronym according to reports the facility is in the crimea near the city of saki and was built when ukraine was a part of the soviet union it remains the only training complex of its kind in the world the nitka base is vital for states that operate one of the russian designed carriers equipped with ski ramp takeoff decks instead of the flat decks used on u s and french aircraft carriers the only two ski jump carriers are the russian navy s admiral kuznetsov and its sister ship the varyag acquired by china from ukraine in 1998 and initially announced in china for use as a floating casino russia continues training its pilots in ukraine while building a similar facility in the krasnodarsky krai region of russia that is expected to be completed in 2012 ukraine s security service sbu took the unusual step of going public regarding yermakov s spying activities on behalf of china and his long term association with chinese intelligence a counterintelligence officer who spoke to news outlets and who was identified only as oleg n stated that yermakov was assisted by his 35 year old son yermakov s son also named aleksandr registered an off shore zoned company that provided services in the sphere of arms deliveries the profile of the company was the providing a full spectrum of military technical testing methods and design information based on the initiatives of received orders said the sbu counterintelligence officer arms trading firms registered in cyprus often

industry known widely in western intelligence and security circles for illicit acquisition of defense related technology in the former soviet union at the request of his beijing comrades he had identified former military personnel defense industry specialists from russia ukraine and other nations of the former soviet union to travel to china to participate in scientific seminars and symposiums which were organized under the guise of tourist excursions for each one of these tourists yermakov received up to 1 500 said the sbu china has been recruiting former soviet military specialists since the fall of the soviet union and russian and ukrainian authorities have tolerated the practice however collecting classified and commercially proprietary information on nitka was strictly illegal espionage and the payoff for yermakov was considerably greater than his long running tourist business chinese intelligence promised to pay the russian father son team 1 million for the delivery of documentation on this training facility and its operations in the form of drawings digital photos information on flash drives the sbu said as preparation for the operation yermakov s son made several trips to the people s republic of china where he visited people s liberation army navy facilities and met with their representatives the sbu and diplomatic sources told segodnya the

information had a value to the national interests of ukraine in the hundreds of millions of dollars china s navy acquired the varyag from the ukrainian nikolayev shipyards in 1998 for 20 million using a chinese tourism company as a cover for the sale the original chinese buyers promised that the ship would be turned into a casino and entertainment complex to be moored at the former portuguese
