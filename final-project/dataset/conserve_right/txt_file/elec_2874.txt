to mention his connections to wall street and wealthy donors such as the koch brothers some republicans said these criticisms went over the line top stories coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history australian researchers see virus design manipulation you are not going to die from covid 19 as a 20 year veteran of national politics having worked with bill clinton edward m kennedy and other high profile democrats ms cutter can sense moments in the campaign when there is blood in the water and it s time to go for the jugular last week she came under intense partisan fire for suggesting that mr romney may have committed a felony by having his name remain on bain capital s sec filings years after he said he ended active involvement with the private equity firm the remark has been the source of escalating acrimony between the obama and romney camps mr romney has denied any wrongdoing and personally demanded an apology but the obama campaign insists that ms cutter isn t walking back her comments in any way she raised the question about whether he was misleading the american people or misleading himself to the sec obama campaign spokesman ben labolt told the washington times the only person who is walking anything back or has changed his tune is mitt romney who is now saying that he was no longer involved in day to day operations at bain after 1999 either way the damage had been done with ms cutter s felony remark having gone viral on liberal and conservative blogs alike learning from clinton ms cutter can thank mr clinton an early political mentor and master of rapid response for her aggressive shoot from the hip style having served him as deputy communications director in the white house in the 1990s but her abrasive style has proved a liability at times she can

for their discipline in sticking to the party s preferred message and enforcing a consistent line of attack can be a positive trait in a communications strategist but the flip side is often failing to switch gears and react to developments or allow voices of dissent to be heard in a 2007 piece for politico ms cutter outlined her new lessons for flacks as the parties were gearing up for the 2008 presidential battle among her basic rules of the road the concept of off the record is extinct leaks kill pay attention to the state you re campaigning in and have your closing argument written before the campaign begins comeback ms cutter has her fair share of detractors who still remember her tenure as communications director for john f kerry s losing presidential bid in 2004 in the end the kerry camp devolved as so many failed campaigns do into infighting and recriminations and ms cutter with a reputation for being difficult and sometimes demeaning to reporters and colleagues alike was the
