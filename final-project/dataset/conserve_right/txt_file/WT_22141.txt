previously left untouched on monday china hit back it revealed that it had stopped buying u s farm products a severe blow to trump supporters in rural america beijing s central bank also allowed the

element into the mix we haven t been on this terrain since the 1930s said joe brusuelas chief economist at the consultancy rsm trump has made clear he wants to see the u s dollar drop against the yuan the euro and other currencies that s one reason he s applied relentless pressure to the federal reserve to cut u s interest rates a move that tends to drive the dollar lower the fed last week cut its key interest rate for first time in a decade the president has signaled that he has no problem with a weaker dollar said joe manimbo senior market analyst at western union business solutions this is certainly unprecedented in modern times turning a trade war into a currency war heightens the danger it shifts the battlefield to currency markets where policymakers have much less control currency wars take on a life of their own brusuelas said in the 1997 1998 asian financial crisis traders dumped asian currencies and delivered devastating recessions to thailand indonesia and south korea where borrowers struggled to repay u s dollar denominated loans and left local banks drowning in bad debt indeed a dollar versus yuan fight is unlikely to remain confined to the united states and china if other countries see chinese or u s exporters gaining a currency advantage they ll feel pressure to respond by pushing their currencies lower too the idea that the u s is going to be able to engage in dollar devaluation that adversely impacts the yuan without adversely impacting other trading partners is sheer fantasy brusuelas said currency wars are guaranteed not to stay two party affairs in the
