 sign in president could have saved american lives but didn t manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion president obama has been caught in a web of deception that threatens to ensnarl his re election bid multiple emails and diplomatic cables reveal that the administration deliberately deceived the public libyagate haunts mr obama relentlessly eroding his credibility and trustworthiness it is a stake aimed at the heart of his presidency for nearly two weeks the obama team claimed the attack on the u s compound in benghazi resulted from spontaneous protests in response to an anti muslim video that was false and mr obama knew it several senior state department officials testified at congressional hearings that there were no protests on sept 11 2012 in fact our diplomatic mission had been quiet all day moreover the state department was monitoring the compound practically in real time on video state department officials witnessed scores of armed men breach the consulate and begin shooting at our diplomats the officials obvious conclusion it was a terrorist assault within 24 hours the cia s station chief in libya also reported jihadists had perpetrated the attack the latest evidence however is a bombshell two hours after the assault began the state department sent an email to numerous agencies including the white house situation room that ansar al sharia a terrorist group affiliated with al qaeda had claimed responsibility the email went directly to the white house s executive office the president s inner circle in other words from nearly the beginning mr obama knew the benghazi attack was a terrorist atrocity yet he insisted on blaming a phantom protest and an obscure youtube video he misled the public in a desperate attempt to cover up his administration s colossal failure top stories purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces why the answer is cynical politics one of mr obama s central campaign narratives is that he killed osama bin laden and badly degraded al qaeda the benghazi attack however directly contradicts the administration s position rather than being in retreat al qaeda is on the rise pakistan afghanistan yemen somalia mali iraq and libya the islamic fascist network has been expanding its safe havens and jihadist activity in every one of these nations in particular libya has been transformed into a failed islamist state contrary to media spin mr obama s military intervention in libya has been a disaster jihadists roam the countryside targeting minorities and seeking to impose shariah law more than 20 000 weapons formerly controlled by late strongman moammar gadhafi were stolen by al qaeda militants the country s eastern provinces are nearly in open revolt fueled by a muslim insurgency in fact the benghazi attack occurred for one primary reason mr obama s war has made libya safe for radical islam hence the president feared that the truth about his libyan intervention would come out the result is that ambassador j christopher stevens was murdered along with three other u s diplomatic personnel mr obama has american blood on his hands the sept 11 2012 terror plot was not the first one the administration engaged in willful blindness to the islamist reality in benghazi our consulate had been attacked in april and june britain withdrew its diplomatic mission because of the surging violence the red cross shut down its operations as well moreover american officials repeatedly asked for enhanced security at the compound the requests were denied in his diary and several cables stevens complained about the growing jihadist violence that threatened his staff to no avail they were sacrificed on the altar of mr obama s multilateral interventionism and political ambitions the real tragedy is that perhaps the dead americans could have been saved the attack lasted more than six hours a u s drone was directly over the compound conducting surveillance american fighter jets and ac 130 gunships were less than 450 miles away a massive rapid response should have been ordered to defend the consulate instead mr obama did nothing the reason he did not want to violate libyan sovereignty without the permission of the government in tripoli he abandoned our personnel to be butchered like sheep by rampaging islamists the benghazi atrocity was not simply an assault on americans it was an act of war against america itself embassies and consulates are sovereign territory or at least they re supposed to be when jihadists breached our compound it was the equivalent of storming a government building in washington boston or new york they were invading american soil shedding american blood on behalf of a holy war against the west mr obama knew it was terrorism but he refused to order a military response he systematically perpetrated a cover up and a manipulation campaign for this alone he deserves to be defeated in november he is unfit to be our president jeffrey t kuhner is a columnist at the washington times and host of the kuhner report on wrko am 680 www wrko com in boston manage newsletters
