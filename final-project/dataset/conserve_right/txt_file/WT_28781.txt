ing home policy florida race for house seat becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn six months into his first term mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador has proved a study in contradictions pragmatic and ideological soft spoken and uncompromising omnipresent but hard to pin down but the leftist firebrand s unexpected and most consistent trait since taking office has been an almost deferential soft touch approach to his american counterpart whose hispanophobia mr lopez obrador routinely derided throughout his 2018 presidential run and in a book he titled listen up trump the man who in mid 2017 told a los angeles crowd that he would enforce our sovereign authority by turning mexico s diplomatic missions into authentic law offices to defend migrants now says president trump has a vision i respect and consider legitimate top stories trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid lopez obrador watchers say the president long a confrontational figure on the mexican political scene has turned into a shrinking violet out of prudence and political reality he has become one of a number of world leaders who have apparently decided the best way to handle mr trump s most incendiary tweets is to ignore them in a striking case last month mr trump raged on twitter when mexican soldiers drew their guns on u s troops in a confusing confrontation along the border he said the clash was probably a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers from mexico city crickets mr lopez obrador later blandly promised reporters that his government would investigate the incident to me it s prudence on his part said jose del tronco of mexico city s latin american social sciences institute believe it or not foreign policy often depends on one on one diplomacy on how presidents get along the mexican leader s change of heart also may be born of necessity three fourths of his country s exports go to the united states and ratification of the updated nafta trade deal signed the day before he took office in december may hinge largely on mr trump s enthusiasm for pushing it through congress lopez obrador needs to negotiate many things with the administration and doesn t want to predispose trump negatively mr del tronco said he doesn t have much to gain from confrontation but probably much to lose thus when mr trump threatened last month to close down the u s mexico over what he said was mexico s failure to stop migrant caravans mr lopez obrador not usually known as a man of few words all but refused to comment also as washington upped the ante to oust socialist venezuelan president nicolas maduro at least in theory an ideological ally whom mr lopez obrador invited to his inauguration the mexican president sidestepped that minefield with bland calls against meddling despite his reputation over the decades as a leftist populist unafraid to disrupt the mexican political establishment it s restraint that the 65 year old former mexico city mayor and three time presidential contender has perfected through a political career he kicked off in the late 1980s lopez obrador has a quieter character if you will he s a man from the country mr del tronco said he noticed that confrontation is not a good strategy in mexico there s an adage that says he who gets upset loses although polls show that up to 80 of mexicans support the president whom most simply call by his initials amlo his pragmatism has nonetheless disappointed some spoiling for a more confrontational attitude toward the pugnacious american president with trump amlo betrays his principles leading mexican daily el universal titled a scathing editorial last month fearful faint hearted and at times even cynical mexico s president on this front is not the man of principle he always promised to be they occupy opposite ends of the political spectrum but mr trump and mr lopez obrador are not polar opposites in every respect much like his american counterpart mr lopez obrador seems to have little use for the news media he doesn t call it fake but fifi a slang term that translates to elite or snobby trump s and lopez obrador s way of conceiving the political system is similar in their kind of contempt of the traditional political class mr del tronco said donald trump is much more of an outsider president of course but that s a similarity taking further inspiration perhaps mr lopez obrador in march used a rally of supporters in the veracruz town of poza rica to reject criticisms of his early months in office raise your hand if you believe i need to reply every time president donald trump talks about mexico he challenged his audience drawing cries of no these are my people the president approvingly observed domestic agenda although his amicable dealings with washington have proved a surprisingly easy sell troubles moving an ambitious domestic agenda increasingly threaten to turn into a headache for mexico city s new boss though he signed a much anticipated labor reform bill giving workers collective bargaining rights this month resistance in the senate hampers the equally high profile rollback of former president enrique pena nieto s 2013 education reform the upper house will likely reconsider the proposal after rejecting it may 1 it s unclear whether the president who spends much of his time zigzagging the country on commercial flights will find time to work the phones ahead of the vote although his trademark morning news conferences define the day s domestic debate the freewheeling mr lopez obrador again like mr trump can be his agenda s own worst enemy said rodrigo paez of the national autonomous university in mexico city he exposes himself a lot too much i believe because he talks too much mr paez said he puts such a priority on direct contact with the people he s basically a 24 hour president which is also a little worrisome in the all important fight against rampant violent crime a 10 hike in homicide rates during his first three months in office quickly called mr lopez obrador s efficacy into question just as he was pushing a controversial plan for national guard police units the president must be careful to not ignite an all out drug war mr paez said at the same time if he wants to end a vicious cycle he must fix mexico s structural problems and lack of public safety said johns hopkins university economist steve hanke in a place like mexico not doing much is a disaster the status quo is pretty much unacceptable mr hanke said you want mexico strong not weak you want mexico safe not unsafe but investors still widely perceive mr lopez obrador as not a free market friendly man and his populist proposals such as renationalizing key parts of the oil industry are precisely the wrong recipe mr hanke said a recent uptick in youth unemployment numbers is already sending an ominous message you ve got a bunch of young people who can t get jobs well what do they do mr hanke asked they go into the underground economy they go into the criminality they go someplace they ve got to eat the trump administration he said has shown little enthusiasm for helping jump start mexico s economy an impression underlined this month by a 17 5 tariff on mexican tomato imports as the nafta replacement agreement languished on capitol hill even that announcement couldn t draw the lopez obrador government into an open break with mr trump luz maria de la mora a top trade adviser to the president told reporters in mexico city that she felt disappointed by the move but the good news she said i
