apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic sen lindsey graham s emergence as president trump s horse whisperer has likely helped cement his position among south carolina republicans but democrats say it s created an opening for them to take his seat in 2020 it would be a stunning upset in a solidly red state where mr graham won last time with 55 percent of the vote but democrats say the senator appears to be grasping at mr trump s coattails in a bid for attention that has undercut his reputation as a maverick and could potentially cost him the support of crossover democrats and middle of the road independents top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots to me it just comes across that what s most important for lindsey is not his role as senator said jaime harrison former chairman of the state democratic party and a likely graham challenger it is whether he is in the mix whether there is a microphone or tv camera there for lindsey that is what it means to be relevant others see mr graham s bond with the president in more nuanced light saying he s been an equal opportunity enrager over his career there is an almost schizophrenic way that lindsey graham has handled his politics in recent years said charlie cook of the cook political report watching graham is like watching a sailboat tacking first to port then to starboard then to port then back to starboard repeating again and again those tacks include having been an impeachment manager in the case against president bill clinton then siding with the ultimate maverick sen john mccain earning the nickname lindsey grahamnesty for his work on immigration yet delivering the most forceful defenses of mr trump s judicial nominees his emergency wall building declaration and his foreign policy the support has overshadowed his critique of mr trump s decision to disengage in syria and his response to the violent white nationalists rally in charlottesville in 2017 when i don t agree with the president i will tell him mr graham told the washington times but i unashamedly want him to be successful and got a good working relationship with him and i think that is overall a benefit it s likely a smart place to be in a state that hasn t voted democratic in a presidential election since jimmy carter carried it in 1976 and where his bigger electoral challenges have come in the primary chip felkel a south carolina based gop strategist said mr graham is a political pragmatist who recognizes that he won t lose as much as support as he gains from the relationship the challenge for graham was always expected to be the right in a primary mr felkel said he has shored that up the friendship between the veteran senator and the political outsider seemed unlikely during the 2016 presidential campaign particularly after mr trump mocked the idea that mr mccain mr graham s best friend on capitol hill was a hero for getting captured during the vietnam war by the time the dust settled mr graham had called mr trump a race baiting xenophobic bigot and mr trump had shared mr graham s cellphone number at a campaign rally forcing him to get new digits president trump and i did not start off well mr graham said with a chuckle this month at the conservative political action conference i remember meeting him after he got elected and saying hey lindsey i don t have your phone number and i said there is a reason for that so i have given him my phone number and trust me he uses it and i couldn t be more proud of the fact that he talks to me and he asks my opinion and we have a lot in common now i like him and he likes him mr graham said mr harrison who has been encouraged to run by senate minority leader charles e schumer said the key to defeating mr graham is to win over the independents conservative democrats and moderate republicans who held their noses while voting for mr trump those people are not the biggest fans of donald trump and the rhetoric of donald trump and those people are asking what has happened to lindsey graham mr harrison said as long as he wants to tie himself to donald trump that is great but you take the good with the bad and there is a lot of bad mr graham welcomes the possible fight with mr harrison saying that matchup would offer voters a choice of candidates with clear differences on issues like the confirmation of supreme court justice brett m kavanaugh here s the deal mr graham told the times he thinks that what i did in kavanaugh was bad i think it was good i voted for democratic nominees and i never thought of doing to them what they did to kavanaugh and i think most south carolinians are going to see it the way i do and we should all want our president to be suc
