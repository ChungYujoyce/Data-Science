meeting like that it should not involve a surprise a jack in the box pop out of a circus tent meeting seven weeks after the loss said radd seiger a retired lawyer who is a neighbor of the family and accompanied them to the white house for this to happen you would want some heavy duty therapy and you want to meet in a neutral environment trump told reporters wednesday that he thought the family had wanted to meet with sacoolas but that they weren t ready for it tuesday it was very sad to be honest he said of their conversation they lost their son trump said he had spoken with sacoolas and that she had been waiting in a room just off the oval office when he made the offer to dunn s family they weren t ready for it trump said but i did offer i spoke with boris he asked me if i d do that and i did it trump said referring to british prime minister boris johnson unfortunately when we had everybody together they decided not to meet perhaps they had lawyers involved by that time i don t know exactly pressed on why he thought that was something they would welcome trump said that based on what i saw they wanted to meet but now they say they only want to meet if they re in the u k and that ll be up to them but i did meet the family and i expressed condolences on behalf of our country trump also said sacoolas told him that she had been driving on the wrong side of the road accidentally something trump said happens in europe because drivers in england drive on the left side of the road instead of the right trump told reporters last week that he had once done so himself harry dunn 19 was killed in august when his motorcycle collided with a car allegedly driven by sacoolas outside a british air force base in southern england used by the u s military seiger said the family received a call from the white house on tuesday inviting them to meet with a very senior government official whose identity was not revealed they immediately got on a train to washington the mood was quite buoyant we were looking forward to it he told the associated press in a telephone interview from manhattan where the family returned after the oval office meeting instead the family was subjected to what seiger described as a high pressure effort to convince them to meet with sacoolas against their will a characterization the white house rejected we were ambushed he said of the situation putting most of the blame on o brien who replaced former national security adviser john bolton last month after serving as the president s chief hostage negotiator when we said no he erupted in fury in front of my poor people this guy was a thug and he was intimidating seiger said on the other hand seiger gave trump credit for demonstrating what he believed was genuine sympathy for the family s circumstances he held charles hand at one point and agreed to try to find a way to help her he was absolutely charming seiger said of trump he was very warm and offered a strong handshake and embrace he made them feel comfortable and i was very impressed with his personal touch but as soon as trump expressed his condolences seiger said the president immediately suggested a meeting with sacoolas something the family was unprepared for very quickly there was a change seiger recounted we re all here together i ve got mrs sacoolas here in the building and you guys are the building let s all meet he quoted trump as saying seiger said the family is still emotionally vulnerable and that they were taken aback while trump appeared to understand their reluctance he said o brien continued to insist even after they made clear that any meeting would have to happen back in britain finally i said mr president this meeting is not happening today if it happens it will be back in the u k that s when o brien erupted his face went all red and i thought he was going to lunge at me seiger recounted he was sitting about three feet away from charlotte and said angrily she is never going back never white house spokeswoman stephanie grisham rejected that characterization and said that after the family declined the meeting no one asked again trump s intent was to do all he could to comfort the victims of a tragic accident she said adding that no one in that room was angry it was a quiet and respectful meeting sacoolas left britain shortly after the crash though police released a statement saying she had previously told them she had no plans to depart dunn s parents have been pressing for sacoolas to return to britain she needs to come back and face the justice system she needs to do this for herself for us she needs do this for her children set a good example to her children stand up to your mistakes charles said in an interview with cbs a statement previously released on sacoolas behalf said she intended to continue cooperating with authorities anne is devastated by this tragic accident no loss compares to the death of a child and anne extends her deepest
