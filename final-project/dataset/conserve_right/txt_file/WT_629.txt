going to go away wrong donald though never onstage with his rivals before wednesday night the former new york mayor has built support in national polls though huge expenditures on polished television

reported spending 409 million through the first nine weeks of his presidential campaign including 220 million last month alone still there were signs that his debate performance shook the confidence of would be supporters who just 24 hours earlier believed bloomberg might be the ideal candidate for the democratic party s anxious establishment to rally behind instead a new reality began to settle in at least among some prominent donors and political operatives who acknowledged a stark divide between the strength of bloomberg the brand and bloomberg the candidate i ve never seen a billionaire get disemboweled before but good god that was bad said boyd brown a south carolina based democratic strategist who was considering backing bloomberg earlier in the week i don t see how he bounces back from that some prominent donors weren t impressed either rufus gifford a leading fundraiser for both of barack obama s presidential campaigns said as a biden supporter but also someone who respects

dismissing bloomberg after one debate given his extraordinary political assets organization a sophisticated data operation and an unlimited bank account yet the myth of bloomberg has been replaced by a new reality elizabeth warren skinned him alive in front of the nation and if you can t beat fauxcahontas in february you re not going to beat donald trump in october bannon said the leading

advisers declined to respond to requests for comment though immediately after the debate campaign manager kevin sheekey noted that bloomberg hadn t debated in more than a decade he was just warming up

held accountable i have really had it with billionaires regardless of party who think that the rules don t apply to them she said in the debate warren pressed bloomberg to say how many nondisclosure

democrat sanders the self described democratic socialist who has emerged as the front runner in the party s nomination fight bloomberg warned that his party may very well be on the way to nominating somebody who cannot win in november and if we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base like sen sanders it will be a fatal error and ignoring his own poor debate debut he declared himself best positioned to defeat trump in this fall s general election we all know that trump is a bully but i say i m a new yorker and i know how to deal with bullies i did it all the time bloomberg said i m not afraid of trump and he knows it and he sees our poll numbers and he is scared voters won t have a chance to prove bloomberg right or wrong until march 3 also known as super tuesday when he will appear

liberal for her personally but she s not sure he can beat trump bloomberg s debate performance didn t scare her away from bloomberg i watched the debate i thought he got picked on parrish said he didn
