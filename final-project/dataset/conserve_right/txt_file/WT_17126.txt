to me he promised me that he was going to china for a month and would come back so that we can take care of our baby together she said i was six months pregnant when he left the country across africa china has emerged as the major foreign player financing and building badly needed infrastructure projects from a railway in nigeria and a highway in ethiopia to a major new dam in angola new contracts signed in 2014 hit 75 billion and president xi jinping has called for even more projects in what he once called a win win deal for beijing and african nations for the past decade chinese companies have been working on major infrastructure projects in uganda including the karuma hydropower project the mandela national stadium and a highway connecting entebbe in the south to kampala the capital the uganda investment authority estimated that china accounts for half or more of all foreign investment coming into the country as a result up to 50 000 chinese men have come to the country to work on these projects according to local chinese expatriates at the same time there is also a rising local demand for cheap goods from china contractors traders investors and entrepreneurs from the asian giant have flocked the country looking for opportunities opening factories and retail shops selling imported chinese goods these foreigners are a lure for many ugandan women who date and sometimes marry these expatriates many ugandan women said they prefer foreigner partners to local men whom they accuse of being unromantic and not caring or loving chinese men know how to love a woman and you can t compare them with ugandan men they give women what they need said joyce tusabe from kampala who is dating a chinese expatriate also the chinese have a lot of money he opened me an electronic shop and i m doing very well ugandan immigration officials say they are dealing with a related problem chinese workers looking to stay permanently in the country are engaging in sham marriages with ugandan women to gain residency rights but the main reason for the unwanted surge in single abandoned mothers is money say local officials climbing out of poverty poverty is the problem said james okumu a tribal chief who is the government administrator of the kiryandongo district which encompasses the dam project the chinese are taking advantage of the situation to spoil our girls because they know our girls need money to take care of their poor families mr okumu said he knows of more than 50 children fathered by chinese employees working at the karuma hydropower project alone chinese men do not come with their women to african countries while working on major infrastructure projects he said so they are forced to seek local women to fulfill their sexual desires they buy sex from these women now some of these women want the situation rectified they want to compel the chinese fathers to pay the expenses of the children i want the father to be brought back to the country so that he can take care of his child said ms musisi taking care of this child is very expensive the baby wants sweet food like juice and biscuits which is very expensive here they are rejecting local food they gave us false promises she added referring to the chinese expatriates they lied to us and said that they will take us to china they gave us a lot of money and we believed them mr okumu said he is working with the country s ministry of gender labor and social development to deal with the issue so that it does not happen in the future in the meantime he added the government is figuring out how to help mothers forced to raise their children alone many cases of women that were fathered by chinese have been reported at our offices and we are investigating the incidents he said we are investigating the company so that it can be held responsible and petitioned to support raise these children the sinohydro corp had no comment on the matter in spite of love ms tusabe warned ugandan women to be cautious with chinese men i have advised many women not to fall into their trap get pregnant and bear children she said it s very risky because they are foreigners and they can leave any time i advise them to get money fr
