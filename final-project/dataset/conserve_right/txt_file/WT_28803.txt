tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap president donald trump is spreading misleading rhetoric about illegal immigration at a wisconsin rally he suggested he s launched his plan to transport immigrants in the u s illegally to sanctuary cities in mass numbers my sick idea as he proudly called it there s no evidence that s happening he s also giving a confused outlook on the u s population growth alternating between assertions that the country is too full to accept any more migrants and that it needs more migrants to fill jobs top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time in the meantime russia kept reverberating over the past week even with special counsel robert mueller s report now part of history as much as trump says he wants the united states to move on he s found it hard to turn away himself as seen in a torrent of tweets and remarks railing against democrats trashing mueller and painting his own actions in a saintly light a review of rhetoric from trump and his team also touching on health care the economy and the census immigration trump last month alone 100 000 illegal immigrants arrived in our borders placing a massive strain on communities and schools and hospitals and public resources like nobody s ever seen before now we re sending many of them to sanctuary cities thank you very much i m proud to tell you that was my sick idea green bay wisconsin rally saturday the facts a mass transfer to sanctuary cities is not underway he proposed the idea in part to punish democratic congressional foes for inaction on the border but his homeland security officials rejected the plan as unworkable trump said this month he was strongly considering the proposal hours after white house and homeland security officials had insisted the idea had been eschewed twice we re in the process of figuring out all the details on how that would work white house press secretary sarah sanders said monday sanctuary cities are places where local authorities do not cooperate with immigration officials denying information or resources that would help them round up for deportation people living in the country illegally by all signs federal officials considered the president s words little more than bluster his comments to the wisconsin crowd appeared to be bluster too people with knowledge of the discussions say white house staff discussed the idea with the department of homeland security in november and february but it was judged too costly and a misuse of money the people were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity trump on u s population we need people to come in rally trump we have companies pouring in the problem is we need workers fox business interview sunday the facts his position is a flip from earlier this month when he declared the u s to be full in light of the overwhelmed southern border in an april 7 tweet he threatened to shut down the border unless mexico apprehended all immigrants who crossed illegally but it turns out the u s is only full in terms of the people trump doesn t want immigrants as a whole make up a greater percentage of the total u s population than they did back in 1970 having grown from less than 5 percent of the population to more than 13 percent now in 2030 it s projected that immigrants will become the primary driver for u s population growth overtaking u s births health care trump the republicans are always going to protect pre existing conditions wisconsin rally the facts he s not protecting health coverage for patients with pre existing medical conditions the trump administration instead is pressing in court for full repeal of the affordable care act including provisions that protect people with pre existing conditions from health insurance discrimination trump and other republicans say they ll have a plan to preserve those safeguards but the white house has provided no details former president barack obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones bills supported in 2017 by trump and congressional republicans to repeal the law could undermine protections by pushing up costs for people with pre existing conditions russia trump calling mueller s probe a witchhunt it s the greatest political hoax in american history wisconsin rally the facts a two year investigation that produced guilty pleas convictions and criminal charges against russian intelligence officers and others with ties to the kremlin as well as trump associates is demonstrably not a hoax all told mueller charged 34 people including the president s former campaign chairman paul manafort his first national security adviser michael flynn and three russian companies twenty five russians were indicted on charges related to election interference accused either of hacking democratic email accounts during the campaign or of orchestrating a social media campaign that spread disinformation on the internet five trump aides pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with mueller and a sixth longtime confidant roger stone is awaiting trial on charges he lied to congress and engaged in witness tampering mueller s report concluded that russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was sweeping and systematic ultimately mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign but the special counsel didn t render judgment on whether trump obstructed justice saying his investigators found evidence on both sides trump no collusion no obstruction there has never been a president who has been more transparent millions of pages of documents were given to the mueller angry dems plus i allowed everyone to testify including w h counsel tweet wednesday attorney general william barr the white house fully cooperated with the special counsel s investigation providing unfettered access to campaign and white house documents directing senior aides to testify freely and asserting no privilege claims remarks at the justice department on april 18 the facts it s a huge stretch for them to cast the white house as being fully cooperative and open in the investigation into moscow s interference in the 2016 u s election and the trump campaign s relationship with russian figures trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice also on the matter of transparency trump is an outlier among presidents in refusing to release his tax returns providing tax information as a candidate in 2016 and as president is something party nominees have traditionally done for half a century trump in the old days if you were president and you had a good economy you were basically immune from criticism remember it s the economy stupid today i have as president perhaps the greatest economy in history tweet tuesday the facts you can assume many previous presidents would beg to disagree that a good economy shielded them from criticism under president bill clinton whose top campaign staffer james carville coined the phrase the economy stupid to underscore what the campaign should be about the unemployment rate fell to 3 8 and the nation s economy grew 4 or more for four straight years yet clinton was under independent counsel investigation for all but one year of his presidency 1993 the house impeached him in december 1998 at the height of the monica lewinsky scandal though the senate acquitted him in february 1999 in january 1998 hillary clinton alleged a vast right wing conspiracy to take down her husband a widely mocked complaint about the relentless criticism the clintons faced from the right which extended to ridicule over the title of hillary clinton s 1996 book it takes a village under president ronald reagan the economy expanded 3 5 or more for six years in a row with growth rocketing to 7 2 in 1984 yet reagan was dogged in his second term by the iran contra investigation which focused on covert arm sales to iran that financed aid to nicaraguan rebels both presidents saw much faster growth than trump has presided over despite trump s faulty claim to have perhaps the greatest economy in history growth reached 2 9 last year the best in four years but far below the levels achieved under clinton or reagan the unemployment rate touched 3 7 last september and november the lowest in five decades but just one tenth of a percentage point below the 3 8 in april 2000 under clinton trump mueller was not fired and was respectfully allowed to finish his work on what i and many others say was an illegal investigation there was no crime headed by a trump hater who was highly conflicted tweet thursday the facts trump is wrong to suggest that the fbi acted illegally by investigating him the fbi does not need to know if or have evidence that a crime occurred before it begins an investigation many investigations that are properly conducted ultimately don t find evidence of any crime the fbi is empowered to open an investigation if there s information it has received or uncovered that leads the bureau to think it might encounter a crime apart from that the investigation into the trump campaign was initially a counterintelligence investigation rather than a strictly criminal one as agents sought to understand whether and why russia was meddling in the 2016 election trump also makes a baseless charge that mueller was highly conflicted mueller a longtime republican was cleared by the justice department s ethics experts to lead the russia investigation nothing in the public record makes him a trump hater according to the special counsel s report when trump complained privately to aides that mueller would not be objective the advisers including then white house chief strategist steve bannon then white house counsel don mcgahn and then chief of staff reince priebus rejected those complaints as not representing true conflicts bannon also called the claims ridiculous trump i did nothing wrong if the partisan dems ever tried to impeach i would first head to the u s supreme court tweet wednesday the facts he d have a tough hearing at the supreme court justices ruled 9 0 in 1993 that the constitution grants sole power of impeachment to the house and senate not the judiciary under the principle of separation of powers congress is a co equal branch of government to the executive branch and judiciary the house is afforded power to impeach a president by bringing formal charges and the senate convenes the trial with two thirds of senators needed to convict and remove a president from office the constitution does not provide a role for the judiciary in the impeachment process other than the chief justice of the united states presiding over the senate trial in its 1993 ruling the supreme court said framers of the constitution didn t intend for the court to have the power to review impeachment proceedings because they involve political questions that shouldn t be resolved in the courts kellyanne conway white house counselor saying there s no need for congress to continue investigating with the mueller probe concluded we all know if director mueller and his investigators wanted to or felt that it was right to indict they would have done that he had every opportunity to indict and declined to indict investigators investigate and they decide to indict they refer indictment or they decline indictment that s the way the process works remarks wednesday to reporters the facts that s not how mueller s process worked according to the report mueller s team declined to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment on whether to indict that is do what prosecutors typically do as conway describes it because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought the report states as a result the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office mueller s team wrote that its investigation was conducted in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary material available accordingly while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him the report states hogan gidley white house deputy press secretary he s already denounced multiple times russian involvement remarks tuesday to reporters the facts trump has had it both ways at times criticizing that involvement but more often equivocating and long after u s intelligence agencies and other parts of his administration became convinced of russian meddling every time he sees me he says i didn t do that trump said of putin in november 2017 i really believe that when he tells me that he means it in february 2018 he tweeted i never said russia did not meddle in the election i said it may be russia or china or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer now he has assailed the report by mueller whose investigation fleshed out the audacious russian effort to shape the election in favor of trump and resulted in indictments against 25 russians accused either of hacking democratic email accounts or sowing discord in america through social media as well as trump associates trump isn t it amazing that the people who were closest to me by far and knew the campaign better than anyone were never even called to testify before mueller the reason is that the 18 angry democrats knew they would all say no collusion and only very good things tweet on april 22 the facts trump s wrong to suggest that the people closest to him weren t called to testify before mueller s team plenty of people close to him including in his own family interviewed with the special counsel s investigators or were at least asked to appear and of those who did some said not very good things about their interactions with the president among the advisers and aides who spoke with mueller was mcgahn who extensively detailed trump s outrage at the investigation and his efforts to curtail it mcgahn told mueller s team how trump called him at home and urged him to press the justice department to fire the special counsel then told him to deny that the entire episode had taken place once it became public mueller also interviewed priebus bannon former white house chief of staff john kelly former white house communications director hope hicks and white house press secretary sarah sanders michael cohen trump s former personal lawyer who once said he was so close to the president that he d take a bullet for him also cooperated with mueller and delivered unflattering details mueller certainly wanted to hear from trump s family too even if not all relatives were eager to cooperate his eldest son donald trump jr declined to be voluntarily interviewed by investigators according to mueller s report trump s son in law jared kushner spoke multiple times to mueller s team one of the president s daughters ivanka trump provided information through an attorney gidley it was barack obama who leaned over to dmitry medvedev in the oval office and said listen we ll have more flexibility when the election s over remarks tuesday the facts first the conversation was in south korea not the oval office gidley accurately recounted the gist of what obama was heard telling the russian president on a microphone they didn t know was on but gidley did not explain the context of the remark obama was suggesting he would have more flexibility postelection to address russia s concerns about a nato missile defense system in europe the conversation with medvedev who was soon succeeded by vladimir putin had nothing to do with russian meddling that would be exposed in the u s election four years away census trump the american people deserve to know who is in this country yesterday the supreme court took up the census citizenship question a really big deal tweet wednesday gidley when asked whether trump believes an accurate census count isn t necessary he wants to know who s in this country i think as a sovereign nation we have that right it s been a question that s been on the census for decades remarks tuesday the facts not since 1950 has the census collected citizenship data from the whole population moreover trump s position that asking a citizenship question in the census is needed to know who is in this country ignores the judgment of the census bureau s own researchers who say that it would not result in the most accurate possible count of the u s population the question is already asked in other government surveys according to january 2018 calculations by the census bureau adding the question to the once a decade survey form would cause lower response rates among hispanics and noncitizens the government would have to spend at least 27 5 million for additional phone calls home visits and other follow up efforts to reach them federal judges in california maryland and new york have blocked the administration from going forward with a citizenship question after crediting the analysis of agency experts the experts said millions would go uncounted because hispanics and immigrants might be reluctant to say if they or others in their households are not citizens commerce secretary wilbur ross has argued that a citizenship question is needed to help the government better comply with the voting rights act but the justice department has been enforcing the 1965 law which was passed to help protect minority groups political rights with citizenship data already available from other government surveys the count goes to the heart of the u s political system determining the number of seats each state has in the u s house and how the electoral votes that decide presidential elections are distributed it also shapes how 300 federal programs distribute more than 800 billion a year to local communities associated press writers colleen long jill colvin christopher rugaber ricardo alonso zaldivar chad day eric
