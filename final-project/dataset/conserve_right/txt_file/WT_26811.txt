global survey i am here under oath to correct the record to answer the committee s questions truthfully and to offer the american people what i know about president trump i recognize that some of you may doubt and attack me on my credibility it is for this reason that i have incorporated into this opening statement documents that are irrefutable and demonstrate that the information you will hear is accurate and truthful never in a million years did i imagine when i accepted a job in 2007 to work for donald trump that he would one day run for president launch a campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance and actually win i regret the day i said yes to mr trump i regret all the help and support i gave him along the way i am ashamed of my own failings and i publicly accepted responsibility for them by pleading guilty in the southern district of new york i am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty of the things i did for mr trump in an effort to protect and promote him i am ashamed that i chose to take part in concealing mr trump s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience i am ashamed because i know what mr trump is he is a racist he is a conman he is a cheat he was a presidential candidate who knew that roger stone was talking with julian assange about a wikileaks drop of democratic national committee emails i will explain each in a few moments i am providing the committee today with several documents these include a copy of a check mr trump wrote from his personal bank account after he became president to reimburse me for the hush money payments i made to cover up his affair with an adult film star and prevent damage to his campaign copies of financial statements for 2011 2013 that he gave to such institutions as deutsche bank a copy of an article with mr trump s handwriting on it that reported on the auction of a portrait of himself he arranged for the bidder ahead of time and then reimbursed the bidder from the account of his non profit charitable foundation with the picture now hanging in one of his country clubs and copies of letters i wrote at mr trump s direction that threatened his high school colleges and the college board not to release his grades or sat scores i hope my appearance here today my guilty plea and my work with law enforcement agencies are steps along a path of redemption that will restore faith in me and help this country understand our president better before going further i want to apologize to each of you and to congress as a whole the last time i appeared before congress i came to protect mr trump today i m here to tell the truth about mr trump i lied to congress about when mr trump stopped negotiating the moscow tower project in russia i stated that we stopped negotiating in january 2016 that was false our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign mr trump did not directly tell me to lie to congress that s not how he operates in conversations we had during the campaign at the same time i was actively negotiating in russia for him he would look me in the eye and tell me there s no business in russia and then go out and lie to the american people by saying the same thing in his way he was telling me to lie there were at least a half dozen times between the iowa caucus in january 2016 and the end of june when he would ask me how s it going in russia referring to the moscow tower project you need to know that mr trump s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to congress about the timing of the moscow tower negotiations before i gave it to be clear mr trump knew of and directed the trump moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it he lied about it because he never expected to win the election he also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the moscow real estate project and so i lied about it too because mr trump had made clear to me through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country that he wanted me to lie and he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before i gave it to congress over the past two years i have been smeared as a rat by the president of the united states the truth is much different and let me take a brief moment to introduce myself my name is michael dean cohen i am a blessed husband of 24 years and a father to an incredible daughter and son when i married my wife i promised her that i would love her cherish her and protect her as my father said countless times throughout my childhood you my wife and you my children are the air that i breathe to my laura my sami and my jake there is nothing i wouldn t do to protect you i have always tried to live a life of loyalty friendship generosity and compassion qualities my parents ingrained in my siblings and me since childhood my father survived the holocaust thanks to the compassion and selfless acts of others he was helped by many who put themselves in harm s way to do what they knew was right that is why my first instinct has always been to help those in need mom and dad i am sorry that i let you down as many people that know me best would say i am the person they would call at 3am if they needed help i proudly remember being the emergency contact for many of my children s friends when they were growing up because their parents knew that i would drop everything and care for them as if they were my own yet last fall i pled guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of at the direction of and in coordination with individual 1 for the record individual 1 is president donald j trump it is painful to admit that i was motivated by ambition at times it is even more painful to admit that many times i ignored my conscience and acted loyal to a man when i should not have sitting here today it seems unbelievable that i was so mesmerized by donald trump that i was willing to do things for him that i knew were absolutely wrong for that reason i have come here to apologize to my family to the government and to the american people accordingly let me now tell you about mr trump i got to know him very well working very closely with him for more than 10 years as his executive vice president and special counsel and then personal attorney when he became president when i first met mr trump he was a successful entrepreneur a real estate giant and an icon being around mr trump was intoxicating when you were in his presence you felt like you were involved in something greater than yourself that you were somehow changing the world i wound up touting the trump narrative for over a decade that was my job always stay on message always defend it monopolized my life at first i worked mostly on real estate developments and other business transactions shortly thereafter mr trump brought me into his personal life and private dealings over time i saw his true character revealed mr trump is an enigma he is complicated as am i he has both good and bad as do we all but the bad far outweighs the good and since taking office he has become the worst version of himself he is capable of behaving kindly but he is not kind he is capable of committing acts of generosity but he is not generous he is capable of being loyal but he is fundamentally disloyal donald trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great not to make our country great he had no desire or intention to lead this nation only to market himself and to build his wealth and power mr trump would often say this campaign was going to be the greatest infomercial in political history he never expected to win the primary he never expected to win the general election the campaign for him was always a marketing opportunity i knew early on in my work for mr trump that he would direct me to lie to further his business interests i am ashamed to say that when it was for a real estate mogul in the private sector i considered it trivial as the president i consider it significant and dangerous but in the mix lying for mr trump was normalized and no one around him questioned it in fairness no one around him today questions it either a lot of people have asked me about whether mr trump knew about the release of the hacked democratic national committee emails ahead of time the answer is yes as i earlier stated mr trump knew from roger stone in advance about the wikileaks drop of emails in july 2016 days before the democratic convention i was in mr trump s office when his secretary announced that roger stone was on the phone mr trump put mr stone on the speakerphone mr stone told mr trump that he had just gotten off the phone with julian assange and that mr assange told mr stone that within a couple of days there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage hillary clinton s campaign mr trump responded by stating to the effect of wouldn t that be great mr trump is a racist the country has seen mr trump court white supremacists and bigots you have heard him call poorer countries shitholes in private he is even worse he once asked me if i could name a country run by a black person that wasn t a shithole this was when barack obama was president of the united states while we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in chicago he commented that only black people could live that way and he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid and yet i continued to work for him mr trump is a cheat as previously stated i m giving the committee today three years of president trump s financial statements from 2011 2013 which he gave to deutsche bank to inquire about a loan to buy the buffalo bills and to forbes these are exhibits 1a 1b and 1c to my testimony it was my experience that mr trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in forbes and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes i am sharing with you two newspaper articles side by side that are examples of mr trump inflating and deflating his assets as i said to suit his financial interests these are exhibit 2 to my testimony as i noted i m giving the committee today an article he wrote on and sent me that reported on an auction of a portrait of mr trump this is exhibit 3a to my testimony mr trump directed me to find a straw bidder to purchase a portrait of him that was being auctioned at an art hamptons event the objective was to ensure that his portrait which was going to be auctioned last would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon the portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for 60 000 mr trump directed the trump foundation which is supposed to be a charitable organization to repay the fake bidder despite keeping the art for himself please see exhibit 3b to my testimony and it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that mr trump directed me to call business owners many of whom were small businesses that were owed money for their services and told them no payment or a reduced payment would be coming when i advised mr trump of my success he actually reveled in it and yet i continued to work for him mr trump is a conman he asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair and to lie to his wife about it which i did lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets she is a kind good person i respect her greatly and she did not deserve that i am giving the committee today a copy of the 130 000 wire transfer from me to ms clifford s attorney during the closing days of the presidential campaign that was demanded by ms clifford to maintain her silence about her affair with mr trump this is exhibit 4 to my testimony mr trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a home equity line of credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign i did that too without bothering to consider whether that was improper much less whether it was the right thing to do or how it would impact me my family or the public i am going to jail in part because of my decision to help mr trump hide that payment from the american people before they voted a few days later as exhibit 5 to my testimony shows i am providing a copy of a 35 000 check that president trump personally signed from his personal bank account on august 1 2017 when he was president of the united states pursuant to the cover up which was the basis of my guilty plea to reimburse me the word used by mr trump s tv lawyer for the illegal hush money i paid on his behalf this 35 000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year while he was president the president of the united states thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws you can find the details of that scheme directed by mr trump in the pleadings in the u s district court for the southern district of new york so picture this scene in february 2017 one month into his presidency i m visiting president trump in the oval office for the first time it s truly awe inspiring he s showing me around and pointing to different paintings and he says to me something to the effect of don t worry michael your january and february reimbursement checks are coming they were fed exed from new york and it takes a while for that to get through the white house system as he promised i received the first check for the reimbursement of 70 000 not long thereafter when i say conman i m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school his colleges and the college board to never release his grades or sat scores as i mentioned i m giving the committee today copies of a letter i sent at mr trump s direction threatening these schools with civil and criminal actions if mr trump s grades or sat scores were ever disclosed without his permission these are exhibit 6 the irony wasn t lost on me at the time that mr trump in 2011 had strongly criticized president obama for not releasing his grades as you can see in exhibit 7 mr trump declared let him show his records after calling president obama a terrible student the sad fact is that i never heard mr trump say anything in private that led me to believe he loved our nation or wanted to make it better in fact he did the opposite when telling me in 2008 that he was cutting employees salaries in half including mine he showed me what he claimed was a 10 million irs tax refund and he said that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving someone like him that much money back during the campaign mr trump said he did not consider vietnam veteran and prisoner of war senator john mccain to be a hero because he likes people who weren t captured at the same time mr trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the vietnam draft mr trump claimed it was because of a bone spur but when i asked for medical records he gave me none and said there was no surgery he told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment he finished the conversation with the following comment you think i m stupid i wasn t going to vietnam i find it ironic president trump that you are in vietnam right now and yet i continued to work for him questions have been raised about whether i know of direct evidence that mr trump or his campaign colluded with russia i do not i want to be clear but i have my suspicions sometime in the summer of 2017 i read all over the media that there had been a meeting in trump tower in june 2016 involving don jr and others from the campaign with russians including a representative of the russian government and an email setting up the meeting with the subject line dirt on hillary clinton something clicked in my mind i remember being in the room with mr trump probably in early june 2016 when something peculiar happened don jr came into the room and walked behind his father s desk which in itself was unusual people didn t just walk behind mr trump s desk to talk to him i recalled don jr leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice which i could clearly hear and saying the meeting is all set i remember mr trump saying ok good let me know what struck me as i looked back and thought about that exchange between don jr and his father was first that mr trump had frequently told me and others that his son don jr had the worst judgment of anyone in the world and also that don jr would never set up any meeting of any significance alone and certainly not without checking with his father i also knew that nothing went on in trump world especially the campaign without mr trump s knowledge and approval so i concluded that don jr was referring to that june 2016 trump tower meeting about dirt on hillary with the russian representative when he walked behind his dad s desk that day and that mr trump knew that was the meeting don jr was talking about when he said that s good let me know over the past year or so i have done some real soul searching i see now that my ambition and the intoxication of trump power had much to do with the bad decisions i made to you chairman cummings ranking member jordan the other members of this committee and the other members of the house and senate i am sorry for my lies and for lying to congress to our nation i am sorry for actively working to hide from you the truth about mr trump when you needed it most for those who question my motives for being here today i understand i have lied but i am not a liar i have done bad things but i am not a bad man i have fixed things but i am no longer your fixer mr trump i am going to prison and have shattered the safety and security that i tried so hard to provide for my family my testimony certainly does not diminish the pain i caused my family and friends nothing can do that and i have never asked for nor would i accept a pardon from president trump and by coming today i have caused my family to be the target of personal scurrilous attacks by the president and his lawyer trying to intimidate me from appearing before this panel mr trump called me a rat for choosing to tell the truth much like a mobster would do when one of his men decides to cooperate with the government as exhibit 8 shows i have provided the committee with copies of tweets that mr trump posted attacking me and my family only someone burying his head in the sand would not recognize them for what they are encouragement to someone to do harm to me and my family i never imagined that he would engage in vicious false attacks on my family and unleash his tv lawyer to do the same i hope this committee and all members of congress on both sides of the aisle will make it clear as a nation we should not tolerate attempts to intimidate witnesses before congress and attacks on family are out of bounds and not acceptable i wish to especially thank speaker pelosi for her statements in exhibit 9 to protect this institution and me and the chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence adam schiff and chairman cummings for likewise defending this institution and my family against the attacks by mr trump and also the many republicans who have admonished the president as well i am not a perfect man i have done things i am not proud of and i will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life but today i get to decide the example i set for my children and how i attempt to change how history will remember me i may not be able to change the past but i can do right by the american people here today thank you for
