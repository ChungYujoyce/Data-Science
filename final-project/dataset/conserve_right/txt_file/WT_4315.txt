ed for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion it has taken a long time but finally the justice department is training its guns on what heretofore was unthinkable unless you are a career civil libertarian for years the civil libertarians have been warning us that the intelligence community posed a threat to democracy as we know it in these united states every so often they would point to some excess of the fbi or the cia and tell us that the lights were going out in democratic america does not the washington post run atop its front page the maudlin line democracy dies in darkness well the darkness descended upon donald trump the moment he decided to run for president the fbi and cia in cahoots with mrs hillary clinton and those popularizing the infamous dossier she financed threw a blanket of darkness over his campaign late last week we learned that what had been a justice department administrative review had suddenly become much more serious it has become a criminal inquiry that means the justice department believes there is sufficient evidence that a crime has been committed now the prosecutor in charge john h durham will have the power to subpoena witnesses testimony and documents he can convene a grand jury and file criminal charges my guess is that he has already convened a grand jury mr durham and attorney general william barr have been looking into the origins of the obama administration s spying on president trump just how did it begin and who exactly started it they are clearly unsettled by the answers they have found so far top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches my colleague george neumayr and i have been studying the obama administration s spying on mr trump for over three years while most of the mainstream media searched desperately for a smoking gun carried by one of mr trump s people or even by the president himself we looked elsewhere we looked at the politicized atmosphere within the fbi and the cia we even looked at british intelligence no one else seemed interested but we found evidence of criminal misbehavior by the former head of cia john brennan the former head of national intelligence james clapper and former head of the fbi james b comey on march 23 2018 we published the following lines while brennan s recklessness is obviously of no interest to the media it is provoking increasing concern among government investigators who are looking at a range of his abuses from leaks to perjury to the outsourcing of spying on trump to foreigners under the guise of intelligence sharing and we went on a member of the intelligence community tells us that he was approached by fbi investigators inquiring about brennan s improprieties at the cia he was startled to hear them venting aloud about brennan s practice of using british intelligence officials to spy on the trump campaign including american contractors hired by the british who were working from the 12th floor of a building in crystal city virginia and an nsa building in san antonio texas brennan they fumed was using british intelligence agents so that he could deny if asked that he had spied on the trump campaign now if you will remember president trump claimed that the obama administration had bugged trump tower the chattering class raged about this claim for months but we now know that mr trump was right mr comey had sitting on his desk fisa warrants on carter page paul manafort and michael flynn that gave him the power to reach into trump tower and intercept their communications seized with trump derangement syndrome the three stooges mr brennan mr clapper and mr comey had convinced themselves that mr trump a sui generis american businessman known for his patriotism was a plant for the russians psychologists would call such a far fetched notion a case of projection it was mr brennan after all who famously voted for gus hall the soviet plant who ran for president in the 1970s the most perverse irony in all of this is that the american officials who bleated the loudest about malicious actors interfering in the election presided over a government that actually did it was members of the u s government who spied upon mr trump s campaign and sought to sabotage it through entrapment schemes and criminal leaks it was mr brennan who turned to foreigners for dirt on mr trump to throw the election they failed but not for lack of trying just ask harry reid who has noted mr brennan s ulterior motive for briefing him on crossfire hurricane before election day in the coming days we will learn much more about this audacious mischief first through the report of inspector general michael horowitz detailing fisa abuses then through mr durham s findings which could result in a raft of indictments brace for impact lefties it is going to be a bumpy year ahead r emmett tyrrell jr is founder and editor in chief of the american spectator he is the author
