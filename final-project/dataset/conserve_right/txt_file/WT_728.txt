apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap house democrats want to enact a massive infrastructure package upgrading the nation s broadband road and water systems speaker nancy pelosi said wednesday in the next installment of congress effort to help the country weather the destructive blows inflicted by the coronavirus outbreak pelosi said the measure would be in the range of the 2 trillion that president donald trump cited in a tweet tuesday announcing his own support for such a job creation effort but even under unparalleled health and economic crises the fate of infrastructure proposals remains uncertain republicans have qualms about whether such a costly proposal is yet needed and infrastructure plans have a recent history of going nowhere they ve long been

curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick pelosi d calif told reporters that democrats infrastructure plan would address some of the critical impacts and vulnerability in america that have been laid bare by the coronavirus but powerful republicans are already tapping the brakes they note that congress and trump have just pumped 2 2 trillion into the economy all by adding to the national debt to try preserving jobs and financing the country s battle against the rapidly spreading and sometimes deadly infection we just borrowed significantly for the 2 2 trillion measure sen john barrasso r wyo chairman of the senate environment and public works committee said in an interview wednesday i want to make sure that gets implemented fully before turning to borrowing more money and spending more money he also said that if the economy still needs a boost down the road building infrastructure projects is the best way to do it senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky has said he ll oppose any democratic effort to use a fresh economic recovery bill to advance environmental restrictions or their other policy preferences we need to make certain that any further actions we take are directly related to this public health crisis mcconnell told fox news radio s guy benson on tuesday pelosi s still evolving plan would be centered on a 760 billion five year framework that house democrats unveiled in january it includes money to rebuild roads mass transit rail systems wireless communications networks and water projects she said when congress returns to washington after

included in a wide ranging economic recovery bill that would also include money for extended unemployment benefits state and local governments and hospitals plus expanded job protections and benefits for workers trump threw another wild card into the mix tuesday when he embraced using the next round for a massive infrastructure package it should be very big bold two trillion dollars and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our country phase 4 trump tweeted there seems little doubt that if the economy remains near its current morbid state the major question facing lawmakers will be what the next bill should look like not whether to have one growing numbers of business close by the day consumer spending is plummeting and millions are losing jobs as much

enormous 2 2 trillion bill stephen moore a former trump senior adviser now with the conservative pro business committee to unleash prosperity said he envisioned major problems for congress in reaching an agreement he said that while the economy will likely need another large cash infusion to recover democrats pushing more spending will clash with republicans eager to use tax cuts instead such as
