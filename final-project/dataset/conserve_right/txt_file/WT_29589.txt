congressional aides the funding measure is through the fiscal year which ends sept 30 the agreement means 55 miles of new fencing constructed through existing designs such as metal slats instead of a

pulled the plug on the talks over democratic demands to limit immigrant detentions by federal authorities frustrating some of his fellow negotiators but democrats yielded ground on that issue in a fresh round of talks on monday asked if trump would back the deal shelby said we believe from our dealings with them and the latitude they ve given us they will support it we certainly hope so trump traveled to el paso texas for a campaign style rally monday night focused on immigration and border issues he has been adamant that congress approve money for a wall along the mexican border though he no longer repeats his 2016 mantra that mexico will pay for it and he took to the stage as lawmakers back in washington were announcing their breakthrough they said that progress is being made with this committee trump told his audience referring to the congressional bargainers just so you know we re building the wall anyway the agreement got bad reviews from some of trump s conservative allies while the president was giving a great speech in el paso congress was putting together a bad deal on immigration rep jim jordan r ohio wrote on twitter democrats carried more leverage into the talks after besting trump on the 35 day shutdown but showed flexibility in hopes on winning trump s signature after yielding on border barriers democrats focused on reducing funding for detention beds to curb what they see as unnecessarily harsh enforcement by immigration and customs enforcement or ice the agreement yielded curbed funding overall for ice detention beds which democrats promised would mean the agency would hold fewer detainees than the roughly 49 000 detainees held on feb 10 the most recent date for which figures were available democrats claimed the number of beds would be ratcheted down to 40 520 but a proposal to cap at 16 500 the number of detainees caught in areas away from the border a limit democrats say was aimed at preventing overreach by the agency ran into its own republican wall democrats dropped the demand in the monday round of talks and the mood in the capitol improved markedly trump met monday afternoon with top advisers in the oval office to discuss the negotiations he softened his rhetoric on the wall but ratcheted it up when alluding to the detention beds issue we can call it anything we ll call it barriers we ll call it whatever they want

surrendered after the shutdown hit 35 days agreeing to the current temporary reopening without getting money for the wall the president s supporters have suggested that trump could use executive powers to divert money from the federal budget for wall construction though he could face challenges in congress or the courts the negotiations hit a rough patch sunday amid a dispute over curbing ice the federal agency that republicans see as an emblem of tough immigration policies and democrats accuse of often going too far according to ice figures 66 percent of the nearly 159 000 immigrants it reported detaining last year were previously convicted of crimes reflecting the two administration s differing priorities in 2016 under president barack obama around 110 000 immigrants were detained and 86 percent had criminal records few convictions that immigrants detained last year had on their records were for violent crimes the most common were for driving while intoxicated drugs previous immigration convictions and traffic offenses the border debate got most of the attention but it s just part of a major spending measure to fund a bevy of cabinet departments a collapse of the
