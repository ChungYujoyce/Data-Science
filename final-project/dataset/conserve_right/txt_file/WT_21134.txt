apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic hurricane dorian has long since turned away from any path that would have taken it remotely near alabama but the tempest over president trump s warning for alabamians was still churning thursday after days of being widely mocked on social media for his prediction followed by more kerfuffle over an apparently altered map mr trump again insisted on twitter that he was correct in his initial alert last week that alabama along with georgia and the carolinas would most likely be hit much harder than anticipated in the early days of the hurricane when it was predicted that dorian would go through miami or west palm beach even before it reached the bahamas certain models strongly suggested that alabama georgia would be hit as it made its way through florida to the gulf the president tweeted thursday see also pete buttigieg on trump hurricane map i feel sorry for the president he added instead it turned north and went up the coast where it continues now in the one model through florida the great state of alabama would have been hit or grazed mr trump said in the path it took no read my full fema statement what i said was accurate all fake news in order to demean on thursday afternoon he tweeted national hurricane center maps from thursday and friday of last week showing potential winds from dorian stretching into alabama and shared a friday tweet from the alabama national guard warning that the storm could head in the state s direction however by sunday all models that had dorian cutting across the florida peninsula had changed and the storm was predicted to move up the east coast as has happened but the white house released a statement late thursday from rear adm peter j brown the president s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to back up the president s account he confirmed that a hurricane briefing for the president sunday showed the possibility of tropical storm force winds hitting parts of alabama adm brown said the forecasts of the storm s impact area changed substantially over time including that by monday morning the threat to alabama was over and then came sharpiegate during an oval office briefing wednesday mr trump displayed a map of the national hurricane center forecast for last thursday that showed the storm s likely path over florida the map showed what appeared to be a hand drawn extension on the end of the cone of uncertainty that projected its path over alabama mr trump offered no explanation for the darker semicircle drawn on the map that he displayed but he told reporters i know that alabama was in the original forecast when the president included alabama in his original warning sept 1 the national weather service in birmingham alabama tweeted in response alabama will not see any impacts from dorian we repeat no impacts from hurricane dorian will be felt across alabama the system will remain too far east the altered hurricane map that mr trump displayed in the oval office has led to a virtual cottage industry of memes on social media for example a hand drawn semicircle over mr trump s head in a photograph to make him appear taller than former president barack obama as they stood next to each other democratic presidential hopeful pete buttigieg joined in thursday saying he feels sorry for mr trump i don t know if he felt it necessary to pull out a sharpie and change the map i don t know if it was one of his aides who believed they had to do that in order to order to protect his ego mr buttigieg mayor of south bend indiana said on cnn s new day this is humiliating this is an embarrassing moment for our country and we seem to see a new national embarrassment every day what we re seeing there is literally pathetic he said it makes you feel a kind of pity for everybody involved and that s not how i want to feel about the president whether it s from my party or the other one david sherfinski
