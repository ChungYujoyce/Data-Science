primaries in new jersey and california and what is at stake for bernie sanders and hillary clinton hillary clinton has earned enough delegates to clinch the democratic presidential nomination according to an associated press count released monday night an assessment swiftly challenged by primary rival bernie sanders and his campaign the ap released its updated tally showing the former secretary of state winning enough delegates to become the first woman to top a major party s presidential ticket on the eve of the last major day of primary voting the ap said clinton reached the 2 383 delegates needed to become the presumptive democratic nominee with a weekend victory in puerto rico and late burst of support from superdelegates those are party officials and officeholders many of them eager to wrap up the primary free to support whichever candidate they want we really need to bring a close to this primary process and get on to defeating donald trump said nancy worley a superdelegate who chairs alabama apos s democratic party and provided one of the last endorsements to put clinton over the top it apos s time to stand behind our presumptive candidate said michael brown one of two superdelegates from the district of columbia who came forward in the past week to back clinton before the city apos s june 14 primary we shouldn apos t be acting like we are undecided when the people of america have spoken clinton touted the news at a long beach calif campaign event saying the campaign is now on the brink of a historic unprecedented moment but even she stressed that six states are yet to vote on tuesday and urged supporters to cast their ballots for her in those contests the six states to vote tuesday include new jersey north dakota new mexico montana california and south dakota campaign manager robby mook said in a statement this is an important milestone but there are six states that are voting tuesday with millions of people heading to the polls and hillary clinton is working to earn every vote we look forward totuesdaynight when hillary clinton will clinch not only a win in the popular vote but also the majority of pledged delegates the sanders campaign rejected the declaration that clinton had clinched the party nod citing its longstanding position that the superdelegates should not count until they actually vote at the convention as they are free to switch sides before then there is nothing to concede sanders told ktvu late monday at a rally in san francisco secretary clinton will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to win the democratic nomination she will be dependent on superdelegates they vote on july 25th so right now our goal right at this moment is to do everything we can to win the primary tomorrow sanders spokesman michael briggs accused the media of a rush to judgement and ignoring the democratic national committee s clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that bernie is by far the strongest candidate against donald trump briggs said on monday sanders apos supporters expressed disappointment that the calls were made before california apos s primary and urged the senator to continue on despite the pronouncements we apos re going to keep fighting until the last vote is counted said kristen elliott a sanders apos supporter from san francisco who attended the rally said another attendee patrick bryant of san francisco it apos s what bookies do they call fights before they apos re over house minority leader nancy pelosi endorsed clinton during an interview on good morning america before her home state s primary i apos m a voter in california and i have voted for hillary clinton for president of the united states and proud to endorse her for that position pelosi said though adding it apos s not over until it apos s over clinton has won 1 812 pledged delegates in primaries and caucuses she also has the support of 571 superdelegates according to an associated press count the ap surveyed all 714 superdelegates repeatedly in the past seven months and only 95 remain publicly uncommitted all the superdelegates counted in clinton apos s tally have unequivocally told the ap they will back her at the convention and not change their vote since the start of the ap apos s survey in late 2015 no superdelegates have switched from supporting clinton to backing sanders clinton s presumptive victory monday came nearly eight years to the day after she conceded her first white house campaign to barack obama back then she famously noted her inability to shatter that highest hardest glass ceiling campaigning this time as the loyal successor to obama clinton fended off a surprisingly strong challenge from vermont sen sanders he mobilized millions with a fervently liberal message and his insurgent candidacy revealed a deep level of national frustration with politics as usual even among democrats who have controlled the white house since 2009 clinton outpaced sanders in winning new superdelegate endorsements even after his string of primary and caucus wins in may following the results in puerto rico it is no longer possible for sanders to reach the 2 383 needed to win the nomination based on the remaining available pledged delegates and uncommitted superdelegates according to the ap clinton leads sanders by more than 3 million cast votes by 291 pledged delegates and by 523 superdelegates she also won 29 caucuses and primaries compared to his 21 victories echoing the sentiments of california gov jerry brown who overcame a decades long rivalry with the clinton family to endorse her last week many superdelegates expressed a desire to close ranks around a nominee who could defeat trump in november beyond winning over millions of sanders supporters who vow to remain loyal to the self described democratic socialist clinton faces challenges as she turns toward november including criticism of her decision to use a private email server run from her new york home while serving as secretary of state her deep unpopularity among republicans has pushed many leery of trump to nevertheless embrace his campaign this to me is about saving the country and preventing a third progressive liberal term which is what a clinton presidency would do house speaker paul ryan told the ap last week after he finally endorsed trump weeks after the new yorker clinched the gop nomination yet clinton showed no signs of limping into the general election as she approached the milestone leaving sanders behind and focusing on lacerating trump she said electing the billionaire businessman who has spent months hitting her and her husband with bitingly personal attacks would be a historic mistake he is not just unprepared he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge stability and immense responsibility clinton said last week in a speech that was striking in its forcefulness previewing a brutal five month general election campaign to come even without the nomination sanders can claim ideological victory his liberal positions pushed the issue of income inequality into the spotlight and drove clinton to the left on issues such as trade wall street and campaign finance reform but she prevailed in part by claiming much of the coalition that boosted obama she won overwhelming support from women and minorities catapulting her to decisive victories in diverse delegate rich states such as new york and texas when clinton launched her campaign last april she did so largely unopposed having scared off more formidable challengers by locking down much of the party apos s organizational and fundraising infrastructure vice president joe biden seen as her most threatening rival opted not to run in october of the four opponents who did take her on sanders was the only one who emerged to provide a serious challenge he caught fire among young voters and independents his campaign gaining momentum from a narrow loss in iowa in february and a commanding victory in new hampshire his ability to raise vast sums of money online gave him the resources to continue into the spring but clinton vowed not to repeat the failings of her 2008 campaign and focused early on winning delegates hiring help from obama apos s old team before launching her campaign they pushed superdelegates into making early commitments and held campaign appearances in areas where they could win the most pledged delegates her victory in nevada in late february diminished concerns from allies about her campaign operation decisive wins in southern states on super tuesday and a sweep of march 15 contests gave her a significant delegate lead which became insurmountable by the end of april after big victories in new york and in the northeast she now moves on to face trump whose ascent to the top of the republican party few expected the brash real estate mogul and reality tv star has long since turned his attention from primary foes to clinton debuting a nickname crooked hillary and arguing she belongs in jail for her email setup after a long primary campaign clinton said this past weekend in california she was ready to accept his challenge we apos re judged by our words and our deeds not our race not our ethnicity not our religion she said saturday in oxnard so it is time to judge donald trump by his words and his deeds and i believe that his words and his deeds disqualify him from being president of the united states the associated press contributed to this report get all the stories you need to know from the most powerful name in news
