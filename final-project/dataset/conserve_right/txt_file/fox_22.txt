video clip male speaker so many basic and fundamental errors were made by three separate hand picked investigative teams on one of the most sensitive fbi investigations end video clip chris wallace the ig finding no political bias in opening the probe of the trump campaign but laying out plenty of blame begin video clip male speaker it doesn apost vindicate anyone at the fbi who touched this including the leadership end video clip chris wallace we aposll discuss the findings with former fbi director james comey who says the report clears him it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive then a straight party line vote begin video clip male speaker aye male speaker no male speaker aye male speaker no adam schiff the article is agreed to the resolution is amended as ordered reported favorably to the house end video clip chris wallace sends two articles of impeachment to the full house laying out charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress against president trump begin video clip president trump to use the power of impeachment on this nonsense is an embarrassment to this country end video clip chris wallace we aposll ask pam bondi a special adviser to the president about the white house defense strategy and we aposll discuss the democrats case with house intelligence chair adam schiff plus we aposll ask our sunday panel what new fox polls mean for impeachment and the 2020 race all right now on fox news sunday and hello again from fox news in washington this week members of the house will cast one of the most consequential votes of their careers for or against impeaching the 45th president of the united states donald trump democrats are expected to approve two articles of impeachment on a straight party line vote setting up a senate trial early next year meanwhile the inspector general of the justice department released his long awaited report on the fbi aposs handling of the trump russia investigation in a moment we aposll discuss that in an exclusive interview with former fbi director james comey but first let aposs bring in kevin corke with the latest from the white house kevin kevin corke chris trade deals with canada and mexico even china and a major domestic policy victory on paid family leave normally each would be a headline in its own right but the release of the long awaited ig report and of course a party line vote on impeachment overshadowed them all begin video clip male speaker today is a solemn and sad day kevin corke it went as expected male speaker aye female speaker ms jackson end video clip kevin corke a 23 17 party line judiciary committee vote charging the president with abusing the power of his office over the ukraine scandal and obstruction house democrats apos attempt to investigate him for it the move now sets the stage for a full house vote this week where democrats currently hold 233 seats and would only need 216 votes while new fox polling suggests the nation remains split on impeachment with no change since early october the majority of those surveyed believe he did abuse his power begin video clip donald trump the impeachment is a hoax it aposs a sham end video clip kevin corke the president meanwhile remained defiant buoyed by the fact that leaders of the gop controlled senate have made it clear that if there aposs a trial they won apost remove him from office and perhaps by the release of the long awaited inspector general aposs report investigating fisa abuse and the origins of the russia probe which found significant inaccuracies and omissions made in applications to surveille trump campaign aid carter page inflaming the president aposs rhetoric that his campaign and indeed his presidency were spied upon end video clip kevin corke inspector general horowitz said he was deeply concerned that there were so many basic fundamental errors made by three hand picked investigative teams though he said he was unable to prove any political bias chris chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thank you joining us now former fbi director james comey director welcome to fox news sunday james comey thanks for having me chris wallace you have been taking something of a victory lap since the ig report was released earlier this week the question is whether or not it aposs justified here are you and the inspector general michael horowitz answering the same question begin video clip reporter aposs question do you think this is vindication james comey it is i mean the fbi aposs had to wait two years while the president and his followers lied about the institution finally the truth gets told reporter aposs question does your report vindicate mr comey michael horowitz it doesn apost vindicate anyone at the fbi who touched this including the leadership end video clip chris wallace the ig says you should feel no vindication james comey well maybe it turns upon how we understand the word what i mean is that the fbi was accused of treason of illegal spying of tapping mr trump aposs wires illegally of opening an investigation without justification of being a criminal conspiracy to unseat defeat and then unseat a president all of that was nonsense i think it aposs really important that the inspector general looked at that and that the american people your viewers and all viewers understand that aposs true but he also found things that we were never accused of which is real sloppiness and that aposs concerning as i aposve said all along has to be focused on if i were director i aposd be very concerned about it and diving into it chris wallace well sloppiness may be a euphemism for what it is he found one of his big concerns is the way the fbi handled the fisa applications and the warrants that you were allowed you to surveil carter page who was a former foreign policy advisor to the trump campaign again here is what you said about the fisa process and what the inspector general horowitz said this week take a look begin video clip james comey i have total confidence that the fisa process was followed and that the entire case was handled in a thoughtful responsible way by doj and the fbi michael horowitz we identified significant inaccuracies and omissions in each of the four applications seven in the first application and a total of 17 by the final renewal application end video clip chris wallace seventeen significant errors in the fisa process and you say that it was handled in a thoughtful and appropriate way james comey he aposs right i was wrong i was overconfident in the procedures that the fbi and justice had built over 20 years i thought they were robust enough it aposs incredibly hard to get a fisa i was overconfident in those because he aposs right there was real sloppiness 17 things that either should aposve been in the applications or at least discussed and characterized differently it was not acceptable and so he aposs right i was wrong chris wallace but you make it sound like you aposre a bystander an eyewitness you were the director of the fbi while a lot of this was going on sir james comey sure i aposm responsible for it that aposs why i aposm telling you i was wrong i was overconfident as director in our procedures and it aposs important that a leader be accountable and transparent if i were still director i aposd be saying exactly the same thing that chris ray is saying which is we are going to get to the bottom of this because the most important question is is it systemic are there problems in other cases chris wallace one of the central issues is the role that the steele dossier played which was oppo research paid for by the democrats what role it played in getting the fisa warrants to surveil page again here aposs your version and again here is the inspector general begin video clip james comey my recollection was it was part of a broader mosaic of facts that were laid before the fisa judge to obtain a fisa warrant begin video clip male speaker and we concluded that the steele reporting played a central and essential role in the decision to seek a fisa order end video clip chris wallace horowitz says it wasn apost part as you told bret baier it wasn apost part of a broader mosaic he said it played an essential role in establishing probable cause in fact he says if it hadn apost been for the steele dossier the fbi probably would haven apost even submitted a fisa application that it had been reviewed in april of 2016 or august rather of 2016 they decided not to do it they get the steele dossier they do it it wasn apost part of a broader mosaic that aposs what you said sir james comey i aposm not sure he and i are saying different things what his report says is that the fbi thought it was a close call until they got the steele report put that additional information in and that tipped it over to be probable cause it aposs a long fisa application it includes steele material and lots of other material i don apost think we aposre saying different things chris wallace well i think you are sir because he aposs saying you aposre saying it aposs part of a broader mosaic it aposs just one element he aposs saying it was the tipping point it aposs what brought it over that doesn apost make it part of a broader mosaic it makes it the centerpiece of the whole fisa application and the ability to surveil carter page james comey yeah i don apost understand it to be saying that i could be wrong about that chris wallace well i aposve just i aposve got his james comey i understand chris wallace quote here he says we concluded the steele reporting played a central and essential role in the decision to seek a fisa warrant that it pushed the fisa proposal over the line in terms of establishing probable cause i mean he says james comey yeah chris wallace what he says words mean something james comey yeah and i agree with his characterization i aposm just confused i no i don apost see the disconnect between the two of us and i aposm sorry that i aposm missing it chris wallace well you don apost see a difference between it aposs part of a broader mosaic and it was the it played an essential role in establishing probable cause james comey it was one of a bunch of different facts that were assembled to apply to the court it was the one that convinced the lawyers that they had enough now with that added to the pile to go forward chris wallace i guess the question is it seemed that you were minimizing the role of the steele dossier and he aposs saying it aposs a lot more important than you let on james comey okay if i was then i aposm sorry that i did that but i meant it was one part of the presentation to the court it was not a huge part of the presentation to the court but it was the fact according to his report that convinced the lawyers to go forward chris wallace all right then there is the issue of how reliable the steele dossier in fact was on january 6th 2017 in the trump tower you briefed donald trump president elect about the steele dossier that same month the fbi talks to steele aposs main russian contact the main person on whom he based the dossier who says according to the ig report quote steele misstated or exaggerated the primary sub source aposs statements in multiple sections of the reporting director comey not only do you fail to go back to the president elect or president after january 20th and tell him oh you know that report i briefed you on turns out it aposs bunk but the fbi goes back and renews its fisa application three more times and by this point the fbi knows that the steele reporting is not credible james comey yeah i think you aposre mischaracterizing both what the fbi knew and what mr horowitz says in his report they didn apost conclude the reporting from steele was bunk they concluded there was significant questions about the reliability of some of the sub source reporting that should have been included in the renewals when i briefed the president i briefed him on a small part of it that i told him i didn apost know whether it was true or not i didn apost care i just needed him to know about it chris wallace i think you aposre mischaracterizing steele isn apost or rather horowitz isn apost saying that the sub source the russian contact was unreliable or was inaccurate the russian contact said to the fbi steele is unreliable because he misrepresented steele misstated or exaggerated the source aposs statements in multiple sections of the report he aposs saying i told him one thing and he wrote something else the fbi knew that james comey yeah but that doesn apost drive a conclusion that steele aposs reporting is bunk i mean there aposs a number of tricky things to that first you aposre interviewing the sub source after all of the reporting has become public and so as a counterintelligence investigator you have to think is he walking away from it because it aposs now public chris wallace well but james comey and that has to go into your assessment if mr steele chris wallace but it doesn apost it hasn apost i mean if it had become public just barely this is in january of 2017 this isn apost two years later james comey right this is when it blew up when it was published by whatever the outfit is buzzfeed it was all over the news and had become a big deal and so i chris wallace did you know all of this james comey all of what chris wallace everything that we aposre talking about here did you know that in fact the steele report was the key for probable cause did you know that the fbi had talked to the russian contact and he said what steele said he had told him was not true did you know this you aposre the fbi director james comey first again the report will speak for itself i don apost believe the fbi concluded that steele aposs reporting was bunk after talking to his sub source but no i didn apost as the director you aposre not kept informed on the details of an investigation so no in general i didn apost know what they aposd learned from the sub source i didn apost know the particulars of the investigation chris wallace but this isn apost some investigation sir this is an investigation of the campaign of the man who is the president of the united states you had just been through a firestorm investigating hillary clinton i would think if i were in your position i would have been on that you know like a junkyard dog i would have wanted to know everything they were doing in investigating the trump campaign james comey yeah that aposs not the way it works though as a director sitting on top of an organization of 38 000 people you can apost run an investigation that aposs seven layers below you you have to leave it to the career professionals to do to the special agents who do this for their lives and if a director tires to run an investigation it aposll get mucked up in all different kinds of ways given his or her responsibilities and the impossibility of reaching the work that aposs being done at the lower level chris wallace all right and then there is best for last the worst misconduct in august of 2016 just two weeks into the investigation the cia tells the fbi that it actually has a relationship with carter page that when he has these meetings with the russians he actually goes back and he tells the cia about it but you never tell the fisa court that and in fact in 2017 an fbi lawyer doctors a document the cia said oh carter page he aposs a source and he puts in the application he aposs not a source james comey yeah i aposve got to take issue with one of the i aposll answer the question but one of the predications of your question the inspector general did not find misconduct by any fbi people he found mistakes and negligence in oversight chris wallace no no no it is not true james comey he did not chris wallace in the case of kevin clinesmith he has referred it for criminal investigation james comey right but that aposs not been resolved this business with the lawyer changing some email to a partner on the team chris wallace i mean you make it sound like it aposs not much james comey no no it aposs very important chris wallace it aposs quite a lot james comey it aposs very important chris wallace i mean not a source a source to not a source is a big deal james comey but remember how we got here the fbi was accused of criminal misconduct remember i was going to jail and lots of other people were going to jail people on this network said it over and over and over again the inspector general did not find misconduct by fbi personnel did not find political bias did not find illegal conduct the inspector general found significant mistakes and that is not something to sneeze at that aposs really important but the american people especially your viewers need to realize they were given false information about the fbi it aposs honest it is not political it is flawed chris wallace would you agree that the fisa court was also given false information by the fbi james comey i think that aposs fair the fbi should have included or at least pushed to the lawyers so they could make a decision information that you just said things like that that another agency not a source relationship but some kind of contact relationship chris wallace okay james comey so chris wallace i want to get to three last questions james comey okay chris wallace and one of them has to do with how serious what this is you aposve talked a lot about mistakes or sloppiness horowitz concludes three separate teams made significant errors in four separate fisa applications on one of the fbi aposs most significant cases i mean the investigation of president trump and his campaign james comey he was trump i have to keep correcting you president trump was not being investigated his campaign was not being investigated four americans two of whom were no longer associated with the campaign were being investigated chris wallace okay he was asked how he explains it horowitz here he is begin video clip michael horowitz it aposs unclear what the motivations were on the one hand gross incompetence negligence on the other hand intentionality end video clip chris wallace gross negligence or they intended to do it they intended to lie to the fisa court you were in charge during a lot of this sir james comey he chris wallace and in fact you signed the fisa applications james comey sure i think i signed at least two or three of them he doesn apost conclude that there was intentional misconduct by these career special agents chris wallace no he just says it aposs one of two things and he can apost decide gross negligence or it was intentional misconduct james comey well i aposve read chris wallace that aposs what he said james comey i aposve read his report he says i we are not concluding that there was intentional misconduct by fbi officials chris wallace did you hear what he just said here james comey i did i don apost know the context of that i aposve chris wallace he was asked specifically how do you explain it and he said gross negligence or intentionality james comey yeah well i aposm sorry he doesn apost find intentionality but that doesn apost make it any less important as director you are responsible for this i was responsible for this and if i were still there i aposd be doing what chris wray is doing is figuring out so how did this happen and is it systemic because that aposs the scariest thought is that chris wallace if you were still there and all of this came out and it turned out it happened on your watch would you resign james comey no i don apost think so there are mistakes i consider more consequential than this during my tenure and the important thing is to be transparent about it and then look to fix it and explain to the american people how you fixed it chris wallace a couple of final questions as you know attorney general barr has been harshly critical of how the fbi conducted this entire operation here s how he reacted to the ig s findings of whatever you want to call it in the handling of the fisa applications begin video clip bill barr these irregularities these misstatements these omissions were not satisfactorily explained and i think that leaves open the possibility to infer bad faith end video clip chris wallace given the repeated errors some would say abuses of the fisa process does attorney general barr have a point james comey no he does not have a factual basis as the attorney general of the united states to be speculating that agents acted in bad faith the facts just aren t there full stop that doesn t make it any less consequential any less important but that s an irresponsible statement chris wallace finally here s president trump and here s how he reacted to the ig report on the fbi investigation begin video clip donald trump they ve destroyed the lives of people that were great people that are still great people their lives have been destroyed by scum okay by scum end video clip chris wallace i d like your response to that and i d like you specifically because you said the other day where does former fbi lawyer lisa page go to get her reputation back where does carter page go the target of these fisa warrants and surveillance where does he go to get his reputation back james comey it s a great question carter page was treated unfairly most significantly by his name being made public he s a united states citizen and it never should have been made public and that s an outrage but that statement is just a continuation of the lies about the fbi the fbi is an honest apolitical organization remember the treason remember the spying remember all of us going to jail that was false information that your viewers and millions of others were given my own mother in law was worried i was going to jail i kept telling her look it s all made up it s all made up don t worry about it but i couldn t say that publicly for two years well now i m saying it on behalf of the fbi it was all made up and i hope people will stare at that and learn about what the fbi is like human and flawed but deeply committed to trying to do the right thing chris wallace director comey people are going to have their reaction to what you said but thank you for coming in thank you for taking all our questions sir james comey thanks for having me chris wallace up next we ll discuss white house plans for defending the president with a key member of his impeachment team former florida attorney general pam bondi joins us next commercial break chris wallace president trump has lashed out at the democrats impeachment push calling it an embarrassment to the country but he adds it seems to good for him politically joining us now pam bondi a special adviser to the president and a key member of his impeachment defense team all right pam during the break you said you wanted to respond to director comey pam bondi i sure do chris wallace go ahead pam bondi sure do chris you know he s right the men and the women of the fbi deserve much better than what they had much better than what they had in james comey that man was fired in disgrace he must have read a different report than we all read he presided over the fbi in times worse than when j edgar hoover was at the fbi that man led the fbi and it s unbelievable that steele dossier was central and essential to this report it was fake we know it was fake and he says that his people did nothing wrong and first of all he was the leader he was the one charged with briefing the president when in fact he was spying on the president i can t that guy needs a lawyer by the way i can t believe this he repeatedly misled the fisa court clinesmith as you said lied doctored an email as well as the people refusing to provide the court with exculpatory evidence chris wallace okay pam bondi meaning evidence chris wallace i ve got pam bondi that will clear the president chris wallace okay laughs we went over a lot of that with him on the other hand and i want to move on to impeachment but on the other hand comey does point out that the inspector general found there was no political bias in opening not the fisa warrant opening the investigation and that it was opened on a legitimate basis and he points all the president s talk about obama ordering the tapping of his phones all of the talk about treason i mean if comey is responsible for his misstatements is the president responsible for his pam bondi well first of all comey was spying on the president when he went in to brief him yet they felt compelled to brief russia and putin yet not the candidate and then the president elect of the united states chris wallace but you re not answering my question pam bondi and as far as yeah let me answer the question about you saying that there was no bias opening in the report because john durham disagreed with that chris wallace i didn t say it that s what the inspector general said pam bondi yeah john durham disagreed with that the inspector general can only look at doj he can only talk to the people who would talk to him in fact he tried to talk to comey he brought comey in and he had to read comey kept saying he couldn apost recall he couldn apost recollect so they had to read him back in his security clearance and he refused to do that because he didn apost want to have to answer for all this chris wallace okay pam bondi john durham said he disagrees with that because he has he can talk to outside entities such as the cia many others he can talk to other people he can talk to other countries so i think we need to wait and see i d love to come back on your show after durham answers his investigation and by the way he has a grand jury chris wallace that s pam bondi so a lot of people need to be very very concerned chris wallace that s a date we aposll have you back on pam bondi love to chris wallace let aposs talk about to impeachment let aposs talk about the senate trial here aposs what senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said about working with the white house this week begin video clip mitch mcconnell everything i do during this i m coordinating with white house counsel there will be no difference between the president aposs position and our position as to how to handle this end video clip chris wallace now democrats note that before an impeachment trial all senators have to raise their right hand and take an oath to do impartial justice how impartial can it be when mcconnell says that he quote is taking his cues from the white house pam bondi well okay so chris go back to the house proceedings adam schiff started those proceedings himself chris wallace wait wait pam pam bondi hidden in a back room of the capitol chris wallace i m asking you pam bondi hold on chris wallace i m just but wait i aposm asking you about mcconnell saying he s taking his cues from the white house please answer the question pam bondi so we weren apost given a fair trial in the house at all now it goes to the senate and these senators the president deserves to be heard we should be working hand in hand with them the rules of evidence will apply these are the senators who will decide if our president is impeached which will not happen we should and will work hand in hand with them these are some of the weakest charges out there chris you know that originally bribery all these things were thrown out absolutely nothing we are we wouldn apost be doing our job if we weren apost working hand in hand with the senate to clear the president of this charade this sham that started with adam schiff your next guest and we aposre not going to let it continue in the u s senate chris wallace all right pam bondi because we will have fair proceedings chris wallace all right let aposs turn to this week when the house is basically certain to impeach the president of the united states here is the chair of the judiciary committee jerry nadler begin video clip jerry nadler for the third time in a little over a century and a half the house judiciary committee has voted articles of impeachment against the president end video clip chris wallace now i aposve read earlier interviews with you you say the president is focused on doing the people aposs business but this is a stain the president says it aposs not a good thing for your resume so i aposm asking you not on political talking points but on a human level and i know you aposve been in conversations with him how does he feel about the fact that he aposs about to be the third president in american history to be impeached pam bondi well the president says this is difficult on his family of course it is because during the week chris when they delivered a disgraceful vote to impeachment the president during that week and these aren apost talking points this is what the president was doing the work of the american people usmca the china trade deal the work of the american people combating anti semitism by executive order holding a summit on family paid leave that aposs his focus going nonstop for the american people so is this difficult of course it is and that aposs why the lawyers we are all handling this impeachment sham and charade with the weakest of weak evidence chris wallace okay pam bondi now as you said going to the u s senate chris wallace okay well i didn apost say it was a weak case i just asked you about the senate trial congressman jeff van drew of new jersey who was one of the two democrats who voted against the impeachment inquiry in the first place plans to switch parties and become a republican are you in the white house are you asking him to hold off so when he casts his vote against impeachment this week he casts it as a democrat pam bondi no i have had you know what i have had no conversations with him nor have i known of any of that i heard that this morning that he may change his party he aposs probably changing his party chris because he knows what his constituents care about they care about jobs they care about the economy they care about the safety of their community all these things haven t been happening because of these sham proceedings started by your next guest adam schiff in a secret room in a bunker and republicans and democrats are seeing this and democrats alike they care about what their constituents want what aposs important to this country they know the president aposs not going to be impeached and all this money and time being wasted when all so many great things so many bipartisan things could be happening for our country chris wallace okay i have one final question for you president trump tweeted late yesterday that we fox news sunday should not even be doing an interview with james comey or with adam schiff i want to put up this tweet he writes both commie cast msnbc and fake news cnn are watching their ratings tank don apost know why fox news wants to be more like them they aposll all die together as other outlets take their place only pro trump fox shows do well my question pam is does the president understand that it aposs the duty of a free and fair press to cover both sides of the story pam bondi chris of course he does i think he aposs so tired of hearing all these lies and frankly i aposm going to disagree with the president right now because i aposm glad you had james comey on because you caught him in multiple misrepresentations once again and i can apost wait to hear from adam schiff next he is the one who has abused the only one who has abused their power in this entire proceeding is adam schiff and i want to hear him answer your tough questions he has lied ad nauseum about the president about the involvement chris wallace okay pam bondi subpoenaing phone records of his colleagues attorneys and fellow journalists so i can apost wait to hear what he aposs going to say when you question him chris wallace well thank you very much for the promo thanks for the plug pam bondi thank you thanks for your time please come back and we aposll have some more tough questions for you pam bondi i aposd love to thank you chris wallace coming up we aposll discuss the democrats apos case for impeachment and what a senate trial would look like with house intelligence chair adam schiff that aposs next commercial break chris wallace coming up house judiciary votes out articles of impeachment against a president for the third time since 1974 begin video clip donald trump someday there aposll be a democrat president and there aposll be a republican house and i suspect they aposre going to remember it chris wallace we aposll ask house intelligence chair adam schiff if democrats are making impeachment the new normal commercial break chris wallace next week the house the full house will vote on whether president trump abused the power of his office and obstructed congress charges that arose from a house intelligence committee investigation led by our next guest chairman adam schiff who aposs a frequent target of the president congressman president trump says that this is the weakest impeachment of a president in history he calls it impeachment lite here is what he said well actually excuse me here aposs what you said during the hearings about the crimes he committed begin video clip adam schiff it was a failed effort to bribe ukraine a failed effort to extort ukraine end video clip chris wallace but the president notes that none of that bribery extortion is in the articles of impeachment why not adam schiff well we aposve charged the president with abusing his power bribery and extortion are a subset of an abuse of power and frankly abuse of power better connotes the full range of the president aposs misconduct the pattern of his misconduct his efforts to invite russian interference his efforts to obstruct the inquiry into that invitation to russia to intervene but then most pernicious his use of his office his abuse of his power to attempt to get an ally to help him cheat in the next election sacrificing our national security undermining the integrity of our elections we think that abuse of power most accurately characterizes the sweep of the president aposs misconduct chris wallace all right you also accuse him another article of impeachment is obstructing congress by refusing to comply with subpoenas but on friday the supreme court agreed to hear cases where the house had subpoenaed the president aposs financial records and the supreme court says it wants to hear and deliberate that case so why is going to court an impeachable offense adam schiff well going to court is not an impeachable offense stonewalling completely refusing to comply with the oversight of congress particularly during an impeachment inquiry is an impeachable offense indeed richard nixon was about to be impeached for a far less comprehensive effort to stonewall the congress of his day and i would just say to my republican colleagues who appear to be on the verge of shirking their constitutional duty if they aposre prepared to say that a president of the united states can simply say no to any congressional subpoena and tie up the congress for years in litigation it is going to have to accept corruption malfeasance negligence misconduct in any future president democratic or republican are we really prepared to go down that road in many respects chris i think this may be the most serious of the articles because it was it would fundamentally alter the balance of power and allow for much greater misconduct in the chief executive of the country the last point i aposd make chris is among the acts of stonewalling is the utter refusal to turn over a single document from any of the departments to turn over the notes for example of ambassador taylor chris wallace right adam schiff or his cable to secretary pompeo all of these things are being withheld there is no legal basis to do so and so yes the president can sue all he wants it aposs a delay tactic and he aposs repeatedly lost in court but that doesn apost make it any less an act of obstruction chris wallace president trump says that if the house as expected votes articles of impeachment this week and it goes to a senate trial that he would like to call you as a witness here he is on you begin video clip donald trump i think adam schiff is a deranged human being i think he grew up with a complex for lots of reasons that are obvious i think he aposs a very sick man end video clip adam schiff laughs chris wallace first of all what do you think of the president aposs psychoanalysis and if his lawyers call you to testify as a witness on the senate floor will you comply adam schiff well in terms of the president aposs comments i guess all i would say is this president does nothing if not project onto others his own misconduct in terms of whether i aposm a witness i aposm not a fact witness in any way chris and the president knows that he also wants to call the speaker as a witness this is merely his common tactic and that is he can apost defend his gross misconduct he can apost defend his abuse of power chris wallace but if adam schiff he can apost defend chris wallace if i may interrupt adam schiff withholding 400 million chris wallace excuse me adam schiff in military aid chris wallace sir excuse me adam schiff and so he simply attacks those chris wallace just for a minute he i just want to pick up on the adam schiff who stand up to him chris wallace one point of the fact witness because he would say adam schiff yeah chris wallace that contact either you or a member of your staff had with the whistleblower does make you a fact witness adam schiff well the fact that the whistleblower did have contact with my staff doesn apost make me a fact witness but nonetheless nor does it make the speaker a fact witness this isn apost about fact witnesses there are in fact members of congress who are witnesses senator johnson had a discussion with the president senator graham had discussions with the president about the withholding of aid they may be fact witnesses we didn apost seek to call them we aposre not seeking to make a circus out of this but the president is because he can apost defend his gross abuse of his office he can apost defend withholding military aid from an ally at war the damage he aposs done to our national security all he can do is attack and sadly too many of the republican members are willing to debase themselves by doing whatever the president asks chris wallace finally i want to switch to the inspector general report because you have weighed in on that in 2018 you were the ranking member the top democrat in the minority in the intelligence committee devin nunes the then republican chair issued a report talking about all the problems with the fisa warrants and the fbi case you defended the fbi aposs use of fisa warrants to surveil carter page in a lengthy memo here you are discussing that begin video clip adam schiff it aposs important for the public to see the facts that the fbi acted appropriately in seeking a warrant on carter page they aposre not part of some deep state as the president apparently would like the public to believe end video clip chris wallace after reading the ig aposs report which discusses 17 serious errors of omission some would say misconduct on the part of the fbi do you still think that the fbi acted appropriately as you said there adam schiff well i think this is consistent with the ig report they were right to seek a fisa on carter page and there wasn apost some deep state conspiracy there was no spying on the trump campaign there was no effort to based on political bias open the investigation it was properly predicated but there were nonetheless serious abuses of fisa which were not apparent two years ago but which have become apparent now with 170 witnesses interviewed and two million documents reviewed by the ig and i am glad that the ig made the recommendations that he has made and the fbi is going to follow them but that wasn apost apparent to us two years ago but the most significant things i think are that corrective steps will be taken in terms of the fisa process and that the ig debunked these claims by the president by mr nunes and others of this deep state conspiracy this improper investigation it would have been negligent for them not to conduct this investigation chris wallace i aposve just got a minute left because at that time in 2018 you said the fbi and department of justice did not quote omit material information apparently you did not know at the time that in fact steele aposs main russian sources had told the fbi that he had misrepresented what that russian source had said and that the fbi knew at the time that carter page in fact was acting as a contact as an unofficial source for the cia given what you know now we talked earlier to director comey and he basically said i was wrong in what i represented back in 2018 are you willing to admit that you were wrong in your defense of the fbi aposs fisa process adam schiff oh i aposm certainly willing to admit that the inspector general found serious abuses of fisa that i was unaware of had i known of them chris yes i would have called out the fbi at the same time but i think it aposs only fair to judge what we knew at the time not what would be revealed two years later but yes there were very serious abuses of the fisa process they need to be corrected we need to make sure they never happen again chris wallace chairman schiff thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir adam schiff thank you chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the ig report impeachment and new fox polls on the state of the 2020 democratic race commercial break begin video clip donald trump this was an overthrow of government this was an attempted overthrow and a lot of people were in on it and they got caught they got caught red handed end video clip chris wallace president trump reacting to the inspector general s report on how the fbi handled its trump russia investigation and it s time now for our sunday group guy benson of fox news radio mo elleithee of georgetown university s institute of public politics and service julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and host of ap s new ground game podcast and townhall com editor katie pavlich katie let me start with you democrats are hanging their hat in terms of the ig report on his finding that the investigation into the trump campaign was legitimately opened that there was no political bias republicans on these repeated abuses or errors in the fisa process who s got the better side of that argument katie pavlich i think republicans do because democrats should be very concerned about what the ig laid out in his testimony and in his report you know james comey the former fbi director in his interview with you continues to refer to these omissions as mistakes as sloppy behavior but you don t omit information like carter page is an asset for the cia in a fisa application if you don apost do that on purpose that is not something you just forget about you also don t fail to take out information that christopher steele is connected to the clinton campaign through the dossier by mistake these are things that were obviously calculated the ig repeatedly kept saying i understand why people feel there may be some kind of bias here he says it s inexplicable why the 17 actions happened well the explanation for this is that there was a group that was handpicked by andrew mccabe at the fbi they all were engaged in this not a single person said why are we omitting and doctoring information and lying to the fisa court to get this warrant chris wallace mo i understand there are two parts to this report horowitz says there was no political bias in opening the investigation he talks about problems with the big problems with the fisa process but isn t it harder to argue that there was no political bias overall when you see 17 mistakes made by three teams on four separate fisa applications mo elleithee well it you can say that and the inspector general seems to say that looking at what led to the fisa application was not politically motivated that that was not based on any political bias you can look at the end result and see that of the four individuals who were investigated three of them either convicted or pled guilty to some sort of a crime you can also say that there were these serious problems and that the fbi should look at whether or not they are systemic whether they were intentional or whether they were sloppiness all these things can be true and i think either side that tries to cherry pick the results of this and point to just what helps them is doing a huge disservice to this process all these things seem to be true or can be true and should be part of the conversation chris wallace okay let s turn to impeachment and the apparent vote to impeach and then a trial in the senate julie talking to your sources at the white house have they figured out what they want in a senate trial there s this debate a long trial witnesses hunter biden the whistleblower maybe john bolton have they figured out whether they want the long trial with all of this spilling out or a much shorter trial which basically they go over the evidence that s already been established and what about this confusion as to who s going to be lead the defense for the president everybody assumed it was going to be the white house counsel pat cipollone now apparently the president is polling people as he is wont to do well maybe we should find somebody else julie pace laughs i think there are a lot of active discussions underway right now both inside the white house and then between the white house and republican leaders in the senate about what this will look like who will defend the president the president in the course of one answer this week said he would be okay with a short trial but also wanted a longer one and i think the key to this the key sort of difference right now between the white house and the senate leadership is that president trump doesn t just want acquittal through this trial he wants vindication he wants people to watch this trial six days a week and come out and not just say i don t think he should be removed from office i don apost think he did anything wrong there s some interest on the senate republican side in just simply getting through this quickly just saying that we are going to acquit the president and moving on but the president is pushing for more and to your question about cipollone this is kind of classic trump here this is the person who was seen as the lead lawyer here but trump also looks at this as a reality television star this is going to be a televised process he wants the best person not just legally but also for the visual effect for the televised portion of this the big question and this comes up a lot when you see the second guessing is who would the replacement be and there hasn t been a clear answer to that chris wallace alan dershowitz julie pace that is not a popular option i would say among a lot of the senate republicans right now chris wallace okay we told you about new fox polls on impeachment at the top of the hour we also did some polling about the state of the 2020 race we want to put those up in the democratic horse race joe biden holds on to a solid lead 10 points ahead this is national polls 10 points ahead of bernie sanders elizabeth warren has faded to third pete buttigieg and michael bloomberg in single digits everybody else behind them and democrats seem to be leaning more moderate at this point when asked who s about right on the issues biden and buttigieg lead the way and bloomberg does pretty well too guy what do those numbers tell you about the state of the democratic race and the state of the democratic electorate guy benson well joe biden just keeps trucking along right you know there s all these flaws and he gives bad answers he s not great on the stump and certainly in debates he has occasional head scratchers let s say of answers but the electorate is looking at their options the democratic electorate and saying we think this is probably our safest bet to beat president trump and a lot of the polling both nationally and in the swing states crucial states there s that out what struck me is the democratic primary voters on sort of the porridge test like is it too left too right or just right when it comes to positions on the issues joe biden has a double digit lead on that question over both elizabeth warren and bernie sanders and if you break it out not just democrats but nationally you ask all voters do these people have the right ideas bernie and warren are both at 31 percent who say yes we re good with that that is less than one third of the population comfortable with the positions of warren and sanders that s significant chris wallace mo i want to sneak you in we ve got less than a minute left but has the democratic push to the left and the green new deal and medicare for all has that kind of abated and are democrats focusing more now on beating the president and being more in the center mo elleithee well yeah i think if you look at clears throat excuse me multiple polls you ll see the point that guy just made and that is the democratic electorate is not following the narrative that there s this huge leftward lurch in the party democratic voters tend to be more sort of center left than some of the party leaders are i think one of the untold stories of this election so far has been the staying power of joe biden not just in the national polls but in iowa and new hampshire he is still there at the top chris wallace you know it s interesting they had an election in england and the head of labor jeremy corbyn lost in a landslide and somebody said after there s a difference between twitter and real people who go into the voting booth thank you panel see you next sunday up next why our first amendment freedoms still make america special commercial break chris wallace there s a museum about journalism here in washington called the newseum and it held its final public event this week a celebration of the first amendment i was invited to talk about the importance of a fair and impartial press there was a lot of coverage of what i said about president trump s attacks on press freedom but not so much my comments on bias in the media so here is some of that we are not participants in what we cover we are umpires or observers trying to be objective witnesses to what is going on if the president or anyone we aposre covering says something untrue or does something questionable we can and should report it but we shouldn apost be drawn into the fight we shouldn apost be drawn into taking
