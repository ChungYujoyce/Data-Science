apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic singapore ap the leaders of china and taiwan met saturday for the first time since the formerly bitter cold war foes split amid civil war 66 years ago and though no concrete agreement resulted both hailed the meeting as a sign of a new stability in relations chinese president xi jinping and taiwanese president ma ying jeou came together on neutral ground in the southeast asian city state of singapore walking toward each other in a hotel ballroom in front of a backdrop of yellow a traditional color of chinese emperors the two men smiled broadly as they shook hands for more than one minute turning slightly to the side to accommodate a host of photojournalists in the ballroom no national flags were present a necessary work around to overcome china s refusal to recognize taiwan s sovereignty or its government s formal legitimacy and the two men were referred to merely as mr xi and mr ma to further reduce the chances of bruised sensitivities top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds in brief opening remarks in front of reporters before going into a closed door meeting xi said history will record this day he alluded to china s long cherished goals of unification with taiwan saying we are one family and no force can pull us apart ma said both sides should respect each other s values and way of life while adding that relations between the sides were the most peaceful and stable they have ever been when they split in 1949 both sides aspired to absorb the other with each claiming the mantle of the only legitimate government of all of china taiwan included communist party ruled china still demands that taiwan eventually be unified with the mainland by force if necessary while many citizens of democratic taiwan increasingly prefer to simply maintain the separate status the island has carved out over more than six decades critics of ma in taiwan are wary that his meeting with xi and similar contacts will pave the way for beijing to assert greater control over the island further deepening its international isolation however ma said at a post meeting news conference that he discussed with xi the taiwanese people s desire for greater participation in global society particularly for nongovernmental organizations china refuses to acknowledge the island as anything other than a breakaway province and pressure from beijing keeps taiwan out of the united nations and other major multinational organizations ma said xi told him that china would appropriately handle taiwanese moves toward greater participation on a case by case basis each leader hopes to seal his legacy as one who helped bring decades of division and mistrust to a mutually acceptable end but the meeting was more about the symbolism of coming together than about substance both sides had said no agreements would be signed or joint statements issued in all the two men met for an hour afterward the two sides held separate news conferences handled for the chinese side by spokesman zhang zhijun of the taiwan affairs office and for the taiwanese side by ma himself we are here today so that the tragedies in our history cannot be replayed zhang quoted xi as saying at the meeting zhang said that china understands taiwan s desire for greater international space but that beijing cannot agree to moves that would split the country reflecting its insistence that only it can represent the chinese nation ma also said they discussed upgrading a hotline between their cabinet level agencies responsible for contacts between the sides and agreed to study the issue of establishing representative offices on each other s soil a long shot proposal that has languished for years he said he also told xi about fears in taiwan that china might make good on its military threats as seen in the scores of missiles based directly opposite the island and recent chinese war games that appeared to simulate an attack on taiwan s presidential office ma said xi told him that china s defense was comprehensive and not directed at any parties in particular following his news conference ma joined xi at a banquet at the upscale shangri la hotel where the meeting was held three decades of hostilities followed the 1949 split occasionally bursting into warfare in the taiwan strait including over the once heavily militarized matsu and kinmen island group making dialogue all but impossible tensions eased after china shifted to endorsing the option of peaceful unification alongside military threats in 1979 although it wasn t until 1993 that representatives of the two governments met in singapore to establish the groundwork for future talks while subsequent talks achieved little they began bearing fruit after ma s election in 2008 resulting in 23 agreements on trade and technical matters although that has failed to produce beijing s desired progress on political matters saturday s meeting was seen as moving the relationship into a new stage it is because of what has been accumulated over the past seven years that the two sides of the strait can take this historic step today xi said in china where nationalism runs high many have cheered the meeting as a further step in what they consider an inevitable trend toward unification beijing salesman huang xiaojie said the compromise required to arrange the meeting boded well for cross strait relations at an official level it will definitely accelerate taiwan s return he said many in taiwan are wary of such a result and several hundred protesters gathered at the economic affairs ministry in taipei waving banners warning that ma was aiming to sell out taiwan however others see xi s willingness to meet with the top taiwanese leader on foreign soil as a nod of respect toward the island s government even if the meeting s negotiated protocol demanded that the two leaders refer to each other with the title mr rather than president if the two sides meet each other only then will they understand more and gradually become more familiar with each other said 50 year old taipei resident peter sun ma is required to step down after two terms next year with elections in january to choose his successor he has denied that the meeting with xi was aimed at affecting the polls and the event s effect on voter sentiment remains to be seen zhang the chinese official said china had no interest in meddling in taiwan s election but was concerned only that
