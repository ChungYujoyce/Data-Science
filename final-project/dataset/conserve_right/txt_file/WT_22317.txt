apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic augusta maine ap efforts to ban flavored e cigarettes and reduce their appeal to youngsters have sputtered under industry pressure in over a half dozen states this year even as one state michigan moves ahead with its own restrictions and president donald trump promises federal ones in many cases the fight by the industry and its lobbyists has focused on leaving the most popular flavors mint and its close cousin menthol alone but public health experts say that all flavors should be banned and that menthol can still hook kids on vaping the proposal trump outlined on wednesday which would supersede any state inaction includes a ban on mint and menthol and an industry giant quickly indicated it would capitulate top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning we strongly agree with the need for aggressive category wide action on flavored products read a statement released by juul labs inc we will fully comply with the final fda policy when effective but the fight in state legislatures has been fierce lobbyists for the vaping and tobacco industry fought bans on flavors in hawaii california new mexico massachusetts new york maine and connecticut such bans failed or stalled even as michigan s governor this month ordered emergency rules prohibiting flavored e cigarettes new york democratic gov andrew cuomo expressed a desire monday to ban flavored e cigarettes trump s federal proposal as it stands would require no congressional approval meaning lobbying efforts to defeat it could be less effective than in state legislatures juul spent 1 9 million in the first half of the year to try and sway the white house congress and the food and drug administration the vapor technology association has reported spending 78 000 this year in its lobbying fight against california s proposed flavored e cigarettes ban while one of the world s largest tobacco producers altria reported spending over 100 000 last fall solely to lobby such legislation the bills have since stalled reynolds american which sells vuse alto e cigarettes reported spending 240 000 on paid lobbyists in new york this year at least 23 000 alone went to fund their lobbying push against a flavored tobacco ban that failed to pass this year altria which is also juul s biggest investor also spent over 70 000 in maine alone this spring on an online social media and email campaign in its efforts to defeat a ban on flavored e cigarettes and all tobacco products according to lobbying reports filed with state ethics officials maine still has no flavor ban the global e cigarette and vape market was valued at as much as 11 billion in 2018 the rise in teen vaping has been driven mainly by flavored cartridge based products such as juul which controls roughly three quarters of the u s e cigarettes market the proposals and the lobbying fight come as health authorities investigate hundreds of breathing illnesses reported in people who have used e cigarettes and other vaping devices no single device ingredient or additive has been identified though many cases involve marijuana vaping supporters of flavors argue that adult cigarette users say flavors helped them quit and that legislators should instead focus on companies that are trying to hook young nonsmokers with clearly kid friendly marketing and packaging one of the things that we are finding is that state legislatures are reflexively reacting to media stories and without a scientific basis making determinations that flavors are the problem so we need to get rid of all the flavors said tony abboud president of the vapor technology association there had been concern that the tobacco and vaping industries were winning their fight to keep at least the most popular flavors mint and menthol in play that concern has now been tempered by trump s announcement wednesday that his ban would include menthol and mint last november the fda announced plans for a crackdown that could lead to federal regulators pulling all e cigarette flavors besides menthol and mint thought to be useful to adult smokers from shelves the fda also said it would also seek to ban menthol cigarettes the fda s announcement came just two days after juul announced the halting of in store sales of mango fruit creme and cucumber flavors in retail stores the company s ceo has said that juul never intended for young people to use their products but that they are sensitive to concerns raised by the fda and a spokesman for juul ted kwong said before wednesday s announcement by trump that the company would support an outright ban on flavors that mimic kid candies foods and drinks still in line with the fda s proposed policy juul labs still distributes mint menthol and tobacco flavors in retail stores the company also sells flavored products through its website anti tobacco and vaping groups say there s no scientific basis for leaving menthol or mint alone they warn menthol has been unethically marketed toward african americans and that such flavors can still increase the appeal of e cigarettes for young people who aren t smokers by overcoming the harshness of nicotine anything that is overcoming the harshness of tobacco flavoring is something that kids are going to find more appealing said hillary schneider director of government relations in maine for the american cancer society action network but banning minty flavors has been politically contentious in maine convenience store owners upset by a proposed flavor ban argued that mint wintergreen and menthol represent 30 of flavors offered in stores statewide and 32 million in tax revenue lawmakers then considered a tweak to only allow menthol mint and wintergreen flavors maine ended up passing a bill backed by the tobacco and vaping industries as well as small retail stores that instead makes it illegal to sell e cigarettes to people under 21 and give them to minors under 16 officials in michigan gov gretchen whitmer s administration discussed exempting mint and menthol flavors from the e cigarette ban but determined that the action taken was the best path forward to protect youth said bob wheaton spokesman for the state department of health and human services a court challenge is expected for michigan s ban abboud argued before w
