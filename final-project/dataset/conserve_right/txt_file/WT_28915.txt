tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn seoul south korea ap for president donald trump a four day visit to asia is shaping up to be more about relationships than results in japan for the group of 20 summit trump notched few identifiable accomplishments on a range of pressing challenges as he savored the show of diplomatic backslapping he went into his meetings with friends and foes alike against the backdrop of global crises from iranian aggression to russian election meddling eager to avoid a repeat of his past tumultuous international summit visits trump traded hard nosed negotiations for compliments and sidestepped thorny issues in public with even the most troublesome of global figures top stories trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots after meeting with russia s vladimir putin saudi arabia s mohammed bin salman turkey s recep tayyep erdogan and china s xi jinping all of whom have authoritarian tendencies the president invoked the imperative of strong relationships nine times in a closing news conference at the g 20 i really have a good relationship with everybody he said then he moved on to south korea holding out hope for another chance to show off what may be his art of the handshake he invited north korea s kim jong un to join him for a quick exchange of greetings at the heavily fortified demilitarized zone the prioritization of personal ties over concrete achievements revealed the unexpected flip side to trump s transactional view of foreign policy despite his reputation as a dogged negotiator he often frames developing connections with world leaders as an end unto itself we have a great relationship and that s very important whether you have a place like saudi arabia in all fairness or china or north korea or any country trump said otherwise you end up in a lot of very bad wars and lots of problems at the same time though trump hasn t hesitated to insult and undercut some of america s closest allies straining ties with partners such as france s emmanuel macron canada s justin trudeau and germany s angela merkel he publicly aired grievances against japan germany and india in the days leading up to his trip to asia during his travels he directed valuable attention to weighing in on domestic issues and u s politics a focus that otherwise could have been devoted to diplomacy in osaka trump s cultivation of world figures played out in ways big and small in a meeting with merkel he set aside concerns about germany s defense spending he was cavalier with putin about the issue of russian interference in american elections which u s intelligence agencies fear will occur again in 2020 i honestly don t know what trump s goals are said michael mcfaul ambassador to russia under president barack obama he defines a good meeting and a positive relationship with putin as the goal that should be the means to achieving the real goals trump praised the summit host japan s shinzo abe for his hospitality trump fondly recounted to xi the red carpet welcome granted to the american nearly two years ago when he visited beijing as he and xi declared a cease fire in their countries trade war trump enthused that chinese culture is an incredible culture and repeatedly called xi his friend trump aides contend that he is taking the long view on personal diplomacy believing that while it may seem at odds with his oft invoked america first worldview it did create images of statesmanship that contrast with the political infighting among the democrats back home looking to replace him critics deride it as a trump first policy in which a few flattering words can buy an adversary trump s silence either way the affirmations of friendship haven t yet correlated with results that reality was at the fore as trump expressed hope for a meeting with kim at the demilitarized zone on sunday u s north korean talks on nuclear issues and even the repatriation of korean war remains have broken down in recent months after the failure of their second summit in hanoi in february but trump is eager for the historic image at the dmz he said saturday that he would welcome becoming the first u s president to step over the border into north korea and hopes it can help jump start negotiations he once believed could deliver him a nobel peace prize the mere invitation from trump marks a significant propaganda victory for kim who has long sought and been denied recognition on the international stage trump has made clear he considers kim a friend even as the north has resumed some ballistic missile testing in recent months that trump s national security adviser john bolton contends violated u n sanctions trump has often placed a priority on close ties over matters of principle arguing it pays off in the long term after his meeting with the saudi crown prince the president falsely claimed that nobody so far has pointed directly a finger at the future king of saudi arabia in the murder of journalist and u s resident jamal khashoggi u s intelligence agencies have assessed that the prince must have at least been aware of the plot trump s willingness to embrace the royal helped clear the transformation of the saudi leader from international pariah to member of the club in osaka in his meeting with erdogan trump did raise the issue of turkey s purchase of russian made surface to air missiles which his administration has warned would imperil the sale of f 35 joint strike fighters to the nato ally but trump broke with other u s officials to strike a sympathetic tone blaming obama for not approving the sale of u s made missiles it s a mess trump said and honestly it s not really erdogan s fault trump also said turkey has a less than stellar human rights record but he made clear that unlike previous u s presidents who would use the moment to set an example on american values this blot would not deter their relationship he s tough but i get along with him trump said maybe it s a bad thing but i think it s a good thing editor s note zeke miller and jonathan lemire cover the white house for the associated press follow miller on twitter at http tw
