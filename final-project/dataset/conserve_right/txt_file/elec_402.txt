capturing the state come election day mr romney kicked off his celebrity twofer by linking up with golf legend jack nicklaus an ohio native at a campaign rally outside columbus and then teamed up with mike rowe host of the discovery channel s dirty jobs at a business roundtable meeting in the cleveland suburbs mr romney used the stops and another in toledo to warn that mr obama will continue to

stolen our jobs that s got to stop mr romney said at the event with mr nicklaus who told the crowd of about 2 000 that the former massachusetts governor was the right man for the job mr rowe did not

the two candidates were even on the issue the poll came on the heels of a washington post survey released tuesday that gave mr obama an 8 point lead here it also showed that more likely voters in ohio trust the democrat more when it comes to handling the economy and think he has a better understanding of the problems people are facing on the economic front part of the problem for the romney camp is

the tricky position of explaining the state s success without undercutting mr romney s message i hope you all know that ohio s coming back mr kasich said wednesday from 48th in job creation to no 4 no 1 in the midwest from 89 cents in a rainy day fund to a half a million dollars and we have grown 123 000 jobs in the state of ohio our families are going back to work he added but every day i have to face the headwinds that come from washington the romney camp is downplaying the recent surveys suggesting their internal polling numbers tell a different story after the debates and after the campaigns and after all the ads are over the people of ohio are going to say loud and clear on nov 6 we can t afford four more years we must do better mr romney said mr obama countered mr romney s criticisms at the rally at bowling green state university telling the young crowd that the republican s tough talk on china rings hollow it sounds better than talking about all the years he spent

like that fox saying you know we need more secure chicken coops mr obama was referring to mr romney s 75 000 investment in cnooc ltd the chinese state owned oil company which was revealed when former massachusetts governor released his 2011 tax return last week mr romney s blind trust purchased the shares then dumped them mr obama charges when the presidential candidate decided he was going to
