apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic gang of six hits defense the chairman of the house armed services committee is panning the deficit compromise plan offered by so called gang of six senate leaders for its steep cuts in security funding based on what we ve read the proposal would result in 886 billion in security cuts over 10 years rep howard p buck mckeon said in a memo sent wednesday to committee republicans top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time due to a firewall in the proposal between security and domestic spending nearly half of the discretionary savings in this proposal comes from security programs he said noting that pentagon spending is about 85 percent of all security funds also the senate compromise would mandate cuts to military retirement and other benefits it is our belief that this proposal raises serious implications for defense and would not allow us to perform our constitutional responsibility to provide for the safety and security of our country or keep faith with men and women in uniform said mr mckeon california republican explaining why he opposes the plan since president obama originally submitted his fiscal 2011 budget defense spending has been cut by 439 billion over 10 years the president in april proposed another 400 billion in cuts that is being pushed to 700 billion and as much as 1 trillion cia s nuclear denial a former career intelligence officer this week criticized the cia s controversial 2007 national intelligence estimate saying that a recent update also was skewed in stating that iran halted all work on nuclear arms in 2003 fred fleitz a former cia analyst and until recently a house intelligence committee staff member wrote that u s intelligence analysts for the past several years remain unwilling to conduct a proper assessment of the iranian nuclear issue the refusal puts them at odds with the white house u s allies and even the united nations he said mounting evidence over the last few years has convinced most experts that iran has an active program to develop and construct nuclear weapons mr fleitz said in an op ed column in the wall street journal despite the growing evidence of ongoing iranian nuclear arms work u s intelligence officials are standing by their assessment he said in february the 17 agencies of the u s intelligence community issued a highly classified national intelligence estimate updating their 2007 assessment he stated that estimate had been politicized by several officials who feared how president george w bush might respond to a true account of the iranian threat mr fleitz said the february 2011 iran national intelligence estimate was poorly written and little improvement over the 2007 version he noted that criticism of the revised report was blocked from publication by cia censors who reviewed his newspaper column including my serious concern that it manipulated intelligence evidence it is unacceptable that iran is on the brink of testing a nuclear weapon while our intelligence analysts continue to deny that an iranian nuclear weapons program exists he said a more detailed critique of the 2007 intelligence report can be found in this reporter s 2008 book the failure factory nsc clash on china congressional republicans say a key player involved in the obama administration s policy of refusing to sell needed arms to taiwan is evan s medeiros a pro china academic now well placed to influence policy as white house national security council specialist on the chinese military the policy dispute has brought mr medeiros into several policy clashes with other asia hands in the state department pentagon and military and even the white house republicans staff aides and a defense official told inside the ring that they believe mr medeiros is behind efforts to block the release to congress of the pentagon s annual report on the chinese military completed months ago and due to capitol hill on march 1 the report is being held back to avoid upsetting the chinese who routinely denounce the report mr medeiros also is being blamed for preventing the u s sale of 66 advanced f 16 jets to taiwan that is expected to anger beijing and for holding up a new sale of equipment to upgrade taiwan s existing f 16s and the sources say he has used bureaucratic delaying tactics to block the release of a second pentagon report to congress on the shifting air power balance in the taiwan strait one official said mr medeiros also has tried to thwart a pentagon task force from adopting a new military strategy toward china based on better coordination of u s air and naval forces white house spokesman tommy vietor declined requests from inside the ring to interview mr medeiros but mr vietor said any assertion that mr medeiros is behind the delays is completely wrong and wildly uninformed other china specialists in the intelligence community say mr medeiros advocates an ideological view that exaggerates chinese sensitivities to any u s effort to deal realistically with india japan and others in addressing the china threat mr medeiros track record on china is available online in numerous writings on china s military for more than a decade a reading of some his work shows he is an adherent of the diminishing view among academic analysts of china who assert that china s military poses little or no threat and that beijing s policies are generally benign claims that have come under increasing skepticism a 2005 article he wrote criticized any u s effort to hedge against china s rise by building forces to counter china s military buildup last year while in his national security council post mr medeiros co wrote a journal article in international security on china s nuclear forces that stated china has a small nuclear force that is not useful for warfighting and is mainly for deterrence and to prevent nuclear blackmail that analysis is questionable because u s officials have said china s nuclear forces have expanded rapidly in recent years along with its large missile forces reports from asia say china s nuclear arsenal could be three to five times the size of its estimated 400 nuclear warheads with as many as 2 300 warheads in 2009 mr medeiros wrote that china s international behavior is not ideologically driven as a result he clashed with u s pacific command officials mr medeiros in internal emails sided with china when the u s pacific command criticized beijing for backing pyongyang over the findings of an international panel that said a north korean submarine sank a south korean warship mr medeiros also has been criticized for writing that china is not seeking to displace the united states as the predominant global power and as he said in a rand monograph that china is not seeking to confront the united states or expel it from the region that assertion was shown to be false in 2009 when then pacific command commander adm tim keating revealed how a chinese admiral proposed dividing the pacific into two spheres western waters controled by china and eastern seas under u s forces the proposal was rejected in 2008 mr medeiros co wrote a monograph stating that east asia is not gradually falling under chinese hegemony military leaders at the pacific command however have said china is quietly expanding its hegemony in the region mr medeiros opposed u s diplomatic efforts to bolster japan after threats from beijing forced tokyo to release a chinese fishing boat captain arrested for illegally fishing in japanese waters he also backed the u s navy scaving in to pressure not to send an aircraft carrier to the yellow sea earlier th
