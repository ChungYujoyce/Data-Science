apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic topeka kan a persistent buzz about mike pompeo stepping down as the top u s diplomat to run for an open senate seat in kansas has built to a roar as impeachment hearings into president donald trump have intensified scrutiny of the state department the u s secretary of state was in brussels on wednesday brushing off questions about the impeachment inquiry and dismissing speculation about how long he ll stay in trump s administration pompeo met with nato s secretary general while lawmakers heard testimony from ambassador gordon sondland that he kept pompeo informed of efforts to pressure ukraine into investigating former vice president joe biden and his son against the backdrop of impeachment strain has set in between trump and pompeo and republicans already have speculated for months that pompeo will resign to run for the senate in his home state enthusiasm from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and others regarding such a move has not cooled despite the impeachment hearings top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time many republicans still see pompeo as their best candidate for preventing the kansas race from becoming competitive in a state where a democrat hasn t won a senate seat since 1932 while democrats would certainly raise pompeo s ties to trump and impeachment revelations neither would likely hurt him with conservative voters who dominate gop primaries i do think there s a chance he runs said alan cobb the kansas chamber of commerce s ceo a long active republican who worked for trump s 2016 campaign the question comes down to not necessarily impeachment or the relationship with the president but the fundamental question of control of the united states senate and i think the landscape next year is murky pompeo has repeatedly said he intends to stay on as secretary of state as long as trump will have him and even declared a senate run off the table this summer time magazine reported this week that pompeo has told three prominent republicans in recent weeks that he plans to resign from the trump administration to run for the senate the republicans were not named and state department spokeswoman morgan ortagus told reporters in brussels that the story is completely false pompeo has given no signal that he intends to leave his current job anytime soon and aides say he has diplomatic travel planned through at least the end of january en route to brussels on tuesday he suggested to reporters accompanying him that he would be returning to the city several more times as secretary of state he is 100 focused on being president trump s secretary of state ortagus said for months pompeo has enjoyed an enviable position in trump s cabinet his power largely unchecked as he frequently won foreign policy fights with then national security adviser john bolton and was viewed by the president as an aggressive defender among many in trump s orbit pompeo was viewed as the most powerful cabinet member but trump more recently has suspiciously viewed the parade of diplomats and career foreign policy officials who alleged he inappropriately withheld military aid from ukraine in exchange for an investigation into a political foe trump was eager to paint the officials as never trumpers or part of the so called deep state conspiracy meant to unravel him but a number of the officials were appointed by trump at pompeo s direction the president has snapped about pompeo delivering disloyal officials and has privately vented about the secretary of state s hiring choices according to three white house officials and republicans close to the white house who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations and there has been some grumbling among white house aides about pompeo s incessant flirtation with running for the senate according to the officials pompeo s trips back to his home state four as of november have not gone unnoticed and he has declined to definitively curtail talk about a run that has led some in trump s circle to wonder whether the secretary of state was plotting an escape strategy yet pompeo has continued to stay close to trump he declined to support state department employees at a news conference attacked the impeachment proceedings and refused to publicly break with the president he does not seem in danger of losing his post according to the officials in brussels on wednesday pompeo said he hadn t watched the impeachment hearings i didn t see a single thing today he told a reporter i was working sounds like you might not have been the interest in pompeo running for the senate is driven by some gop leaders fears that kris kobach nationally known for advocating tough immigration policies will emerge from a crowded primary race in august kobach the former kansas secretary of state rouses democrats and liberal activists while alienating gop moderates and he lost the 2018 governor s race to democrat laura kelly during a nov 8 save the senate event in washington kevin mclaughlin the national republican senatorial committee s executive director said audience members should call pompeo and urge him to run a source with knowledge of the gop s strategy said the source who spoke anonymously because the committee doesn t have a formal role in the race said the comment was meant as a laugh getting line but the source also said pompeo is viewed as a game changer candidate who will be well funded on his own pompeo s entry into the race would likely push most other gop candidates out though kobach has not said he would drop out the other republicans running include u s rep roger marshall of western kansas kansas senate president susan wagle and david lindstrom a kansas city area businessman and ex kansas city chiefs player you have to imagine whatever data they have in a republican primary kobach is still a formidable candidate said university of kansas political scientist patrick miller they need to find a candidate who is 10 kinds of awesome to beat him prominent republicans said pompeo s stature isn t likely to dip with fellow republicans because of the impeachment hearings cobb said testimony wednesday simply tied pompeo more closely to a nothing burger cheryl reynolds the chairwoman of the gop in the 2nd congressional district in eastern kansas said republican voters see the impeachment inquiry as purely political they see his whole thing as a sham said kelly arnold a former kansas republican party chairman they re going dismiss most of the stuff that is being said and thrown at mike pompeo lemire reported from washington and lee from brussels
