saw the trump administration at odds with many allies over the paris accord on climate change and issues like migration the joint statement signed by all 20 member nations said 19 of them reaffirmed their commitment to the paris climate accord with the united states which withdrew from the pact under president donald trump the lone holdout the official communique acknowledged flaws in global commerce and called for reforming the world trade organization but it didn t mention the word protectionism after negotiators said that had met resistance from the united states applause broke out in

abortions for all including illegal aliens the non binding agreement was reached after marathon talks by diplomats stretched overnight and into daylight amid deep divisions between member nations european union officials said the united states was the main holdout on nearly every issue trump has criticized the wto and taken aggressive trade policies targeting china and the eu but china also pushed back in talks on steel south africa objected to language on trade australia didn t want the statement to be too soft on migration and turkey worried it would push too far on climate change according to the officials a senior white house official said the joint statement meets many u s objectives and stressed that it includes language about wto reform the official also noted other elements such as language on workforce development and women s economic development and a commitment by china to doing infrastructure financing on transparent terms according to the official the unusual language on climate was necessary for washington to sign on and turkey saudi arabia and russia had appeared sympathetic to the u s position but ultimately stayed with the other countries the final language of the statement says regarding climate that 19 nations that are signatories to the paris accord reiterate their commitment to it while the u s reiterates its decision to withdraw it also notes a recent u n report that warned damage from global warming will be much worse than previously feared and expresses support for an upcoming u n climate meeting in poland meant to nail down how countries will meet promises made in the paris accord on global commerce the statement says the 20 countries support multilateral trade but acknowledge that the current system doesn t work and needs fixing via the necessary reform of the wto to improve its functioning on migration european officials said the u s negotiator said too much talk about it would have been a deal breaker for trump so they came up with minimalist language that acknowledges growing migrant flows and the importance of shared efforts to support refugees and solve the problems that drive them to flee the statement also shows a commitment to a rules based international order despite trump s rejection of many of those rules with trade tensions between the u s and china dominating the summit the europeans sought to play mediator and also scaled back their expectations cutting out mention of rising protectionism mainly aimed at trump french president emmanuel macron called it a victory that the u s signed on to the statement at all given the tensions going into the talks with trump we reached an agreement macron said the u s accepted a text thomas bernes of the canada based centre for international governance innovation who has held leading roles with the international monetary fund the world bank and the canadian government said the g 20 had veered all over the road at the summit and failed to truly fix trade the u s was out of step on migration and climate change and blocked meaningful agreement on those issues he added instead leaders buried their differences in obscure language and dropped language to fight protectionism which had been included in every g 20 communique since the leaders first summit he said this is clearly a retrograde step forced by united states intransigence the question is whether we are burying the g 20 in the process bernes added certainly this is a big hit to the credibility of the g 20 to provide resolute leadership in addressing global problems perhaps surprisingly one country that was seen as particularly constructive was russia the eu officials said despite tensions over its military actions on ukraine and political interference abroad russia supports international efforts on trade and climate summits like this don t take away contradictions among g 20 leaders russian president vladimir putin said but he added that these meetings are useful because countries that are fighting can focus on problems they all agree on such as wto reform the summit statement s language on climate was welcomed by environmental groups such as the world wildlife fund and greenpeace the latter of which said in a statement the necessity of the u s being part of the effort to fight climate change cannot be denied but this is a demonstration that the u s is still the odd one out while a statement isn t legally enforceable the europeans see it as proof that the g 20 is still relevant and that multilateralism still works everyone agrees that the wto should be reformed german chancellor angela merkel said this is an important agreement we will send a clear signal in any case most of us for the success of global climate talks starting in poland on sunday merkel added merkel s spokesman said that during a meeting with putin she also voiced concern about rising tensions in the kerch strait off crimea and pushed for freedom of shipping into the sea of azov last weekend russia seized three ukrainian naval vessels and their crews in an incident escalating a tug of war that began in 2014 when russia annexed ukraine s crimean peninsula and supported separatist rebels in eastern ukraine germany and france have sought to mediate between russia and ukraine and merkel spokesman steffen seibert said she and putin agreed that the four countries should hold further talks at the adviser level macron and british prime minister theresa may both said they had pressed saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman for international involvement in investigating the october murder of dissident saudi journalist jamal khashoggi at the country s consulate in istanbul may said she spoke to the crown prince about the importance of a full credible transparent investigation that identifies those who are involved and that ensures that those involved are held to account macron did similar but said bin salman only took note of his demands and expressed hope the prince would respond soon turkish president recep tayyip erdogan lamented that the issue of khashoggi s killing was not a part of the official agenda and said the only leader who brought it up was trudeau according to erdogan the crown prince s response was that saudi arabia cannot be blamed unless the crime is proven something the turkish leader called unbelievable u s intelligence agencies have concluded bin salman must have at least known about the plot to kill khashoggi saudi arabia denies he played a role trump has said there is no definitive evidence the crown prince is complicit we want to know who ordered this assassination erdogan said accusing saudi arabia of a lack of cooperation trump and chinese president xi jinping met later over dinner after the summit s close their countries have been embroiled in an escalating trade war with new u s tariffs on china goods set to take effect a month from now in closing remarks the summit s host argentine president mauricio macri said the countries had overcome a number of challenges to reach the statement the next g 20 summit is to be held in osaka japan in june 2019 putin said that when japan takes over there will be proposals on perfecting the wto this is already something associated press writers catherine lucey and almudena calatrava in buenos aires and geir moulson in berlin contributed to
