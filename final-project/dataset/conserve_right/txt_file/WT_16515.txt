russell 2000 index set all time highs the s p broke through 1 700 points for the first time the nasdaq hit its highest level since september 2000 the gains were driven by a steady flow of encouraging reports on the global economy top stories gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed overnight a positive read on china s manufacturing helped shore up asian markets an hour before u s trading started the government reported that the number of people applying for unemployment benefits last week fell sharply at mid morning a trade group said u s factories revved up production last month and while corporate earnings news after the market closed wednesday and throughout thursday brought both winners and losers investors were able to find enough reports that they liked including those from cbs metlife and yelp it s just a lot of things adding up said russell croft portfolio manager of the croft value fund in baltimore it s hard to put your finger on why exactly but basically it s a bunch of pretty good data points coming together to make a very good day overall analysts said the news was good but not overwhelmingly so enough to suggest that the economy is improving but not enough to prompt the federal reserve to withdraw its economic stimulus programs earnings results covered a wide range boston beer which makes samuel adams and home shopping network operator hsn rose after beating analysts estimates for earnings and revenue kellogg health insurer cigna and cosmetics maker avon were down after beating earnings predictions but missing on revenue it s becoming a familiar template this year stock indexes have been setting record highs since april even while the underlying economy is often described as improving but hardly going gangbusters while layoffs are steadily declining companies aren t hiring as quickly as they did before the financial crisis and great recession the economy is growing but not fast enough to drive significant job growth the commerce department reported this week that gross domestic product or gdp the broadest measure of the economy grew at a tepid annual rate of 1 7 percent in the second quarter they re not great numbers but they re positive and they re continuing to grow said tim courtney chief investment officer of exencial wealth advisors in oklahoma city that s about all the market needs to hear because the stock market often looks ahead 6 9 months it s not unusual for stock indexes to be ahead of economic indicators when the economy is improving or worsening right now stock investors may be anticipating a stronger economy and better earnings next year among thursday s stock index records the s p 500 index rose 21 14 points or 1 3 percent to 1 706 87 the dow rose

and the russell 24 8 percent the nasdaq composite index rose 49 37 points or 1 4 percent to 3 675 74 in line with the daily gains of other indexes but still far short of its record the nasdaq which is heavily weighted with technology stocks briefly veered above 5 000 points in march 2000 just before the internet bubble burst investors said thursday that the s p s crossing over 1 700 points might give consumers a psychological boost but they were hardly crowing about a new era in stocks turns out it s quite common for indexes to hit records since 1950 the s p has hit a high about 7 percent of the time or an average of about every 15 days courtney said the s p s last record close was just eight trading days earlier on july 22 the s p made the jump from 1 600 to 1 700 in less than three months the index first traded above 1 600 on may 3 the first close above 1 500 was in march 2000 the market s sharp advance thursday was a stark contrast with the previous two days when the s p 500 moved less than a point each day on tuesday investors didn t want to make big moves ahead of the federal reserve s policy announcement the next day on wednesday the fed didn t make much news after all the central bank said unsurprisingly that the u s economy was recovering but still needed help the fed didn t give any indication of when it might cut back on its bond buying program which has been supporting financial markets and keeping borrowing costs ultra low among the good economic and corporate news that cheered investors thursday china s purchasing managers index a gauge of business

of manufacturing jumped to 55 4 in july up from 50 9 in june and well above an expected reading of 51 8 a number above 50 indicates growth auto companies reported strong sales gains for july ford chrysler and nissan each reported u s sales growth of 11 percent compared with the same month a year ago an index of transportation stocks also rose sharply many investors see that sector as a leading indicator for the economy because freight and shipping companies tend to get busier as the economy improves the dow jones transportation average jumped 208 26 points or 3 2 percent to 6 670 06 led by
