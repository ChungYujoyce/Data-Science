apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president donald trump is claiming without evidence that expanding mail in voting will increase voter fraud but several gop state officials are forging ahead to do just that undermining one of trump s arguments about how elections should be conducted amid the coronavirus outbreak while trump has complained that voting by mail is ripe for fraud republican state officials in iowa ohio and west virginia have all taken steps to ease access to mail in ballots following health officials warnings that voting in person can risk transmission of the deadly virus the nebraska s republican governor urged voters to apply for absentee ballots florida s gop chairman says the party will continue to run a robust vote by mail program the disconnect between trump and republican state officials illustrates the abrupt hard turn the president and his national political allies have taken on the issue before the coronavirus hit many in the gop had warmed to mail in voting agreeing that it can be conducted without fraud and even used to their political advantage top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender but trump s hard line appears to be driven by his personal suspicions and concerns about his own reelection prospects statewide mail in voting doesn t work out well for republicans he tweeted this week without explanation trump s comments put his republican allies in states in the awkward position of trying to defend their practices without criticizing the president some said they agreed with trump even as their actions seem to suggest otherwise others suggested trump was out of line it is disappointing when anyone in leadership makes fraud claims said kim wyman the republican secretary of state of washington state which has had universal mail voting since 2010 when it happens the public loses confidence in the foundational pillar of our system wyman was part of a group of bipartisan election officials who spoke to reporters thursday to push for money from congress to deal with the virus in iowa republican secretary of state paul pate did not criticize trump directly but said that sowing doubt about the integrity of the process is as dangerous as vote fraud iowa is mailing requests for absentee ballots to all 2 1 million registered voters ahead of special elections in july pate described the move as a reaction to an emergency adding you need to have some flexibility there is no evidence of widespread mail voting fraud the most prominent recent fraud case occurred in north carolina s 9th congressional district in 2018 when a consultant hired by the gop candidate was linked to an effort to tamper with absentee ballots trump himself requested a mail ballot for florida s gop primary last month and he has voted absentee in previous elections still this week he said mail in voting is horrible it s corrupt and the republican national committee moved to help state parties block expansion of the franchise the effort was most notable in wisconsin where thousands of voters were forced to wait in long lines after the conservative majority on the state s supreme court prevented the democratic governor s last ditch attempt to delay the election but there s no consensus about trump s position in ohio gov mike dewine and secretary of state frank larose both republicans this week urged the state s voters to cast ballots via mail in the april 28 primary the contest was shifted to virtually all mail last month as the virus outbreak worsened nebraska gov pete ricketts a republican is urging all voters to request absentee ballots for next month s primary in west virginia voters are receiving applications for mail ballots for the state s upcoming primary on thursday the state s republican secretary of state mac warner told reporters he agrees with trump that voting by mail just opens up opportunity for fraud but said he believed his state has necessary safeguards in florida where republicans have dominated mail in voting state gop chairman joe gruters also agreed with trump that the state couldn t entirely vote by mail but he added the florida gop will push vote by mail requests and returns among republicans wendy weiser of the brennan center for justice which advocates for expanded mail voting said there had been bipartisan agreement on the election changes needed to adjust to the coronavirus outbreak but she said trump s comments this week were adding partisan fuel to decisions that should be no brainers trump has a history of making baseless claims of voter fraud after he won the 2016 presidential election while losing the popular vote he insisted there was widespread voter fraud he set up a commission to investigate but it disbanded without finding any examples every state has some version of mail voting but with widely varying rules they range from systems like those used in utah washington and colorado where all voters are automatically sent ballots to wisconsin where a witness s signature is required for voters to return an absentee ballot in about one third of the states voters need a state sanctioned excuse to make their request trump s concern about mail in voting appears to come from a belief that the practice benefits democrats he tweeted that republicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail in voting democrats are clamoring for it in fact republicans in florida and other states have used mail in ballots to ramp up turnout among their voters especially older and rural voters on wednesday trump tried to adjust his argument by saying that mail voting was legitimate for republican leaning groups such as people over age 65 or members of the military but should not be broadly available trump tweeted that 100 mail in voting was vulnerable to abuse and should not be allowed in utah trump s complaints baffled justin lee the state s elections director the only fraud the state finds are scattered examples of one spouse signing for another the mail system hasn t hurt republicans at all people are turning out 90 are using it in a very red state lee said i don t see any problems for us associated press writers julie carr smyth
