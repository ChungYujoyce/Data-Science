apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic after two weeks of impeachment hearings house democratic leaders were poised to draft articles of impeachment against president trump but their rank and file members were stumped about what should be the next move lawmakers headed home for thanksgiving break unsure whether there would be more hearings or when they would cast a seemingly inevitable vote on impeachment with just eight legislative days remaining before the end of the year rep adam b schiff the california democrat and intelligence committee chairman who presided over the hearings said the parade of witnesses had presented a clear cut case that mr trump abused the levers of power and bribed ukraine officials to help his re election campaign top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk they were willing to do whatever was necessary to get ukraine to do that dirty work to do that investigation and then there was a quid pro quo regarding the white house meeting mr schiff said in a closing argument he also has floated an obstruction charge noting that one of the articles of impeachment against president richard m nixon was his refusal to obey subpoenas by congress and yet the testimony from a dozen witnesses spread across five days of hearings over two weeks has failed to move republican lawmakers or the general public against mr trump rep will hurd of texas an outspoken anti trump republican on the permanent select committee on intelligence said he wasn t convinced an impeachable offense should be compelling it s not something to be rushed or taken lightly he said i have not heard evidence proving the president committed bribery or extortion democrats had eyed mr hurd who is not running for reelection as a possible crossover vote for impeachment congress members were in the dark about what would happen next rep devin nunes of california the ranking republican on the intelligence committee said as the final hearing of the week came to a close he railed against the house democrats rules for the inquiry which were passed on a party line vote saying the hearings were skewed against mr trump denying him due process what you ve seen in this room the past two weeks is a show trial the planned result of three years or political operations and dirty tricks campaigns waged against this president he said and like any good show trial the verdict was decided before the trial ever began the impeachment inquiry heard thursday from former national security council official fiona hill and state department aide david holmes ms hill backed up earlier testimony by u s ambassador to the european union gordon sondland describing a quid pro quo deal with ukraine they testified about plans to give newly elected ukraine president volodymyr zelensky a prized white house visit in exchange for his announcing investigations of ukraine meddling in the 2016 election and alleged corruption at burisma holdings a ukraine natural gas company linked to former vice president joseph r biden and his son hunter the quid pro quo a latin phrase meaning a transaction of this for that is the linchpin of the democrats abuse of power and bribery case none of the witnesses directly tied the dealmaking to mr trump though he did ask mr zelensky in a july 25 phone call for a favor on the matter of investigations without apparent strings attached a whistleblower who is believed to be a cia official assigned to the white house accused the president of abusing his power for personal gain on the call including withholding u s military aid from ukraine to force the investigations a rough transcript of the call released by the white house did not show a quid pro quo with the investigation request but democrats argue the threat was understood and part of an ongoing pressure campaign of shadow foreign policy conducted by mr trump s private lawyer rudolph w giuliani mr holmes testified that he was with mr sondland in a kyiv restaurant when he overheard a cellphone call between the ambassador and mr trump in which the president asked about the investigations according to mr holmes after the call mr sondland told him that mr trump doesn t care about ukraine but only cares about big stuff that benefits the president such as the biden investigation when mr sondland testified wednesday he denied that he mentioned the bidens none of the witnesses provided evidence supporting the most serious allegation against mr trump that he withheld 391 million of u s military aid from ukraine as leverage to force the investigations ms hill and mr holmes echoed others testimony when they said they did not know why the aid was held up mr holmes guessed a reason my clear impression was that the security assistance hold was likely intended by the president either as an expression of dissatisfaction with the ukrainians who had not yet agreed to the burisma biden investigation or as an effort to increase the pressure on them to do so he said the answer provided more ammunition for mr trump s defenders to dismiss the impeachment case as a hodgepodge of conjecture and second hand speculation a new emerson college poll released thursday revealed that american voters were turning against the impeachment effort it found 45 of voters oppose impeachment compared to 43 that support it that s a reversal of public opinion from the same poll in october before the public hearings on impeachment when 48 supported impeachment and 44 opposed it the biggest swing was among independent voters who now oppose impeachment 49 to 34 compared to october where they supported impeachment 48 to 39 according to the national survey mr trump s approval rating also increased to 48 a bounce from 43 approval last month the impeachment hearings are being watched or followed by 69 of voters we are winning big and they will soon be on our turf mr trump said referring to the republican run senate where he would stand trial if the house impeaches him under the house rules for the inquiry upon finishing its investigation the intelligence committee will submit a report to the house judiciary committee which will deliberate whether to send articles of impeachment to the full house for a vote they are anxiously eyeing the calendar and the prospect of the impeachment process bleeding into the 2020 election season i hope it s possible to wrap up by the end of the year but i just don t know whether it will be possible and what the leadership has in mind said rep jamie raskin maryland democrat an
