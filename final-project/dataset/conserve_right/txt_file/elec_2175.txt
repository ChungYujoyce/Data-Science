joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong labor unions long a rich source of ground troops for national democrats election day victories are less enthusiastic this year according to some movement leaders who say they are more focused on state level races and feel left behind by the party on key issues such as obamacare while public sector unions remain almost universally supportive of congressional democrats more traditional labor unions in key industries and key states express frustration with the party or say they haven t been given a reason to get as deeply involved in the midterm elections in ohio no u s senate races and few house races are on the ballots to energize unions unions also aren t thrilled with the gubernatorial options the democrats and republicans have offered said eric stevenson an organizer for plumbers and pipefitters local 189 in columbus see also despite union attacks walker grabs lead in wisconsin re election bid a lot of it is midterms there s nothing exciting on the ballot here he said but i think a lot of it is the state democratic party messed up in my personal opinion the choices they made for the top of the tickets wow did they vet any of these people beforehand or what afl cio political director michael podhorzer said the prospect of a republican controlled senate isn t as potent a motivating factor for voters as trying to draw a contrast between the parties we re obviously not making the argument about republican control as much as we are about what the individual candidates stand for he said last month on c span s newsmakers program we are almost exclusively focused on grass roots activism and person to person contact and building on the labor movement that exists in each place in each location so we re obviously going to be putting more effort able to put more effort into states like michigan alaska iowa colorado and then in some of the other states photos see obama s biggest white house fails others labor leaders said lingering concerns over president obama s agenda are what have dampened enthusiasm terry o sullivan general president for the laborers international union of north america has consistently criticized mr obama for stalling on approving the keystone xl pipeline which has produced a major split within democratic ranks between unions and environmentalists eyeing the construction jobs the project would generate many unions have long pushed mr obama to approve the canada to texas pipeline mr o sullivan said the administration also has not addressed labor concerns about obamacare s treatment of high end health care plans the so called cadillac tax which will hit some union negotiated plans particularly hard when it takes effect later this decade i certainly think that it s going to affect turnout mr o sullivan told the hill this year you have people that are disillusioned and angry they either vote a different way or they don t vote at all despite the grumbling some union organizations vow to back democrats the afl cio has deployed its resources in key states and the american federation of teachers plans to spend more than 20 million on elections this year more than twice the 8 2 million spent in 2008 aft president randi weingarten even campaigned in alaska with sen mark begich hoping to boost the democrat as he tries to fend off a stiff challenge from republican dan sullivan alan hughes president of the arkansas chapter of the afl cio said efforts are just as strong as ever in boosting incumbent democratic sen mark l pryor in a tough race and candidates in a host of other state level races we re sending our guys they re doing door to door they re doing phone banks he said we know how important it is to keep a balance on the senate indeed national unions that represent government workers such as teachers generally seem to be more engaged there are schools in every single district said bob bruno director of the labor education program at the university of illinois school of labor and employment relations you re not going to find a steel plant in each one local unions particularly in industries hit hard by the great recession said they are focused less on politics and more on basic issues such as finding jobs for members just for us we re trying to get stuff going with work so we haven t had time to do anything with the political parts said eugene wilson business manager for the international brotherhood of electrical workers local 700 in arkansas home to the race between mr pryor and his republican challenger rep tom cotton i mean we really haven t done anything not all public sector unions are falling completely in line for democrats either the international association of firefighters is heavily involved in the most competitive governor s and u s senate races this year but the group is withholding support for two democrats sens kay r hagan of north carolina and mark r warner of virginia because of their 2010 nay votes on a bill that would have expanded collective bargaining rights for public safety employees it is one thing to disagree on an issue but it is another thing for somebody to really fail to fulfill a commitment and if you do that with us then you re just not going to be entitled to our support and that happens to be the case with the two senators from north carolina and virginia said iaff president harold schaitberger the disillusionment is hurting democrats in some key senate races in kentucky for example senate minority leader mitch mcconnell a republican won the endorsements of two local correctional officer chapters of the american federation of government employees stephen creech first vice president of afge local 4051 in manchester said
