and a growing al qaeda presence across the continent particularly in the horn of africa the sahel and nigeria in somalia where leaders wednesday approved a new draft constitution that guarantees many

statement accompanying the policy document that the united states will not stand idly by when actors threaten legitimately elected governments or manipulate the fairness or integrity of electoral processes and will stand in steady partnership with those who are committed to the principles of equality justice and the rule of law that s a pretty strong marker he said that s not a statement that
