account may violate the site s terms and services hillary for president again chatter is percolating that former secretary of state hillary clinton could still enter the presidential race inspired by a certain former new york mayor s recent activities it would mark her third attempt here is the fox news conversation between anchor maria bartiromo and former clinton strategist mark penn on the phenomenon you have also said in the past on this program you think hillary clinton may reenter the race do you think she still is thinking about running for president ms bartiromo asked there s still a couple of days here i don t know whether she will look at the michael bloomberg thing and say ah the field is too crowded now i missed my opportunity or the opposite wow the field is weak i could come in i could get 165 000 donors i m tied with biden in some of these early states if i get in mr penn replied there s still a political logic there for her he said and notably mr penn also predicted that mr bloomberg will center his campaign on climate change gun control and a set of moderate positions bloomberg s 12 billion entry fee new york city native john podhoretz has a theory about how much michael r bloomberg could spend in his newly minted quest for the white house the answer lots in 2009 running for a third term as mayor michael bloomberg spent 102 million to get a mere 51 total of 174 per vote if he were to spend 174 per vote in this bid for the presidency in 2020 we re hearing so much about the white house would cost him something like 12 billion writes mr podhoretz in the new york post google tells me bloomberg is worth 53 billion buying the presidency would take about a quarter of his wealth so why not run he only has two kids do they really need the full 53 billion after he sloughs off this mortal coil when they could split 41 billion asks the columnist if bloomberg wants it why shouldn t he try to buy it this is america people we all like to say things like the presidency is not for sale but have we ever really truly tested the proposition besides enormously rich people like bloomberg help support our economy by putting dollars into play when it comes to electoral politics he s is a one man money velocity machine he concludes sorry bloomberg at no 10 a sliver of the democratic electorate is ready for the presidential candidacy of michael bloomberg according to a new morning consult poll which found him to be as competitive as the party s current top candidates against president trump in a hypothetical matchup reports eli yokley an analyst for the pollster according to the nov 8 poll 4 of democratic primary voters said the billionaire and former republican would be their first choice for the party s nomination to take on trump
