in our borders placing a massive strain on communities and schools and hospitals and public resources like nobody s ever seen before now we re sending many of them to sanctuary cities thank you very much i m proud to tell you that was my sick idea green bay wisconsin rally saturday the facts there s no evidence that the trump administration has begun to send the migrants to sanctuary cities en masse he proposed the idea in part to punish democratic congressional foes for inaction on the border but homeland security officials rejected the plan as unworkable trump said this month he was strongly considering the proposal hours after white house and homeland security officials had insisted the idea had been eschewed twice sanctuary cities are places where local authorities do not cooperate with immigration officials denying information or resources that would help them round up for deportation people living in the country illegally there were no indications federal officials were taking any steps to move forward with the idea or considered the president s words anything more than bluster his words to the wisconsin crowd suggesting his sick idea was in motion appeared to be no more than that people with knowledge of the discussions say white house staff discussed the idea with the department of homeland security in november and february but it was judged too costly

births health care trump the republicans are always going to protect pre existing conditions wisconsin rally the facts he s not protecting health coverage for patients with pre existing medical conditions the trump administration instead is pressing in court for full repeal of the affordable care act including provisions that protect people with pre existing conditions from health insurance discrimination trump and other republicans say they ll have a plan to preserve those safeguards but the white house has provided no details former president barack obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones bills supported in 2017 by trump and congressional
