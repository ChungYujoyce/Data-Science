export led germany promises a new band aid a european crisis management setup as an appreciating euro cuts into its trade despite all this frenzied activity if momentarily frightening off speculators intervention will not in the end be effective a policy of beggar your neighbor shifting responsibility from one national economy currency to another cannot cure a worldwide recession the biggest manipulator of all china makes cuddly noises about international cooperation but boosts export subsidies buttressing its hugely undervalued nonconvertible yuan its unprecedented reserves from trade surpluses a 2 5 trillion hoard mostly dollars discombobulate the global economic system the obama administration s remedies have included a proposed doubling of u s exports over five years trimming oil imports with subsidized alternatives wheedling china into currency concessions health care reorganization new taxes and an expansionary monetary policy to pump up the domestic recovery this

a green light it might be hard to exempt other foreign sellers that would turn america s back on the world trade organization which beijing joined but did not honor and the whole post world war
