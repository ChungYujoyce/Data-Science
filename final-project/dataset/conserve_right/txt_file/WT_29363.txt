 national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion last sunday afternoon u s attorney general william barr released a letter which he said summarized the report he had received from special counsel robert mueller about alleged crimes committed by president donald trump mr barr wrote that the president s exoneration is complete with respect to any conspiracy between the trump campaign and russian intelligence to affect the outcome of the 2016 presidential election he also wrote that though mr trump will not be prosecuted by the department of justice for obstruction of justice the special counsel did not exonerate him this is a head scratcher the head scratcher is why mr barr revealed any ambivalence on the part of anyone in the doj on the issue of obstruction of justice when he needn t have as well under the federal rules of criminal procedure he shouldn t have those rules which prohibit the revelation of evidence for and against prosecution of people not actually prosecuted also prohibit the revelation of the existence of such evidence as well as any disagreements among prosecutors over the legal significance of the evidence top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots the barr revelation constitutes the same violation of federal rules and doj policy that fbi director james comey committed when he announced in the summer of 2016 that hillary clinton would not be prosecuted for using private email servers to communicate about classified materials and then revealed that the fbi had convincing evidence against her and then revealed what that evidence was when the president learned of the barr summary of the mueller report he naturally rejoiced and then he thoughtlessly asked for the full mueller report to be made public that was a mistake here is the back story mr barr s four page summary of mr mueller s 700 page report claims to have characterized fairly mr mueller s principal conclusions yet a careful reading between the lines of those four pages reveals lawyerly language that the president does not want to hear analyzed though the president will not be charged with conspiracy to receive something of value from the russians in order to affect the outcome of a political campaign a felony mr mueller clearly found some evidence of a conspiracy between the trump campaign and russian intelligence probably the 100 plus communications some in person between them but not enough evidence to establish the conspiracy that is not enough evidence to prove the existence of the conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt we know mr mueller found some evidence of such a conspiracy because if he failed to find any evidence mr barr would have said so he didn t the second conclusion related by mr barr is that mr mueller found the evidence against mr trump of obstruction of justice interfering or attempting to interfere with an fbi investigation for a self serving purpose to be equivocal that means mr mueller found there is evidence that the president obstructed or attempted to obstruct justice and there is equally as strong exculpatory evidence or public policy or credibility reasons for not prosecuting as well both of these conclusions were made known to mr barr three weeks ago but he revealed them last sunday why would mr mueller punt on the obstruction charge it is not uncommon for prosecutors to view the same facts and the same law and come to different conclusions about whether a crime can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt in the conspiracy charge mr mueller concluded he could not prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt on the obstruction charge he allowed his boss mr barr to make the decision about whether to prosecute the president such a kicking the case upstairs is not uncommon in high profile cases why mr barr revealed all this is a mystery as it will beat the drum for the release of mueller s full report and perhaps the evidence on which that report is based so that members of congress who want to second guess mueller or examine for themselves what evidence of conspiracy and obstruction he found may do so what s next the barr letter is a summary of the mueller report the mueller report is itself a summary of the millions of pages of raw evidence mr mueller and his team accumulated that raw evidence consists of grand jury transcripts fbi notes of interrogations of witnesses transcripts of wiretaps emails and text messages prosecutors impressions of the quality of their evidence and more than 1 million pages of campaign and white house documents voluntarily surrendered to mr mueller if the 700 page summary of the evidence or the trove of raw evidence on which the summary is based are revealed there will be much in there for mr trump s adversaries to feast upon it s a mistake for the president to call for the revelation of anything that he or his lawyers have not seen while the political focus shifts to the house democrats the legal focus shifts to manhattan where federal prosecutors have an ongoing investigation of the president for election finance fraud and they have a finding by a federal judge that the criminal conspiracy to evade election finance reporting to which michael cohen pleaded guilty and for which the owner of the national enquirer received a deal was orchestrated by the president himself also in manhattan labors cy vance the manhattan district attorney he is investigating allegations of pre presidential bank and tax fraud against mr trump he can go back to behavior that occurred 10 years ago he also has a state statute that makes new york the easiest state in the union in which to prosecute financial crimes and the senate republicans now want to investigate who in the fbi or the cia abused their legal authority and started all this but the intelligence community will do its best to stifle them just as that community stifled trump from revealing what materials were seen by the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court that is another can of worms the contents of which mr trump should not want to be seen andrew p napolitano a
