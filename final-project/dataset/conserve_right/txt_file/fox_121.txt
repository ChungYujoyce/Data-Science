player of the week tara westover is the bestselling author of educated this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday july 21 2019 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace anchor i aposm chris wallace president trump keeps attacking the squad but says he disapproves of that angry chant begin videotape crowd send her back send her back donald trump president i didn apost say that they did but i disagree with it rep ilhan omar d minn his nightmare is seeing a somali immigrant refugee rise to congress wallace we aposll discuss the week aposs debate over race and loyalty to country with senior advisor stephen miller one of the president aposs immigration hardliners it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive then robert mueller former special counsel the report is my testimony wallace democrats prepared to question former special counsel robert mueller about his russia investigation we aposll ask house judiciary committee chair jerry nadler about his party aposs strategy to get mueller to go beyond his report jerry nadler only on fox news sunday and iran seizure of a british oil tanker escalates tensions with the west we aposll ask our sunday panel what happens next all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington send her back that is the phrase and the debate that has consumed washington and much of the country this week critics of the president aposs comments say urging four congresswomen to go back where they came from is hateful but mr trump says he won apost stand for some of the things the so called squad says about this country joining us now top white house advisor stephen miller stephen welcome back to fox news sunday stephen miller senior white house policy adviser great to be here thank you chris wallace you are the president aposs senior policy advisor and his chief speechwriter his tweets this week about those for congresswomen and let aposs put them up why don apost they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came are the latest in a long string of controversial comments by mr trump some of which i know that you helped draft here are a few begin video clips donald trump president i want him to show his birth certificate there aposs something on that birth certificate that he doesn apost like they are bringing crime they are rapists and some i assume are good people donald j trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states you had many people in that group other than neo nazis and white nationalists ok and the press has treated them absolutely unfairly end video clip wallace why shouldn apost someone see all of that as racist miller i think the term racist chris has become a label that is too often deployed by left democrats in this country simply to try to silence and punish and suppress people they disagree with speech that they don apost want to hear the reality is that this president has been a president for all americans whether you look at historically low black unemployment rates historically low hispanic unemployment rates or if you look at what he aposs doing on immigration to protect safety security rising wages for all american citizens wallace but when he questioned and let aposs there aposs a long record here when he questioned whether or not barack obama was an american citizen when he said the people in his announcement that the mexico is sending this country are not their best they are rapists they are drug dealers and some are good people when he called for total and complete shutdown of the muslim ban something i know you were very involved in that aposs not protecting the american people that is playing the race card miller i couldn apost disagree more i mean let aposs take for example the issue of the recent indictment we saw of 22 ms 13 gang members in california wallace well we aposre not talking about hardened criminals crosstalk wallace all right let aposs talk about the obama and the birther you don apost think that questioning whether or not the president of united states the first black president is an american you don apost think that there aposs a race quality to that crosstalk miller they raise questions about john mccain aposs circumstances of birth wallace no there were never raised questions about john mccain there are questions about whether he was or born in the panama canal or not there was never a race question about john mccain miller i fundamentally disagree with the view that if you criticize somebody and they happen to be a different color skin that that makes it racial criticism in fact you saw from you saw from crosstalk wallace he wasn apost criticizing him he was questioning whether he is an american miller you saw from congresswoman pressley this week that she was saying that if you are if you aposre brown you have to speak like a brown person if you aposre black you have to speak like a black person that aposs the kind of ideology the president is rejecting if you want to have a color blind society it means you can criticize immigration policy you can criticize people aposs views you can ask questions about where they aposre born and not have it be seen as racial wallace and can you also say go back where you came from miller the first of all and i aposm glad we can now get to what i think we really want to focus on with the send her back chant the president was clear that he disagreed with it wallace no he was clear he was clear after the fact he let crosstalk wallace excuse me he let it go one for 13 seconds and it was only when chant diminished that he started talking again miller right but crosstalk wallace he said nothing there he said nothing in his tweet i promise i aposm going to inaudible but he said nothing there or in his tweet after the rally that indicated any concern about the chant miller right but i want to get to the core issue the president was clear that he said he disagreed with that tweet but the core issue is that all the people in that audience and millions of patriotic americans all across this country are tired of being beat up condescended to looked down upon talked down to by members of congress on the left in washington d c and their allies in many corners of the media and let aposs get specific about it you saw the quotes from representative omar saying some people did something at 9 11 and yes if you watch it in context its worst you saw the quotes from representative omar talking about how oh well we talk about al qaeda in menacing tone and by the way she aposs giggling throughout this interview but we don apost talk about the army in a menacing tone and yes if you watch it in context which i have it aposs even worse and perhaps the most shocking of all with the comments made by representative ocasio cortez saying that our border agents are running concentration camps and therefore they are nazis and therefore everyone in that audience and you and me and everyone who supports our border patrol are by extension nazis sympathizers we support nazis if we support border agents wallace let aposs miller one more point on that that i have to say wallace ok go ahead miller which is that i aposm jew as a jew as an american jew i am profoundly outraged by the comments from ocasio cortez it is a historical smear it is a sinful comment it minimizes the death of 6 million of my jewish brothers and sisters it minimizes their suffering and it paints every patriotic law enforcement officer as a war criminal and those are the comments chris that we need to be focusing on wallace all right ph the president says that the four congresswomen hate america here he is begin video clip trump i can tell you this you can apost talk that way about our country not when i aposm the president end video clip wallace but during his 2016 campaign and even as president mr trump has been as critical of this country as anything the squad has ever said take a look begin video clips trump i think president obama has been the most ignorant president in our history nobody respects us they are laughing at us we don apost know what we aposre doing rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation we aposve got a lot of killers what you think our country is so innocent you think our country is so innocent end video clips wallace why is what those congresswomen said and you pointed out some things and i aposm not going to defend everything that the squad has said there are a lot of things they aposve said that i think are just wrong and very deeply troubling but why is what those congresswomen have said in general any worse than what you just heard donald trump say president obama is ignorant this country is killers on and on miller it aposs a great question so i want to drill down on it because it aposs really the heart of the debate that we aposre having in this country right now anybody who aposs running for office right left or center always points out where they think america can do better where they think america needs to go but there aposs a fundamental distinction between people who think that we need to lean into and strengthen america aposs core values whether it aposd be our constitutional values the rule of law the principles of western civilization or people who think it would basically need to turn america into venezuela for example wallace wait wait wait crosstalk wallace wait no wait a minute the fact of the matter is that people can have a legitimate difference of opinion about policies whether we want to go one way we want to go another under the constitution that you so believe in and i believe in the first amendment allows everybody to say it we aposre not talking what constitutional rights the president said that president obama has been the most ignorant president in our history when asked about putin he said there are a lot of killers you think our country is so innocent that isn apost you know his view that aposs being sharply critical of the united states as critical as the four members of congress of the squad have been miller what i aposm saying is there aposs is there aposs a canyon sized difference between saying that we need to have better enforcement of our immigration laws to protect u s citizens that we need to have better trade deals to end the deindustrialization crosstalk wallace that is what i aposm talking about that aposs not what i aposm talking about miller yes it is because the president ran a campaign that can be summarized into words america first there aposs a huge difference between america first and an ideology that runs down america if you want crosstalk wallace you don apost think the president ran down lock her up the president miller america first is the core crosstalk wallace look i completely nobody has any problem miller right wallace with what the president aposs policies have been it aposs when he goes into stoking racial fears i aposve never called i aposve never called any of his tweets racist but there aposs no question that he is stoking racial divisions miller chris the core element of the president aposs philosophy is america first saying that america needs to improve to get closer to an america first ideal as the president did as a candidate criticizing obama criticizing our trade deals our foreign policies our immigration policies is out of love for america saying as representative ocasio cortez did that illegal immigrants are in effect more american than americans is fundamentally an anti american statement wallace let aposs go to alexandria ocasio cortez the president is particularly upset with one particular slur by the congresswoman here it is begin video clip trump when people are speaking so badly when they call our country garbage think of that that aposs worse than deplorables end video clip wallace but here aposs what alexandria ocasio cortez and he repeated that often that somebody he didn apost say it was aoc has called the country garbage here aposs what you actually said talking about her proposals for the country all of these things could sound radical compared to where we are but where we are is not a good thing and this idea of 10 percent better from garbage shouldn apost be what we settle for she didn apost say the country was garbage she said some of the policies she opposes are garbage miller it aposs impossible to read the quote that way the quote what she aposs trying to say is crosstalk wallace she said this idea of 10 percent better from garbage shouldn apost be what we settle for she aposs talking about her proposal miller it aposs literally impossible to read the quote that way what she saying is there aposs a debate in the democratic party in which some people want to improve in her mind 10 percent from garbage which maybe we aposll say is obamacare where she wants to do say medicare for all which she views being i guess 70 percent better than garbage her point is where starting at garbage so i want to go a little better than garbage wallace i understand that i understand it crosstalk wallace but she aposs talking about she aposs talking about policies miller she aposs saying her starting point wallace she aposs not talking about the country and the people is garbage such a horrible word miller she aposs saying that america in her view right now is garbage but crosstalk wallace no no i want to put something up in that regard because i want to put up a tweet from donald trump from 2014 he wrote the united states under president obama has truly become the gang that couldn apost shoot straight everything he touches turns to garbage stephen that isn apost aoc that aposs donald j trump miller throughout this interview chris you aposre continuing to conflate donald trump aposs criticisms of president obama versus aoc aposs deep and systemic criticisms of the country itself and so let me just cut to the heart of the issue these four congresswomen detest america as it exists as it is currently constructed they want to tear down the structure of our country they want it to be a socialist open borders country if you as donald trump says want to destroy america with open borders you cannot say you love your country if you attack border agents the way that ocasio cortez has it means you have a deep seated hatred of the nation as it exists that aposs why you want to erase its borders fundamentally transform the country and in the process it doesn apost matter if american citizens lose their jobs lose their homes lose their livelihoods lose their health coverage and lose their very lives there aposs a gigantic enormous distinction between donald trump saying i aposm going to get on the world stage and put america first in every single thing we do versus a view that says america should never come first and american citizens should never come first which is their view and that aposs what we aposre going to take to the ballot box wallace stephen thank you thanks for your time i wanted to talk about immigration but we didn apost seem to get there please come back so we can discuss that as well because there are a lot of interesting and controversial things happening on that front miller thanks so much wallace thank you up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the president aposs attacks on those four congresswomen and their response when does political debate in this country go too far commercial break begin video clip trump i was not happy with it i disagree with it but again i didn apost say i didn apost say that they did it was a record crowd and i could have filled it ten times as you know those are incredible people those are incredible patriots end video clip wallace president trump a day after trying to distance himself from those send her back chant at a rally appearing to walk back his disavowal and it aposs time now for our sunday group jason riley of the wall street journal mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service jonathan swan from axios and fox news contributor lisa boothe well jonathan is this classic trump where his political advisors and even his family try to get him to toe a more politically correct stance and then he balks out and goes back to what he really thinks jonathan swan axios national political reporter yes that aposs a pretty succinct explanation of it and i think one thing that aposs been missed in some of the coverage is this is not president trump sitting down wit come political advisors and going through the polling from the key states and see well if we only make you know black non college voters a little 5 percent more angry we are going to win the election this is president trump watching this network responding to a quick tweeting and doing everything really by instinct and his staff tried to pull him back they aposre happy for him to talk about the squad the point at which they get uncomfortable is when he says go back to your own countries wallace i want to talk to lisa about this there was a lot of talk this week about whether or not this was politically smart which it seems to me misses the real point and that is was this wrong was it over the line to say go back where you came from lisa boothe contributor well i wouldn apost defend necessarily the tweet that he sent out but i would also point out there aposs been a lot of comparisons made to the late senator john mccain when he did shut down hecklers who called president obama an then candidate obama an arab but you have still representative john lewis then compare them to george walsh and you know basically fostering an environment of hate when we saw 1963 white supremacist bombed a church wallace let aposs try to stick to donald trump and what he did this week boothe the point is chris is that aposs the environment that we operate in where you aposve seen for a long time the left weaponize these words of racism or sexism against their political opponents we also saw that with mitt romney crosstalk wallace but you aposre not answer my question which is was it wrong for the president to say send them back to the country they go why don apost you go back to the country from which you came was that wrong boothe but i aposm a political analyst chris that aposs not my job to say it was wrong or not wallace so you don apost have a view boothe ask his ask his white house and his campaign it aposs my job to analyze the optics and the politics of this and to jonathan aposs point i would say i think president trump has good instincts in looking at the electorate he may not have looked at that axios report that you guys reported on the poll that shows that these four members of congress particularly alexandria ocasio cortez and omar absolutely toxic with key groups of voters but he has political instincts and we aposd seen him set up and tee off 2020 as the left is anti american they are socialist they are way too far extreme for america and that aposs the direction they want to go in and if you want to elevate four people to make that point these four women meet those descriptions wallace was it over the line mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics public service yes and it was wrong as other people who will occasionally tweet at me after i come off the air telling me to go back to where i came from they usually don apost mean arizona right they mean something else wallace literally you get that 920 boothe and if you want to elevate four people to make that point these four women meet those descriptions wallace was it over the line elleithee yes and it was wrong as other people who will occasionally tweet at me after i come off the air telling me to go back to where i came from they usually don apost mean arizona right they mean something else wallace literally you get that elleithee i literally get that in my twitter feed i will get it occasionally walking the street and so it does mean something and it means something deep and profound and hurtful to a lot of americans that you are other and that aposs what this is really about this is really about the otherization of americans the president is saying if you do not see america the way i see america you do not belong in america that aposs what he aposs saying we can debate on policies wallace forgive me he aposs not saying it to white men he aposs saying it to women of color elleithee and this is my point right my point is he saying he aposs not saying it to white critics right he saying it to these critics but he aposs taking race and identity general right in general conflating those two things and turning it into the great otherization of america and that aposs where i think his problem is going to where it aposs going to become a political problem crosstalk jason riley contributor right now i don apost think it aposs a political problem for him i think right now it aposs working he wants ocasio cortez and company to be the face of the democratic party and right now they are the face of the democratic party and so long as that is the case donald trump thinks he aposs winning nancy pelosi is spending her time right now not on refuting president trump and his policies she aposs spending her time on trying to her party and so long as she is preoccupied with that i think donald trump thinks i aposm winning this race wallace are you troubled by him taking this tack riley chris i aposve lost count of the number of times i aposve been troubled by something donald trump said or tweeted of course but i don apost think that aposs the point here frankly i think this is donald trump being donald trump and i add this to the pile of other things he said that i consider uncouth and unwise frankly and unhelpful in terms of crosstalk wallace but here aposs the reason i kind of disagree with you because it seems to me that the unity of the country and the harmony of the country and especially the racial harmony of the country is important riley of course it aposs important wallace so with the president said something anybody says something riley but no one looks to donald trump for racial harmony and we haven apost for the past two years so i don apost i don apost think that aposs the news here the news here is whether or not the democrats are taking the bait here and i don apost think that his team they are strategizing about this but i think trump has got a gut instinct here which is that i want to make the left wing democrats the face of the party and he seems to be succeeding in doing that and if he is successful in doing that in other words if he succeeds in making aoc and company the face of the party i think that will work to his advantage because i don apost think that aposs where most of the country is wallace let me pick up let me pick up on that because ilhan omar has been punching back as of all the members of the squad and here is a clip from her begin video clip omar as much as he aposs spewing his fascist ideology on stage telling you as citizens to go back because they don apost agree with his detrimental policies for our country we tell people that here in the united states dissent is patriotic end video clip wallace mo do you think that the trump campaign officials or strategists are licking their chops when they see that kind of clip playing on the news elleithee i stopped trying to predict what they think is good politics and not good politics but to this question of are democrats taking the bait and are democrats is this a winning strategy for donald trump donald trump has one thing going for him right now electorally right as a political analyst he aposs got one thing going for him he aposs got a strong economy every day he aposs not talking about that is a wasted opportunity for him politically his unfavorable rating is at 55 percent his job approval rating is even lower people don apost like him but a lot of people are willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because we are in good economic times if he aposs not talking about that i think he aposs taking the bait and handing the democrats a huge favor wallace i got about a minute lisa boothe well i was going to say in fairness we are in an environment where alexandria ocasio cortez is essentially said that nancy pelosi is a racist her chief of staff likened centrist democrats to segregationists you have the congressional black caucus taking aim at the justice democrats and extension these four women saying they are primarying people of color so this is today aposs environment that we operate and where we use terms like racism so loosely and cavalierly and i would say on the substance of president trump aposs attacks on representative omar they are absolutely correct in the categorization of the fact that she did in fact minimalize the 9 11 attacks that some people did something she did indeed right a judge asking for leniency for men that were trying to join isis these statements that she made these positions that she holds are true and she aposs also led a movement with a boycott divestment and sanctions movement that nancy pelosi has said that is bigoted and dangerous wallace you get the final word swan generally speaking the president aposs advisors are licking their chops not because they think they can make 2020 a referendum on the squad but because when the squad are in the national conversation it aposs very easy for them to direct the conversation onto the things they want to talk about radicalism socialism immigration wallace very quickly to mo aposs point are they missing an opportunity where they are not talking about the economy swan so the funny thing is i aposve been told by advisors of the president during the midterm elections they would say you aposve got to talk about the economy and he aposs like yes but when i do my people get really bored you know when i do these events they don apost want you here about the economy laughter wallace and honestly they do boothe we agree on that wallace all right thank you panel we aposll take a break here agreement on something up next washington prepares for this week of positivist public hearings with former special counsel robert mueller what does it mean for democrats hoping to impeach the president house judiciary committee chair jerry nadler who will oversee one of the hearings joins us next commercial break wallace coming up the long awaited testimony of former special counsel robert mueller begin video clip rep jerry nadler d n y i think it aposs very important that the american people here from mr mueller as to what he did find what the results of that two year investigation were end video clip wallace house judiciary committee chair jerry nadler joins us exclusively next commercial break wallace on wednesday former special counsel robert mueller faces five hours of questioning before two house committees on his investigation of russian interference in the 2020 campaign and possible obstruction of justice by president trump some democrats are counting on the testimony to convince americans the house should impeach the president or at least to damage his chances for reelection joining us now exclusively from new york jerry nadler mr chairman robert mueller has made it clear he doesn apost want to testify and he aposs not going to go beyond what he wrote in his report take a look begin video clip robert mueller former fbi director we chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself and the report is my testimony i would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before congress end video clip wallace so why are you putting mueller and the country through this nadler well we want the american people to hear directly from special counsel mueller what his investigation found the president and the attorney general and others have spent the last few months systematically lying to the american people about what the investigation found they aposve said that it found no collusion that it found no obstruction that it exonerated a president all three of those statements are absolute lies it found a great deal of collusion it found a great deal of of obstruction of justice by the president and it found and it pointedly refused to exonerate the president we think it aposs very important for the american people to hear directly what the facts are because this is a president who has violated the law six ways from sunday if anyone else had been accused of what the report finds the president had done they would have been indicted it aposs important that that we not have a lawless administration and a lawless president it aposs important that the people see where we aposre at and what we aposre doing what we aposre dealing with wallace i want to i want to follow up with what you just said that he aposs violated the law six ways from sunday if he weren apost the president he aposd be indicted you aposve read the 448 page report do you believe the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors the marker for impeachment by the house nadler i think there is very substantial well the report presents very substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and we have to present or let mueller present those facts to the american people and then see where we go from there because the administration must be held accountable and no president can be can be above the law wallace your committee though has said your committee staff has said that you expect that mueller could be fairly uncooperative could give yes or no answers could refer when you ask a question about an incident refer you to a specific page in in the report look at page 224 in volume two i understand that you aposre trying to educate the people people have said see the movie not read the book but what if this whole thing ends up being a dud nadler well we hope it won apost end up being a dud and we aposre going to ask specific questions about look at page 344 paragraph two please read it does that describe obstruction of justice and did you did you find that the president did that for example wallace meanwhile republicans say that they aposre going to use their time and they get equal time five minutes along with each of your members to ask about what they call the corrupt cabal and that aposs the idea that there was fbi misconduct in launching and then conducting the investigation of the president isn apost there a real chance since what you aposre asking about is stuff that aposs already in the report and they aposre going to ask about stuff that isn apost in the report that the republicans could end up getting more out of this hearing than democrats do nadler well i doubt it because the fact is that those charges have been investigated by the inspector general and have been found to be baseless they will do whatever they can wallace well wait wait wait i mean forgive me sir but they he they had the inspector general hasn apost investigated or at least hasn apost come out with his report on the conduct of the trump investigation nadler well the inspector general came out with most of what they aposre talking about is the is the hillary investigation and the beginning of the trump investigation and we have it aposs been very clear that the trump investigation was not predicated on the so called dossier that they aposre talking about there was nothing wrong with the with the fisa application all the things they aposre talking about have gone through the inspector general found that there was nothing wrong with the other half of what they aposre talking about which is the hillary investigation he aposs finishing it if they want to debate or discuss i should say this irrelevancy let them waste the time but the the what aposs before the american people now is the conduct of this president and what mueller found about the conduct of this president and where we go from here wallace some democrats including perhaps you hope that this hearing will breathe new life into the possibility of impeaching the president and here aposs what the president has to say about that begin video clip trump how many bites of the apple do you get we aposve gone through 500 witnesses 2 500 subpoenas i aposve let them interview my lawyers i aposve let them because i had nothing to do with russia now that aposs come out there was no collusion end video clip wallace and here aposs what a wall street journal poll from earlier this month found twenty one percent say there aposs enough evidence for congress to begin impeachment hearings 27 percent say congress should continue investigating but 50 percent say there should be no hearings and that mr trump should finish his term as president chairman hasn apost the country largely moved on from the trump investigation nadler no the country has not moved on i mean they aposve the the president and the attorney general have lied to the american people about what was in the mueller report about the fact that you just heard the president saying they found no collusion that was not true that it found no obstruction that is not true and they aposve had months about lying to the american people people don apost read a 448 page report i believe that when people hear what was in the mueller report then we aposll be able we aposll be in a position to begin holding the president accountable and to make this less of a lawless administration and the fact of the matter is that the president has also been lawless in telling all witnesses not to obey congressional subpoenas not to testify at all and that is beyond the pale of the constitution wallace well let me pick up on that because regardless of what mueller says you have said that you intend to continue this investigation and one of the things that you very much want to do is to talk to former white house counsel don mcgahn who was involved in a number of these key incidents when according to the mueller report the president told him to get the the special counsel aposs investigation ended the white house has refused to make him available and you aposve suggested you aposre going to go to court after the mueller hearing how soon do you plan to take that before a judge nadler within a couple of days that if the house counsel weren apost so busy enforcing subpoenas other subpoenas we would aposve done that before the fact is that we have never seen a situation where the president the white house stonewalls congress on subpoenas that was article three of the nixon impeachment that they stonewalled subpoenas here the president said outright out loud that he aposs stonewalling all subpoenas which they are doing and that aposs an invasion of the separation of powers and it aposs a and a core function of the of the duty of congress to hold the administration accountable to the american people wallace you are also ask hope hicks who was a former top white house advisor and is now an executive vice president of fox corporation you aposre asking her to come back before your committee to clarify earlier comments she made in testimony before your committee about her knowledge of the hush payments to stormy daniels her lawyer came out with a statement after you requested her to come back he issued this statement ms hicks stands by her truthful testimony that she first became aware of this issue in early november 2016 as the result of press inquiries does that satisfy you mr chairman nadler no that does not because that would seem to go against the evidence that that was released by the court in the in in in the michael cohen in in the i think it was the michael cohen case the other day so we aposve asked her to clarify how her testimony was truthful given what the court the court filings reveal but again the key here is that all people owe the public their evidence all witnesses all witnesses owe the public their evidence and it is our duty to make sure that people like mcgahn testify for example because as the mueller report showed the president asked him to fire the special counsel so as to stop the investigation into the president he asked him to deny publicly they aposve done so both of those if true are criminal acts by the president wallace but i just want to pick up on one last thing with regard to hope hicks this information came out when the judge ordered it released after the prosecutor in new york indicated that the case the hush money case is closed and they aposre not going to bring charges against anyone else so isn apost that kind of a dry hole because according to reports the prosecutor in effect found that there was not sufficient evidence to show that president trump actually knowingly intentionally violated campaign finance laws nadler well first of all there was no i don apost think that was ph the latter finding he could not consider indicting the president because it is the policy of the justice department pursuant to the office of legal counsel memo ph that a sitting president may not be indicted no matter what no matter what the evidence now the finding you know in that case michael cohen was sent to prison for these campaign finance violation done at the behest of donald trump in the interest of donald trump and the indictment said that cohen did it at the request and direction of individual 1 who has now been identified as president trump so from a legal point of view he is subject to indictment for that after the election the fact that they have closed the case doesn apost mean that they found him not guilty in any way wallace chairman nadler thank you thanks for joining us and we will of course be watching your hearing on wednesday nadler it should be interesting laughter wallace yes let aposs hope it aposs not a dud when we come back iran seizes a british tanker in the persian gulf the latest in a tense standoff plus what would you like to ask the panel about the mueller hearings this week just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump what happened to me with this witch hunt should never be allowed to happen to another president of the united states never ever again cheering and applause end video clip wallace president trump once again denouncing the russia investigation ahead of robert mueller aposs much anticipated testimony this week before congress and we are back now with the panel well jason what do you expect from the mueller hearings riley not much chris the democrats spent two years telling us that the mueller investigation would show obstruction and that it would show collusion and it showed neither and i think this is more evidence these hearings that the democrats simply to refuse to accept that result mueller doesn apost want to be there he made that pretty clear in his press conference after this report was released and i don apost think he aposs going to give them much wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the mueller hearings marilyn simpson clark posted this on facebook why are they going to conduct hearings when he aposs mueller aposs already stated the report is his testimony and has nothing further to add lisa how do you answer marilyn and what do you expect the effect of the mueller hearings to be boothe well i would echo that sentiment and i have the same question myself in fact i question why he ever gave a press conference in the first place i mean we already knew that his office was shutting down by the fact that the report had already been turned in you had attorney general barr and rod rosenstein already reach the conclusion that they weren apost going to move forward on obstruction of justice barr had already released the report 90 percent to the public and it had already been in the domain so i don apost know why he gave that press conference he also contradicted himself by originally saying that he would have cleared the president if he could have while simultaneously saying that he had decided that he wasn apost going to reach a conclusion one way or another and then also giving a wink wink nod nod in my opinion to democrats by saying that the constitution outlines essentially it aposs congress aposs duty to find wrongdoing of a sitting president so i think the entire reason he went out and gave the press conference was to give ammunition to democrats wallace mo what you know it aposs going to be an interesting thing to see and we don apost know how mueller aposs going to perform but certainly the the democratic staff seems to think this could be like pulling teeth to get him to say things if he aposs not a particularly forthcoming or cooperative witness couldn apost this be well to coin a phrase a dud elleithee well it could be and and yes he aposs already expressed that he doesn apost want to be there i think you aposre going to see democrats though focus on three lines of questioning one will be drilling down on the contacts the campaign had with the russians i don apost know if there aposs anything new that aposll come out of that two the obstruction issue which i think is going to be interesting because again mueller said in the report or at least it aposs intimated from the report that the only reason he did not go further was because his hands were tied and so democrats trying to pin him down on that will be an interesting flash point and then number three and this is the part that gets the least amount of attention but as an american one i aposm incredibly interested and freaked out by that is russian attempts forget the collusion for a second russian attempts to infiltrate our electoral process which this congress has not really focused on as much democrats have passed some legislation but republicans haven apost been there so seeing what they do on that wallace yes swan chairman nadler crystallized in your interview what this is all about this is about television it aposs about educating the american public through television they don apost expect anything new to come out it aposs about stoking impeachment we aposve done a lot of reporting on this talking to members of both committees there aposs a couple of quotes that members gave one of them i want to read to you from jackie speier this is to my colleague alayna treene my fantasy is when i get my five minutes i aposm just going to have him read certain excerpts from his report and i think that will be very powerful nadler actually sort of almost said the same thing wallace no he did say that swan i mean so you imagine this spectacle where they aposre basically having robert mueller read his own report because they know that no one read this report and they aposre trying now desperately through the television to beat the american people over the head and change those numbers that you put up on screen about impeachment wallace ok let aposs let aposs talk about something that is exciting and actually even has pictures and that is iran seized a british tanker in the persian gulf this week and released this video which is pretty interesting you can see iranian commandos in ski masks they repelled from a helicopter onto the tanker and seized control all of this of course after the u s shot down an iranian drone that got too close but president trump aposs reaction to the seizing of this tanker was restrained begin video clip trump this only goes to show what i aposm saying about iran trouble nothing but trouble end video clip laughter wallace it sounds that sounds like something out of a sitcom trouble nothing but trouble jonathan what are you hearing about where the president is on military action against iran and what will it take what would it take for him to decide to pull the trigger swan call me naive but i actually don apost think that this president wants war with iran i really believe he doesn apost want that from talking to his advisors obviously he aposs said this publicly but i really believe that he wants to avoid that what some people who are more dovish who talk to the president and worry about his national security advisor john bolton about his hawkish tendencies what they were about his accidental conflict that this escalation one thing happens here they have to respond there aposs a escalating letter of conflict and they might get a war that he actually doesn apost want but i believe that he really wants to do everything he can to avoid certainly avoid a massive troop deployment in that region he doesn apost want that at all wallace mo i assume you approve of the president aposs restraint on iran elleithee yes look i what i think he was right to show restraint here i think he was right to show restraint when the first when they shot down the american drone the first time but i think i would share the concern of his dovish advisors which is that a lack of clarity in his policy towards iran plus iran aposs increased provocation and i aposm laying a lot of the blame at iran right like 100 percent but that those two things together could lead us to a very tricky situation that that he gets kind of pushed into or trips into wallace jason riley we can apost confuse restraint with weakness which is what iran could be seeing from their advantage point there have been a series of provocations in recent months this is a result of these sanctions which are crippling the iranian economy and they aposre saying if we can apost trade our oil we aposre going to make it hard for everyone else to engage in this business as well and i think we aposre going to continue to see provocations until they get a meaningful response to them yes we aposve sent some trips yes we said some tough things but the mullahs don apost respond to that they will respond to resolve on the part of the west and we have not really seen that yet wallace well i want to ask you about that because a question i have is after the u s drone was shot down and the president apparently ordered a military strike and then at the last minute called it off if he had gone ahead with that strike would perhaps iran not be taking the actions it is now riley my guess is you aposre correct they wouldn apost be we have some precedent for this back in the 1980s iran was acting out in this way and reagan took out some some oil platforms and they stopped the mullahs got the message so there aposs not only a precedent for the way iran is acting now there is a precedent for how we could respond forcefully wallace thirty seconds jonathan any second guessing or second thoughts in the white house about maybe they should have taken that action after the u s drone was shot down swan well there aposs plenty of second among the staff because they wanted him to take that action i haven apost got any evidence that the president himself has second guessed it in fact he was talking to people about how he got great reviews from the media for for that action i just think one more important thing to say which is to the point wrecking the iranian economy is a goal in and of itself for this white house their view is every dollar they deprive the mullahs of is a dollar they can apost spend on terrorism wallace thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week her journey from a survivalist family to the heights of academia has been a best seller for more than a year you aposll meet her when we come right back commercial break wallace as of today it aposs been on the new york times best seller list for 73 weeks as we told you in february no it aposs not a spy thriller or a trump tell all here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape tara westover author educated i could not continue to have my family in my life and and be in any way respectful of myself wallace tara westover is describing her journey the story she tells in educated which has been on the bestseller list for over a year westover i think people want to believe that they can change wallace it aposs a remarkable but painful account that has captivated hundreds of thousands of readers tara grew up in buck aposs peak idaho one of seven children their dad was a mormon survivalist who believed the government had been taken over by an evil organization on camera you never went to grade school or high school why not westover he thought if we went to school that we would be brainwashed wallace what is your birthday westover i don apost know my birthday wallace voice over tara describes a break when she was 16 her father wouldn apost let them see doctors but after her brother was in a bad accident she disobeyed her dad and took a brother to a hospital westover i could tell i was going in one direction and he was going the other direction and it wasn apost clear to me how the relationship was going to survive wallace the next year she began her formal education passing an exam and attending brigham young university westover i was pretty wildly unprepared one of my first lectures that i went to i raised my hand and asked the lecturer what the holocaust was i had just never heard of it before wallace but with the help of some female classmates and a fierce drive to learn tara thrived westover i think for some of us having not had access to education when we finally got it for me anyway there was a kind of obsessive quality for that and i wasn apost going to stop until i had kind of run out of road wallace tara got a fellowship to harvard and ended up with a ph d from cambridge university in england but it wasn apost easy breaking away from buck aposs peak on camera one point in the book you describe yourself as an ignorant girl who crawled out of the scrap heap did you really think of yourself that we westover i think i thought of myself that way and worse wallace voice over her family said her academic success came at the expense of her soul westover that tension for a lot of years between this idea of myself as this expletive and my idea of myself as a scholar was very difficult to reconcile wallace and that led tara to the final chapter of being educated westover for me i ended up discovering for myself that i could love my family and still choose to say goodbye to them wallace on camera when was the last time you talked to your mom or dad westover the last time i saw my mother it aposs probably been about a year and a half since i saw her for maybe five minutes and since i saw her for a real amount of time four or five years wallace voice over tara hopes her story helps other people estranged from family understand they aposre not alone westover i remember thinking to myself i don apost know how i can believe that i aposm a good person when i know that my mother doesn apost think i aposm a good person for me it aposs about saying this is not a good option this is not a nice thing to have happen but i do think there aposs a way to be at peace wi
