have expressed skepticism about china s commitment to transparency after the communist government s lag in reporting cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 and 2003 that killed hundreds however chinese officials appear to be doing a better job with the new coronavirus said amesh adalja a senior scholar at the johns hopkins university center for health security there were delays in reporting sars in 2003 but thus far there appears to be a great degree of transparency and real time information sharing going on mr adalja told the washington times for example the virus genetic sequence was shared rapidly the chinese head of state has made control of this outbreak a priority lawrence gostin a professor of global health law at georgetown university acknowledged that china reported the novel virus promptly but said he has reason to doubt beijing s honesty and transparency after its lack of action with the sars outbreak we were told that china had everything under control it didn t we were told they were doing thorough contact tracing they weren t the cases spread over china parts of asia and the u s were not on known contact lists mr gostin said in other words

it will be important to discover whether the coronavirus usually causes mild illness or whether it is more like sars or middle east respiratory syndrome mers which have a greater capacity for severe illness it also will be vital to figure out how common human to human transmission is and how the virus is spread this way this article is based in
