tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion the democrats and other opponents of president trump are so consumed with rage at being rejected they re not even hiding their desire to provoke violence against their objects of hate yes objects plural the public chattering class of democrats and republicans who remain apoplectic about mr trump s success and their own pathetic failures hate mr trump because they hate the average american who put him in office the president is the proxy for the american voter and every person who dared to fire the establishment in 2016 and it s those people who must be dealt with right after the first disastrous presidential democratic debate the rhetoric on the left became even more unhinged perhaps it s the natural dread finally seeing what has become of the party looking into the crib and seeing rosemary s baby would tend to induce panic top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick take it from jennifer rubin the sort of republican columnist the washington post admires made it very clear on an msnbc panel who the problem is and what should be done about them total annihilation is the only answer after talking about needing to burn down the republican party because all his enablers have to lose she then got down to business about why there can be no survivors we have to level them because if there are survivors if there are people who weather this storm they will do it again will take this as confirmation that hey it just pays to ride the wave look at me i ve made it through this just a few weeks after the el paso texas and dayton ohio mass shootings that shook the country in the aftermath we finally had conversations about all the elements contributing to mass murders including violent imagery and rhetoric yet no one on that panel consisting of five other people including host joy reid appeared shocked or felt bothered enough to contradict her rhetoric it s not mr trump per se who enrages the political class it s his supporters the forgotten man and woman were forgotten deliberately after all what do you do with people who don t use hair gel and end the day with dirt under their fingernails just as hillary clinton forgot to go to wisconsin during the 2016 presidential race the rejected political class of coastal elites decided to just not think about the people who disgust them the working class people without a college education union members blue collar workers and that includes first responders etc anyone who is perfectly happy and even prefers to live in any city not on a coast is the problem and better off forgotten someone like radio talk show host and one term house member joe walsh is especially angry about mr trump and sure has found a way to get the attention that had waned in recent years mr walsh was swept into office during the tea party wave of 2010 allowing the republicans to take over the house of representatives we had some real winners in that election mr walsh was not one of them he was fired by the voters after one term declaring he s running against mr trump for the 2020 gop presidential nomination mr walsh knows he has no chance at winning but he sure is getting a lot of attention mr walsh s schtick is being outraged about the outrageousness of mr trump he laments how divisive dangerous and juvenile the president is by being divisive dangerous and juvenile mr walsh apparently the left s new even more unhinged michael avenatti was rewarded with a new york times op ed with which to attack mr trump first he wrote at times i expressed hate for my political opponents we now see where this can lead there s no place in our politics for personal attacks like that and i regret making them two short paragraphs later he s right back at it expressing his hatred for mr trump with ad hominem attacks calling the president a racial arsonist who encourages bigotry and xenophobia during an abc interview mr walsh said of the president he s nuts he s erratic he s cruel he stokes bigotry as one would expect that sort of unhinged and bizarre hate can lead to a desire to do violence an exchange on msnbc with nicolle wallace says it all about her and this latest darling of the unhinged nicolle wallace why do you think you can get farther than the 16 republicans who ran against mr trump joe walsh because i m going to hit donald trump i m going to punch him in the face every single day nicolle wallace on tv this from the man positioning himself as the arbiter of all that is decent and good the champion of the people ready to remove the evil dangerous crazy man in the white house but can you blame him when he goes on national television expresses a desire to physically assault the president and the first thing the host of the show is interested in is if he ll do it on tv in the meantime the bar for statements that seem tailor made to provoke other people to violence against the president was provided by brian stelter on cnn s ironically named reliable sources he interviewed a psychiatrist who stated trump is as destructive a person in this century as hitler stalin and mao were in the last century he may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were these monsters were responsible for what many historians believe is upwards of 60 million deaths including at least 6 million jewish people killed by hitler s industrialized mass murder mr stelter said nothing challenging that obscene and dangerous comparison these are the people who insist mr trump is the menace who must be removed that should tell you everything you need to know about what s at stake in 2020 tammy bruce president of independent women s voice author and fox news contributor is a radio talk
