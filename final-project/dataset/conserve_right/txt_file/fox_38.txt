atic presidential candidate andrew yang joins chris wallace on fox news sunday this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday july 26 2019 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace anchor i aposm chris wallace president trump claims victory after robert mueller aposs testimony as democrats debate what to do next begin videotape donald trump president the democrats had nothing and now they have less than nothing rep jerry nadler d n y did you actually totally exonerate the president robert mueller former special counsel no wallace and will the senate pass a bipartisan budget deal that is making conservative spending hawks cringe we aposll discuss that and more with white house chief of staff mick mulvaney then just two days before the next democratic debate joe biden says no more mr nice guy reporter what did you mean when you said you aposre not going to be as polite in the next debate joe biden d presidential we aposll see wallace presidential candidate and entrepreneur andrew yang joins us for an exclusive 2020 sit down plus speaker pelosi and aoc meet to clear the air rep nancy pelosi d calif i call this we have our differences respect that wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about pelosi aposs bid to end the infighting in her party all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington president trump is in another ugly twitter war with another democratic congressman of color and how speaker pelosi is accusing him of another racist attack meanwhile the house has left town for a six week recess but even after the testimony of former special counsel robert mueller fell flat the question of whether democrats will start impeachment proceedings against the president remains unsettled joining us now is white house chief of staff mick mulvaney and mick welcome back to fox news sunday mick mulvaney acting white house chief of staff not much going on this week chris it aposs good to be here wallace well let aposs start with what we didn apost anticipate and that is the twitter war president trump attacked democratic congressman elijah cummings on saturday saying that his district in the baltimore area of maryland is worse worse conditions more dangerous than along the southern border i want to put up the president aposs statements his district is considered the worst in the usa cummings apos district is disgusting rat and rodent infested mask no human being would want to live there in fact median household income in the district is in the upper half nationally and columbia maryland which is part of the cummings apos district has been called the safest city in america so what is the president talking about mulvaney and i think maryland is i think on a per capita basis or per household basis the richest state in america you still see pictures on the internet of complete poverty in baltimore maryland what this is about though is the president fighting back against what he saw as being illegitimate attacks about the border in the hearing this week if you go online you can see the questioning that elijah cummings did of kevin mcaleenan regarding the conditions at the border mr cummings saying that children were sleeping or sitting in their own feces that aposs just not that aposs not right it aposs not accurate born by the fact by the way that mr cummings has not been to the border in recent memory certainly not during this administration and when the president hears lies like that he is going to fight back and that aposs what you saw in those tweets wallace this goes back to what happened with the four members of the squad nobody objects to the president defending his border policies but this seems mick to be the worst kind of racial stereotype let me finish mulvaney yes wallace racial stereotyping black congressman majority black district i mean no human being would want to live there is he saying people that live in baltimore are not human beings mulvaney so chris help me with this when the president attacks aoc plus three when he attacks the squad last week he gets accused of being a racist when nancy pelosi does it a few days later the left and many members of the media not you in particular i want to make that clear come to nancy aposs defense how it couldn apost possibly be racist that she was simply attacking their ideas the president is doing the same the president is attacking mr cummings for saying things that are not true about the border i think it aposs right for the president to raise the issue of look i was in congress for six years if i had poverty in my district like they have in baltimore if i had crime in my district like they have in chicago if i had homelessness like they have in san francisco and i spent all of my time in washington d c chasing down this mueller investigation this bizarre impeachment crusade i aposd get fired and i think the president aposs right to raise that it has absolutely zero to do with race wallace you say it has zero to do with race there is a clear pattern here mick the fact is that before his inaugural before his inauguration the president tweeted about john lewis a black congressman that he should this is before his inauguration he should spend time in his crime infested district then two weeks ago he goes after these four members of the squad all women of color and says they should go back to the crime infested countries from which they come then he talks about elijah cummings and he says his district is rat and rodent infested infested it sounds like vermin it sounds subhuman and these are all six members of congress who are people of color mulvaney i think you aposre spending way too much time reading between the lines does anybody crosstalk wallace i aposm not reading between the lines i aposm reading the lines mulvaney does anyone watching this program dispute the fact or the possibility that if adam schiff has said the same thing about the border that the president would be attacking adam schiff the exact same way today wallace i don apost think he aposd be talking about his crime infested rodent infested district mulvaney he very well could it has zero to do with the fact that adam is jewish and everything to do with adam would just be wrong if he were saying that this is what the president does he fights and he aposs not wrong to do so crosstalk wallace you aposre completely comfortable with him saying that this is a rodent infested district and no human being would want to live there you aposre comfortable with that personally mulvaney have you seen some of the pictures on the internet just this morning from the conditions in baltimore maryland have you seen them crosstalk wallace you can do that in any inner city in america mulvaney you absolutely could wallace and you could argue why doesn apost the president do something to stop it mulvaney the richest state in the nation the richest state in the nation has abject poverty like that a state by the way dominated for generations by democrats i think it aposs fair to have that conversation wallace ok after robert mueller aposs testimony this week president trump declared victory here he is begin video clip donald trump president this was a very big day for our country this was a very big day for the republican party and you could say it was a great day for me end video clip wallace but house judiciary committee chair jerry nadler even after the mueller hearings says he aposs going to go to court to try to get access to documents try to get access to witnesses like former white house counsel don mcgahn here he is begin video clip rep jerry nadler d n y there appears to be compelling evidence of the president aposs misconduct outside of the four corners of the redacted version of the mueller report and we will work to uncover that evidence as well end video clip wallace this isn apost over mulvaney no it aposs far from over in fact i don apost know if it was in that clip that you just saw a little later in that same press conference or after he got back to his district in new york but nadler actually told people he has begun an impeachment inquiry keep in mind let aposs not lose sight of the fact that jerry nadler is facing a primary from his left in new york he is falling over himself to become more and more progressive in order to try and keep his job and not lose to the next aoc no no this is not over in their minds which is just bizarre given what happened this week mueller answered the single one outstanding question he said they asked him would you have indicted the president if he were not the president and mueller said absolutely not he would not do that he answered crosstalk wallace no that aposs not what he said no that isn apost what he said he said we didn apost because of the olc the office of legal counsel guidelines he said we didn apost even make a decision on that mulvaney he got asked the question by congressman lieu who i know said would you have indicted him if he were not the president and he said yes we would have and we went back to the beginning of a second hearing crosstalk wallace right and that aposs when he said he said yes he did i agree but what he said was that we i wouldn apost have made it we didn apost even make that decision because the guidelines prevented us from doing that mulvaney i actually just think you aposre wrong on that if they could crosstalk wallace the record will show what it shows i promise you you aposre wrong mulvaney if they had the evidence to indict the president they would aposve done it and they don apost because there was no obstruction you can go through the details about what mr mueller wallace ok let aposs look at that because despite the president aposs claim of total vindication the special counsel and his testimony was not a moment in history but he made it clear he aposs not saying the president did nothing wrong take a look begin video clip nadler the report did not conclude that he did not commit obstruction of justice is that correct robert mueller former special counsel that is correct nadler did you actually totally exonerate the president mueller no rep adam schiff d ca your investigation is not a witch hunt is it mueller it is not a witch hunt schiff when the president said the russian interference was a hoax that was false wasn apost it mueller true end video clip wallace not a witch hunt not a hoax and the president is not exonerated mulvaney and that last one which is the second clip you just played is probably one of the most offensive things i aposve seen on television from a federal government employee since i aposve been here and there aposs a fairly high bar for that did not exonerate the president there is no way to exonerate the president that aposs not the job of a special prosecutor you don apost get exonerated you are innocent until proven guilty in fact i think it was congressman turner from ohio raised that issue in another clip wallace so did ratcliffe i agree mulvaney exactly wallace but he specifically said because the president says he was exonerated i aposm just simply mulvaney you aposre innocent you know it i know it you aposre innocent until proven guilty they could not find enough evidence to convict them excuse me to charge him with any crime this is over most folks know that it aposs over in fact if you go back and watch the response of most democrats during the day they knew it was a disaster they knew it was over but you still have mr nadler and a small part of this democrat party the left wing of the party bringing the entire party to the left to continue impeachment proceedings just bizarre results wallace ok let aposs move on the senate votes this week on a bill that would extend spending limits and also extend the debt limit into 2021 this is what the bill would do it raises spending by 324 billion over spending caps and runs out the clock on sequestration no more forced spending cuts question does the president want the senate to pass it and if it does will he sign this bill mulvaney yes and yes keep in mind the bill spends more money than the president wanted to spend there aposs no question about that but as i aposve said on this show and you and i have talked before elections have consequences and when the democrats won back the house everybody knew we were going to end up spending more money so what did we get in exchange we got more money for defense which we think we need we get more money for the v a which we think that we needed and this hasn apost gotten nearly the attention we got protections for the republican policies that were in the previous year aposs bills keep in mind there aposs policy riders that go on appropriations bills where lawmakers who spend money try and use that money to change policy outcomes and the democrats wanted to limit our policies on the border they wanted to limit our policies regarding pro life they want to limit our policies regarding deregulation and we won on every single one of those so did we spend more money than we wanted to yes did we get a lot in return yes wallace but candidate trump back in 2016 promised that he was going to balance the budget and you when you were a member of congress were a big deficit hawk take a look begin video clip trump we can balance the budget very quickly sean hannity host do you think in five years trump i think over a five year period and i don apost know maybe i could even surprise you mulvaney we are not paying for the government that we are getting and unless we aposre going to continue to steal money from our kids we have to make a very difficult choice which is are we going to raise taxes or are we going to reduce spending end video clip wallace but look at these numbers mulvaney look at the hair on crosstalk wallace i wasn apost going to comment on that fact but yes age hasn apost helped either of us look at these numbers after dealing with the great recession in his first term the deficit under obama dropped by an average of 11 percent a year in his second term the deficit has increased by 15 percent a year in president trump aposs first two years under president trump our national debt has increased by more than 2 trillion and if this bill goes through estimates are the trump debt will top 4 trillion how can mick mulvaney budget hawk support this mulvaney yes take our budget adopt our budget the media and the press crosstalk wallace yes but that aposs always dead on arrival this is the bill mulvaney dead on arrival is the word that everybody always uses but if you actually went to look at it and saw what donald trump would do if he could pass spending bills which he can apost you would be on your path to balance and the deficit would be down congress spends money wallace you had wait a minute you had republican control of congress for the first two years mulvaney yes who also threw our budgets in the trash as well as dead on arrival you asked me about donald trump if donald trump were in charge if donald trump wallace he aposs the president mulvaney but you also know your constitution which is that congress spends the money we have to deal with the democrats in the house we have to deal with democrats in the senate because of the 60 vote rules we are always going to spend more money when democrats have that seat at the table wallace ok thirty seconds your reaction to the supreme court saying you can spend that 2 5 billion in pentagon money for the wall mulvaney it aposs the right decision we aposll build about 100 miles of wall we aposll be at four miles a week by the fall probably higher than that in the next year and we are still on schedule to have 450 miles of wall built by the end of 2020 wallace mick thank you thanks for coming in always good to talk with you sir mulvaney thanks for having me wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the sticking points for conservatives over that big spending bill plus what would you like to ask the panel about democrats statements they are just getting started after the mueller hearings just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip nadler if our committee is going to recommend articles of impeachment to the house we must make the strongest possible case rep kevin mccarthy r calif why would you ever even bring up impeachment after yesterday aposs hearing that should be put to bed that is over we watched it we aposve heard it we aposve read it what more can they make up end video clpi wallace house judiciary committee chair jerry nadler and house republican leader kevin mccarthy with very different takes on where the house is on impeachment after robert mueller aposs testimony this week and it aposs time for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove columnist for the hill juan williams former democratic party chair donna brazile and cofounder of the federalist ben domenech before we get to impeachment i aposve got to ask a couple of you about the tweets your reaction to the president aposs tweets about elijah cummings of baltimore donna brazile former dnc chair he was not only attacking the chairman of the oversight committee he was attacking the entire southern district of maryland which includes baltimore city and the rest the president is absolutely wrong when lawmakers are questioning his policy questioning the implementation of policy the president goes after these lawmakers in a personal way i think it aposs wrong but of course this is the president aposs strategy wallace do you think he aposs racist brazile you know i don apost know what is in his heart but this is a repeated pattern that we aposve seen for the last several years wallace karl you hear people close to the trump campaign saying that the president can kind of walk up to the line of racist tweets racist rhetoric mobilize his base and then step back from it without alienating a lot of other people that he aposs going to need for his suburban college educated people is this a good political strategy karl rove former bush white house advisor this didn apost advance it if that was his goal this didn apost advance it i mean he attacked a city he attacked her district he attacked a people he painted an ugly picture i don apost think this helps the president aposs cause whatsoever and look i don apost know what is in his heart but i don apost see him as a racist but this is the kind of thing that will cause people even who accept that view to say mr president why are you doing this you aposve got better things to do with his tweets wallace ok let aposs move on to the question of impeachment 101 members of the house i think one independent former republican and 100 democrats now in favor of at least impeachment proceedings how big a mistake for democrats for 2020 if they go down this road rove big in january the washington post abc poll said 38 percent bought the house ought to begin 57 percent said they shouldn apost we had in march the end of the investigation april we had the report now in the latest july washington post apos abc poll it is 33 percent say they should begin sixty three percent oppose beginning impeachment hearings now having said that they aposre going to put they aposre going to have a pseudo hearing they aposre not going to go to the floor and ask for a vote of the house to move forward with impeachment proceeding but it aposs clear that 15 out of 24 democrats on the house judiciary committee 16 if you include nadler are in favor of impeachment and they are moving ahead the democrats nancy pelosi is now in purgatory she can they aposre going to continue to move forward on impeachment through the judiciary committee dominating the headlines whatever they want drowning out what they aposre doing in the house drowning out democratic presidential candidates and there aposs nothing nancy can do about it wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of what should happen post mueller we got this on facebook from bill thrower mueller said he was unable to indict a sitting president for obstruction but others in his administration or campaign are not immune to indictment so why has no one else been indicted is mueller implying the president trump committed obstruction by himself donna two questions one how do you answer bill secondly what does nancy pelosi do to control the drive for impeachment among a lot of her fellow democrats brazile well i aposll take the second first i mean speaker pelosi cannot drive the conversation because the conversation started a long time ago it started before she even became speaker for the second time there aposs a very healthy debate going on in our country now in terms of whether or not the president is abusing his power the house judiciary committee will continue to proceed along the facts and gain information i don apost know if it will ever come to a vote on the house floor but as of now democrats believe this president must be held held responsible not just for his actions but he should be held responsible for the things that he is doing to our constitution wallace let aposs turn to that budget deal that the senate is going to consider this week which would extend spending for two years and a debt limit for two years into 2021 take them out of the presidential race in 2020 and here aposs what the senate republican leader mitch mcconnell had to say about that bill begin video clip sen mitch mcconnell r ky i make no apologies for this to your caps deal i think is the best we could have done at a time of divided government the alternatives were much worse end video clip wallace then as i mentioned to mick mulvaney this increases spending by over 300 billion over the next two years how much heartburn is it causing conservative republicans ben domenech the federalist i think it aposs causing a lot of heartburn i think there are a lot of people who feel like this is kind of the end of the tea party era in a lot of different little respects but this is all kind of connected in a way because what we see now from the american congress both on the republican and democrat side of the aisle is there aposs no actual demand on them to legislate to go through the process of negotiation the way that they ought to instead you have these big deals that are crafted that no one aposs really happy with but then you have to have them swallowed just as nancy pelosi got her entire the bulk of our conference to swallow this deal and it doesn apost really leave anybody satisfied because the job of the congressman now is essentially to be a hype machine for national partisan issues as opposed to legislating in a way that would be representative of their district wallace ok so you put the finger on congress but what about president trump i mean he aposs got mick mulvaney who made his bones as a budget hawk why did he accept this deal domenech i think he accepts this deal for the political reality of kicking the can down the road but i also think that this is a deal that is the sort of things you could see under any president and it aposs going to continue to be a problem for the american people that we have a budget process that is totally broken that doesn apost work either under president obama or under president trump wallace juan the key players in this negotiation reporting is that mulvaney was basically kept out of it because democrats thought he was too much of a budget hawk so the key players in the negotiation were speaker pelosi for the democrats and treasury secretary mnuchin more of a dealmaker for the republicans which of the two of them do you think came out better in this deal juan williams political analyst do you really want the answer it aposs pretty obvious i hope everybody sees that nancy pelosi is the queen she is majestic on this run she held her caucus together she got a bigger increase in terms of social domestic spending that trump got and he makes defense spending his be all and end all she got more money in fact in this deal chris you see a faster rate of increase in nondefense spending under president trump then you had under president obama so the democrats are doing better in terms of spending for these social programs under president trump than they did under obama i come back to something ben was talking about which is you know the tea party the freedom caucus this was a drive to take over washington spending out of control under obama deficits rising deficits are rising faster now and you see a divided republican party on this front you only got 65 of 197 republicans in the house to vote for this and obviously they aposre all in fear of trump and his political power but you can see the demise of so much of the instinct the drive that pushed them to power in the first place which was about smaller government apparently that aposs gone domenech the constituency for that is much smaller than it turned out to be wallace let me ask you about that karl because conservatives used to talk about president you worked for george w bush bush 43 and say he was a big government conservative where does donald trump fit on that scale rove well i aposm not certain there aposs a coherent political philosophy behind there but look let aposs inject just a little bit of restraint here yes the deal allows for up to 320 billion in additional spending by removing the caps that were in the 2011 budget bill but it doesn apost say that we are going to spend 320 billion more now we have to fight over 13 individual appropriations bills so two thirds of the republicans said we are not voting for this we think it stinks those republicans plus the 65 who voted for it now have a chance in the house and the republicans in the senate to say ok we want to spend x out of the 320 billion we don apost want to spend that much so they have the ability and the fights over these individual spending bills we basically got rid of the caps and we said we aposre not going to have a needless fight over the debt ceiling until 2021 but it we will absolutely have a fight over each and every one of those spending bills wallace so are you suggesting that there may because let me just quickly explain they set spending limits you can apost spend any more than this but you aposre not saying you have to spend that rove right wallace and there wasn apost any money appropriated are you saying we aposre going to end having a government shutdown rove no no i don apost think so but i do think we aposre going to have i slightly disagree with ben i think we aposre going to have a lot of legislating as people go through these appropriations bills and the test will be do the republicans stand up and say we want less spending rather than more spending or do they just simply say you know here aposs what i need for my district we aposll see wallace we have to take a break here panel see you all a little later up next he aposs a former tech entrepreneur running as the anti politician in 2020 with an online following that aposs earned him a spot on the debate stage andrew yang joins us live for a fox news sunday sit down with the 2020 presidential candidates commercial break wallace coming up his underdog campaign is getting a big boost from an online fan base begin vdieo clip unidentified female your next president of the united states andrew yang andrew yang d presidential candidate thank you thank you washington d c end video clip wallace andrew yang joins us for a 2020 sit down next commercial break wallace his supporters call themselves the yang gang they chant powerpoint at his rallies and wear ball caps with m a t h on the front for make america think harder joining us now for an exclusive fox news sunday sit down democratic presidential candidate and entrepreneur andrew yang who will be on the debate stage this week mr yang welcome to fox news sunday yang thanks for having me chris it aposs a pleasure to be here wallace let aposs start with the latest fox news poll that came out this week it shows you tied for sixth place with amy klobuchar at 3 percent 30 points behind joe biden but running ahead of cory booker and beto o aposrourke and julian castro so i have kind of a good news bad news question which is why do you think you aposre doing better than a lot of better known politicians and then the other hand how do you ever make the big jump that you still have to make to get into the top tier of candidates yang well on the positive side america unfortunately has lost a lot of confidence in its politicians it aposs one reason why i aposm doing so well i aposm beating many sitting senators and governors the american people realize that our government is way behind the curve in solving the real problems and we need to catch up and speed up and they see someone like me as someone who can help make that possible in terms of making the big jump to catch up to joe biden and the other leaders most americans are just tuning in to who aposs running in 2020 i aposm still introducing myself to the american people it aposs going to be a very very fluid race over the weeks and months to come i aposm very confident i aposm just going to keep on climbing the polls and start catching up to the leaders very soon wallace you say people are just tuning in but if they tuned in to the first democratic debate they didn apost see much of andrew yang you ended up getting i had to get check this out two minutes and 50 seconds total in a two hour debate by far the least amount of time of any of the democrats in the two debates what aposs your plan to get more airtime this week yang well i got asked two questions in two hours which certainly was not enough but we aposre very confident that this wednesday i aposm going to have much much more of an opportunity to make my case to the american people that the real central issue is that we aposre automating away millions of first manufacturing jobs and now retail jobs call center jobs and on and on through the economy and because of the polling support we have i aposm not going to have just next week in detroit i aposm going to have also september in houston and on and on my campaign is going to be here the entire way wallace i want to talk about your policy proposal and automation in a moment but just to get back to the debate one way that is tried and true to get more attention and airtime is to go after the front runners you aposre going to be on the stage on wednesday night with two of the front runners vice president biden and senator harris any thoughts about going after them one because you have differences on issues and two because it will get you more attention yang well my focus is on solving the problems of the american people and to the extent that i can drive the conversation towards those issues i aposm very very excited about it i don apost think that we benefit if i aposm throwing rocks at other candidates when frankly i agree with them on many many issues and i think right now my focus really is on still introducing myself to the american people wallace one of your main messages which you referred to a moment ago is that you say that this country is going through a dramatic economic transformation in large part because of automation and you say that you will keep the promises to working class americans that president trump has failed to keep to them here you are in the first debate begin video clip yang i can build a much broader coalition to beat donald trump it is not left it is not right it is forward and that is where i aposll take the country in 2020 end video clip wallace you propose what you call the american mall act like shopping mall act with a 6 billion fund how would that work yang well we aposre in the process of automating away the most common jobs in the u s economy which includes retail worker call center worker truck driver food service these are the jobs that are disappearing around the country and unfortunately they aposre also the most common jobs so amazon is closing 30 percent of our malls and stores and paying zero in taxes while doing it and these malls become sinkholes they cause blight become havens for crime and bad actions so we need to help communities transition these malls to become community centers or schools or even residential but in the absence of that kind of move these ghost malls become the last place anyone wants to be and they destroy property value for miles around wallace but what you do you do if automation is the problem what do you do to help the worker who has skills for an earlier era transition and get a job in these times yang the first big step is we need to have everyone share in all of the gains from this progress and innovation my flagship proposal of freedom dividend would put 1 000 a month into the hands of every american so that if your mall closes or your job gets blasted away you at least have 12 000 a year that helps take the pressure off and helps you transition in a better better direction wallace but are you basically on your own in other words are you going to provide retraining programs are you basically saying here aposs 12 000 help yourself yang well we certainly need to invest in the retraining of the american people but we also have to be honest that we aposre terrible at retraining the success rates for federally funded retraining programs for the displaced manufacturing workers in the midwest were between zero and 15 percent and pretending that we aposre somehow going to become excellent at retraining americans is lying to the american people i was just at a truck stop in iowa if you went to those truckers and said we aposre going to retrain you to be coders or engineers they would be more likely to punch you in the face then sign up so we need to put the resources directly into our hands the hands of the american people certainly we need to invest in retraining programs but we also have to be realistic about what we can and can apost accomplish wallace ok let aposs talk about some of the concerns about your big program the freedom dividend which is also called ubi universal basic income 1 000 a month to every adult everybody over 18 regardless of whether your jeff bezos or you aposre the guy on the street 12 000 a year yang bezos yes wallace estimates are that your plan would cost about 3 trillion a year and the main way that you would do it you have some other methods but your main way is a value added tax a vat the kind of sales tax they have in europe which is what you say would would pay for this first of all it aposs basically a sales tax which as you know is one of the more regressive ones and secondly independent groups like the tax foundation say and they aposve looked at all of your plans they say that your numbers don apost add up that in fact what you would get from all of this is less than 500 a month per person not 1 000 a month per person yang first the headline cost is much lower than 3 trillion because we aposre already spending over 1 5 trillion on various direct income support programs but if we put a mechanism in place where the american people get a sliver of every amazon transaction and again amazon aposs a trillion dollar tech company that paid zero in taxes last year if we give the american people a sliver of every amazon transaction every google search every facebook ad every robot truck mile we can generate hundreds of billions in new revenue and the great thing is when we put this dividend into your hands this thousand dollars a month where does the money go the money goes right back into local communities and the economy it goes to car repairs and day care and little league sign ups all the things that make us healthier and stronger and would help create millions of jobs around the country wallace but i want to pick up on something you just said well this whatever it is with get pay a million a trillion and a half dollars a year in money transfers that aposs one of the concerns because some conservatives are saying well look if we were giving everybody 12 000 a year we could replace the welfare state so yes everybody aposs going to get the andrew yang freedom dividend but then the conservatives can do away with social programs that a lot of people at the lower end of the income scale depend on yang well my program is universal but it aposs opt in and if you opt in then you aposd be forgoing benefits from certain existing programs and so this to me would be a win win win where you have these resources in the hands of the american people you don apost have restrictions on how people spend it and you also get rid of a lot of the negative incentives because the fact is a lot of these programs give you less if you do better and we have to make it so that if you do better you do better wallace final final question and this is another concern people have look when you work you get more out of it than money you get self esteem you get social interaction there aposs a lot of things and some people are concerned that with your in effect 12 000 a year handout that your delinking income from actually earning a living yang well i aposm asian so you know i love to work but you have to be a little bit broader about how you think about work my wife is at home with our two young boys one of whom has autism what is the market value of her work at right now zero and we know that aposs the opposite of the truth we know the work she aposs doing is among the most challenging and vital work in our society so we need to think bigger about what we mean by work but most americans know that putting a bit of money into your hands is going to make you work harder in many contexts and it aposs certainly not going to take someone who wants to work and say like oh i aposm going to kick back because a thousand dollars a month is not enough to thrive in any environment wallace mr yang thank you thanks for sharing your weekend and your ideas with us and we aposll be tracking how much time you actually get to speak in the debate this week yang thank you chris hopefully i aposll see you in detroit wallace well no you won apost but that aposs a that aposs not a fox debate but we would like to do one thank you wallace coming up house speaker nancy pelosi plays down tensions after a meeting with freshman congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez we aposll discuss the democratic divide when our sunday group returns commercial break begin video clip question what did you mean when you said you aposre not going to be as polite in the next debate joe biden d presidential candidate we aposll see end video clip wallace democratic frontrunner joe biden promising he aposs going to be much tougher on his rivals in this week aposs presidential debates in detroit and we aposre back now with the panel well karl what do you expect from this next round of democratic debates and how do you explain the fact that despite his performance in the first debate which was almost universally panned that joe biden is still leading this democratic field in the latest fox poll this week by better than two to one karl rove contributor yes well he aposs got the biggest name id the biggest reputation the biggest knowledge base and also the attack by harris was was a cheap shot it turned out that they both had the same view that they opposed federal government imposing busing but they accepted local school districts imposing busing so you know that aposs what happened in her situation and they ended up being the same also harris turned out to be a a not so good candidate we aposve now seen her flip flop on is she in favor of the medicare for all getting rid of all personal health insurance are not she aposs been flipping flopping on that she aposs been flipping flopping on a couple of other issues she aposs not very clear so she got a little bit of a bump but she aposs falling back they don apost have a good alternative yet to biden having said that what matters is who aposs got the best ground game in iowa and does somebody seize a moment like barack obama did in 2008 and turn that ground game and the moment into a surprise upset in iowa wallace juan biden will be standing wednesday night between kamala harris on one side and cory booker on the other both of whom have hit him on his record on race given the fact that that support in the african american community is the strongest pillar of his support in the primaries that aposs where he really separates from the rest of the field how hard do you expect them to go after him on wednesday night juan williams political analyst oh it aposs going to be tough i mean he aposs going to it aposs going to be a pincer movement just visually as you describe it look biden lost seven to eight points in most polls after the last debate the big winner was harris i disagree with karl on this i think harris has proven to be a very strong candidate able to move up in the polls move up in terms of fundraising move up in terms of name id people just know who she is given what you just talked about with andrew yang the second thing is that it aposs forced biden to try to shore up his support this week we had an naacp convention in detroit the urban league as in indianapolis biden aposs out there with a new criminal justice plan he aposs gone to south carolina to apologize for saying that he worked with segregationists in the past and the reason for that is the cautionary tale of hillary clinton back in 2008 she had all the big endorsements it looked like she had strong black support and then here comes barack obama who does well enough in iowa he wins iowa in fact and then goes to south carolina which is going to set the parameters for all the southern primaries that follow large black constituencies and obama beat clinton by 29 percentage points in south carolina and goes on to win it all biden doesn apost want to see a repeat of that scene wallace donna where do you see this democratic race at this point going into these debates donna brazile contributor well first of all i aposm very excited night one is going to be the most exciting day for two reasons one we have elizabeth warren and bernie sanders i mean we have a progressive lane that we all know has been congested over the last couple of months and we aposre going to see which of those two have a real good plan for medicare for all and many of the other ending college debt et cetera wallace but wait a minute they say that they aposre friends and they aposre not going to attack each other brazile well they may not attack each other but they they will have to distinguish themselves elizabeth warren has been coming up in the polls she has a plan for everything even a plan for defeating donald trump so i think night one is going to be interesting but you know night two is not just about race and joe biden and his standing night two is also these other candidates who are trying to play catch up they didn apost have enough time as you just heard from andrew yang to introduce themselves night two is going to be also a very good evening for democrats in the country wallace meanwhile nancy pelosi and alexandria ocasio cortez met on friday for half an hour to try to work out their differences there they were afterwards begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif it aposs like you aposre in a family in a family you have your differences but you aposre still a family rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y i aposm looking forward to us continuing our work and as always i think the the speaker respects you know the the fact that we aposre coming together as a party end video clip wallace so ben do you think that it aposs all sweetness and rainbows and lollipops in the democratic caucus and and seriously how much do you think aoc and the other members of the squad the more progressive members threaten pelosi aposs control of the caucus ben domenech the federalist i think it aposs a significant long term threat for the democratic party families can be dysfunctional too and in all sorts of ways and i think in this circumstance you know we saw this week the power of nancy pelosi work in one way you had you know the mueller hearings sort of go down the way that she actually thought it was going to go down a disappointing summer reboot if it was the movie version of the book you had her getting all of her conference together really when it came to this budget deal including aoc at the last minute making the decision to support that but in terms of what aposs going forward with the future looks like for the democratic party the fact is that these young members who have come in have a real message a theory of the case that is a critique of the obama administration that under that they view it as being having taken a route was too pro corporate in lots of different ways of not going down a road differently on health care perhaps that they would have liked to see in that in that case and they aposre very much of a progressive mind set on all these different areas and they aposre not going away they have huge microphones they have a huge following it aposs only going to increase and i think that in the long term this type of of divide within the democratic party could prove difficult when it comes to winning national elections they plan into president trump aposs argument that the democratic party is too radical for the moment so even if you don apost like him even if you don apost like where he is this is what you have to look forward to in a future administration wallace but but what about the argument that nancy pelosi made when she wasn apost being so consolatory hey these are just four congresswomen four votes when they had the big bill about humanitarian aid to the border all they got was their own votes domenech the votes that they have are far less important than their ability to reach out and change the narrative this is what we saw with the tea party as well the fact that they had a certain number of members who were in of this particular mind set was far less important than what they represented the ability to challenge significant statewide politicians and to you know in karl aposs own state of texas knock off someone as powerful as david dewhurst in the case the case of ted cruz sends a message to washington now these are just four members of congress of course this is not the kind of movement that we aposve seem take on nationally but i do think it aposs one that is growing and it aposs going to particularly grow among young left of center voters williams they are best known among republicans according to the polls and why is that because they are convenient foils for republicans to say oh all this democrats are socialists we were just talking about the ongoing race who aposs the leading candidate oh joe biden kamala harris elizabeth warren these aren apost radicals domenech and their agenda but their their brazile and they aposre energizing the party domenech but their agendas are going to end up closer to where aoc and where omar and where these other candidates are than they will to the joe biden of just four years ago brazile but but they have been they have energized the party they aposre helping to redefine the party but they are not the at the leadership table nancy pelosi is still the leader of the democratic party rove yes but they are systematically calling for challenges to democrats it aposs not an accident they aposre challenging the jerry nadler from the left they aposre challenging the chairman of the house ways and means committee from the left and as a result democrats are being pulled to the left how many people would have normally stood up there and said yes i aposm for the green new deal after the goofy piece of document that they laid out talking about cow flatulence how many people would have stood up and said we aposre in favor of some of these other things that they aposre doing they are driving the narrative i agree with ben they their their control is not in numbers it aposs in the voice and the voices is going to get larger because the republicans are going to pay attention to it the media likes it and they have mastered social media to a degree that it really is driving driving a lot of incentive in the party ph wallace what about that argument donna that yes i mean in terms of their effect on the house is limited but in terms of their effect in the national conversation and politics in other words as an inside game the caucus there aposs an outside game twitter followers brazile well look they have a lot of twitter followers but you know what we need people who can move legislation we need people who can move votes they are very good in terms of helping to grow the democratic party but i don apost see them right now setting the narrative for 2020 not yet rove well look nobody knows what the house democrats have done in the way of passing bills but they know lots about aoc and tlaib and omar and pressley in this this element and its only going to get worse brazile and we have president trump and his tweets to also thank for that williams and i think the gop has been broken down by trump i mean the gop is just basically the party of trump behind that i don apost think you can say that about the democrats rove nice dodge nice dodge juan trying to change the subject as cross talk wallace you aposre you aposre all pretty good at that cross talk wallace i want to say i thoroughly enjoyed the last two or 3 minutes i just sat there and watched the panel work thank you panel brazile well chris as a as but as a woman i am so proud of them proud of them wallace see you next sunday as a man i aposm proud of them too up next our power player of the week if there aposs another vacancy on the supreme court he will help fill it commercial break wallace supreme court watchers pay close attention to the days between the court aposs terms watching for any sign a justice may retire as we reported last summer if president trump gets to fill a third court vacancy he aposll almost certainly reach out to our power player of the week begin videotape leonardo leo executive vice president federalist society the job of a judge is to enforce the constitution as it aposs written wallace voice over leonard leo is executive vice president of the federalist society which advances the cause of limited constitutional government in washington he aposs known by a different name wallace on camera you have been called president trump aposs supreme court whisperer how do you plead leo i don apost remember ever whispering and i know he aposs never whispered wallace voice over leo is back in the spotlight any given summer if a justice on the aging supreme court retires at the end of the spring term anthony kennedy retired last summer wallace on camera do you given your role do you think to yourself we aposre headed into the regular season now leo every june we think about that yes absolutely wallace voice over leo has already helped get five justices on the court he organized conservative support for clarence thomas and john roberts and sam alito but his role increased dramatically when candidate trump asked him to draw up a list of potential nominees which included neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh leo what you see in that list of 21 now actually i think 25 is probably the best and brightest you know individuals on the bench donald trump president judge gorsuch has outstanding legal skills a brilliant mind tremendous discipline wallace just days after he took office president trump nominated federal appeals court judge neil gorsuch who was on leo aposs list justice neil gorsuch supreme court i will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the constitution and laws of this great country leo it aposs always been a point of contention for wallace leonard leo has been pushing his originalist philosophy for more than a quarter century the idea that the words of the constitution should be interpreted as they were commonly understood when it was written outside his office there aposs a photograph of the supreme court aposs chambers of justice antonin scalia the prime mover of originalism over the last half century wallace on camera is this the inner sanctum of originalism leo that aposs why it aposs hanging here outside of my office because this is the place this is the originalist temple wallace voice over leo is modest about what his role will be if there aposs another vacancy on the court saying it aposs up to the white house but there aposs little doubt if president trump makes another nomination leo will be at the center of the action and he could not be more committed leo this is really at the core of his legacy you aposre dealing with a fundamental transformation in the federal bench it aposs about as inspiring
