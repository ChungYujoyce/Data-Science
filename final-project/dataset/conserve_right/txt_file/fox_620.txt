to enjoy all the benefits of our website for at least seven decades energy security has made the persian gulf a geopolitical minefield get the new statesman s morning call email under donald trump geopolitics is back with a vengeance for him the united states has enemies and contingent interest based allies in trump s world view more systematically articulated by him than usual in the 2017 us national security strategy his predecessors forgot the hard reality that international politics is a contest for power instead they indulged the vain hope that global commerce and international institutions advance international cooperation deceived they allowed an adversarial china and russia to exploit american weakness now trump promises he will ensure the us wins the competition between the great powers and eliminates would be regional hegemons such as iran for many europeans the prospect of renewed geopolitical conflict is dismaying in an interview last year with the economist emmanuel macron worried that a strategically transactional america leaves europe at the mercy of a bipolar struggle between washington and beijing and whatever trump arbitrarily decides without regard for nato to do in the middle east perhaps worse still the very language of geopolitics represents a defeat for the imaginative idea of the eu as a polity where geography and history are transcended and peace depends on common values not military power in truth however geopolitics never went away even in the 1990s when a heady rhetoric about an emerging universal order and globalisation was commonplace bill clinton might have talked about leaving twentieth century great power territorial politics behind for the march of freedom but he still engaged in a new great power rivalry over the oil and gas discoveries in the caspian sea for the clinton administration how those energy resources should be transported to europe was much more than a matter of global commerce if building a pipeline from baku on the azerbaijan shore through georgia to ceyhan on the turkish mediterranean coast was exorbitantly expensive it was still preferable to caspian oil transiting through russian

geopolitical problems wrought by oil and gas for at least seven decades energy security has made the persian gulf a geopolitical minefield today around a third of all sea borne oil passes through the

that a multinational coalition could under united nations authority force saddam hussein to retreat from kuwait and then protect the iraqi kurds was heralded as the beginning of a new international political era but george hw bush explicitly justified the first iraq war as a geopolitical imperative created by energy the united states imported nearly half the oil it consumed he said in a televised address from the oval office and that rendered saudi arabia s independence a strategic american interest that had to be defended with military force victory for the us then bequeathed a new persian gulf problem that lasted through the 1990s and into the following decade to maintain oil sanctions against saddam hussein s regime the american navy policed the gulf to keep iraq away from the

reliance on iran to protect western energy interests in the persian gulf the carter doctrine declared that any attempt to gain control of the gulf would be treated as an assault on the vital interests of the united states in conception it was directed at the soviet union but first iran and then iraq demonstrated that the more pressing threats would come from actual gulf states in part george w bush s war against iraq in 2003 was an attempt to try to eliminate the military burden this actuality imposed by establishing a friendly regime in baghdad but the iraq invasion and subsequent occupation produced a disaster from which much else has followed in the region not least a stronger iran able to profit several times over from the chaos with trump in power the military stakes have risen he has put sufficient economic pressure on the iranian regime to push tehran to attack in the persian gulf including in june 2019 by shooting down an american drone over the strait of hormuz in response trump hesitated to activate the carter doctrine when he cancelled an air strike on iran ten minutes before it was due to begin with general qasem soleimani s assassination the us has reverted to course trump is trying to concentrate american military commitments in the middle east around the gulf in particular in kuwait saudi arabia bahrain qatar and the united arab emirates this would return american policy largely to what it was prior to the 2003 iraq invasion but trump often talks and tweets as if the world has indeed changed and the united states can thanks to shale oil now escape the carter doctrine these wishful musings are his illusions there is no freedom for the world economy from what happens in the persian gulf especially in a world where china imports nearly half its oil
