permanent a temporary increase in the state income tax to 5 percent the rate is set to drop to 3 75 percent in january he argues that it would be offset by a proposed 500 per homeowner property tax

for being a billionaire and accusing him of planning to cut his own taxes while reducing spending on public schools the governor also has insisted that he doesn t have secret plans to make the income tax increase permanent because his 2015 budget proposal included the higher 5 percent tax rate that he says is necessary to maintain the state s good schools i have the courage to tell people what
