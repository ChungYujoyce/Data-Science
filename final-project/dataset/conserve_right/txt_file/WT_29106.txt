outlets spent monday investigating but the allegation fell apart monday night when kelly issued a statement saying that he was never assaulted and had been set up he said tuesday he wanted to help president donald trump but ended up roped into a jussie smollett esque situation by wohl and burkman who have spread conspiracies and unverified or false allegations against other public figures notably the two staged a news conference last year in which they claimed a woman would accuse special counsel robert mueller of sexual harassment the woman never showed up and has said she was tricked by wohl into participating in the plot which has drawn scrutiny from the fbi wohl s website touts his expertise in media manipulation and notes he has been banned from twitter for spreading false

standing in the race has dramatically risen in recent weeks kelly said that wohl and burkman arranged for him to fly from michigan to baltimore on sunday and then took him to burkman s apartment in arlington virginia kelly said he was under the impression he would spend a few days helping research buttigieg s background and trying to find dirt that might trip him up but after he arrived kelly

sent wohl a message on the encrypted messaging app signal saying that he was incredibly uncomfortable and not on board with the plan but by the time he got out of bed at 11 a m kelly said the post had been published and was spreading across the internet with the help of fake twitter and gmail accounts that wohl had created under kelly s name kelly said he later learned the post had been published

committing heinous acts in the name of protecting our country kelly said they are the real danger to our country wohl denied any wrongdoing tuesday he said that kelly reached out to him and burkman after they sought information about buttigieg on social media and that kelly was very passionate about his claims he said that kelly wrote the medium piece himself and was pressured into recanting after his family was inundated with questions from the media it s not surprising we understand this is very tough for a young person and we wish him the best wohl said in an interview trump 2020
