tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn tired of it all yet the hubbub surrounding efforts to impeach president trump has been called many things including a witch hunt and a circus the process itself also has been very episodic progressing from one cliffhanger to the next as democrats and their strategists huddle together and manufacture the next suggestive scenario complete with talking points and buzz words partisan journalists are more than happy to enhance these efforts which brings us to a cultural moment about the impeachment melodrama it is just that some say this is a lawyered up script it not an actual complaint which this goes to my point this is not an impeachment inquiry it s an impeachment show for television former u s attorney andy mccarthy tells fox news top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century there s no inquiry they never made a vote and all this talk we ve heard about subpoenas there are no subpoenas the democrats wrote a couple of snippy letters which make the preposterous claim that if you don t do everything we say in the letter we re going to cite you for obstruction that s not an enforceable legal document mr mccarthy continues offering a reality check if they were serious about this they would vote on it then they d have an inquiry they would issue subpoenas but they don t want to do that because subpoenas get litigated in court people get to move to quash subpoenas and make legal arguments against them they d have to explain to a federal judge why they haven t voted for impeachment he observes this is not the house of representatives looking for impeachment this is nancy pelosi who has decreed that we have an impeachment inquiry mr mccarthy concludes yes well one democrat also had an observation this week the impending impeachment hearings are they going to be west wing level entertainment or more like c span the hollywood reporter asked democratic presidential hopeful pete buttigieg it s going to be full on house of cards he replied for the lexicon impeachment defense task force never think the gop doesn t rally its forces president trump s reelection campaign has launched a new national volunteer squad to address an obvious issue out of touch democrats are ignoring the will of their voters to pursue a baseless unpopular impeachment witch hunt the democrats refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election and are on a never ending fishing expedition to tear down president trump we need your help in standing up to these members of congress across the nation to stop the madness tell them to end the impeachment inquiry and get back to work for the american people the organizers advise find their pitch at stopthemadness gop prediction trump wins the rust belt president trump is likely to win the rust belt in 2020 writes fletch daniels a columnist for the american thinker during a drive through rural michigan this week he recalled the president s recent speech before the united nations if you want freedom hold on to your sovereignty and if you want peace love your nation the future does not belong to globalists the future belongs to patriots globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders causing them to ignore their own national interests those days are over mr trump told his audience that s a message the democrats don t want america to hear even as democrats failed americans living in the inner city areas politicians from both parties failed the people in these rural towns viewing them as collateral damage in their globalization crusade mr daniels observes suggesting a simple tactic for the gop the problem for the democrats is that trump has a simple but effective message they cannot counter so they fall back on impeach impeach impeach if the republicans stand together the coordinated democrat media and intelligence community attack will fail what the democrats will be left with is the candidate worst positioned to actually win back the states that cost democrats in 2016 at that point history will be on track to repeat the columnist counsels which is of course the reelection of mr trump in just
