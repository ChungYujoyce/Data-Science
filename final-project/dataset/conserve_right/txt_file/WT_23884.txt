tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion in 2016 donald trump overwhelmed 16 qualified republican primary rivals and became the first major party presidential nominee without prior political or military experience against even greater odds mr trump defeated in the general election a far better funded and politically connected hillary clinton what are his chances of repeating that surprising victory in 2020 in 2016 mr trump had no record to run on that blank slate fueled claims that such a political novice could not possibly succeed it also added an element of mystery and excitement with the possibility that an outsider could come into town to clean up the mess top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey president trump now has a record not just promises of course his base supporters and furious opponents have widely different views of the trump economy and foreign policy yet many independents will see successes since 2017 even if some are turned off by mr trump s tweets still if things at home and abroad stay about the same or improve without a war or recession mr trump will likely win enough swing states to repeat his 2016 electoral college victory if however unemployment spikes inflation returns or we get into a war he may not at about the same time in their respective presidencies bill clinton and barack obama had approval ratings similar to mr trump s in president clinton s first midterms democrats lost 14 more house seats than republicans lost last november democrats under president obama lost 23 more seats in his first midterms than republicans lost under mr trump democrats lost eight senate seats in 1994 during mr clinton s first term they lost six senate seats in 2010 during mr obama s first term republicans actually picked up two senate seats last fall yet mr clinton and mr obama handily won re election over respectively bob dole and mitt romney in other words the 2020 election is likely mr trump s to win or lose it s also worth remembering that mr trump does not exist in a vacuum in 2016 many voters preferred mr trump because he was not the unpopular hillary clinton in 2020 there will be an even starker choice mr trump now an incumbent will likely run on the premise that he is the only thing standing between voters and socialism the power of that warning will depend on whether the democrats continue their present hard left trajectory or the eventual democratic nominee manages to avoid getting tagged with what are as of now extreme progressive talking points the green new deal a wealth tax a top marginal income tax rate of 70 percent the abolition of ice the abolition of the electoral college reparations legal infanticide as abortion the cancellation of student debt free college tuition medicare for all and the banning of private insurance plans are not winning 51 percent issues if the democratic nominee embraces most of these fringe advocacies or is forced by the hard left to run on some of them he or she will lose if the democrats nominate sen kamala harris sen elizabeth warren sen bernie sanders or sen cory booker mr trump will seem moderate by comparison and have more relative experience at both presidential campaigning and governance also with a few notable exceptions such as john f kennedy and barack obama senators do not have a good record of winning the presidency if the democrats nominate a veteran politician such as former vice president joe biden then the two rivals will be more equally matched in appealing to the middle classes another thing to consider what will the mueller investigation and a flurry of house investigations of mr trump look like by november 2020 if special counsel robert mueller concludes that there was no collusion between the trump campaign and russia then mr trump s charges of a witch hunt will more than likely stick but if mr mueller s investigation proves that mr trump negotiated with the russians to stop the clinton campaign mr trump will be in considerable trouble at some point all the progressive obsessions to abort the trump administration the efforts to warp the voting of the electoral college electors to invoke the 25th amendment the logan act and the emoluments clause and to thwart mr trump from the inside as former fbi deputy director andrew mccabe and the anonymous new york times editorialist have detailed have to show results if they do not by 2020 then these attempts will be seen more as bitter end vendettas and they may work in mr trump s favor making him appear a victim of an unprecedented and extraconstitutional assault then in nietzschean terms anything that did not end mr trump will only have made him stronger finally mr trump himself is not static for a while relative calm has returned to the white house secretary of state mike pompeo national security adviser john bolton and attorney general william barr are more in sync with mr trump s style and message than the previous holders of those positions mr trump himself often displays more self deprecation like other incumbents mr trump may be becoming savvier about the complexities of the job democrats think 2020 will be an easy win over a controversial and often wounded president republicans thought the same thing in 2012 victor davis hanson a classicist and historian at the hoover
