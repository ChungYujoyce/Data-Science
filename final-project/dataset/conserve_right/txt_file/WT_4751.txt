risk at the white house col vindman was the first to file a complaint against mr trump for his july 25 call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky the iraq war veteran said that in filing the same day action he was not trying to be overtly critical of the president one issue that seemed to unify the white house opposition is rudolph w giuliani mr trump s personal attorney the president assigned him to investigate ukraine s role in the 2016 election and former vice president joseph r biden and son hunter biden s involvement in burisma holdings an oligarch run ukrainian natural gas firm in a series of tv appearances mr giuliani laid out his corruption case against the bidens based on his interviews with ukrainian officials he pushed behind the scenes for ukrainian investigations at a time when the trump administration had suspended military aid to kyiv some trump aides including then national security adviser john r bolton saw the former new york mayor as a loose cannon blowing up sound diplomacy ambassador bolton made it very clear that nobody should be talking to rudy giuliani on our team or anybody else should be ms hill told the house permanent select committee on intelligence and two other joint impeachment committees giuliani was the one that had to be satisfied mr sondland testified house intelligence committee chairman adam b schiff california democrat has been releasing witness transcripts over the past two weeks he is refusing to allow republican called witnesses such as hunter biden to explore why mr trump focused on ukraine s years of rampant corruption democrats argue that mr trump executed a quid pro quo foreign aid in exchange for a biden investigation and should be impeached mr trump denies this and says the white house released transcript of the zelensky call exonerates him two weeks before the call ukraine s then defense chief oleksandr danylyuk came to washington to huddle with trump people about a u s course with mr zelensky and a new parliament ms hill griped that mr sondland had made her life more difficult by giving her cellphone number to foreign officials and telling them to stop by the white house unscheduled on one occasion mr sondland told her that mr trump had made him the point man on ukraine outranking the in country ambassador ambassador sondland i m afraid you know i felt you know as i mentioned before he was driving along on the road ms hill testified you know he d just gone off the road no guardrails no gps i could just go on and on she added ms hill described mr sondland s approach to brussels based diplomacy he was new to the experience i mean he was clearly you know a savvy guy he s charming he s funny he was well meaning i mean a lot of the stories that have been in the press about him paying for things actually i think he was doing that out of generosity he was truly trying to build up morale in his embassy his embassy loved you know the kind of treats and things that he would get for them he was trying to create happy hours she characterized ukraine policy as being isolated in a closed group of two mr sondland and white house acting chief of staff mick mulvaney sondland said repeatedly he was meeting with chief of staff mulvaney she said and that was it it was not going down to the rest of the staff he s my commander in chief ms hill described the july 10 west wing meeting as a disaster mr sondland brought up the need for investigations mr bolton abruptly left the meeting broke up and reconvened downstairs near the ultrasensitive situation room col vindman told the committees on oct 29 that mr sondland specifically brought up the bidens names that day ambassador sondland emphasized the importance that ukraine deliver the investigation into the 2016 elections the bidens and burisma col vindman testified i stated to ambassador sondland that the statements that his statements were inappropriate that the request to investigate the bidens and his son had nothing to do with national security and that such investigations were not something that the nsc was going to get involved in mr sondland said he was mystified by the way other witnesses and the news media depicted the july 10 meeting he testified that he had no memory of bringing up the bidens or an investigation dr hill s testimony was so at least as it was reported was so contrary to any recollection i had i thought i must have slept through something and missed something he told the committees if someone said that a meeting was abruptly terminated and that angry words were used when in fact we had a great meeting we all tweeted about it afterwards and that was that asked by mr schiff whether he brought up the bidens or an investigation mr sondland said i don t remember that no mr sondland said that contrary to ms hill s narration he rarely spoke with mr mulvaney i ve had very very few conversations with mr mulvaney col vindman said that immediately after the july 25 call he bypassed his boss the director of european affairs and went to nsc counsel john a eisenberg to file a complaint against mr trump for mentioning a need for an investigation i mean he s my commander in chief he testified i m not trying to you know be overly critical of the president what i was trying to do in speaking to mr eisenberg was express my concerns about something that i viewed to be problematic rep michael t mccaul texas republican told col vindman that ukraine is riven with corruption he said mr trump had every right to bring up the need for investigations to comply with the defense authorization act it requires the administration to certify that ukraine is taking steps to combat theft of public funds and bribery before u s money can be released if the president brings up corruption in his phone call which i think he s and certainly as the commander in chief should do and when congress has these requirements i guess i m not quite understanding why that s inappropriate mr mccaul said col vindman said i think it s the what i had i guess difficulty with is the fact that he was calling for an investigation not the continuation of an investigation but starting a new investigation because there was not an active one mr mccaul said attorney general william p barr last spring appointed a special investigator to look into the origins of the 2016
