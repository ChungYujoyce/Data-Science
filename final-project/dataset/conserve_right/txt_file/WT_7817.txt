said brad farnsworth vice president of global engagement at the american council on education he recalled the sars crisis in 2002 and 2003 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome that originated in china killed nearly 800 people the whole higher education relationship was not nearly as complex as it is now farnsworth said we have many many more students going in both directions many academic collaborations could be rescheduled if the crisis is resolved quickly but the longer it lasts the deeper the damage will be he added china sends far more students to the united states than any other country more than 369 000 in the last academic year according to the institute of international education the u s typically sends more than 11 000 students to china annually lately the relationship has been strained by visa difficulties trade conflicts and u s concerns about security risks posed by visiting chinese students this doesn t help the current situation which is very tense right now

returned to the u s from hubei province which includes wuhan should report to health officials so they can be monitored he urged the international community to work together to combat the illness

give students and staff more time to return classes had been scheduled to begin on march 2 most chinese students studying in the u s were already in place for classes when the virus emerged but worries about the illness have led many schools to cancel plans to send americans to china for an upcoming semester at the university of arkansas where china has been a popular study abroad destination especially for business students about 60 students who had been planning to travel there beginning in may saw their programs canceled the university made the decision a week ago before students had to make financial commitments and it has been working to arrange opportunities in other parts of the world for the affected students said sarah malloy the university s director of study abroad and international exchange one arkansas student lancaster richmond had been planning to visit beijing and shanghai to fulfill a requirement of her mba program now the 24 year old is planning to visit chile this summer instead i was obviously disappointed but i also understand the university is doing whatever they can in our best interest she said it made my parents a little more comfortable

university of arizona but many universities say they are emphasizing precautions such as frequent hand washing andrew thomas chief clinical officer at ohio state s wexner medical center said the university is monitoring the situation but trying not to be over the top to the point that we re causing more concern and fear than is warranted in the community the university of illinois at urbana champaign which enrolls over 5 500 students from china said some of its students from wuhan who traveled home during winter break opted to self quarantine or wear masks while going to class to protect others several institutions urged anybody returning from china to isolate themselves for two weeks as a precaution at northeastern university graduate student lele luan said that while some fellow chinese students have taken to wearing masks around campus in boston he does not feel the need they told me it s very safe here he said so i don t do anything special to protect myself at the
