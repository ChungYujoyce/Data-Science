and vanity and now look around you the greater strength by far is ours she told the cheering crowd over her shoulder was visible the gold colored marquee of trump international hotel he puts his name in bold on every building he does all of this because he wants you to believe he is strong he is not our president is a coward she said she branded herself the brave candidate and made brave the catchword for her campaign distinguishing herself from what she described as the cowardice fear and hatred of mr trump the truth is brave hasn t always won and brave isn t winning right now brave doesn t spread hate or bully the vulnerable brave doesn t put greed and self interest over millions of lives brave doesn t cower behind lies and walls brave doesn t pit people against one another that
