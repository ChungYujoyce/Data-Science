 and the suggestion that anybody in my team whether the secretary of state our u n ambassador anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we ve lost four of our own governor is offensive barack obama second debate oct 16 fight night at hofstra the two boxers confined within a ring of spectators circling feinting taunting staring each other down come several times by my reckoning no more than one provocation away from actual fisticuffs of the kind that on occasion so delightfully break out in the taiwanese parliament think of it the secret service storming the ring pinning mitt romney to the canvas as candy crowley administers the 10 count the actual outcome was somewhat more pedestrian president obama gained a narrow victory on points as borne out by several flash polls the margin was small paling in comparison to romney s 52 point victory in the first debate at hofstra obama emerged from his previous coma to score enough jabs to outweigh romney s haymaker his dazzling takedown of the obama record when answering a disappointed 2008 obama voter that one answer might account for the fact that in two early flash polls romney beat obama on the economy by 18 points in one poll 31 in the other that being the overriding issue the debate is likely to have minimal effect on the dynamics of the race the one thing obama s performance did do is re energize his demoralized base the media in particular but at a price the rub for obama comes ironically enough out of romney s biggest flub in the debate the libya question that flub kept romney from winning the evening outright but obama s answer has left him a hostage to fortune missed by romney missed by the audience missed by most of the commentariat it was the biggest gaffe of the entire debate cycle substituting unctuousness for argument obama declared himself offended by the suggestion that anyone in his administration including the u n ambassador would mislead the country on libya this bluster unchallenged by romney helped obama slither out of the libya question unscathed unfortunately for obama there is one more debate next week entirely on foreign policy the burning issue will be libya and the scandalous parade of fictions told by this administration to explain away the debacle no one misled his u n ambassador went on not one but five morning shows to spin a confection that the sacking of the consulate and the murder of four americans came from a video motivated demonstration turned ugly people gathered outside the embassy and then it grew very violent and those with extremist ties joined the fray and came with heavy weapons but there was no gathering there were no people there was no fray it was totally quiet outside the facility until terrorists stormed the compound and killed our ambassador and three others the video a complete irrelevance it was a coordinated sophisticated terror attack encouraged if anything by osama bin laden s successor giving orders from pakistan to avenge the death of a libyan jihadist not wishing to admit that we had just been attacked by al qaeda affiliates perhaps answering to the successor of a man on whose grave obama and the democrats have been dancing for months the administration relentlessly advanced the mob video tale to distract from the truth and it wasn t just his minions who misled the nation a week after the attack the president himself asked by david letterman about the ambassador s murder said it started with a video false again romney will be ready monday you are offended by this accusation mr president the country is offended that your press secretary your u n ambassador and you yourself have repeatedly misled the nation about the origin and nature of the benghazi attack the problem wasn t the video the problem was policies for which you say you now accept responsibility then accept it mr president you were asked in the last debate why more security was denied our people in libya despite the fact that they begged for it you never answered that question mr president or will you blame your secretary of state esprit d escalier wit of the staircase is the french term for the devastating riposte that one should have given at dinner but comes up with only on the way out at the bottom of the staircase it s romney s fortune that he s invited to one more dinner if he gets it right this time obama s narrow victory in debate no 2 salvaged by the mock umbrage that anyone could accuse him of misleading will cost him dearly it was a huge gaffe it is indelibly on the record it will prove a very expensive expedient letters charleskrauthammer com read more on this issue from opinions erik wemple cnn applauds candy crowley s debate performance jennifer rubin more evidence of
