apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump offered a cogent reminder about world affairs at the values voters summit on saturday he reminded them about the nature of long term conflicts in the middle east and the toll they take on the u s military and american civilians as well these wars they never end and we have to bring our great soldiers back from the never ending wars mr trump told the audience citing the current disagreement between turkey and syria over a 22 mile stretch of land between the two nations let them have their borders but i don t think that our soldiers should be there for the next 50 years guarding a border between turkey and syria when we can t guard our own borders at home mr trump advised top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state which makes some wonder if securing the border will be yet another endless war for the trump administration to address numbers suggest this could be a possibility the federation for american immigration reform now says there are 14 3 million people living illegally in the u s up 2 million people since 2017 the organization blames it on coordinated surges of migrant crossing our southern border illegally plus obama era policies that expanded the grounds for seeking political asylum and sanctuary policies that shield immigrants who are in the u s illegally from federal enforcement migrants from just about everywhere on earth are crossing the border and staying put without action in washington to secure the border and curb the abuses of our humanitarian policies the dramatic increase in the illegal alien population and the commensurate dramatic increases in costs to u s taxpayers will continue unabated warns dan stein president of the nonpartisan interest group for the lexicon billionaires should not exist yes well this is a new slogan from sen bernard sanders campaign which is using it as a fundraising tool for donations as high as 1 000 and up not a single billionaire has donated to our campaign that s because our political revolution is powered by the working class and when we re in the white house we re going to pass a wealth tax that will finally make the billionaire class pay their fair share the campaign reasons save the date it is a reality check of sorts there really is a presidential election on the way despite shrill inconclusive biased and often erroneous media coverage of the event now we have something tangible to go on the commission on presidential debates has revealed the schedule for 2020 debates all

state hillary clinton and daughter chelsea clinton have a new book out titled the book of gutsy women which lists a hundred women who have inspired them a roster that includes former first lady eleanor roosevelt and former democratic congresswoman bella abzug there are no conservative or libertarian women on the list because they don t embody the identity politics on which clinton s failed campaigns have been based writes american thinker columnist nicholas j kaster to be gutsy according to the clintons is about never giving up and working to pave the way for the next generation with that in mind here are the profiles of five gutsy women who didn t make the list because they don t fit hillary s politically correct narrative mr kaster says listing british prime minister margaret thatcher ambassador clare boothe luce eagle forum founder phyllis schlafly free market icon ayn rand and author laura ingalls wilder there are of course many more women of accomplishment who don t fit the feminist agenda more importantly there are millions of ordinary women who don t aspire to leadership or fame but do the vital work that sustains the nation working and raising families serving their churches volunteering in their communities and homeschooling their children in 2016 hillary had a word for those women deplorables mr kaster concludes partisan political theater white house counsel pat cipollone recently sent a detailed eight page letter to house speaker nancy pelosi regarding the ongoing impeachment inquiry the white house also issued a helpful public statement which translates the legal phrases and cuts to the heart of the matter the president has done nothing wrong and the democrats know it for purely political reasons the democrats have decided their desire to overturn the outcome of the 2016 election allows them to conduct a so called impeachment inquiry that ignores the fundamental rights guaranteed to every american these partisan proceedings are an affront to the constitution as they are being held behind closed doors and deny the president the right to call witnesses to cross examine witnesses to have access to evidence and many other basic rights the statement said the statement summed it up this way in the process they are violating civil liberties and the separation of powers threatening executive branch officials with punishment simply for exercising their constitutional rights and prerogatives all of this violates the constitution the rule of law and every past precedent for these reasons the executive branch cannot be expected to and will not participate in this exercise of partisan political theater poll du jour 84 of republicans would vote for president trump if the gop primary election was today 88 of gop men
