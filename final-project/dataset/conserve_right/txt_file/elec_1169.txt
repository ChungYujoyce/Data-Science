during a tuesday appearance on the view no less than the former director of national intelligence dni james clapper described what was done by the obama administration to donald s trump campaign as spying although clapper said he does not like the word spying considering how the disclosure of this spying has blown up in the obama administration s face who can blame him he still used the word twice because there is no other word sounding rattled and defensive even though he was among friends clapper a left wing partisan who served as dni during the obama administration attempted to spin the spying into something that was for trump s own good and the good of the country with the informant business well the point here is the russians clapper volunteered not spying on the campaign but what are the russians doing and in a sense unfortunately what they were trying to do is protect our political system and protect the campaign view co host joy behar asked trump claims it s spying other people say it s a whistleblower or informant he says it s spying it s bigger than watergate so i ask you was the fbi spying on trump s campaign again describing what happened as spying clapper said the spying was done on the russians not on the trump campaign as i will explain below this is simply not true no they were not clapper replied they were spying on a term i don t particularly like but on what the russians were doing trying to understand were the russians infiltrating trying to gain access trying to gain leverage or influence which is what they do it is fascinating watching the anti trump media attempt to hurl semantics as a means to smear trump as a liar for calling straight up spying spying this social media back and forth between aaron blake an anti trump activist for the far left washington post and fox news s brit hume shows you just how foolish the media are willing to look to pretend the obama administration did not spy on the trump campaign even though that is now a proven fact still no evidence there was a spy in fact we found out this person wasn t implanted in the campaign as previously claimed https t co lbluqehriy aaron blake aaronblake may 23 2018 oh for pete s sake he was acting as an informant for the fbi in a counterintelligence investigation how else to describe him https t co kar6r1vfwv brit hume brithume may 23 2018 informant seems to work pretty well spy by definition requires you to be informing on an enemy which is why trump insists on it https t co a788tpyawx aaron blake aaronblake may 23 2018 nonsense do we spy on the israelis and the british do they spy on us are they enemies brit hume brithume may 23 2018 in utter desperation and while hoping no one would notice the word usually blake foolishly tried to rescue himself with the dictionary merriam webster to watch secretly usually for hostile purposes oxford a person employed by a government or other organization to secretly obtain information on an enemy or competitor collins to watch or observe closely and secretly usually with unfriendly purpose aaron blake aaronblake may 23 2018 aaron stop digging usually for hostile purposes means sometimes not for such purposes and do you really believe this spying was for friendly purposes if so why didn t the fbi warn the campaign of the russian efforts think how different things would be if it had brit hume brithume may 23 2018 if they contacted the campaign for the purpose of warning about possible russian efforts to influence it sure we know that was considered but was not done brit hume brithume may 23 2018 an even more desperate blake then started to throw poop at the wall the fbi did warn the trump campaign per nbc https t co d5fwyr8qo3 aaron blake aaronblake may 23 2018 read that story carefully this was a briefing given both campaigns at the time they were being given access as nominees to classfied information no indication it was the product of fbi info on the specific russian efforts regarding the trump campaign brit hume brithume may 23 2018 what s more blake and clapper attempting to spin idea that the obama administration was spying on the trump campaign for friendly purposes is beyond laughable and we know this was not the case for the reasons hume points out the trump campaign was never informed of this counter intelligence operation for the simple reason that this counter intelligence operation had been launched against trump and his campaign moreover have the media and the intelligence community ever sounded more desperate and dumb as they attempt to convince trump he should be happy his campaign was spied on by the obama administration obama s spying was not altruistic it was the infamous insurance policy there is your motive predictably though the establishment media and their confederates in the deep state are always more than willing to look stupid and petty in service to their precious barry obama but the american people are not going to
