governor and handing donald trump another gubernatorial loss this year in the heart of trump country the moderate edwards cobbled together enough cross party support with his focus on bipartisan state specific issues to defeat republican businessman eddie rispone getting about 51 of the vote coming after a defeat in the kentucky governor s race and sizable losses in virginia s legislative races the louisiana result seems certain to rattle republicans as they head into the 2020 presidential election trump fought to return the seat to the gop making three trips to louisiana to rally against edwards top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches in a victory rally of his own late saturday edwards thanked supporters who danced sang and cheered in celebration while he declared how sweet it is he added and as for the president god bless his heart a phrase often used by genteel southerners to politely deprecate someone tonight the people of louisiana have chosen to chart their own path edwards said trump had made the runoff election between edwards and rispone a test of his own popularity and political prowess heading into the 2020 presidential race on saturday trump went on twitter in a vigorous plug for rispone the president s intense attention motivated not only conservative republicans but also powered a surge in anti trump and black voter turnout that helped edwards as he conceded the race rispone called on supporters to give a round of applause for trump saying that man loves america and he loves louisiana democrats who argue that nominating a moderate presidential candidate is the best approach to beat trump are certain to say louisiana s race bolsters their case edwards a west point graduate opposes gun restrictions signed one of the nation s strictest abortion bans and dismissed the impeachment effort as a distraction still while rispone s loss raises questions about the strength of trump s coattails its relevance to his reelection chances are less clear louisiana is expected to easily back trump next year and edwards views in many ways are out of step with his own party in the final days as polls showed edwards with momentum national republicans beefed up assistance for rispone that wasn t enough to boost the gop contender who wasn t among the top tier candidates republican leaders hoped would challenge edwards as they sought to prove that the democrat s longshot victory in 2015 was a fluke he had ties to unpopular former gov bobby jindal and offered few details about his agenda edwards also proved to be a formidable candidate with a record of achievements working with the majority republican legislature edwards stabilized state finances with a package of tax increases ending the deficit riddled years of jindal new money paid for investments in public colleges and the first statewide teacher raise in a decade edwards expanded louisiana s medicaid program lowering the state s uninsured rate below the national average a bipartisan criminal sentencing law rewrite he championed ended louisiana s tenure as the nation s top jailer rispone the 70 year old owner of a baton rouge industrial contracting company hitched his entire candidacy to trump introducing himself to voters in ads that focused on support for the president in a state trump won by 20 percentage points but the 53 year old edwards a former state lawmaker and former army ranger from rural tangipahoa parish reminded voters that he s a louisiana democrat with political views that sometimes don t match his party s leaders they talk about i m some sort of a radical liberal the people of louisiana know better than that i am squarely in the middle of the political spectrum edwards said that hasn t changed and that s the way we ve been governing rispone said he was like trump describing himself as a conservative outsider whose business acumen would help solve the state s problems we want louisiana to be no 1 in the south when it comes to jobs and opportunity we have to do something different rispone said we can do for louisiana what president trump has done for the nation the president s repeated visits appeared to drive turnout for both candidates tour guide andrea hartman 40 cast her ballot for edwards in new orleans i do not agree with what rispone advocates she said i also don t want trump coming here and telling me who to vote for rispone poured more than 12 million of his own money into the race but he had trouble drawing some of the primary vote that went to republican u s rep ralph abraham after harshly attacking abraham in ads as he sought to reach the runoff we have nothing to be ashamed of we had over 700 000 people in louisiana who really want something better something different rispone said rispone also avoided many traditional public events attended by louisiana gubernatorial candidates and sidestepped questions about his plans he promised tax cuts without saying where he d shrink spending and he pledged a constitutional convention without detailing what he wanted to rewrite both parties spent millions on attack ads and get out the vote work on top of at least 36 million spent
