apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion we all heard former ukraine ambassador william b taylor at the impeachment hearings say as so many do daily that ukraine is on the front line in the conflict with a newly aggressive russia the u s is a vital ally for ukraine and its security we re taught and conversely ukraine is a vital ally for us tucker carlson of fox news wasn t buying it singularly mocking the notion so we need ukraine like a drowning man needs a life ring or more precisely like an alcoholic needs a drink he explained we ve been doing it this way for so long that we are addicted too many careers depend upon keeping our assumptions exactly what they were in the fall of 1977 ukraine isn t vital to american security it s vital to russia s and that s why we re exploiting a rift between neighbors as we like to do more accurately as the entrenched washington that president trump is taking on likes to do pit brother against brother a la dismembered yugoslavia then feign horror at fratricide by the aggressor our designated bad guy top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century but russian security was once in a bout of rationality in the early 90s generally thought to be consistent with ours and something to be preserved after 1991 analysts across the board spoke of a new era of friendship and cooperation against a common global threat something now only mr trump seems capable of uttering radical islamic terror there was a time when we all gave a thought to infidel unity and security against a rising caliphate rather than do the divide part of divide and conquer for it underwriting a coup to replace a moscow friendly government in ukraine would have stumped most americans in the early years after 9 11 but inexplicably this is where we are with added effects such as feigned shock and panic that russia did anything but lie prostrate before the inmates running the asylum had lost the last of their marbles it was widely understood that strong and intact european countries are better for american and international security than dismembered war torn ones divided into smaller less powerful and more penetrable statelets particularly in the midst of a holy war declared on us in the long run it was also better for preserving and spreading our values but defending our values is what president clinton told us we were doing in kosovo in 1999 in an american intervention that has disoriented some of us for the better part of 20 years nato attacking belgrade for responding to domestic terrorism that it had been sweeping under the rug for decades in order to preserve the brotherhood and unity ideal we head scratchers couldn t figure out what america s national interest was there if anything our play seemed to contradict it the smaller more porous statelets we created in the balkans were promptly flooded by wahhabis madrassas sex traffickers and drug runners and gunrunners all having waited on their haunches for the disunited west to activate its stupid button sure enough the domestic terror against which we stayed belgrade s hand didn t stay domestic as we found out when federal investigators flew to albania in the wake of the 9 11 attacks never mind the kosovo albanians and bosnian muslims who have been disproportionately filling up islamic state roles or kosovars like the one who killed american servicemen in frankfurt in 2011 but bound by blood lies we and the albanians became indispensable allies in an oft cited eternal friendship reinforced by mutual bribes and threats more recently there was the 2017 spectacle of nato s oh so momentous admission of vital tiny montenegro another yugo crumb that no american heard of having set disorder in motion the west now needs vital ukraine ok you need to get a pen mr carlson quipped on his show the territorial integrity of ukraine is essential to america s national interest now our own borders mean nothing of course defending them is racist and it s immoral everyone in washington will remind you of it but ukraine s borders and by the way the borders of crimea and donbass wherever those places might be those are vitally important matters and have been george kent tells us for 75 years or so indeed they are all indispensable for poking russia in the eye free world history has no example more barefaced than a distant west siphoning russia s like blooded neighbors one after the other to nato s umbrella this is what s bringing us to the brink of war and that s the opposite of u s security a semantics trick has been played on us an inversion of words like american values american interests aggressors allies and adversaries why is the ukraine vital for u s security for the purpose of encircling russia why are we vital to them for the purpose of encircling russia that s offense not defense there is nothing more unnatural than the borders between the ukraine russia and belarus the late poet yevgeny yevtushenko told a press conference in 1996 at queens college where he was teaching he expressed optimism about the day s news of possible reunification between russia and belarus notice this wasn t taken as russian resurgence i have belorussian blood i have ukrainian blood and i have russian blood where are the borders inside me he asked yevtushenko who wasn t jewish but whose name in the 1960s became synonymous with anti anti semitism is best known for his poem babi yar a ravine not far from kyiv which 30 000 jewish people were machine gunned into by nazis and ukrainian militia in 1942 and which became a grave for 100 000 thirty years later despite being surrounded by several brooklyn bred jewish bodyguards at a new york reading the poet was beaten to the ground by ukrainian nationalists whose parents had been fascist sympathizers in the ussr thankfully there are still some americans with long memories former federal prosecutor andrew mccarthy is one at the height of this month s impeachment hearings he told commentator laura ingraham of fox news the president has a different view of ukraine w e are hearing fantasy about the ukraine that s been built over the last number of years ukraine is pervasively corrupt and there are really troublesome elements in the government that we are funding including neo nazi groups in case anyone doubts that this ukraine russia fixation is a yugoslavia redux recall that we backed against belgrade with training personnel and weapons the wwii unrepentant not so neo nazis of croatia who proceeded to bloodily and pyromaniacally cleanse 300 000 serbs while opening fire on u n peacekeepers who stood in the way much like our somewhat hitler beguiled albanian allies later did under our auspices in kosovo deign to recall that our balkans misadventures were heavily media and democrat driven today we again find ourselves trapped in a debate puppeteered by democrats clawing our way not out but around republicans won t dispute the democrat spawned narrative of ukraine good russia bad so there has been little argument that denying lethal weapons to ukraine was a threat to u s security republicans are stuck protesting only that mr trump delaying the wrong move doesn t rise to the level of impeachment republicans are playing into democrats hands trying to win the skirmishes but losing the war to not go to war we have all been recruited into avenging hillary clinton s 2016 presidential defeat just like we were recruited to bill clinton s philanthropic war to overshadow his philandering if the question is about u s security as we engage in these great power rivalries and pit neighbor against neighbor think of the fact that just as anti semites cheer jewish infighting and the kkk cheers black on black violence the unsleeping enemy takes a break to say good the infidels are fighting julia gorin was a soviet refusenik who came to the u s in 1976 she is editor of hillarisms the unmaking of the first female
