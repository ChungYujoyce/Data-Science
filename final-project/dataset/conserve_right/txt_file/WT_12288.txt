issue is whether the president will avoid all comments and meetings that are likely to upset china or whether the united states will continue the bush administration strategy of seeking a closer

administration s two year program of conciliatory policies toward beijing the pro china group dubbed the kowtow faction by officials close to the debate is fighting to keep out of the president s speech in new delhi next month anything that would upset china that would include any reference to the indian border state of arunachal pradesh that china is claiming as its territory or meetings or references to the exiled tibetan leader the dalai lama or the tibetan government in exile both based in india the visit to india will be a showdown of sorts over as many as 10 national security and defense issues related to india and china the moderates think pro china officials will use the india visit to roll back initiatives launched by president george w bush and defense secretary donald h rumsfeld that are aimed to coaxing india with its history of promoting nonaligned policies into a closer u s policy orbit using the future threat from china as the catalyst the programs being debated in addition to india china territorial dispute and u s support for the dalai lama include should the united states continue to promote india s leadership role in the region amid criticism from china that new delhi is becoming regional hegemon whether the united states should press india to cap its long range missile and nuclear program which china favors whether the president will go to bat for u s aircraft manufacturers and press india to buy up to 150 u s jet fighters worth an estimated 5 billion instead of choosing european warplanes whether to let the u s military continue joint special operations force exercises with indian special forces troops and to continue promoting stepped up indian naval visits to japan guam and other asian ports the soft liners on china favor a presidential visit to india that will make it appear the united states and india have no special strategic relations and specifically that washington is not supporting india in a grand strategy against china the moderates favor continuity with policies that work to help india become a strategic counterweight to china in the years ahead the nations of asia are closely watching the obama visit which begins nov 5 as a sign of u s commitment to regional security every country in asia will be watching closely to see how chinese objections and pressure will be handled by obama said one official most americans have no sensitivity to this at all but asians from japan and south korea to indonesia and vietnam will all be gauging the u s commitment to the region ben rhodes deputy national security adviser for communications william burns undersecretary of state for political affairs and mike froman deputy national security adviser for economic affairs told reporters on wednesday that the president s india visit will focus largely on trade and economic issues mr rhodes said there is no message for china by the administration in the tour of secretary of state hillary rodham clinton who left wednesday for visits to a group of asian nations and mr obama s visit to asia without a stop in china however he said it was not a coincidence that india will be the first stop scheduled on the president s visit asia is a focus as i ve said and we see india as a cornerstone of our engagement with this hugely important region of the world he said on china mr rhodes said we don t feel like there needs to be a choice between a cooperative u s china relationship and these broader relationships that we have in asia as an asian power and a pacific power it s in the interests of the region for the u s to have a cooperative relationship with china on some of these issues but it s similarly in the interests of the region for us to again be very engaged with asean to be deepening our partnership with india and to firm up our alliances with korea and japan he said what china policy fight the obama administration appears stung by the report in inside the ring last week revealing a policy fight over china and a split between pro beijing kowtow officials and a more moderate group described as sad and disappointed at china s failure to cooperate with the united states on all major issues asked about the ring report kurt campbell assistant secretary of state for east asia and the pacific who officials say is part of the sad and disappointed camp told reporters wednesday look all i can tell you in terms of the asian pacific team it is among the most cohesive engaged groups of people i ve ever worked with the team has held very productive discussions on all initiatives that we ve been involved with mr campbell said noting that discussion of this kind of division is wrong is incorrect and i think of myself as quite optimistic generally and open he said and so i would highlight instead a team that is working very hard in a very cohesive fashion together not disunity i think that s totally incorrect jeffrey a bader who was identified as a key figure in the kowtow group of officials who favor orienting all u s policies toward avoiding anything that would upset china told the new york times without addressing the policy dispute that the administration is aiming to effectively counteract the view that the united states is a declining power while china is growing through a policy of renewing american leadership by shifting its asia policy toward developing closer ties to nations in the region mullen on suicides adm mike mullen chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said in a speech wednesday that the military needs to train its soldiers in psychological fitness as a way to stem the growing problem of suicides speaking at the annual association of the u s army convention in washington adm mullen said the head of a task force on suicide prevention in the military has urged military members veterans and their families to attack the stigma of seeking help for psychological problems the military s warriors are also human beings and calling for help to deal with depression and other mental ailments is no different than seeking help for other needs he said adm mullen said the military needs to build up resilience of soldiers in basic training we need to teach soldiers psychological fitness skills just as surely as we teach them to march wear a uniform or fire a weapon he said the comments by the chairman come as the army on wednesday launched a 17 million program to study which suicide prevention programs work best the three year project will look at various aspects of suicide in order to find which methods can be used best to prevent suicides between 2005 and 2009 more than 1 100 u s military members committed suicide we know we re not going to solve the suicide problem in the military with this three year research consortium army col carl castro director of the military operational medicine research program at fort detrick md told the associated press but what we hope to do at the end of this three years is to lay a very solid foundation on which other research can be built don t ask in afghanistan marine corps brig gen joseph osterman commander of task force leatherneck located in the heart of southern helmand province afghanistan told reporters this week that the legal wrangling over the pentagon s don t ask don t tell policy on gays has had no impact on the marines fighting the taliban here down on the ground level here in afghanistan there is no impact at all gen osterman said of a recent federal judge s decision striking down the law and a subsequent appeals court upholding it i think it s safe to say that most of the marines sailors soldiers and airmen that i have underneath my charge really are not that aware of a lot of the dialogue that s going on he said most of the marines fighting in helmand are living in 15 man patrol bases where they re lucky to have some fresh water or some kind of shelter over their head beyond a tent he said gen osterman said the marines are out of touch with the controversy and i also don t know that they necessarily would take it as problematic in terms of the dialogue they understand that as marines we ll follow whatever laws are in place and also whatever policies are promulgated by the secretary of defense he said so really basically we ll follow you know whatever policy is promulgated there and move on gen osterman said the marines in the region are making
