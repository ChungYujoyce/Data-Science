director of having role in deep state here are some of the claims spreading online and the facts you need to know about them claim the centers for disease control and prevention recommends people shave off facial hair to protect against the new coronavirus the facts reports that the cdc published an infographic recommending that men shave their beards to protect against the coronavirus circulated widely as the number of confirmed cases of covid 19 increased to 60 in the u s the cdc did not release this graphic in relation to preventing the new coronavirus nor did the agency recommend that people shave off their facial hair to protect against it the graphic dates to 2017 and depicts the types of facial hair that do and do not work well when wearing filtering facepiece respirators tom skinner a spokesman for the cdc told the ap in an email that the graphic was developed several years ago and is intended for professionals who wear respirators for worker protection cdc does not recommend the routine use of respirators outside of workplace settings in the community in the midst of the new coronavirus outbreak many people began wearing masks to cover their nose and mouth in most cases they are surgical masks as opposed to more advanced respiratory masks surgical masks are loose fitting compared to tight fitting n95 respirators surgical masks also don t fully protect people from inhaling smaller airborne particles unlike respirators which filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles the cdc also notes that when it comes to the new coronavirus people should only wear a face mask if they re experiencing symptoms or are being investigated for possibly having the virus claim everyone should ensure that their mouth and throat is moist and never dry take sips of water every 15 minutes because even if the virus gets into your mouth by drinking water or liquids it will wash the virus down through your esophagus and into your stomach where your stomach acid will kill the virus the facts drinking water prevents dehydration but will not prevent anyone from catching the new coronavirus dr william schaffner an infectious diseases expert at vanderbilt university said the claims are incorrect while medical professionals typically recommend keeping up fluid intake schaffner said drinking more water will not keep anyone from catching the virus we always caution anyone healthy and people who are sick to keep up fluid intake and keep mucus membranes moist he said it makes you feel better there is no clear indication that it directly protects you against complications claim garlic can help cure the new coronavirus the facts there is no evidence that garlic cures the virus while garlic does have antimicrobial properties who said

against ingesting the bleaching agent as news spread about the outbreak social media accounts began promoting the idea that drinking chlorine dioxide or related products with names like miracle mineral solution would help wipe out the virus the fda told the associated press in a statement that they do not recommend ingesting this product we understand people are concerned about the spread of the novel coronavirus and we urge people to talk to their health care provider about treatment options as well as follow advice from other federal agencies about how to prevent the spread of this illness the agency said the fda warns that drinking the product can cause nausea vomiting diarrhea and symptoms of severe dehydration claim surgical masks protect against the new coronavirus the facts medical masks alone cannot protect against being infected with the new coronavirus who advised that the masks should be worn by those showing symptoms of coughing and difficulty breathing so they don t spread disease to others there is no evidence that masks protect people who are not sick claim the new coronavirus can cause 50 percent fibrosis of the lungs the facts false experts say there is no evidence that the new virus causes fibrosis dr robert legare atmar an infectious disease specialist at baylor college of medicine said patients have not been shown to have fibrosis which occurs when lung tissue begins scarring the virus has been known in more serious cases to cause pneumonia severe respiratory syndrome or kidney failure but not fibrosis people who are suffering from coronavirus may see symptoms in as little two to 14 days according to the centers for disease control dr william schaffner an infectious diseases expert at vanderbilt university said he has not seen studies indicating that after patients recover from the new coronavirus they suffer serious lung damage the vast majority of people get better he said claim colloidal silver products can help prevent or protect against the new coronavirus from china the facts the silver solution has no known benefits in the body when it is ingested according to officials with the national center for complementary and integrative health a federal scientific research agency colloidal silver is made up of silver particles suspended in a liquid the liquid solution is often pushed as a miracle solution to boost the immune system and cure diseases experts have long said the solution has no known health benefits and can cause serious side effects the fda has taken action against companies promoting colloidal silver products with misleading claims claim lysol knew of the new coronavirus before the outbreak happened the facts while lysol products have labels that state they disinfect against human coronavirus it is not a specific reference to the new coronavirus that emerged in china in december the current virus is part of a large family of viruses that can range from the common cold to sars a viral respiratory illness that spread to two dozen countries in 2003 before being contained according to lysol s website specific lysol products have demonstrated that they are effective against viruses similar to 2019 ncov on hard non porous surfaces claim symptoms of new coronavirus include vomiting blood the facts in late january a video circulated on facebook with a caption saying that a
