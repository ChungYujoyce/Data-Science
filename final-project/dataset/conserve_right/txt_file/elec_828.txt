source ap photo wilfredo lee twenty democratic presidential candidates will debate tuesday and wednesday night it will be the last time voters will see some of them on a debate stage the democratic national committee s rules for inclusion in early debates the first from nbc in late june in miami and the second from cnn this week in detroit were quite generous if sen michael bennet currently polling at 0 2 percent in the realclearpolitics average of national polls got in both then it s safe to say the rules were not terribly restrictive but that s over after detroit party rules call for new qualification standards for candidates in the next debate scheduled for september in houston candidates will be required to meet a new polling standard and a new donations standard to make it onstage candidates will have to receive two percent or more support in at least four polls which may be national polls or polls in iowa new hampshire south carolina and or nevada according to the dnc the committee went on to list several specifications for the polls themselves to make sure the candidates can cite support in legitimate surveys beyond that the dnc says candidates must show they have received donations from at least 130 000 unique donors plus at least 400 unique donors in at least 20 states together those rules will eliminate a lot of current democratic candidates right now in the realclearpolitics average of national polls just seven candidates are polling at 2 0 percent or higher joe biden elizabeth warren bernie sanders kamala harris pete buttigieg andrew yang and beto o rourke if they stay that way they will be in the september debate that means 13 candidates are below 2 0 percent cory booker amy klobuchar tulsi gabbard julian castro bill de blasio kirsten gillibrand john delaney marianne williamson steve bullock john hickenlooper tim ryan michael bennet and jay inslee two more candidates tom steyer and joe sestak entered the race too late to make the current field a few of those might make it to september by hitting the 2 0 percent mark in an early voting state for example booker is currently at 2 5 percent in the realclearpolitics average of iowa polls so he and perhaps others might make it in on that basis but even if a candidate can scratch his or her way to 2 0 percent they must still meet the donations standard the dnc is clear that candidates have to hit both marks to make it into the later debate the big field has left the first debates open to eccentricity marianne williamson a lecturer on spiritual growth and author of books with titles like a return to love the law of divine compensation and enchanted love has added a touch of well something unusual to the debates andrew yang an entrepreneur whose main platform is a universal monthly income of 1 000 for every u s citizen over the age of 18 is another interesting voice yang might make it to the next stage he is currently at 2 0 percent in the realclearpolitics average only one candidate has dropped out of the democratic race so far rep eric swalwell of california he took part in the first debate but remained at an unmeasurable level in the polls we have to be honest about our own candidacy s viability swalwell said in announcing his departure soon other candidates will have to reach that same level of honesty if they don t make the cut for the september debate they ll be instantly robbed of their only opportunity to reach a nationwide audience and they ll be just as instantly relegated to the category of also ran republicans had a big field 17 candidates in 2016 they too started dropping out early back then the first gop debate was held on aug 6 2015 the second on sept 16 and the third on oct 28 all months before the first primary or caucus votes rick perry dropped out between the first and second debates scott walker dropped out a few days after the second debate bobby jindal dropped out after the third as did later lindsey graham and george pataki now especially because they have an even bigger field than the gop had in 2016 the time is coming for democrats to start dropping out too it will certainly be a disappointment for those candidates who have to face the fact that they never caught fire but it will be a good thing for voters a smaller field will mean they get a better look at each candidate primary contests are about narrowing the field it s time that got started byron york is chief political correspondent for the washington examiner alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
