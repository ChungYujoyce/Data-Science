in the game on camera what does it mean to you to be the first female head doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the nfl wallace voice over all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the united nations general assembly has been called the super bowl of diplomacy and this week president trump goes to new york to join other world leaders there for the first time with plenty of hot spots to discuss what will the president focus on and what action will he seek joining us live here in washington the president aposs national security advisor general h r mcmaster general welcome back to fox news sunday mcmaster thanks chris great to be here wallace as we say president trump speaks to the u n general assembly on tuesday his first time on that stage how important does he think the speech is and how will he fit it into his appeal to world leaders into his doctrine of america first mcmaster well he thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really three things first is to protect the american people the second is to promote american prosperity and the third is really to help promote accountability and sovereignty and in those three things will allow him to communicate his vision for america aposs role in the world but also what his expectations are for international bodies like the united nations but also of other nations the expectation that they are up to protect the sovereignty of their citizens and respect the sovereignty of other nations wallace well let aposs unpack that and let aposs start with issue number one and that of course is north korea the president tweeted about that this morning let aposs put it up on the screen the president said i spoke with president moon of south korea last night asked him excuse me asked him how rocket man is doing long gas lines forming in north korea too bad well before i get to the substance rocket man have you heard that from the president before or is that a new one mcmaster well that aposs a new one and i think maybe for the president but it reminds me of a cover of the economist a few years ago portraying him as rocket man but of course that aposs where the rockets are coming from rockets though we ought to probably not laugh too much about because they do represent a great threat to all to everyone wallace all right but let me mcmaster as secretary tillerson said at the outset it is a global problem wallace let aposs pick up on that here aposs what you had to say on friday begin video clip mcmaster we aposve been kicking the can down the road and we re out of road and so for those who have said and have been commenting about the lack of a military option there is a military option end video clip wallace general what does that mean out of road the fact is you want to get sanctions more time you re not about to go to war mcmaster well really it really depends on how we see this threat continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have we re out of road because in the past the approach taken to the problem of north korea and the kim regime over decades has been to enter into long drawn out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement an agreement that then the north korean regime breaks and what that agreement does though that s particularly dangerous oftentimes what has all the time in the past is locked in the status quo as the new normal and this regime is so close now to threatening the united states and others with a nuclear weapon that we really have to move with a great deal of urgency on sanctions on diplomacy and on preparing if necessary a military option wallace so how do you draw that line how do you decide we aposve reached the point that we have to move to a military option now how long do you get sanctions mcmaster well the president has asked all of us to work on this so we can apost really talk about specific timelines or what conclusions we are coming to but we are working very hard very hard to make everything we are doing militarily diplomatic diplomatically economically and with our allies and partners to be as effective as we can and what we recognize is not really much time wallace all right the administration i want to pick up on one part of that the administration talks about getting tough with north korea aposs trading partners here aposs treasury secretary mnuchin this week begin video clip steven mnuchin treasury secretary we will use economic sanctions to bring north korea to the table bret baier fox news host you re saying stopping trade with china mnuchin stopping trade with anybody nobody would be off the table end video clip wallace but the u s did 648 billion of trade with china they re our single largest supplier for imported goods and our third largest market for export of goods general we re not about to cut off trade with china it would crater our economy mcmaster well this is an indication isn t it of how serious this problem is with north korea and why it aposs in all of our interest to work together to resolve it so of course we china to help as much as they can you know they have a great deal of coercive economic power over north korea and certainly we think and the chinese agree it aposs in their interest to have a denuclearized peninsula wallace but i mean let aposs be serious here we re not going to cut off all trade with china mcmaster well they have to take some steps though that restrict trade in any way that we can with this regime to choke off the resources that allowed this regime to continue to prioritize their military efforts their missile efforts their nuclear efforts over the well being of their own people wallace well let me just pick up on that that one point isn apost it possible in fact isn apost it likely that kim has decided that the key to his survival is to have a nuclear capability he talked this week about having equilibrium with the u s and that there aposs nothing that can be done diplomatically nothing that can be done economically that will stop him from pursuing that effort mcmaster well what he should conclude is the exactly opposite that that continued pursuit of this nuclear capability makes him more and more vulnerable and makes him less and less secure wallace let aposs turn to another subject the president is also going to talk about getting tougher on iran at the united nations but this week he had the opportunity to re impose sanctions that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal he didn apost do that so for all his talk about tearing up the agreement i know he has to recertify in october whether or not they are complying with it all this talk about tearing up the agreement in fact isn apost he going to live with it and try to find other ways to confront iran on other fronts mcmaster well we have to see what live with it means right live with can apost be giving this regime cover to develop a nuclear capability and so a lot of things have to happen immediately rigorous enforcement of that agreement it is under enforced now we know iran has already violated parts of the agreement by wallace but the iaea says that they re complying with it sir mcmaster well the iaea has identified and we aposve identified some of these breaches that iran has then corrected but what does that tell you about iranian behavior they re not just walking up to the line on the agreement they re crossing the line at times so there has to be much more rigorous enforcement of the deal and we have to recognize the fundamental flaws in this deal it is as the president said it is the worst deal it gave all these benefits to the iranian regime upfront and these benefits now they are using to foment this humanitarian catastrophe in the greater middle east this broad range of destructive behavior including support for terrorist organizations like hezbollah support for proxy forces like 80 percent of the affected fighters fighting on the side of the brutal murderous assad regime in syria are iranian proxies and so we have to we have to recognize the broad range of iranian destabilizing behavior and we can apost allow this deal to enable that their missile programs for example the way they are seeding this iranian network with more and more destructive capability that places all their neighbors at risk wallace i want to turn to that next subject which you brought up which is terror the president is going to call at the u n for the world to continue its war on terror here aposs what he had to say this week begin video clip trump we have done better in eight months of my presidency than the previous eight years against isis end video clip wallace but i don apost have to tell you a bomb went off in the london subway this week that aposs the fifth terror attack in great britain just this year and experts say as we succeed and we are succeeding in pushing iraq isis back in iraq shrinking its territory it is only getting them to focus more on launching attacks in europe and the u s mcmaster well the president has told us we have to do three fundamental things very effectively the first is to ensure that these terrorists have no safe havens and support bases that allow them to organize plan and conduct attacks against us and against our allies the second thing is we have to cut off the financing the way that they resource these kinds of operations and the third we have to defeat their evil ideology and this has a lot to do with some of prime minister may aposs top priorities which is to constrict their ability to use the ability to communicate with each other and then of course none of this is a substitute for important law enforcement actions across the world and improving even further our ability to share information and to gain visibility of these terrorist networks and defeat them wallace there is a report this weekend i m sure you read that says that president trump has decided he aposs not going to pull out of the paris climate accord that we may reduce our commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions but he aposs going to live with the agreement stay in the agreement with a reduced commitment is that true sir mcmaster no it s false that aposs a false report the president decided to pull out of the paris accord because it was a bad deal for the american people and because it was a bad deal for the environment it gave the worst polluters the ability to continue polluting and emitting carbon without significantly reducing those levels the president is committed to the cleanest water on earth the cleanest air on earth to an energy policy that reduces carbon emissions but then also provides clean fossil fuels to generate growth in this country and globally and these priorities he felt we could not pursue effectively within this flawed agreement wallace so he aposs out of the paris climate accord mcmaster he aposs out of the paris climate accord what he said the door is open if you look at what he said on the day that he announced withdrawing from the accord he said at some point in the future if there can be if there can be a ideal that addresses these some fundamental flaws crosstalk wallace but the allies said they re not going to renegotiate mcmaster well the president aposs ears are open though if at some point they decide that they can come forward with an agreement that addresses the president aposs very legitimate concerns about paris wallace ok one final area it aposs widely known in washington that you and steve bannon have sharply different views of the world one of the first things you did as national security advisor is kick him out as a regular official member of the nsc he has dismissed you and some of the other advisors on the nsc as globalists he has sharply disagreed with the decision to commit to double down in afghanistan question is the administration better off with steve bannon out of the white house mcmaster well the administration is better off when we can serve the president by integrating coordinating across all of our departments and agencies with our key allies and partners and to present the president with multiple options and then based on his decisions to help the president implement these policies that prioritize protecting and advancing the interests of the american people and so what aposs important is to have an inclusive process not to try to manipulate into a particular decision or to advance your own agenda you know we re advancing the president aposs agenda and we are advancing policies and strategies that are for the american people wallace well you strike is a pretty straight talker are you saying that steve bannon was manipulating that he was trying to work around and advance his own agenda mcmaster well the national security council i think has served the president well in bringing him multiple options there were some who try to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas and that didn apost serve the president well wallace that some people does that include steve bannon sir mcmaster i think this has been too hyped on one individual i mean these reports of feuding this really didn apost even happen i mean we had our doors open to all perspectives within the national security council and it was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that door and permit and participate in an open and transparent process wallace general mcmaster thank you thanks for your time you re a busy guy we covered a lot of ground there in about 12 minutes mcmaster it s always a pleasure chris thank you wallace thank you and we ll be watching the president aposs speech of course on tuesday to the u n sir mcmaster thank you wallace up next we ll talk with two leading senators about the president s move to cut deals with democrats how long will it affect the trump agenda and how long will it last commercial break wallace president trump had dinner with democratic leaders chuck and nancy this week and they seem to have cooked up at least the outline of a deal on immigration that has many of the most devoted trump supporters worried so where do we stand on daca and who aposs driving the agenda now here in washington joining us from chicago dick durbin the senate aposs number two democrat and here in washington republican senator roy blunt well gentlemen let s start with the big question here in washington the most immediate question does president trump have a deal with speaker former speaker pelosi and democratic leader chuck schumer when it comes to daca or not and here s part of what was a shifting conversation on thursday begin video clip trump the wall is going to be built and it will be funded a little bit later schumer it was a very very positive step for the president to commit to daca protections without insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall trump they cannot obstruct the wall the wall to me is vital if i don apost get the wall then we will become the obstruction end video clip wallace senator durbin i want to push on two specific points is there a deal to protect the dreamers without funding for the wall and is there a deal to give the dreamers a path to citizenship sen dick durbin d ill senate minority whip well there aposs a basic understanding chuck schumer and nancy pelosi met with the president thursday night they came to a basic understanding without the details without the obvious negotiations that have to follow and then chuck and nancy said to the president and the white house we are going to put out a press release so it aposs clear on both sides what we aposve agreed to they did exactly that there was great pushback from the right they didn apost like the parameters of this understanding and there has been a lot of conversation since but we are going forward we are going forward with the understanding that we can work with the white house to come up with an agreement that includes daca that includes citizenship for those who are protected under the dream act and also has a substantial commitment to increase border protection those are the two pillars of this understanding wallace and very briefly in this understanding do you believe that the president committed to those pillars over chinese food on wednesday night durbin yes wallace that aposs pretty brief ok senator blunt the president seemed to walk away from at least the citizenship part of this deal later on thursday let aposs take a look at that begin video clip trump we re not talking about amnesty at all we have not talked about amnesty there will be no amnesty we re not talking about that as part of the transaction end video clip wallace so senator helpless clear this up because i mean there aposs genuine confusion here in washington do you believe that there is a deal on these issues and is this something that republican senators could support sen roy blunt r missouri well i think there aposs a desire to come to a conclusion here on both sides and senator durbin just mentioned border security as part of the understanding but the details haven apost been worked out another thing that he mentioned well the details here matter you know it aposs always been three separate questions in my view one is how do you secure the border two is what are the legitimate workforce needs of the country and three what you do with people who came or stayed or in the case of the dreamers were brought to the country illegally i think it would be very shortsighted not to try to do all we can to solve the first problem and the president has unbelievable credibility here if you solve the first problem the other problems i think are reasonably solvable we are seeing that to happen as people want to come together and deal with the issue who of kids who were brought here illegally but you re not going to be able to solve this problem in a satisfactory way unless you give the present at the leeway he needs to be able to some point in the future say the border is now operationally secure that allows everybody to move to solve these other problems in a better way chris wallace but again briefly and i hope you will be as brief as senator durbin is giving them leeway to secure the border does that have to include funding for the wall specifically funding for the wall as opposed to other measures and secondly citizenship for dreamers blunt it appears it would it would not preclude the wall but it doesn apost have to include the wall at this point i don apost think there are a lots of things have to happen to secure the border and should in terms of citizenship does that mean you wouldn apost have to take the test that everybody else takes how long would you have to be here under the dream act ph there are lots of things that can and will be worked out there wallace all right let aposs turn to the bigger issue which is whether or not president trump is forming a new alliance with congressional democrats at the expense of republicans here is what the president had to say about that on air force one begin audio clip trump if the republicans don apost stick together then i m going to have to do more work if they are unable to stick together then i m going to have to get a little help from the democrats and i ve got that i ll tell you end audio clip wallace senator blunt given the failure of senate republicans to pass obamacare repeal and replace isn apost it wise for this president to go to democrats and look for some votes blunt well i think the minority can apost abuse the rules of the senate but under the rules of the senate you have to have some democrats work with you to get most things done the tenures i was either the chief deputy whip for the deputy whip in the house we passed two bills in 10 years that didn t have democrats vote for them that aposs part of the work that s how you get the work done here in a way that allows everything else to move forward so looking for democrats on every bill is a good idea but making it impossible to get your work done because you ve lost your own side is not part of that either wallace senator durbin do you think that there is the potential for a real not permanent but working alliance between president trump and congressional democrats and what you say to those members folks on the left who don apost trust this president and don apost trust making deals with him durbin well of course there will be people on the right and left who will be critical but senator roy blunt and i are good examples of how this can work i have joined him and applauded his leadership in dramatically increasing biomedical research in the united states on a bipartisan basis lamar alexander patty murray joined us two weeks ago schumer and pelosi sat down with the president and the other leaders and said we can help you move immediately for hurricane harvey assistance to have a short term spending bill so the government doesn apost shut down and to extend the debt ceiling of the united states we ll do it on a bipartisan basis mr president that aposs what american wants and the president said i ll take it we did it and we can do more like that as long as we trust one another respect the differences that we obviously do have but try to work toward a goal patty murray and lamar alexander have accomplished more in the last two weeks of strengthening our health care system and moving forward to make the affordable care act more affordable and more transparent than we achieved in seven months of partisan wrangling on the floor of the senate it can be done wallace but there are some differences i mean you talked for instance about nih spending the trump administration wants to cut nih spending and let me talk about another big difference on the hot issue of tax reform the president wants to slash corporate taxes and end the estate tax democrats opposed both the president talks about paying for tax cuts based on assumptions of dramatic growth democrats reject that senator durbin is there a deal given those very sharp differences fundamental differences is there a deal to be made on tax reform durbin chris there will be differences but that aposs what the senate is all about sitting down with democrats and republicans and the republicans are in the majority and really working out an amendment process that comes to a conclusion where both sides have to compromise to some degree that aposs where you get the best legislation and that aposs where you get something the american people can trust jamming something through on one side or the other is just not the way to achieve it we proved that with repeal and replace that did not achieve what america wanted a stronger health care system with more people with insurance coverage and quality insurance policies they can trust wallace senator blunt what are the implications of all this for the 2018 midterm elections you have the president out on the stump recently with north dakota senator heidi heitkamp this is somebody who was a vulnerable democrat one of the prime targets for republicans to knock her off in 2018 the president is saying nice things about her when you add that to the president appearing to compromise on some of his basic campaign pledges couldn apost this hurt republicans in 2018 blunt well on the tax front it s very important we get something done increases take home pay for working families that we re almost into a decade now of very flat opportunities for families with their take home pay a tax bill that increases take home pay and in the future creates better jobs with more take home pay with more pay to start with is where we should be headed we ought to be looking for anybody who wants to be part of that but you know 46 democrats sent a letter to the president that said we d be glad to work with you as long as you don apost do these three things that you think are important parts of the tax package that aposs not a good way to start wallace finally senator blunt and i got about a minute left there was more violent protest in st louis overnight people angry about the acquittal of a white police officer who was charged with murder in the death of a drug black drug suspect i know everyone opposes the violence but even the mayor of st louis said she was appalled by the shooting and appalled by the verdict so what s your reaction to the situation there and the clear anger of a lot of people in the african american community blunt well i talked yesterday to the police chiefs that are involved in what the chiefs are doing i also talked to a number of community leaders and african american pastors i do think this is a place where we have to figure out how to come together you do have to accept what the judge who has the obligation to look at this case determined but at the same time you have to look at what we need to do to bring the community together in ways that both law enforcement and community leaders have been trying to do particularly since ferguson this happened before that happened and we just need to continue to watch this the division in the country whether it aposs st louis or baltimore is not a good thing and we all need to be working hard to make our system work wallace senator blunt senator durbin thank you both we ll stay on top of how all of this work between the president and chuck and nancy plays out in congress thank you all gentlemen coming up we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss president trump aposs new search for votes on both sides of the aisle plus what would you like to ask the panel about the president aposs potential deal to protect dreamers without getting funding for the border wall just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up president trump reaching across the aisle on tax reform suggesting there may be no cuts for the rich begin video clip trump i think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are pretty much where they are end video clip wallace we ll ask our send a panel about the prospect for passing tax reform commercial break begin video clip schumer he likes us he likes me anyway i said mr president you aposre much better off if you can sometimes step right and sometimes step left if you have to step just in one direction you aposre boxed end video clip wallace senate democratic leader chuck schumer caught on a hot mic on the senate floor describing his advice to president trump to deal with both democrats and republicans in congress and it aposs time now for our sunday group former speaker of the house newt gingrich rachael bade who covers congress for politico julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and guy benson of townhall com well mr speaker you worked with bill clinton in the mid 1990s as he wasn apost doing what was called triangulation trying to negotiate apart from both republicans and his own democratic party is that what president trump is doing here and will it work newt gingrich fox news contributor well i think trump is a better dealmaker i think that aposs he wants things to work he wants to get the job done i think the other day he was faced with two visits to houston terrible devastation a hurricane coming to florida and he had the usual partisan infighting for two or three weeks or take a deal and he took a deal and it worked and i think he thought well maybe we aposll do a little more now the challenge will be that the goals of schumer and pelosi and their base are so radically different from trump that the margins for deals may be smaller than people would like but i think it aposs perfectly reasonable i look i advocated for months that they start with infrastructure because it was inherently bipartisan and i think that presidents govern best when they carve a large block out of the opposition party and have a and have a much bigger majority than just their own partisan base wallace julie what are they saying you cover the white house what are they staying at the white house how frustrated are they with republican leaders and particularly their inability to deliver on obamacare repeal and replace and how much hope to they hold given that as i said on a lot of the and the speakers said on a lot of the basic issues what they want in tax reform what they want in immigration that there aposs such big differences how much hope do they hold for a working alliance with the democrats julie pace the associated press well i think you have to put this in context of the relationship that the president has with mcconnell and ryan with mcconnell in particular there aposs just not much of a relationship there so when you come out of something like the obamacare debates and the president sees that mcconnell just can apost get it over the finish line there aposs not a lot of personal bonding there to keep that going so there was a lot of frustration in the white house after that specific debate on the capitol and i think when the president looks at schumer more so than pelosi but schumer in particular you know he sees someone he likes and this is a president who like the personal relationship he likes to have a bond with someone yes there are going to be differences on the policies yes they are not going to be aligned on everything but where he can make an agreement i think he is perfectly fine and he aposs been hearing from people like speaker gingrich and others around him for months that this is actually what he should do that this is an advantage for someone like trump who isn apost particularly ideological who doesn apost have deep roots to the conservative movement or republican ideology wallace so so when it comes to daca does not mean the wall well maybe not citizenship maybe yes pace i think on the wall i mean this is something that you aposve seen the president multiple times when he aposs had a chance to go to the mat over the wall and say i aposm going to hold up a certain piece of legislation i aposm going to veto it over this wall he aposs backed off and i think that for his base that aposs going to continue to be a frustration but he aposs certainly shown a willingness to punt that kick it down the road a little bit wallace we asked you for question for the panel and on this issue of the president making a deal with democrats on daca there was a lot of confusion from you as there has been here in washington let aposs put some of it up fox mulder i love that tweeted this does trump even want to get funding for the wall build that wall got him elected how else will he rally his base and rick conner posted this on facebook how do you think amnesty for these illegals will square with the president aposs campaign promises to the contrary is this just a negotiating ploy to get his agenda through wall and all guy how do you answer them guy benson fox news contributor that aposs what everyone is trying to figure out in this town including i think both senators that you just interviewed a little while ago you know i went back and tried to figure out maybe what would a deal start to look like on daca what would the contours perhaps start to come together with and i think the wall seems to be out at least for this particular piece he says maybe sometime in the future unclear but it seems like ancient history at this point but 2013 there was the gang of eight bill that eventually was killed in the house but democrats agreed in principle to a whole swath of border security and immigration enforcement provisions that i think would probably form the basis for something where trump could potentially somewhat credibly claim a victory and i went back and i looked at some of those provisions 40 billion for border security 20 000 new security agents 700 miles of fencing that aposs a physical border that was in gang of eight agreed to in the so called border surge so there aposs a chance that while the wall might be part of a daca deal there could be something that could be spun as or framed as a wall or a physical barrier wallace and how do you think i mean it aposs crazy to ask you what aposs the base going to do but i aposm going to ask you what do you think the reaction of the real trump hardliners the real base will be if they get a deal on daca that includes citizenship and doesn apost include a wall as it had been commonly thought to exist benson well last week i had a long car ride so i listen to talk radio for about six hours straight and it was really interesting they opened the phone lines and it was trump base voters calling in and there was some trepidation there was some concern about where this might go but overall there was a sense that they trust president trump that they think that he aposs three steps ahead of anyone else and that ultimately he aposs got their interests at heart and that was sort of reflected across the board for most of his supporters so that aposs what i would guess would be the case unless it is egregiously bad wallace rachael from your post covering capitol hill what do you think is the are the prospects for a deal that can be passed on daca and the prospects for a deal on tax reform rachael bade politico you talk to republicans right now they would tell you a slim chance in terms of the white house striking a deal with democrats and getting it over the line while cutting out gop leadership you know you mentioned that a lot of the base still has faith in trump and they see this they say he knows our interests he aposs going to do what is best for us there aposs a totally different feeling on capitol hill with gop leadership i heard a lot of frustration and questioning of what is this strategy what is the end game here basically you know republicans control both houses of congress you know so cutting out leadership is not the smartest thing for the president at this point in time at least republicans will tell you that for instance take the daca deal i was talking to some folks in leadership who were saying that they don apost understand why he took the wall off the table to begin with it aposs the number one bargaining chip they said in terms of negotiating a deal if you aposre going to take it off the table with democrats you should get something for it so they aposre going to try to push him to put that back on the table and sort of use that to get a deal that is possible that conservatives could vote for it wallace and what about tax reform this is i pointed out with the two senators they aposre so different on tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy on whether or not it aposs going to add to the deficit or not unless you put in what they called dynamic scoring and include a lot of the growth that is a guess whether or not it aposs going to happen bade yes i don apost mean to sound alarmist but tax reform is also in trouble right now and it again it goes back to this sort of shift we aposre seeing in the president going from just working to republicans to now wanting to work with democrats for instance republicans on the hill speaker paul ryan mitch mcconnell treasury secretary mnuchin gary cohn they aposve all been writing a republican bill and they aposre about to unveil it last week we saw the president come out and float the idea of increasing taxes on the wealthy which blows in the face of sly side economics and goes against 100 percent against what republicans would want to see in a tax bill so there aposs a fear that he aposs overstepping right now in terms of reaching out to democrats and they aposre concerned that this is going to undercut them and not only a republican base but the president and what he wants to do wallace a quick reactions speaker gingrich i think the most interesting side story was democrats won this big agreement everything was going to end in december the democrats are going to have this huge leverage because the debt ceiling ended in december a few days later mitch mcconnell pointed out that as the majority leader he controlled the paper and they took out the provisions schumer most wanted and wallace which was about extraordinary measures which means that they can keep the debt ceiling going till march gingrich february or march and he said you know i happen to be the majority leader and i control the paper and we did it on my way ph and schumer faced with that reality couldn apost break he couldn apost say no so we aposre a long way this dance is going to continue for a while i think the democrats face the real risk do they really hate the wall more than they love the dreamers because if i were the president that aposs the way i aposd drive it i aposd say these people are so ideological they aposd rather sacrifice the dreamers wallace all right gridlock breaking out here in washington all right panel we have to take a break here when we combat with growing tension between washington and silicon valley powerful internet companies face talk of more government oversight we aposll bring back the panel to discuss congress apos new scrutiny of big tech commercial break begin video clip mark warner d virginia senator i think that we aposre still at the tip of the iceberg the fact is i don apost think facebook has put the resources the time my understanding is they didn apost even go back and check all those accounts to see if they had put out put out other ads end video clip wallace democratic senator mark warner of virginia after facebook admitted it sold 150 000 worth of ads in the 2016 election to groups linked to russia spurring investigations by both congressional committees and special counsel robert mueller and we aposre back now with the panel speaker gingrich how big a development is this and are we beginning to see the end of washington aposs hands off approach to big tech and especially these huge internet companies gingrich yes look i think this is probably four to six years behind the curve these companies are so big they control so much of our lives they can set so many different policies internally with no supervision that having not just the russian angle but really looking at the underlying nature of these companies what they do how they make decisions these are the equivalent of gigantic public utilities and in the information age they have enormous power and i don apost think you in a free society you can apost have power that aposs hidden away in secret controlled by a handful of billionaires wallace well one of the things that mark warner who was a tech guy himself before he went into politics said that it aposs the wild wild west there now some people would say that aposs one of the reasons it succeed are you saying put government clamps on it gingrich no look i think having the wild wild west when companies are small is exactly right several of these companies are so enormous that there aposs some sense of what does it mean to us as a free society to have global corporations run by founding billionaires who are have been in effect totally out of control and who internally can wipe out a company and wipe i mean they can be anti conservative they can be anti liberal they can do all sorts of things and there aposs been almost no supervision just to surface ph the information wallace president rachael president obama and democrats i think you aposd agree generally had a pretty cozy relationship with the big internet companies like facebook like google like amazon is that changing on capitol hill now as the speaker suggested it should and is there a partisan divide in how republicans and democrats see these internet behemoths bade yes absolutely the days of the industry sort of basking in the sunless praise from washington are basically coming to an end right now look for a long time congress had sort of a light touch with the tech industry but now you have democrats who are furious about these russia linked ads that ran in 2016 republicans are worried that google is oppressing conservative voices both sides are concerned about people aposs private information being gathered and what happens if they aposre hacked and so those are all concerns so yes generally republicans control everything right now in washington and they aposre typically anti regulation but it aposs safe to say that this sort of darling industry is now becoming a target as much as anything else wallace and do you have any thought about how you do it when the rubber hits the road how do you allow these companies to grow and prosper but with some guardrails bade i think that aposs the question that the hill is sort of grappling with right now how do they do this but allow an industry to continue to grow that influences everyone aposs life so much look there aposs a test case that aposs going on right now on capitol hill there aposs going to be some hearings coming up in the senate this week to examine whether big websites and tech companies can be held liable for child sex trafficking on the internet right now they cannot be sued if a user were to put illicit content on the internet so the senate is going to look at re examining this the tech industry is putting a lot of money in k street to lobby against this but i think this is an interesting first test right like if if they can apost if they aposre not going to see something as heinous as child sex trafficking as a reason to regulate then it aposs safe to say that big tech still has a lot of power wallace it aposs funny you talk about k street it is amazing which is the big center of lobbying here in washington and there was a chart in the wall street journal that show the lobbying expenditures by these companies has just skyrocketed in the last few years julie where are president trump and his administration on this you talk about utilities speaker gingrich steve bannon used to talk about treating facebook and google as public utilities which meant heavy regulation pace right steve bannon of course now outside the white house so look the at least rhetorically the position of this white house when it comes to big tech is so different from the obama administration which really wrapped its arms around the googles and amazon aposs and facebooks and presented them as examples of american companies that are that are growing strong and are dominating on the global stage trump i think has been turned off a bit by the fact that some of the leaders of these companies are not particularly pleased with his administration and have spoken out on a lot of issues i don apost think you can divorce this conversation when it comes to the white house from that but he aposs also taken on amazon and not just for jeff bezos aposs role in owning the washington post he aposs taken on amazon on his twitter account i think that you are seeing some of this stemming from the president aposs populist message in general as well i mean he looks at wall street and some of the big firms there and i think looks at tech in somewhat of the same way a massive company that can get out of control and he when he looks at his base he can see their frustration with that the frustration of small business owners who see themselves getting taken over by a giant like amazon wallace yes there aposs also this whole question before i get to you guy about the fact that internet companies when they have sales they don apost have to pay taxes but the mom and pop store in the town on main street does have to pay taxes pace and that aposs when you aposve see him go after amazon in particular for he aposs done this in a in a series of tweets i think it will be interesting to see if this comes up in the discussion on the hill on tax reform if we are do end up talking about a big tax reform package wallace that would actually add a lot of revenue wouldn apost it pace yes ph wallace that would really that would get the lobbyists because guy there aposs another aspect of all of this that i want to get to and that aposs growing questions about the culture in silicon valley you had three former female employees of google just file what they hope will be a class action lawsuit charging them with pay and promotion discrimination and as you know there have been a number of complaints and lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in these companies so that wild wild west attitude applies also to the culture in silicon valley benson that aposs right so you aposll have democrats in particular i think focusing on those problems and equal pay and is there discrimination in silicon valley and then you aposll have on the other side as rachael alluded to a lot of conservatives and republicans look at what happened at mozilla a few years ago and brendan eich ousted from that company for having traditional views on marriage and then the firing of that engineer of google is there rampant discrimination in terms of viewpoints against conservatives and how might that play out in terms of average users having information potentially stifled in searches there are real concerns about that on the right so big tech might be waking up these days and saying uh oh we have real problems culturally on the left and the right in this country and that could be a problem for us on capitol hill as lawmakers on both sides rather start to dig in wallace but i want to pick up on something that i asked speaker gingrich because there aposs no question that these companies have been engines of huge economic growth in this country is there a downside to washington obviously there aposs a downside how big a downside is there to washington getting more involved in regulation of the internet benson a huge downside i think some of the concerns that the speaker raised are fair and reasonable and people would agree with them my faith in the ability of government to respond to that wealth to regulation is very low i think it is government is slow moving it is the opposite of innovative and the internet is a miracle and it wouldn apost exist as it does today if the government aposs clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one and i think putting more hand on the neck and applying more pressure from d c i aposm just not sure that works out well wallace fifteen seconds to respond speaker gingrich first of all the internet was created by arpanet a department of defense project second the fact is there are no time in american history when the huge concentrations of power are not directly challenged by government and that aposs overall been good for protecting our liberty wallace all right we aposll continue this debate this is an important subject and we aposll keep talking about it thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the doctor who keeps both the washington redskins and nationals healthy while breaking down barriers in pro sports commercial break wallace the pro football season is now in full swing and as we fans dream of how our team will get to the super bowl we know injuries have a way of derailing those hopes which brings us to our power player of the week begin videotape dr robin west head physician washington redskins in sports medicine people are very highly motivated so they can play to get better wallace orthopedic surgeon robin west has a busy schedule most of the time she aposs the head of inova sports medicine in virginia except when she aposs the lead position for both the washington redskins and the washington nationals wallace on camera what does it mean to you to be the first female head doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the nfl west i don apost even think about it i never it never really crossed my mind i i never think of myself as different wallace voice over we saw for ourselves at a skins exhibition game nose tackle phil taylor went down on a play and west ran on the field she examined him there and back on the sidelines for what turned out to be a season ending tear of his left quadriceps muscle west told us how different injuries are in the two sports west it aposs over use typically in baseball we aposre dealing with a lot of shoulder and elbow injuries in baseball in football it aposs a lot of traumatic injuries high energy injuries that we have to really manage quickly wallace that aposs another difference in baseball an injured player is out of the game but in football west the coaches are in my ear as i aposm examining the kid is he going to play is he going to play i have to decide that pretty quickly wallace but west emphasizes how she makes that decision west i aposm the players apos doctor right so it aposs i want the best for the player so obviously i work for the i don apost work for the team i i want the team to do well but i have to look at the players apos best interests wallace on camera is being a woman an advantage or a disadvantage to doing your job west at least in football a lot of them were raised by their mothers and their grandmothers and so they have they hold women in a very high regard and they come to me and will tell me more information and i they are very trusting i think wallace voice over dr west usually does any reconstructive surgeries but she says psychological outlook is key to getting players back on the field west one of my players today who i operated on last week he said he aposs a mental fortress but yet i have another player who aposs coming to me and saying i aposm just i aposm so depressed i aposm not around my team i and they aposre coming to me and they aposre asking me for help on the mental side wallace growing up west was interested in the human body her mom noticed west when i was five she got me a gray aposs anatomy book for christmas wallace on camera why west that was my present i don apost know i just was fascinated by it wallace now the big concern is brain injuries but she says the nfl has developed a much stricter policy on concussions west i think football aposs the safest it aposs ever been wallace before washington west was an assistant team doctor for the pittsburgh steelers and got two super bowl rings her dream now to win championships in both football and baseball west that aposs our goal right that aposs everyone apos
