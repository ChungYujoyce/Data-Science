news service and others he said during his deposition in the libel case see also deposition in gubarev v buzzfeed but his most momentous meeting was with ken bensinger of buzzfeed in washington during the christmastime holidays he let mr bensinger read the dossier he then stepped away the reporter took cellphone photos they ended up on jan 10 2017 on buzzfeed s website forever changing political history he said he wanted to read them he asked me if he could take photos of them on his i assume it was an iphone mr kramer told the court in a libel case brought against buzzfeed by a russian entrepreneur u s district court in miami unsealed court files thursday marking the first time mr kramer s version of events has become public i asked him not to he said he was a slow reader he wanted to read it mr kramer testified so i said you know i got a phone call to make and i had to go to the bathroom so i ll let you be because i don t read well when people are looking at me breathing down my neck and so i left him to read for 20 30 minutes were you aware that he had taken pictures an attorney asked not until january 10th he answered i was shocked a rattled mr kramer asked mr bensinger to take down the dossier and leave his name out of it mr kramer was identified as the dossier leaker during the libel case s discovery mr kramer said mr steele told him this wasn t supposed to happen this way the wall street journal exposed mr steele as the author sending him into hiding for weeks the mccain aide later amended his testimony in a declaration he said he had no problem with giving buzzfeed a copy and provided copies to other journalists mr kramer said he was pressed by mr steele who compiled the dossier to spread the anti trump information to a variety of reporters mr steele himself was working reporters from london in his attempt to get the fbi to zero in on mr trump before he took office mr steele s 35 page dossier claimed there was an extensive conspiracy between the trump campaign and russian intelligence to interfere in the 2016 election via computer hacking that charge has not been borne out as special counsel robert mueller has not charged any trump related person with colluding with russians to affect the election the dossier became a rally cry by liberals and democrats especially rep adam b schiff of california the top democrat on the house permanent select committee on intelligence and now its chairman he went on to read the unconfirmed dossier charges into the committee record in march 2017 as he vouched for mr steele mr steele was hired by the investigative firm fusion gps with money from the hillary clinton presidential campaign and the democratic national committee republicans believe mr steele s work is a hoax and possibly kremlin disinformation the dossier explicitly cites russian officials as sources for some of its more salacious details democrats rarely refer to the document mr kramer told the story of how he came to own a dossier copy a steele associate andrew wood told him and mr mccain about mr steele s explosive accusations during a conference in canada the next step was for mr kramer to travel to london that fall rendezvous with mr steele read his claims and report back to the senator mr kramer read the dossier at mr steele s home outside london mr steele said the allegations were raw intelligence that needed to be confirmed he said that he had been hired to look into donald trump s dealings in russia and that in the course of doing so he came upon material that indicated that there were close ties between the trump campaign and various russians and the possibility of compromising material on mr trump mr kramer testified he explained that what was produced needed to be corroborated and verified he himself did not feel that he was in a position to vouch for everything that was produced in this he said mr kramer said mr steele disclosed his russian sources to him he didn t disclose them during the deposition by november mr steele sent a secure message to washington that included 16 of the dossier s 17 memos mr mccain then handed the material to then fbi director james b comey by that time the fbi had obtained the information directly from mr steele and from operatives of the clinton campaign mr steele whose mission was to sink the trump campaign and then his presidency believed mr mccain s involvement would give the fbi additional prod to take this seriously mr kramer testified i shared with mr mccain the document and he took some time to review it he asked me what i thought he should do and i suggested that he provide a copy of it to the director of the fbi and the director of the cia mr kramer testified the libel lawsuit was brought by russian businessman aleksej gubarev mr steele accused him of conducting the hacking into democratic party computers a charge the russian denied from the start mr steele said the charge came from unsolicited information and that he tried to verify it on an internet site called cnn ireport mr steele testified that he relied on an article on xbt mr gubarev s firm published on july 28 2009 mr steele was asked by mr gubarev s attorney
