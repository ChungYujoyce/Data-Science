apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic gadhafi s circle western security and intelligence officials monitoring the unfolding events in libya are closely watching libyan foreign minister musa kusa the former libyan intelligence chief and close confidant of libyan leader moammar gadhafi mr kusa is well known to u s intelligence agencies as the mastermind behind the 1988 libyan intelligence operation to bomb pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland killing all 270 people on board he also was the key libyan official who first contacted u s and british intelligence agencies in late 2003 when col gadhafi agreed to give up his nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time a u s official said mr kusa s role may be diminished while musa kusa has served as one of gadhafi s closest advisers for many years there are indications he s not playing a key role in the current crisis the official said robert joseph a former state department and white house national security policymaker in the george w bush administration said he dealt with mr kusa in the operation to dismantle libya s nuclear program i dealt with him when he was head of intelligence mr joseph told inside the ring noting that mr kusa went to school in michigan and is very cosmopolitan in orientation and conceptual in his thinking the moniker he had when he was head of intelligence was the envoy of death which tells you a lot about his character he said mr joseph said mr kusa was someone who could be equally conversant about democracy or islamic fundamentalism he operates on the premise that the way to rule is through brute force and that s certainly being demonstrated in the streets and towns of libya today mr joseph said the libyan official probably has money stashed away outside the country and if things fall apart mr kusa would likely be one of the first people out the door of the regime he said another observer close to the region said mr kusa currently is still a key official who is among the small circle of aides trying to keep the regime together in the face of both political and military defections the thing to watch is what kusa does this person said if he turns against gadhafi it is probably over if he stays with him most likely there will continue to be massive bloodshed the odds of gadhafi surviving internally remain high as long as he has kusa s support china s jasmine revolt pro democracy forces are quietly developing plans for continuous demonstrations to be held every sunday in the hope of triggering mass protests like those now being witnessed in the middle east and north africa initial protests called for 13 cities in china for last week produced several hundred demonstrators in beijing and shanghai in other cities police and undercover security agents outnumbered protesters according to u s government officials china s communist government is bracing for what could eventually develop into the kind of protests with hundreds of thousands of people nationwide calling for democratic political reform younger people in china are calling for this to be our 1989 said one official monitoring the events in june 1989 pro democracy forces took over beijing s tiananmen square and called for political liberalization until the communist rulers called in chinese military forces to brutally suppress the demonstrators the authorities including the ministry of state security china s political secret police and security agency are clamping down on social media and people to try to squelch the anticipated protests and prevent the kind of large scale demonstrations taking place in the middle east among the measures so far are arrests of several organizers and blocking internet postings and text messages related to what is being called the jasmine revolution the unofficial voice for the protests has been the chinese language boxun website which has been hit hardest by official chinese hackers the initial announcement calling for protests urged chinese to take to the streets whether you have a child who suffered from tainted milk whether your house or apartment was unjustly torn down whether you are a veteran who couldn t find a job or a teacher from a privately funded school or laid off worker or one who has tried many times to appeal to higher authorities for justice you may be upset with the son of an official who thought he could get away with crime because of who he is you may have signed the charter 08 you may be a falungong practitioner or you may be a member of the communist party or any other party at this moment you and i both are chinese you and i both still harbor dreams for china and we must take responsibility for our own future and take responsibility for our children s future a chinese official defiantly told reporters in beijing that events in the middle east won t happen in china but reports from china on twitter are hailing recent efforts as a significant start to a renewed democracy movement this is a great beginning of something big and we will continue one chinese language twitter posting said hayden on terror war retired air force gen michael hayden former cia and national security agency director spoke out on wednesday against the obama administration s effort to prosecute cia interrogators and in favor of more efforts to capture and hold terrorists for their intelligence value this is an intelligence driven war gen hayden said during a forum at the american enterprise institute he noted that one of the greatest achievements of american arms was the policy in iraq developed by army gen stanley mcchrystal to use special operations commandos in progressive direct action raids that were held in succession based on intelligence gained from each raid we see that being somewhat repeated i think right now in afghanistan gen hayden said we don t get that in the global war on terror because we don t capture political risk aversion and legal constraints produced our default option against terrorists that is to simply kill them he said killing terrorists is justified under the laws of armed conflict but at the operational level we should at least begin to hold open the possibility of capturing individuals in order to gain intelligence from them because again it s an intelligence driven war he said on the current investigation into cia interrogators gen hayden said i think we should end the current investigation of cia officers that was launched by the attorney general on august of 2009 for cases that were reviewed by career prosecutors and rejected for prosecution 4 years prior to that decision the probe is having a chilling effect on both the action and thinking of current intelligence officers
