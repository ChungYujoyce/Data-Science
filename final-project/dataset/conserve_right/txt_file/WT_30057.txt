tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap in america s deeply divided capital city british ambassador kim darroch was often the bridge he had a direct line to president donald trump s top aides as well as their predecessors from the obama administration and both often found themselves mingling at the same lavish parties darroch hosted at his stately residence in washington he convened discussions on policy and politics with lawmakers journalists and think tank scholars sending dispatches on his conversations across the political spectrum back to london his

administration would inoculate him white house officials were gracious and understanding when the british embassy reached out to alert them to the leak darroch s staff greeted him with applause when he arrived at the embassy on monday morning according to a person with knowledge of the week s events one of several who spoke with the associated press on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss private interactions with the ambassador then trump started tweeting about darroch calling him wacky and a pompous fool and the dynamic began to shift by late tuesday when boris johnson the front runner to become britain s next prime minister pointedly did not defend darroch the ambassador concluded it was no longer tenable for him to stay on the job he announced wednesday morning that he was resigning his position it was a stunning end to darroch s storied career as a diplomat and civil servant and a reminder of how quickly fortunes can rise and fall in trump s washington it s heartbreaking that the president undermines u s diplomacy and erodes our alliances and sir kim was caught in the crossfire said andrew overton an american who served as darroch s spokesman at the embassy until last year darroch joined britain s foreign office in 1976 and held positions in tokyo rome and brussels then served as national security adviser his appointment in washington one of the most sought after diplomatic postings was to be the capstone of his career he arrived in january 2016 when trump still looked like a longshot presidential candidate and a proposal for britain to exit the european union appeared unlikely to pass but the political atmosphere quickly shifted on both sides of the atlantic he took the job at a very different moment said amy english darroch s former congressional foreign policy adviser by november of that year it was a very different role but kim s calm and steady leadership was essential to steer u s u k relations in this tumultuous time although much of washington expected trump to lose to hillary clinton in the 2016 election darroch spent that summer and fall building relationships with the billionaire businessman s friends and advisers he mingled on the floor of the republican convention in cleveland and got to know trump s political advisers and longtime friends including newt gingrich the former house speaker and michael

administration extended beyond social calls he developed a close relationship with former chief of staff john kelly and spoke on a regular basis with current chief of staff mick mulvaney he played a key role in organizing trump s trip to britain earlier this summer a visit that was widely viewed in the white house and in london as a success last month during an interview with darroch at the aspen ideas festival richard haass the president of the council on foreign relations said british ambassadors are often so plugged into american politics that it appeared they had their own seat at the table for key discussions and he praised the british embassy for being one of the very few safe spaces for democrats and republicans to come together in a city that s become increasingly balkanized i actually thought the british ambassador played an important role haass said associated press writer deb riechmann contribute
