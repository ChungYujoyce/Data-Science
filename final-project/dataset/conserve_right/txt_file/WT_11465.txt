million production directed by ann hui is about the scion of an aristocratic family played by lau who belatedly bonds with a longtime servant for the family played by veteran actress deannie yip when i invest in a movie people say aren t you afraid aren t you afraid of losing money these aren t the hottest stars these aren t the biggest productions there are many questions but sometimes i take action because i am moved by the sincerity of the project or the script lau said i really work very hard work very long hours every day to earn my money i do not spend my money foolishly but i think it s worth it when i invest my money in a way that makes me happy he said lau didn t reveal his current per picture salary on monday but director andrew lau no relation once revealed in a tv interview that the actor had charged nearly hk 10 million 1 3 million for the hit 2002 crime thriller infernal affairs lau s fee has likely risen since then given the booming mainland market lau said he was barely spending any time in hong kong these days instead busy belting out his hits for mainland fans and capitalizing on his stardom among entertainment hungry chinese audiences that accounted for a total box office of 1 55 billion last year lau has been the front man for most chinese blockbusters in recent years most recently a remake of the kung fu classic shaolin and the fantasy mystery detective dee and the mystery of the phantom flame it s been a long time since i experienced the atmosphere of shooting in hong kong he said to tse is lau s second recent investment in a hong kong

expanding size of productions on the mainland another hong kong native john woo returned from hollywood several years ago to make the two part historical epic red cliff in mainland china which cost 80 million but what they have in common is uniquely hong kong stories gallants combined a heartwarming and funny story of aging kung fu students staging a comeback with a throwback cast of 1970s and 1980s hong kong movie stars lau s efforts have been warmly received in the hong kong community gallants was the big winner at the recent hong kong film critics society awards clinching best film and

to director hui who helped launch the actor s career when she cast him in her 1982 drama boat people about a japanese reporter who visits postwar vietnam i just think that i admire her principled approach to her work lau said hui is one of the local directors who has sort of fallen by the wayside amid the rise of big budget chinese productions she excels in hong kong set family and domestic dramas that win critical acclaim but struggles to find viewers on the mainland the 64 year old filmmaker joked to reporters monday that her career was nearly over i am more or less done she said as she laughed when a reporter said she was a big fan of hers hui responded it doesn t matter if you say that my box office results are poor i hope the results are better for this movie even though to tse is clearly geared toward a hong kong audience production executives aren t giving up on the mainland market either in a sign of the changing economics of hong kong productions publicists for the

journalists the cultural differences between hong kong and mainland china were also on display lau and yip though fairly fluent in the national dialect of mandarin occasionally dipped into english phrases a legacy of hong kong s colonial rule before searching for the equivalent mandarin term one mainland reporter questioned whether chinese audiences could relate to the relationship between a
