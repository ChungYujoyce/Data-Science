national review the league of morons a key coronavirus question do we want god beauty in babette s feast john wayne the hero we need now why museums should reopen now a strongly worded heterodox view andrew cuomo the other day reminded me how much i miss people watching early on in this quarantine season you would see people describing the introvert s paradise being ushered in first of all don t make assumptions your favorite introvert may very well benefit from a check in and this introvert unexpectedly misses crowds literally one of the last things i would have ever thought i had a fondness for but think for a moment maybe this is your experience too what a day in new york city looks like a midday walk from mass at st patrick s cathedral to national review s offices only a few blocks away off fifth avenue brings constant encounters with all kinds of humanity there are people carrying bags from stores that many of us wouldn t even bother walking into knowing there s nothing we could afford there are people rushing there are counterterrorism police patrolling including in the church there are tourists stopping in the middle of the street to take selfies there is tabby about mid walk who always claims that squashed gluten free fig bars are her favorite when that s all i have to offer from my purse there are men delivering catering for breakfast lots of coffee or lunch whenever you make eye contact it s hard not to realize that this is a person with a biography with concerns and dreams and sacrifices and joy and pain sometimes you can tell the pain is outweighing the joy with others the joy might be contagious even just passing by of course most people are somewhere else under headphones or behind screens pope francis has talked about the epidemic of anesthetization we find something to numb us because we don t know how to handle the drama of life otherwise this is why one of the chief mistakes of this time is not considering religion essential i m not saying we should have st pat s at full capacity but let s make a statement about who we are people whose lives are gifts creations of a creator maybe inadvertently the governor of new york stumbled on all of this during a recent press conference about the slow reopening of things he asked rhetorically how much is a human life worth he continued saying that is the real discussion that no one is admitting openly or freely that we should to me i say the cost of a human life a human life is priceless period although we have stopped so much of our regular activity to protect vulnerable human life what about the inconsistences we are learning about some grave mistakes involving nursing homes and what about the abortion clinics that remain open what about the fact that andrew cuomo only last year expanded legal abortion in new york lighting the freedom tower and the bridge he named after his own father in celebration just last spring he talked about his support for legalizing assisted suicide in the state and even during these coronavirus times new york state became a surrogacy state while we all wish well to anderson cooper a new father by surrogacy a coalition of pro lifers and liberal feminists opposed this move in the empire state pointing to the exploitation of women that legalized surrogacy can make mainstream the sisters of life have their home base in new york and their existence is about giving people confidence that their lives are priceless that every human life is priceless sometimes if we don t believe it about ourselves it s going to be hard to protect it and defend it when times get especially difficult never mind to walk with people the way the sisters of life put it is that you were chosen for life by a creator who loves you and created you in his image and likeness you or i can t convey the pricelessness of life to everyone in the world but we can in our encounters and we can insist on an end to the inconsistencies it s good that people conventionally want pro lifers to be consistent but how about pro choicers too how about an end to the euphemisms for a start during these quarantine times the sisters of life continue to be approached by women including from inside abortion clinics who feel that they don t have a choice that the pressure in their life is too great to go through with their pregnancies this is not health care or freedom they are experiencing it is a miserable culture of death at the very same time we are talking about life let s start connecting some dots here openly and freely thank you governor cuomo for getting the discussion going new york has been dubbed the abortion capital of the world let s make a change for life let s give your words meaning and transformative power jwplayer jwplayer
