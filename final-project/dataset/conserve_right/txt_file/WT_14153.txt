de france champion alberto contador is among the athletes who have tested positive for the drug though he disputes the results claiming he unknowingly ingested the drug by eating tainted filet mignon how much of china s meat supply is tainted with clenbuterol is not clear the government won t say how many cases of contaminated meat or related illness occur every year but industry watchers say that in the countryside at least use of the drug is rampant in a country with an appetite killing roster of food safety issues from deadly infant formula to honey laced with dangerous antimicrobials and eggs dyed with cancer causing pigments the problem of clenbuterol tainted pork is widely considered to be one of china s biggest food threats it s really a big problem in china said pan chenjun a senior industry analyst with rabobank in beijing who focuses on the business of food in china it s not reported frequently so people sometimes think it s not a big issue but actually it s quite widespread mr pan said improved food inspection in big cities like beijing and shanghai have made mass poisonings in urban areas unusual and therefore newsworthy but the problem is rampant in smaller cities and rural areas i think a lot of people living in counties or towns may have a lot of exposure to clenbuterol if they eat street food mr pan said adding clenbuterol to feed can reduce a pig s body fat to a very thin layer and makes butchered skin pinker giving the appearance of fresher meat for a longer time the appealing look is one reason chinese meat suppliers sometimes demand clenbuterol treated pork from pig farmers said wen peng editor of the chinese language version of the pig site an online news aggregator for the global pork industry when it comes to big large farms there isn t much of a problem because they can t afford to be caught but there are a lot of small farms and they have a big market mr wen said and slaughterhouses they prefer their suppliers the producers to use clenbuterol because the meat looks better and more lean the drug lingers in highest concentrations in organs such as liver and lung and poisonings appear more frequent in south china where organ meat is more popular in february 2009 70 people were hospitalized in the southern city of guangzhou with stomach pains and diarrhea after eating tainted pig organs sold in a local market in 2006 more than 300 people in shanghai were sickened by pig products last year 13 people in the coastal city of shenzhen near hong kong were hospitalized from eating clenbuterol tainted snake local media said the snake had been fed frogs that were given clenbuterol apparently to make them grow faster though chinese regulations against lean meat powder are tough including prison terms for those who produce or sell tainted food products enforcement is spotty and offenders can often get off with a fine or a bribe mr wen said government officials too have expressed frustration with the lingering problem in a report to china s congress on aug 25 2009 wang yunlong the head of the legislative committee on agriculture and rural affairs told his fellow lawmakers that efforts to stop the use of lean meat powder had fallen short in many areas and called for a concentrated countrywide effort to bring it under control china s ministry of agriculture did not respond to a faxed list of questions about the problem and measures being taken to deal with it the majority of poisoning cases in the news have involved pork which is by far china s most popular meat nearly 50 million metric tons of pork are produced and consumed per year amounting to about half the global supply the world s second largest pork producer the united states harvested 118 million pigs in 2008 the same year china produced 463 million and output is growing the sprawling industry is in the midst of a huge transformation from mostly backyard farms a few years ago to increasingly large and medium sized facilities a shift that should make it easier to monitor for illicit feed additives like clenbuterol in 2001 74 percent of china s pig farms were tiny with 50 pigs or fewer but today more than half are medium sized facilities with up to 3 000 animals a recent rabobank report said but larger farms are no guarantee of quality in beijing s southern district of daxing an unlicensed farm with about 800 pigs lies hidden behind a metal gate on a recent afternoon a woman inside was stirring a large vat of what looked like mud bones and garbage but said it wasn t for the pigs it s for us she said the man in charge who would only give his surname xu said he d never heard of lean meat powder he said the farm had no phone number business name or card farmers use clenbuterol because it boosts profits in two ways it speeds up the growth of animals to get them to market quicker
