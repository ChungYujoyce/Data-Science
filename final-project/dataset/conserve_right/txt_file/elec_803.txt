national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge attention journalists of america time is running out you have under three weeks left to publish your last batch of over the top pre election puff pieces on texas democrat cross country liberal sensation wing and a prayer senate candidate beto o rourke it is here that we must face the difficult truth barring a gop related disaster of some sort o rourke he of that ineffable cool factor and special sauce at least according to easily impressed columnists at the washington post is likely to lose big according to the latest polls senator ted cruz leads him by anywhere between seven and nine points tuesday s debate between the two meanwhile was so mismatched that o rourke s best moment might have involved a random deer in the headlights story in which he described how he got to meet this blind squirrel who is slowly regaining its sight in summary this year s betomania a somewhat weird phenomenon as we ll explore in a bit seems set to disappear from view just as quickly as it arrived at least in the lone star state on one hand this possibility warms my heart given that in my neck of texas it has grown rather exasperating to have to wade through 15 000 blaring beto yard signs when i m simply trying to get a breakfast taco or four on the other hand i also feel a tinge of melancholy and regret about all of this given that i never got my act together enough to print ironic t shirts with the following brilliant slogan i made up all by myself you beto vote for ted cruz anyway back to the matter at hand i d like to further discuss the debate between o rourke and ted cruz and also actual policy issues and also perhaps the fact that many people in politics seem to be slowly going insane but first can we talk about how embarrassing betomania is friends i am deeply concerned for our culture when you look at a middle aged establishment politician as an icon of rock star cool you re doing something wrong skateboarding beto o rourke shreds whataburger parking lot read an actual recent headline on the website of the dallas morning news this all sounds really rad and sick and gnarly and whatever until you actually watch the video which features o rourke gently coasting around the parking lot soccer dad style looking precariously close to biting the dust when he gives a bystander a high five don t get mad i m not judging i would do exactly the same thing except i d probably actually fall but no wide eyed journalist would write a headline claiming that i shredded anything nor credulously act like i belonged on the cover of thrasher magazine jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist https cdn jwplayer com v2 playlists

percentage of the betomaniacs i have met in texas moved here after fleeing places ruined by beto s favored policies these locales are often expensive increasingly dysfunctional wildly overregulated sometimes mystifyingly poop ridden despite being wildly overregulated here s looking at you san francisco and inevitably run by democrats why does no one seem to make this connection i don t know one hero in austin has taken to posting stickers around town featuring an image of a giant locust paired with the following text i migrated to a thriving texas from a leftist nightmare and now i m voting for beto for senate the posters feature a word much worse than nightmare which i m not reprinting because i run a pg 13 column here but heather you might be thinking surely you must have seen the countless articles in national publications describing how annoying ted cruz is and how beto o rourke is going to lead our generation in rising up above the terrible cynicism that dominates modern politics acting as a bridge uniting and respecting the diverse voices of texans as long as you join in lockstep support for things like abortion on demand higher taxes and a list of leftist hobbyhorses that drive out of state donors wild why yes thanks i have read those articles i laugh every time i used to think that o rourke didn t even really want to win if he did after all wouldn t he at least pretend to be even a teensy bit more moderate but tuesday s debate disabused me of that notion judging by the slightly panicked facial expression that emerged from time to time he really does want to win as an aside i don t know which jokester at the tv station made o rourke stand in front of an image of multiple oil rigs relentlessly pumping while cruz pummeled him for supporting a massive gas tax but sir or madam here s to you alas now that times have gotten tough after months of nice guy rise above the fray narratives mean beto has finally emerged on tuesday he whipped out trump s old lyin ted nickname for cruz and his campaign has launched a series of attack ads claiming cruz is engaged in selling paranoia and fear well politics is politics meanwhile thanks to the enduring power of betomania even a loss this fall might be a win for o rourke beto o rourke matters even if he loses a headline at bloomberg recently declared o rourke defies gravity argued the ringer comparisons to barack obama flow freely and the presidential speculation grows will beto o rourke become president asked a column at texas monthly back in august it might help if he loses to ted cruz stay tuned america we live in interesting times anything can happen and betomaniacs if o rourke does indeed lose don t fret he ll undoubtedly be back and beto than ever okay okay i ll stop i m sorry i blame the unending sea of yard signs they could probably crack the best of us get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
