apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic tensions between china and almost all of its maritime neighbors are at a historic high as a result of sovereignty and maritime rights disputes in the latest dustup china is now facing off against its only main ally and presumptive strategic partner in the region russia maritime and naval authorities in russia dispatched a large patrol ship july 16 that chased a group of intruding chinese fishermen who were inside russia s exclusive economic zone near vladivostok the russians captured by force 17 chinese fishermen and one is missing and presumed

journey in the eastern chinese province of shandong some 1 000 miles away according to both russian and chinese press reports the russian patrol ship the 3 600 ton dzerzhinsky named after feliks dzerzhinsky the notorious bolshevik and founder of the kgb spotted a fishing ship flying a chinese flag in russia s eez the ship then sent a series of inquiries and asked the chinese for answers failing to get any response the dzerzhinsky chased the ship an encounter that lasted three hours the chinese ship refused to stop and instead began making erratic zigzag maneuvers that resulted in a collision with the dzerzhinsky the impact of the crash sent one chinese fisherman into the air and into the sea a search by the dzerzhinsky failed to find him after the crash the chinese fishing vessel continued to evade the dzerzhinsky and the russians fired at the vessel s stern with its ak630 deck guns hitting it numerous times the gunshots immobilized the chinese vessel and the russians boarded it and arrested all 17 remaining chinese fishermen illegal fishing by chinese fishermen is a long standing problem for russia the day before the july 16 shootout another chinese fishing vessel was captured by the russians in the same area last year 75 chinese fishermen were arrested by russian authorities on the russian side of the amur and the usuri rivers in 2010 some 17 chinese fishing vessels were captured and detained for illegal fishing in 2009 a chinese vessel carrying smuggled goods was sunk near vladivostok by russian border guards killing seven chinese sailors china s regional confrontations were triggered by a large scale and seemingly unchecked chinese fishing fleet that has run up against all its maritime neighbors including japan south korea north korea vietnam and the philippines china s official response was immediate but measured the top russian envoy in beijing was called in for a procedural protest the foreign ministry in beijing which is normally quick to condemn all sorts of international conspiracies against china issued a cautious statement promising to contact russian authorities to find out more about the incident the normally jingoistic and anti western official newspaper global times however published an editorial july 18 that criticized moscow s enforcement of the law through violence on the other hand there were reports in official chinese news media that said the fishermen from shandong province may be punished upon their release and repatriation for having caused the high profile incident at an inopportune time the reaction shows that apparently china can ill afford to upset its key strategic partner in moscow too much former u s ambassador in taiwan on chinese democracy taiwan and the united states share common values

dialogue with the chinese communist regime in fact the beijing government never reciprocated mr huntsman s pro engagement stance according to official statements the chinese government distrusted mr huntsman and seized on one statement he casually made last november during a debate in iowa about the power of china s internet the comment caused the beijing government to castigate him as a person who is ultimately persona non grata in china unable to engage china despite his ability to speak chinese mr huntsman apparently is now warming up his relations with democratic taiwan miles yu s column
