don t tell him you re from north korea ok the telling scene comes early in the journals of musan a dark and brooding south korean movie that has won international acclaim for its portrayal of the struggles faced by refugees from communist north korea in the capitalist and as depicted in the film often heartless south the movie opened in seoul last week raised in an impoverished totalitarian state many north koreans lack the education financial resources and personal connections to compete in the south one of asia s richest countries in turn they complain of discrimination in the job market top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed park jung bum the 36 year old director of the journals of musan is part of a young generation of filmmakers inspired by their plight the movie whose honors include a feature film award at this year s film festival in rotterdam is loosely based on the experience of his late friend chun seung chul who came from the north in 2002 and died of stomach cancer a few years later park also incorporated stories about other north koreans he knows into the main character the director a shy and thoughtful man who also plays the leading role becomes animated when talking about his north korean friends my big question was this they came here to be happy but if they have to stay in the bottom class in south korea was there any meaning for them to come all the way here he said in an interview north korean characters have long featured in movies here often as the evil enemy but a growing population of escapees living on the margin has given filmmakers and south koreans generally a new view of their brethren from the north the number of north koreans in the south has grown from about 1 000 in 1998 to 20 000 today mostly as a result of a famine in the 1990s that killed some 1 million people the journey often takes years with escapees sneaking into china and then making their way to southeast asia en route to the south film critic park yoo hee a research professor at korea university described movies such as the journals of musan as a turning point in how filmmakers approach north korea the escapees are now seen as an internal south korean issue rather than fantasized characters from someplace far removed north koreans are no longer abstract distant characters south koreans fear or sympathize with they are part of the reality in south korea and these films show such changing perceptions and attitudes she said the journals of musan is shot with a shaky hand held camera against a blighted background often circling an empty unpaved lot near the fictional chun s apartment which is slated for demolition park said the real chun s life was full of difficulty he had no marketable skills he initially couldn t read english signs which are common in south korea he couldn t keep up at school and park wrote practically all of chun s papers at the university they attended he couldn t afford equipment to play ice hockey he didn t have tools to compete with us here in south korea park said although the two koreas share thousands of years of common history they have grown sharply apart politically economically culturally and even linguistically since they split into two nations more than six decades ago park was motivated to make this film because he was angry at the way chun was treated in the film he made chun a relatively positive person into a darker character to dramatize the challenges and injustice he faced the fictional chun keeps his jacket on indoors as if cold follows him wherever he goes he stares at the ground hiding his eyes behind curtain like bangs his only friend besides a north korean roommate is a stray dog he adopts the film deals little with chun s past other than a scene in which he tells a south korean church audience that he fled north korea because he was hungry so hungry that he killed a friend over food bringing home the corn and leaving the body lying outside park s film is part of a second evolution in the cinema s treatment of north koreans from the end of the 1950 53 korean war until the late 1990s films largely depicted northerners as evil or victims in part that was enforced by censorship which began under south korea s former military dictatorship and continued through the first decade of democracy the first change came with the emergence of the sunshine policy of embracing north korea under president kim dae jung a former dissident who took office early in 1998 a box office hit that year swiri depicted a female north korean assassin who falls in love with a south korean intelligence officer for the south korean audience then seeing a north korean character with conflicting emotions was refreshing said park yoo hee the film critic until the mid 1990s for more than three decades it was impossible for such films to pass government censorship heartwarming melodramas followed such as joint security area in 2000 and welcome to dongmakgol in 2005 in which north koreans were no longer the bitter enemy but respectful even endearing objects of love and friendship president lee myung bak has taken a harder line on north korea than his two liberal predecessors since he took office in 2008 some south korean directors meanwhile have shifted their focus to the lives of the refugees in crossing a 2009 film based on a true story a north korean sneaks into china to buy medicine for his sick wife when the wife dies he hires a broker to bring his son out but the son dies
