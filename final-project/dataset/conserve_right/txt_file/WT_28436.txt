angered many asian americans when he reportedly mocked the accents of two asian heads of state by terry tang associated press when amanda berg heard reports that president donald trump mocked the accents of the leaders of south korea and japan at a recent fundraiser it brought back painful memories from her childhood berg a korean american who grew up in fort collins colorado recalled kids doing the stereotypical pulling at the eyes and the mocking accent it made her feel like she was a foreigner in her own community berg a registered democrat is among a growing and crucial bloc of asian american voters leaning further to the left in the age of trump and his stunt reported by the new york post angered her and many others it empowers people who would be predisposed to doing that kind of thing anyway said berg a high school english teacher in denver and it makes it acceptable to be openly increasingly discriminating trump has used racist rhetoric to fire up his conservative base ahead of the 2020 election most notably against four democratic congresswomen of color telling them to go back to their home countries triggered widespread outcry last month but his reported mocking of asian accents garnered a more tepid reaction some worry the frequency of trump s racially offensive remarks makes them easier to shrug off a concern that could weigh on an asian american voting group that s only growing in power the asian american voting age population has more than doubled in the past two decades leaping from 4 3 million in 1998 to 11 1 million in 2018 according to the u s census bureau a majority of those new voters lean democratic by 2016 some asian ethnic groups that had leaned republican shifted into the democratic camp said natalie masuoka an associate professor of political science and asian american studies at the university of california los angeles a larger share of asian american republicans voted for john mccain in 2008 than for trump in 2016

americans who are strongly anti communist as many are in vietnamese communities some data also suggests that a large proportion of filipinos and wealthy higher educated chinese americans are more likely to go republican masuoka said there is no solid answer for why but religion is one often cited reason she added but it may be hard for some to look past trump s reported words he s willing to use asian stereotypes asian accents in his public speeches masuoka said in that way the way americans are talking about race is now shifting possibly back to what historically was effective before the civil rights revolution explicit and sometimes offensive talk about race the new york post reported that trump imitated south korea president moon jae in and japanese prime minister shinzo abe both close u s allies at a fundraiser in the hamptons this month trump used a fake accent to boast about moon relenting in negotiations over the costs of u s military aid to south korea and when rehashing talks with abe had about trade tariffs according to the newspaper trump has imitated asian people before at an august 2015 campaign rally in iowa he talked about his ability to deal with asian negotiators and used broken english saying when these people walk into the room they say we want deal in the past such comments have led to outrage in 1995 then new york sen alfonse d amato used a faux japanese accent when discussing o j simpson trial judge lance ito who is japanese american in a radio interview the republican senator s apology was criticized at the time by the asian american defense and education legal fund it was a time where even though we were very offended by the remarks we thought it might make a difference to ask for an apology but with president trump one doesn t
