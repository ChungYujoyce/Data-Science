senate where president trump is all but guaranteed an acquittal the house is set to vote wednesday on a resolution to transmit the two articles of impeachment against mr trump to the senate ending a nearly four week delay during which mrs pelosi attempted to dictate rules for the trial the upper chamber is expected to begin the trial tuesday with a standard set of rules preferred by senate

elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed democrats hope to put pressure on senate republicans particularly those from swing states facing reelection in november to back demands for additional witness testimony at the trial the prevailing wisdom on capitol hill however is that impeachment as an election issue will backfire on mrs pelosi whose democrats won the majority in 2018 taking by picking up seats in trump strongholds impeachment has turned into a nightmare for the folks who have been pushing it said sen mike braun indiana republican who unseated a democrat in 2018 nothing has gotten better for pelosi battleground polling last month in pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin showed a boost in support for the president as impeachment proceedings heated up in the house and there s been a slight decline in public support for the senate to convict and remove mr trump from office according to a real clear politics average of national polls on the senate floor tuesday mr mcconnell blasted senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat for demanding a decision on witnesses in pretrial negotiations mr mcconnell pointed to what he called a revealing admission from mr schumer that the debate over witness testimony was a play to pick up seats in november the senate democratic leader recently said that as long as he can try to use the trial process to hurt some republicans reelection chances it s a win win that s what this is all about he said the democratic leader just laid it right out there in case anybody had any doubt forget about the fate of the presidency forget about the constitution as long as the process helps democrats political fortunes our colleague calls it a win win mr mcconnell added earlier in the week mr schumer acknowledged two thirds of the senate likely won t vote to convict and remove the president pursuing witnesses and documents makes us better off no matter the outcome it s a win win mr schumer said according to the new york times house majority leader steny h hoyer maryland democrat bristled when reporters asked him if his party was turning impeachment into a plank of its 2020 campaign platform no this was not a campaign tactic he snapped asking for fairness is not a campaign tactic senate democrats need at least four republicans to vote with them to get the 51 votes needed to call a witness they are eyeing four witnesses close to the president including acting chief of staff mick mulvaney and former national security adviser john bolton sen susan collins of maine and sen cory gardner of colorado are two moderate republicans up for re election who said they are willing to consider calling witnesses sen mitt romney of utah and sen lisa murkowski of alaska are two more republicans who haven t closed the door to hearing from more witnesses neither is up for reelection this year house democratic leaders insisted their side is winning the impeachment debate we ll see what happens in the senate but i think there s been substantial movement that s a good thing said democratic caucus chairman hakeem jeffries of new york we still need to hear from individuals like martha mcsally joni ernst as well as cory gardner of course amongst several others lamar alexander there any number of individuals who hopefully decency will prevail mr alexander of tennessee is retiring ms ernst of iowa and ms mcsally of arizona are up for re election recent polling suggests an overwhelming number of americans would like to hear from mr bolton during the trial a quinnipiac poll released this week showed 66 percent of respondents were eager to hear from the former national security adviser mr mcconnell has said he has enough votes to agree to the same rules and procedures that were used for president bill clinton s impeachment trial in 1999 during that trial the house impeachment managers presented their arguments and the president s legal team responded senators then were able to ask written questions to both sides before the issue of calling more witnesses was debated an administration official said white house counsel pat cipollone will lead the president s defense team mr cipollone will be assisted by personal trump attorney jay sekulow chief counsel at the american center for law justice white house deputy counsels michael purpura and patrick philbin are expected to assist mr cipollone in the trial mr trump reportedly also has expressed an interest in harvard law professor alan dershowitz participating in his defense mr dershowitz did not return requests for comment tuesday the house democrats impeachment managers are expected to be named wednesday rank and file democrats were careful not to get ahead of mrs pelosi s announcement of who and how many managers will be selected however two lawmakers at the top of the list of likely managers are house intelligence chairman adam schiff of california and judiciary chairman jerry nadler of new york the house impeached mr trump in a party line vote dec 18 charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of congress the two articles of impeachment stem from a july 25 phone call with the ukrainian president in which mr trump requested a probe of a political rival former vice president joseph r biden mrs pelosi held on to the articles for about a month demanding the republican controlled chamber hold a fair trial and echoing mr schumer s calls for more witnesses the nearly four week impasse did not yield the democrats any assurances on whether or not mr mcconnell s chamber will hear more testimony dave boyer and tom howell j
