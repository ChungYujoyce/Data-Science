president plots his reelection campaign he replaces chief of staff mick mulvaney with a key ally congressman mark meadows we aposll ask our sunday panel about the west wing shake up and our power player of the week a former rocket scientist shares her love of stem as the head of the girl scouts unidentified female we want to make sure that girls have those skills to not just be users of technology but the creators inventors and designers wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington we aposre following two big stories today first the continuing spread of the coronavirus the u s now has more than 400 confirmed cases 19 deaths and six states declaring emergencies meanwhile the democratic race is down to bernie sanders and joe biden we are just two days away from another round of primaries six states including michigan the first big rust belt state to vote in a minute we aposll speak with senator sanders as he prepares to go head to head against biden for the first time but first let aposs bring in kevin corke reporting from the president aposs retreat at mar a lago with the latest on the coronavirus kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris overnight we learned that a marine who recently returned from overseas this marine is now in virginia has tested positive for the virus he aposs actually being treated at a hospital there just the latest example of the continuing spread of the disease both here at home and abroad begin videotape corke from the white house to the centers for disease control in atlanta an all hands response by the trump administration meant to reassure americans that its strategy to contain the coronavirus is working trump we aposre the only country in that sense that aposs proactive we aposre totally proactive and we aposre totally equipped to handle it thank you very much everybody corke but the white house aposs preparedness is being both tested and questioned critics argue that the administration hasn apost adequately produced testing material to detect the true scope of the virus which has now spread to dozens of states and the district of columbia causing events like the annual south by southwest gathering in texas to be canceled and california officials to delay docking privileges for the virus affected grand princess cruise ship globally the outbreak has sent shockwaves from china where a hospital meant to house the infirm collapsed yesterday to italy where 16 million people have now been placed under quarantine back at the white house a staff shake up capped a turbulent week as the president tweeted he aposll replace acting chief of staff mick mulvaney with retiring north carolina congressman mark meadows a staunch supporter of the president end videotape corke on capitol hill tomorrow the house is set to set up a special center to prepare infrastructure for possible telework as capitol hill becomes the latest front in the fight chris wallace kevin corke reporting for mar a lago kevin thanks we aposll have more on the coronavirus later in the program but first back to politics and joining us from the campaign trail in michigan democratic presidential candidate and senator bernie sanders senator since super tuesday you aposve been going after joe biden pretty hard on a number of issues take a look begin clip sanders one of us in this race led the opposition for the war in iraq one of us led the opposition to disastrous trade agreements one of us has spent his entire life fighting against cuts in social security end clip wallace senator now that this is a two man race and you aposre going to have a two man debate next sunday how hard do you go after joe biden without carving each other up and helping donald trump win reelections sanders well chris that aposs the right question joe biden is a friend of mine joe biden is a decent guy what joe has said is if i win the nomination he aposll be there for me and i have said if he wins the nomination i aposll be there for him because we both recognize that we have a president who is a pathological liar and i say that without any joy in my heart as somebody who aposs running a corrupt the administration somebody apparently who has never read the constitution of the united states and thinks he aposs above the law so biden and i no matter who wins this thing will be together in defeating trump but now that it is a two way race it is important for the voters of this country to ask themselves two questions number one which candidate is stronger in terms of being able to defeat trump and number two what are the differences in a record joe has been in washington for a long time as have i and my point is when people see the records joe voted for the war in iraq i opposed the war in iraq joe voted for the wall street bailout i vigorously opposed the wall street bailout when you go to the midwest we aposre in michigan right now you go to wisconsin you got to pennsylvania people want to know about your views on trade because disastrous trade agreements like nafta and pntr with china cost this country over 4 million good paying jobs decimated communities here in michigan i helped lead the oppositions of those trade agreements joe voted for them wallace senator joe biden is also going after you and here he is on who is better able to help working americans take a look begin clip biden now let aposs go to michigan bernie we aposll see if that aposs true i aposm the guy that helped bailout the automobile industry what did you do old buddy come on end clip wallace he says you got big plans he gets results sanders well i think in terms of results when you support the disastrous war in iraq when you support the wall street bailout when you support terrible trade agreements wallace well how about the but how about the auto bailout sir sanders well the auto bailout was done by the obama administration and it was a step forward but i think sometimes joe is taking a little bit of credit as vice president for initiatives that were led by president obama and by many members of the congress wallace let aposs take a look at the practical politics here the big prize on tuesday or the biggest prize is michigan with 125 delegates you scored a major upset win there in 2016 against hillary clinton sanders yes wallace but on super tuesday you lost to biden among what many people would think would be your base white working class voters in a number of states and biden taunted you on your lack of support among some other groups here he is begin video clip biden it aposs is ridiculous bernie you got beaten by overwhelming support i have from the african american community bernie you got beaten because of suburban women bernie end video clip wallace if you were to lose in the first industrial midwest state to vote michigan on tuesday how serious is that how damaging and would you consider dropping out sanders well no i certainly would not consider dropping out you know chris media asks you is this state or that state life or death i was asked that at iowa i was asked that in new hampshire we won california the largest state in this country we are winning among latino voters big time we are winning among young people you know when you talk about the future of this country or the future of the democratic party one might want to look where young people are at and what young people are saying is that we have got to move aggressively to make sure that health care is a right for all young people want to raise that minimum wage to at least 15 an hour young people want us to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure build the affordable housing that we need and by the way young people understand that we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality we have three people or more wealth in the bottom half of america they want changes they aposre concerned about climate change they aposre concerned about racism and sexism so i think if you look at the general electorate you look at the future of this country i think you aposve got a lot of energy behind this just yesterday chris just yesterday didn apost get a lot of media attention for whatever reason we have the rally in grand park in chicago we had 15 000 people out so i aposm feeling good about the momentum that we have i think we aposre going to do well on tuesday and i think we aposre going to beat biden wallace beat biden in michigan sanders yes i do yes i think the polling you know last time around as you indicated it was seen as a big upset wallace right sanders because polling has down literally by 20 points one day before the election wallace ok you talked in your last answer about income inequality and i want to press down on that with you here aposs something that you said last fall i don apost think billionaires should exist first of all a few billionaires let aposs talk about bill gates steve jobs jeff bezos have created more than a million jobs probably more than a million extra in terms of fallout as it as it goes from their companies and created trillions of dollars of wealth why should they share in the wealth that they create which is helping not just them but has helped a lot of americans sanders chris i have nothing personal against any billionaire but when you are looking at an economy and an economy today where the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92 percent where over the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen a 21 trillion increase in their wealth while the bottom half of america has actually seen a decline where real wages have potentially been stagnant for the last 45 years workers in america not making a nickel more in real dollars than they did 45 years ago when you got a half a million people sleeping out on the streets of america tonight homeless when the very very rich are getting richer when you aposve got half of our people living paycheck to paycheck 87 million people uninsured or underinsured 45 million people dealing with student debt young people can apost afford to go to college i aposm in michigan now go to detroit you aposve got a school district there which is inadequately funded with wallace but sanders so we aposve got to get our priorities right that aposs what we have to do crosstalk wallace let me two questions first of all let aposs just take the case of bill gates he created a whole new way for people to get information to discuss to communicate with each other huge increase in the way we live now sanders yes wallace it aposs unimaginable not to have microsoft and the various things that are created one sanders he deserves great credit for that chris i applaud him crosstalk wallace so let me just say this one he aposs created a great economy he aposs giving away billions of dollars some could argue that he aposs done a lot more with his wealth than any politician would and my sanders chris chris wallace which is one question and the other is how far would you go as a democratic socialist in terms of worker control of businesses sanders good well two questions no one is denigrating the achievements of bill gates or anybody else but we have to look at culturally what aposs going on do people like the walton family for example that owns wal mart they aposre worth well over 100 billion when their workers are marking 11 or 12 an hour no one is denigrating people who have made significant achievements but enough really is enough does mike bloomberg really need 65 billion to see his wealth increase by 15 billion in the last crosstalk sanders couple of years crosstalk wallace what do you about worker control sanders well in terms of worker control i believe it is important to put workers on the boards of directors of major corporations and i aposll tell you why when you do that corporations are not going to be so quick to shutdown in america and move to china move to mexico and to move to other low wage countries i want working people to say you know what i aposm in a job my ideas matter i aposm just not a cog in a machine and in vermont by the way and in states all over this country where you have enterprises where workers do have significant input into what goes on absenteeism goes down productivity goes up democracy to me means not just voting every four years having a bit of a say in the job that you aposre working at wallace i got sanders i like that argument wallace i aposve got two more questions i want to try to squeeze in here sir there aposs been a lot of talk recently about your support for certain aspects and i emphasize that aspects of castro aposs cuba there aposs a story that came out this week that back in 2014 you were part of a congressional delegation that went to cuba and that you met with an american political prisoner there named alan gross and he says this is the conversation the two of you had begin audio clip alan gross united states government contractor he said quote i don apost know what aposs so wrong with this country how could he be so insensitive to make that remark to a political hostage me end audio clip wallace senator did you say that to an american sanders no i did not crosstalk wallace political prisoner in cuba sanders i remember that trip i remember that trip very well and i remember the terrible conditions that mr gross lived in his teeth were rotting i did not make that statement why mr gross is saying that i have no idea but i did not make that statement wallace look cuba is an authoritarian country saudi arabia is an authoritarian country and chris if you check my record i happen to be maybe old fashioned not like donald trump i don apost think putin is a nice guy i don apost think kim jong un of north korea is a nice guy i speak out for democracy all over the world whether it is in cuba whether it aposs in saudi arabia whether it aposs in russia wherever it is wallace finally there was a fascinating profile of you in the new york times i don apost know if you got a chance to read it yesterday it said that when you aposre in hotels you want a room which is far away from the ice machines and the elevators which i have to tell you i think is perfectly sensible it also said that you want your room to be at 60 degrees and the question i have sir is when you aposre on the road do you hang meat in your room laughter sanders i aposll tell you you know maybe if having lived in vermont for the last 50 years i just don apost sleep well when the room gets very very warm and my poor wife has been having to deal with that for decades now so i you know and sometimes in hotels in the night they turn off the air conditioning and it gets pretty hot and i don apost sleep and we aposre on the road a whole lot but i do like i have to confess i admit it i do like cold rooms wallace and and in 15 seconds it also said that you like to watch old boxing matches on tv who aposs your favorite fighter sir sanders i would go with muhammad ali who was not only a great fighter one of the great heavyweight champs of all time but he was just an extraordinary human being and was probably the most loved athlete of his time wallace think he could have beaten joe louis ph sanders yes i do wallace senator sanders thank you thanks for sanders you asked wallace incidentally joe louis was from michigan you aposre going to be in trouble on that one sanders and by the way i know i just met it turns out that chokwe lumumba who aposs the who is the mayor of jackson mississippi is campaigning for me in michigan it turns out his relations his family is related directly to joe louis whose real name was joseph barrow barrow aposs family here in michigan wallace that aposs true you got you got some some political repair work to do this afternoon senator thank you thanks for your time on this busy weekend safe travels on the campaign trail sir sanders thank you very much chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss what aposs at stake tuesday plus president trump aposs new chief of staff commercial break begin video clip biden we are very much alive cheers and applause biden and make no mistake about it this campaign will send it donald trump packing this campaign is taking off join us end video clip wallace well what a difference a week makes a reenergized joe biden as the results from super tuesday put him back in the lead for the democratic nomination and it aposs time now for our sunday group cofounder of the federalist ben domenech fox news political analyst juan williams former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and jason riley of the wall street journal well congresswoman where is the democratic race now how solid is biden aposs position as the front runner and is it possible for bernie sanders to flip the script one more time donna edwards former democratic congresswoman well look coming out of super tuesday biden could not have had a better night i mean he swept a ton of 14 states he aposs in a very solid position looks like he is pulling together the democratic coalition it aposs going to be needed to beat donald trump in november but i think it is still a race to the finish and it is possible that there could be some catch up but biden is in a very solid strong position going into the coming tuesday races wallace and we should point out that just this morning kamala harris the senator from california former presidential candidate has now endorsed joe biden jason we aposve been down this road before last summer biden was unbeatable then warren was in the lead i mean if we had talked a week ago certainly ten days ago we would aposve been saying that can anybody stop bernie sanders and now it aposs joe biden so one how do you see the race and do you think there aposs a possibility that were going to see some more twists and turns jason riley fox news contributor we could i think biden aposs lead is real but i don apost think he can get too comfortable i think that he aposs benefited from a couple things one is that democrats i think took a lesson from what happened to republicans in 2016 and you saw pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar and even beto o aposrourke down in texas turnaround and indoors an alternative to i aposm sorry they got out of the race and they turned around and they endorsed biden and that is something that republicans of course did not do back in 2016 when it came to endorsing an alternative to donald trump i also think that biden has benefited from bernie sanders underperforming this cycle to the extent that he did four years ago yes he is doing better with young voters but they are a smaller percentage of the voting public right now than they were four years ago we talk about how trump benefited from and say clinton senate stomach sentiment four years ago but so did clinton in the primary there was a lot of anti hillary sentiment going on last time bernie benefited from that that aposs out there this time you aposre seeing him suffer because of it wallace well there is another big political story want to get too that is that friday night president trump announced there you see them on the screen he is replacing mick mulvaney as white house chief of staff with his fourth chief of staff and a little over three years congressman mark meadows of north carolina ben why the switch and what you think it says about the president aposs strategy as he prepares in earnest to go into the 2020 election campaign ben domenech the federalist the president had reportedly soured on mick mulvaney as his chief of staff months ago this is something that he wanted to do much earlier but the impeachment process as it was playing out really didn apost allow him to do that now we get someone who is really kind of a story of the republican party in terms of mark meadows someone who is the founder of the freedom caucus a very ideological conservative someone who even reportedly was reluctant to go to the convention in 2016 because he didn apost know if he wanted to be there supporting donald trump now he is someone who is as loyal as you can be and was a fierce advocate for him on this network and others during the impeachment process meadows is someone who i think is just a signal to conservatives that trump knows who he is close to he aposs going to stick by them and he aposs going to make that case to his republican base going forward in what he views to be a base election where he has a lot of things that he can say and advocate for for reasons as to why he should be returned to the white house ph wallace juan the president reportedly told a group of donors on friday night that mark meadows is going to be his jim baker the very well regarded first chief of staff to ronald reagan you and i both covered the reagan white house do you think this president really wants a jim baker juan williams fox news political analyst no because i mean jim baker first of all jim baker was respected across the political a consensus builder and someone who is a student of government machinery in terms of the way government works so he had a deep appreciation of the government aposs ability to serve the american people mark meadows is known as of firebrand what you just heard he aposs the fire of the freedom caucus but he aposs also a guy who has mocked up government remember they the shutdown in 2013 that was freedom caucus that was mark meadows and he has a distaste for how government actually operates to contrary he thinks the government is a problem and has gone after bureaucrats and government workers so it aposs the exact opposite i think it aposs a base play i think it says to people who are strong trump partisans we aposve got our guy right next to the president and i think there was fading confidence in mick mulvaney especially after that press conference when he talked about quid pro quos and the like but secondly i think there was a low density was in charge well the president is now after impeachment calling in and pushing at people who he things aren apost disloyal but calling in terms of loyalists you know hope is coming back and he is making a play right now to consolidate before the election wallace jason your thoughts on the meadows appointment and the continued people in this white house riley i aposm actually reluctant to read too much into the meadows appointment i think that you know the chief of staff traditionally has been a manager or a gatekeeper to the oval office i don apost think trump quite views is in that role i think he sees the chief of staff is another aide and he aposs looking for someone who aposs going to be a fighter for him particularly in the media and be loyal to him i think mark meadows checks both of those boxes and he aposll do fine wallace congresswoman edwards i mean i agree i do think that the choice of meadows is actually a signal to people that there could be coming out as a spokesperson a little bit more disciplined i think than mulvaney had and thereby the confidence of the president but changing another chief of staff frankly is not going to make a difference for this president the president really is his own chief of staff and mark meadows may be a fill in but this is really about donald trump wallace well let aposs hope he aposs actually makes it to the election he aposs not a fill in to that sort of time panel we have to take a break here we aposll see you a little later when we come back the spread of the coronavirus across the world and here in the u s we aposll discuss the response with dr anthony fauci the nation aposs top expert on infectious disease commercial break wallace coming up the president defends his ministrations handling of the coronavirus and downplays concerns testing kits were in short supply begin video clip trump they have the test and the tests are beautiful anybody that needs a test gets a test end video clip wallace we aposll ask dr anthony fauci about demands for screening and other public health fears commercial break wallace as americans brace for the medical and economic impacts of the coronavirus u s officials are trying to encourage preparedness without setting off a panic joining us now dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases doctor welcome back to fox news sunday dr anthony fauci director national institute of allergy and infectious diseases good to be with you chris wallace what aposs the latest on the spread of the coronavirus across the country and the number of deaths here fauci well we aposre having obviously an acceleration of cases now if you look at it every day we get more and more we have somewhere around 350 350 probably going to be close to 400 if it isn apost already there we have at least 18 deaths and they keep coming on every day that goes by what we aposre seeing is what what is called community spread in certain regions of the country particularly in the area of washington state seattle yes wallace so italy just announced that it is going to lock down an entire region of northern italy that includes milan and venice with a quarter of the population millions of people nobody aposs going to be allowed except under extraordinary circumstances to go in or to go out fauci right wallace could that happened here fauci you know we we have to be realistic i i don apost think it would be as draconian as nobody in a nobody out but there will be if we continue to get cases like this particularly at the community level there will be what we call mitigation where you aposll have to do essentially social distancing keep people out of crowded places take a look at seriousness do you really need to travel those kinds of things and i think it aposs particularly important among the most venerable and that aposs the thing that the cdc and the state department are going to be making some recommendations about how people who have underlying conditions those are the most vulnerable particularly elderly with underlying conditions heart disease chronic lung disease diabetes to do right now not wait but right now to sort of take a look at things that are at high risk crowded places getting on airplanes and absolutely don apost get on a cruise ship wallace so i want to i want to press this question though of italy fauci right wallace could could you see a situation you know you a lot of talk about seattle and and what aposs going on there where a city is shut down or a state or a region is shut down and you basically just say for and in the case of italy it aposs till april 3rd nobody in nobody out fauci it aposs possible i think what you need to do on real time basis and that aposs the reason why we evaluated literally every single day you know you don apost want to alarm people but given the spread we see you know anything is possible and that aposs the reason why we aposve got to be prepared to take whatever action is appropriate to contain and mitigate the outbreak wallace ok meanwhile the cruise ship the grand princess fauci right wallace the latest call is that it has 3 500 people on it that it aposs going to doc perhaps as early as tomorrow at a non occupied dock in san francisco bay people are then going to be taken off the ship they aposre going to be sent to quarantines california people to a base in california the others to a base in georgia are you comfortable with that or would you prefer to see those folks stay on that ship fauci no absolutely not i recommend very strongly in our meetings that we get those people off that ship we don apost want to have a repeat of what we saw at the diamond princess where the ship became almost a hot spot of transition now i feel strongly about getting them off there and getting them under the appropriate quarantine and or care for those who are sick wallace there has been some confusion about the response in this country to the disease first of all when a vaccine will become available take a look begin video clip trump i aposve heard very quick numbers a matter of months and i aposve heard pretty much a year would be an outside number unidentified male what is it going to be deployable and that is going to be at the earliest a year to a year and a half no matter how fast you go end video clip wallace realistically what aposs the earliest that a vaccine will be available for americans to take fauci yes i think people need to appreciate the difference between a vaccine that you aposve proven works that aposs going to take a year to a year and a half when you can get it scaled up and that aposs the reason why we aposve met with the pharmaceutical companies because once you show it works then you got to scale it up to hundreds of millions of doses we are talking at least a year to a year and a half at least at best wallace you sound like you think it aposs longer than that fauci well you know it might be with regard i mean i chris the test were doing right now getting it into phase one trial is the fastest we aposve ever done don apost confuse that with when you can put it in someone aposs arm in a deployable way so i think that we really need to be realize that for now the answer is not going to be a vaccine if in fact we go into a cycle where we come back next year then we likely would have some opportunity for a vaccine wallace there have also been contradictions about when and how many people can get tested take a look at that begin video clip trump anybody that needs a test gets the test we they aposre there they have the tests and the tests are beautiful anybody that needs a test get a test mike pence vice president we don apost have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward end video clip wallace can anybody who needs a test get a test now fauci the fact is the tests are out there there was a misstep early on with regard to the tests namely a technical difficulty but right now about 1 1 million tests are out there now they aposll be an additional about 640 000 on let aposs say monday and then at least another 4 million particularly now that we aposre engaging the private sector now when you say that they aposre out there if you go to a doctor it aposs up to the doctor to order the test and if that happens a person should have a test available but it aposs no doubt chris you have to be realistic early on there were some missteps that delayed it but i think wallace i want to i want to i want to pick up on that doctor fauci ok wallace and and the question of testing i want to put some numbers on the screen as of thursday the cdc had tested only 1 583 people in california only 516 tests meanwhile in south korea more than 66 000 people were tested within a week of the first case of community transmission and they can now tested 10 000 people a day why are we so far behind fauci you know i think i mean it gets back to what i said in the beginning that the the cdc made a test there was a technical glitch there the cdc provides tests for the public health groups in the state and local what we really need to do now which were the numbers that i mentioned to you is to get the private sector involved so that you could literally flood it with millions and millions of tests that is happening now but in fact the american people need to realize that in the beginning there was a glitch and we need to overcome that now wallace you spoke with politico recently and i want to put up part of what you had to say you said you should never destroy your own credibility and you don apost want to go to war with the president but you aposve got to walk the fine balance of making sure you continue to tell the truth you have had to correct the president a few times especially on the availability and the schedule for vaccines where do you personally draw the line between reassuring people but staying away from the spin fauci yes i try as best as possible and i think i succeed over many years of staying away from spin and just give people the information that you need based on evidence and hard facts when you have the evidence you give it as it is if you don apost have all the evidence because we aposre in a dynamic situation you use your best judgment and recommendations and guidelines but you must always always be truthful with the american public wallace there aposs a story today on ap that the white house overruled the cdc which wanted to warn elderly people and people in physically fragile conditions not to get on commercial airplanes one do you know that whether that aposs true or not and two what would you tell a relative of yours who was in fauci right wallace either in that class either elderly or physically fragile would you say staff off airplanes fauci no well here aposs the deal i can tell you right away chris that no one overruled anybody about saying this so let me say it loud and clear now the cdc has a health alert and the state department has more of a travel alert right now i aposm telling the american people based on everything that aposs agreed upon in the task force that if you are an individual who has an underlying condition particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition right now not wait you should start to distance yourself from the risk crowds getting on a plane on a long plane trip and above all don apost get on a cruise ship that is a health issue what the state department is saying from a logistics standpoint don apost get on a cruise ship because you could come out have a person on there then all of a sudden you find yourself not being able to get back and quarantine no one has told us not to say that and i aposm saying it very clearly now on your show wallace finally i have noticed you aposve been all over television the last few days you have a bit of a raspy voice have you tested yourself or had yourself tested for the coronavirus fauci my no because i have not been at risk my raspy voice is the fact that i aposm talking too much on tv shows wallace well keep doing it you are a voice of reason and science and authority and i think when people hear you they your they have reason to think they aposre getting the straight scoop fauci thank you wallace thank you very much doctor fauci thank you for giving me the opportunity chris wallace always good to talk with you sir up next we aposll bring back our sunday group to discuss the president aposs plan to contain the outbreak plus what would you like to ask the panel about how the spread of the virus could threaten the u s economy just go to facebook or twitter and fox news sunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect the transcription was perfect end video clip wallace president trump mixing politics and public health as he discusses the availability of coronavirus tests and tries to reassure the public and we aposre back now with the panel ben how do you think president trump is handling the coronavirus how do you think his administration is handling the coronavirus domenech well i think that as your prior guest the good doctor said there were some early glitches in terms of their handling of this i think the thing that aposs really on the mind of the president though is his broader agenda going into the 2020 election and i think that that is changing and shifting a little bit of the things that he aposs saying about this in a way that he should really correct because he shouldn apost be viewing this in the context of politics he should be viewing it in the contest of public health and there i think needs to be a real sticking to the talking points that he has the facts as we know them and not shifting the two because he aposs worried frankly about what this is going to do to the economy in a way that he i think is responding to questions in the media which are legitimate about the kind of economic impact this is going to have wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of how the coronavirus could impact or even threaten the u s economy we got this on twitter from texas guy has the coverage media coverage of the coronavirus been overhyped juan how do you answer texas guy williams well i think there are alarmists out there but you know the president i think has been somewhat partisan wearing that red hat calling the government of washington state jay inslee a snake and all that i just don apost like it because like ben my preferences i just want to have trust in government at this critical time i note that when you get away from media let aposs just look at wall street that you get companies like goldman sachs downgrading their forecast for the year economically obviously the stock market has been up and down the uncertainty producing a great amount of anxiety and fear there so that aposs away from media clearly people who have skin in the game in terms of money are saying when you look at italy when you look at greece what happened in china were disrupting supply chains were disrupting travel industry airplanes cruise ships and the like so this is not good and so i you know it aposs not what i think and i don apost think it aposs like the media hype we aposve got a stay away from the alarmists but there aposs something going on here that aposs quite serious wallace jason this is not just a medical story not just an economic story it aposs also very much as has been suggested by ben a political story because donald trump was understandably planning to run on a strong economic record record growth low unemployment records in the stock market and now suddenly all of that is in jeopardy riley yes how serious a threat does this pose potentially we don apost know what it aposs going to be like in the fall but how serious a threat does this pose potentially to the president aposs re election riley i think it aposs something that that he has to be worried about frankly we aposre in uncharted territory here this is not just the flu it aposs much more serious than the flu the mortality rate is higher than the flu it aposs not as bad as the sars virus so far but it is worse than the flu and we need to work our way through it and he needs to find a way to reassure people without being overly dismissive of the seriousness of this and it is going to affect the economy it aposs going to affect the supply chains businesses like certainty this introduces all kinds of uncertainty we have spring break travel coming up that aposs being canceled conferences are being canceled so he aposs going to have to work through this what he has going for him and as we found out with the jobs report on friday is that this economy is on pretty good footing right now if you look at what aposs going on in japan and china the second and third largest economies in the world after ours they aposre sort of teetering on recession and this could push them into it what we know from our jobs report is that our economy right now is pretty solid which means we aposre in a pretty good position to absorb whatever shock we get from us wallace but you do have to wonder as you talk about all the conferences that are being canceled and we hear about airlines which are cutting flights by a dramatic amounts this is going to filter into the into the economy riley absolutely wallace you know as we head into march and april riley absolutely and again he will have to find a way to reassure people and not overpromise in terms of how quickly we are going to get past this i think he needs to let the health professionals do their job and not be out there contradicting them or second guessing them wallace congresswoman edwards obviously we have no idea where this is going to be in the fall i mean maybe the president aposs right and like the flu as we get into warmer weather it will begin to diminish maybe not how legitimate do you think it is for democrats to go after the president on the administration response to the coronavirus edwards well i think it aposs legitimate to you know to challenge the process and the management of this crisis and it is a public health crisis and i think whenever we hear dr fauci and other experts talk about this virus and about what to do and what what americans can do that it actually is somewhat reassuring but what we don apost get is that kind of reassurance coming directly from the president because of his contradictions because you know the information that he puts out is just on accurate i mean he would actually i think do better in terms of the public if he just shut up because i don apost think people wouldn apost necessarily blame the president for something that was out of his control but if he continues and his administration mismanages the crisis then i think it aposs a legitimate point of challenge by anyone who wants to be president saying i aposd manage it better i mean we saw the impact for example that hurricane katrina and the response had with president bush and i don apost think this is you know different in that respect but the president doesn apost do himself or the american public any good when he makes assertions that are completely contrary to the scientific evidence wallace ben the president has literally tweeted this morning prior to this conversation that the administration is doing a great job and it aposs a fake news media that aposs running him down domenech you know i think we can believe a couple of different things are true here one is the panic is overblown this is not the kind of public health crisis yet that people are treating it in the way that they aposre approaching it in some sections of the media however it aposs very serious it should result in changes in human behavior for the time being as we figure out how we have to adjust to live our lives this way just to note a personal thing here bre paton ph who aposs a former guest on fox news quite a lot passed away a little over a year ago one of our employees from the flu and so the flu is very serious we have a very high level of flu and america right now and so people should take this seriously but don apost freak out don apost don apost panic don apost don apost turn into you know a a you know black friday mob at the at the costco when you aposre trying to prepare for this wallace and on quoting the congresswoman that the president i aposll be gentler should be quiet domenech i think that the president should as i said stick to the talking points that he aposs given you know he aposs not a medical professional but he aposs surrounded by them now there are a lot of serious people working on this i think he should just stick to those points and not go off script the way that he does so often williams yes i think it hurts them politically and you can see it there aposs a public opinion public policy poll out that says 51 percent of americans at the moment disapprove of the way he aposs handling this but i agree with congresswoman edwards that if he said nothing people wouldn apost blame him people might be you know riley no people look to the present for leadership on things like this he needs to watch what he says yes but i don apost think he should stop talking about this the president edwards well the president is incapable of doing that and so i think he should really you know defer to the people in his administration riley fine but but but he should edwards who really have the capacity to make the american public comfortable in where we need to be wallace all right thank you panel see you next sunday my guess is unfortunately we aposll still be talking about this up next our power player of the week the girl scout who became a rocket scientist and is now leading the organization into the future commercial break wallace when you think of the girl scouts you may think about buying thin mints or samoa but our power player of the week wants you to know the century old organization offers a lot more begin videotape sylvia acevedo ceo girl scouts usa the world is changing very rapidly and we want to make sure that girls have those skills to not just be users of technology but the creators the inventors and the designers wallace sylvia acevedo is ceo of girl scouts usa a former rocket scientist and tech executive her goal is to bring science technology engineering and math skills to the scouts acevedo we have the scale and the reach to teach girls much needed tech skills unidentified female we deploy our scissor lift acevedo we aposve had over 1 million stem badges earned in 2019 wallace on camera this is no longer your grandma aposs girl scouts acevedo we do have our hand firmly rooted in our traditions but we always have to be looking also with that hand looking at the future unidentified male you aposre doing about 330 knots wallace voice over new programs aimed to make stem accessible for all ages unidentified female would you like some cookies wallace and even those iconic cookies play a part wallace on camera how big is the girl scout cookie business acevedo it aposs the largest female entrepreneurship program in the world wallace voice over girl scouts to sell 200 million boxes each year bringing in 850 million that fund local troops adventures in learning when girl scouts started girls and women aposs programs got less than 9 percent of any non profit dollars or philanthropy dollars it aposs the same today and so the cookie program allows us to continue to provide these cutting edge programs and amazing experiences for girls wallace juliette gordon low formed the scouts in 1912 to teach girls leadership self sufficiency and outdoor skills unidentified female there you go wallace today there are 1 6 million girl scouts despite stiff competition wallace on camera what did you think when the boy scouts started admitting girls acevedo you know it provides another competitor in the marketplace we have many competitors we are going to continue to stay laser focused on our amazing outcomes and programs wallace voice over acevedo was seven when she joined the girl scouts on a camping trip a troop leader noticed her looking up at the stars and encouraged her to earn a badge about space acevedo i got my science badge making an sd aposs ph rocket and i tried and failed quite a few times but i persisted and when it finally launched and i saw it go into that beautiful blue new mexico sky i thought i could do this wallace she went on to become a nasa rocket scientist an ibm engineer and an apple executive she says the confidence she gained in scouts propelled her and others acevedo it wasn apost just me it was millions of women like me it aposs one of the reasons half of all elected officials in america were girl scouts and 60 percent of the women in congress girl scouts 75 percent of the women senators girl scouts and so man business leaders girl scouts wallace her plan now to build that same foundation in a changing world for today aposs girls acevedo i wouldn apost have had the opportunities in my life had it not been for the girl scouts that is really our mission to create girls of courage confidence and character who make the world a better place end videotape wallace and we have our very own girl sco
