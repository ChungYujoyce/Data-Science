president obama came armed with an arsenal of biting one liners at the final presidential debate monday night trying to paint mitt romney as all over the map on foreign affairs but he encountered a republican rival who returned fire in moderation at times chiding the president for weakness on the world stage but also finding common ground with the man he s been running against for nearly two years the debate in boca raton fla the last before a feverish two week blitz of campaigning was a departure from the candidates previous bout a week ago the two paced around each other in an interruption filled bickering match on monday night the rivals were seated next to one another making for a less confrontational setting though the candidates differences were still on full display to hear romney tell it the president has presided over a steady decline in american influence that has emboldened enemies like iran in nowhere in the world is america s influence greater today than it was four years ago romney said to hear obama the republican nominee is all over the map on world affairs obama accused romney of pushing a foreign policy that s either flat out wrong or some version of what the president himself has already done only louder but romney while lambasting the president for his so called apology tour and his allegedly frosty relationship with israel used a lighter touch at monday s debate than in the past the face off frequently dipped into the economy and the budget but the foreign policy side of things which was supposed to be the focus barely touched on the most heated topic the libya terror attacks romney who after months of trailing obama is suddenly up in a string of national and battleground polls appeared at times to scold obama for getting too aggressive after obama pointedly told him every time you apos ve offered an opinion you apos ve been wrong romney responded attacking me is not an agenda romney offered a few areas of agreement with the president including on ruling out military action in syria continuing to support sanctions against iran and supporting the withdrawal timetable in afghanistan in doing so the republican nominee rejected obama s suggestion that he would be eager to lurch into war with countries like iran he also brushed off obama s claims that romney would return to the foreign policies of the prior administration romney s chief criticism of the president monday night was that he has not provided a clear example of american leadership for the world whether it be in syria or iran or russia but obama in turn sought to portray romney as someone who would be unsteady on the world stage with a risky mix of poor judgment and antiquated views the president employed sharp at times sarcastic language to cast romney as out of his depth after a tense exchange on al qaeda the president said i apos m glad that you recognize that al qaeda is a threat because a few months ago when you were asked what apos s the biggest geopolitical threat facing america you said russia not al qaeda obama then worked in his punchline the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back later on the president mocked romney for complaining about the navy having fewer ships than it did a century ago well governor we also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of our military apos s changed obama said we have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them we have these ships that go under water nuclear submarines and so the question is not agame of battleship where we re counting ships it apos s what are our capabilities romney was most aggressive at the start of the debate claiming the president s counterterror strategy has not quelled the al qaeda threat it was the first and last reference to the sept 11 terror attack in benghazi libya something that has driven the debate on the campaign trail and on capitol hill for a month it s certainly not on the run it s certainly not hiding romney said of al qaeda this is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries romney commended obama for ordering the raid that killed usama bin laden and other strikes on al qaeda leaders but said we can t kill our way out of this mess he said al qaeda remains an enormous threat despite obama s claims that the terror group is on the path to defeat obama though countered that al qaeda s core leadership has been decimated on the issue of iran the two candidates were equally insistent that under their watch the regime would not obtain a nuclear weapon and that if israel were attacked the u s would stand by its side romney though said obama has wasted four years while iran has marched ever closer to nuclear weapon capability obama said he knows the clock is ticking and defended efforts to unite the international community against iran the 90 minute debate at lynn university was moderated by cbs news apos bob schieffer and offered perhaps the last chance for either candidate to shake up the race in any significant way with two weeks to go until election day the presidential debates this month have been among the most consequential in modern campaign history romney entered the debates as the slight underdog in most polls but since his opening performance has surged to even or better with the president an nbc news wall street journal poll on sunday showed the president and romney tied at 47 percent nationally in the vital swing state of ohio a suffolk university survey released monday also showed the two tied at 47 percent other recent polls have given obama a slight edge get all the stories you need to know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox subscribed you ve
