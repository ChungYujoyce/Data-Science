officials were not authorized to speak publicly about the move and declined to be identified in an interview last week sanders blamed the problems in detention on a lack of money and called on congress to pass a 4 5 billion emergency funding bill to address the crisis the house approved the legislation on tuesday night setting up a showdown with the senate where republican leaders plan approval of a different bipartisan bill this week that does not offer as many protections and services for migrants at the white house trump said that he did not ask for sanders resignation adding that he doesn t think he has ever spoken to the man but that he is moving some people around into different locations amid the crisis while activists welcomed sanders departure trump defended u s border authorities saying the laws are so bad and the asylum rules and laws are so bad that our border patrol people who are so incredible aren t allowed to do their jobs the unprecedented surge of
