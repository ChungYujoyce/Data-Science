who would have let the auto industry fail during the height of the economic crisis and during his time at bain capital was a major proponent of outsourcing american jobs gov romney s experiences have been owning companies that were called pioneers of outsourcing mr obama told the crowd my experience has been saving the american auto industry creating more security for your community that s why my administration has brought trade cases against china at a faster pace than the previous administration he said that s why my administration brought a case today against china to hold china accountable

chinese trade officials began imposing both anti dumping and other duties on imports of american cars after determining that american made automobile imports were being sold at less than fair value in
