ever it was also a savage disappointment on the positive side the presidential ticket of two former republican governors gary johnson of new mexico and william weld of massachusetts received more than 4 46 million votes amounting as of press time to 3 28 percent of the national haul smashing the party s previous highs of 1 28 million and 1 06 percent respectively the l p nominee was on the ballot in all 50 states and the district of columbia for the first time since 2000 and he outperformed the green party s jill stein in each one we are the only political party in the country that s growing libertarian party national chair nicholas sarwark crowed the morning after the election we ve tripled our vote totals over 2012 we control a bloc of the electorate that covers the spread in almost all if not all of the battleground states we ve beaten the other third party in every single state for the first time the l p now has more than a half million registered voters the johnson weld campaign raised around 12 million according to internal accounts the final federal election commission reports have not yet been filed that destroys the previous record of 3 5 million set in 1980 and 2 1 million of the 1980 total came from billionaire vice presidential candidate david koch the national party pulled in nearly 3 million in additional donations this year too u s senate candidate joe miller of alaska received 30 percent of the vote in his race the highest such total in party history especially impressive as he had both a republican and a democratic opponent generally if an l p candidate for any legislative seat gets double digit percentages it s because one of the major parties sat the race out gop defections in 2016 also gave the l p sitting state legislators in nevada nebraska and utah all told the party has come a long way since its founding in 1971 when a small gang of dreamers hoped it would become a vehicle to get press attention for libertarian ideas still measured against expectations let alone the basic standard that successful political parties must win elections the libertarian party had its most disappointing year ever we wanted to win and we didn t achieve that goal johnson s campaign manager ron nielson acknowledged shortly after the election we were hoping to get into the presidential debate and no matter how hard we tried we could not achieve that goal after that our goal was to get 5 percent and for the last 45 days we pushed toward that effort which was entirely achievable but for the fact that the election came down to such a tight margin between clinton and trump that put pressure on third party support and a lot of johnson support moved in the end toward trump or possibly chose not to participate while 3 28 percent marked an all time high for the party it was also just a third of the campaign s highest polling average which came in late july all summer long johnson had avoided the typical third party fade with such forecasters as fivethirtyeight projecting a finish higher than 7 percent for months on end but the plates came crashing down over the final eight weeks prompting much anguish and fingerpointing among activists and supporters the libertarian party wrote 2016 l p presidential runner up austin petersen on election day has blown a chance that it may never have again in my lifetime there was plenty of bad news to go along with johnson s late collapse one of the party s sitting state legislators utah sen mark madsen did not run for re election and will be gone in january a second nevada assemblyman john moore suffered what might be a historic mangling for an incumbent finishing a distant third place with just 7 percent of the vote the third legislator nebraska sen laura ebke faces re election in 2018 the party still has precious few elected officials and many of those are in officially nonpartisan jobs the races that libertarians were excited about before election day vastly underperformed expectations massachusetts u s house of representatives candidate thomas simmons thought he actually might win against an incumbent democrat with no republican in the race but he ended up with just 10 percent of the vote florida senate candidate paul stanton anticipated 5 or 6 percent after polling as high as 10 percent he finished with just 2 most activists interviewed for this article presented a glass half full interpretation of the l p s historic year but assessing and strategizing the party s fortunes going forward will depend heavily on figuring out what went wrong and what went right with the johnson weld campaign and that question is still heavily in dispute wherever it turns out gary johnson predicted on the morning of the election i think it s important to point out that last time it was 1 percent and this time it s going to blow that away for some that s just horrible for others it s recognized for big time gains pragmatist converts vs stalwart radicals the record number of credentialed journalists at the libertarian national convention in may all seemed to be there to ask the same question how could the l p facing two historically unpopular major party candidates including one total novice do anything but nominate two popular governors with impressive national profiles yet even the internally admired johnson who had sailed through the process in 2012 needed two highly contested rounds of voting before he won the nomination and his far more controversial vice presidential recommendation amid noisy objections on the convention floor barely squeaked by on a second ballot of his own for more on him see bill weld s weird tuesday on page 56 such intra party division while baffling to most outsiders represents a real split not just in 2016 but in how party members size up next steps for 2018 and beyond roughly speaking a more pragmatic camp wants to keep finding standard bearers with real world experience to sell a palatable big tent version of libertarianism that stresses fiscal conservatism and social toleration a smaller group of radicals is increasingly impatient with recent converts who don t seem to grasp some fundamental tenets of the party s philosophy and they worry that a posture of apologetic libertarianism will dilute the message and repel sympathizers a third wing shares the radicals preference for homegrown libertarianism but emphasizes polish and presentation over passion and philosophy by calibrating its pitch to the country s normals the ticket hoped to and did drum up massive new interest but in doing so johnson and weld also set up inevitable conflict with some in their own party these broad tendencies were on display before during and after the may libertarian national convention where 928 delegates wrestled over what everyone agreed was a historic opportunity darryl w perry a member of the l p radical caucus a group whose goal is to celebrate and promote the radical tradition of american libertarian thought ran representing the libertarian wing of the libertarian party he came in fourth place with less than 7 percent in both rounds of presidential voting then warned in his concession speech that if we nominate two republican governors as our ticket and we compromise what we believe this party will die in september citing the numerous instances of the libertarian party presidential ticket running in opposition to the lp platform perry announced that he was making himself available as a write in candidate in 17 states plus d c write in results had yet to be tabulated at press time third place finisher john mcafee the gonzo anti virus software pioneer who brought celebrity sizzle and creative weirdness to the libertarian primary season also refused to endorse johnson after the convention citing the nominee s character and his tendency to rhetorically compromise on issues such as gun rights among the leading contenders only runner up petersen the self styled freedom ninja who made his name as a producer for fox business network s freedom watch with judge andrew napolitano actually backed his vanquisher though only after repeatedly dinging johnson s muddled position on religious liberty and calling him a spoiled entitled brat prone to public fits such colorful discord conveyed the impression of a party not quite ready for prime time a judgment enhanced by the convention s most talked about moment when james weeks ii a portly young michigan activist who d been running for national party chair elected to use his speaking time which was aired on c span right when viewers were awaiting the results of weld s second ballot for a striptease the act was controversial inside the hall as well as out weeks was suspended by michigan s libertarian executive committee for two years producing further rounds of recrimination i was far more ashamed of those who turned their heads in disgust than by anything mr weeks did mcafee wrote on his facebook page for some longtime libertarians who were getting into capital l party politics for the first time it was a wince inducing moment philip harvey an entrepreneur who founded the sex product company adam eve and a philanthropist who specializes in distributing contraceptives to the developing world donated hundreds of thousands to johnson supporting super pacs this year he has also contributed over the years to reason foundation which publishes this magazine asked whether he d paid much attention to the l p before 2016 harvey says i haven t paid attention to the l p even this year i know very little about it but it does seem to me that the kind of clownish antics i saw at the convention work very much against the party if i have anything to say about it i would try to discourage that and let the radical weird material come through as policy for all the attention garnered by the radicals and freaks the pragmatists clearly won the day at the convention and the party entered the general election behind a softer version of the freedom philosophy casting libertarianism in johnson s oft repeated phrasing as a six lane highway down the center of the road by calibrating the pitch to the country s normals the ticket hoped to and in fact did drum up massive new interest but in doing so johnson and weld also set up inevitable conflict with some in their own party a lot of more radical types such as myself are upset because there are some positions that we do not agree with said colorado l p official radical caucus member and national committee member caryn ann harlos two days before the election but the way i look at it is that the campaign is bringing brand new people in and then it s going to be my job to make consistent libertarians out of them i m not going to look that gift horse in the mouth i think that s entirely the wrong attitude johnson defenders rightly point out that the libertarian alternatives were in order of popularity a 35 year old social media pop off with no elected experience an enigmatic septuagenarian and recent party convert who had been wanted for questioning in belize over the murder of his neighbor and a guy who angrily disputes the propriety of government issued driver s licenses but in choosing political palatability as a primary virtue libertarians ran up against a paradox their lead salesman just wasn t particularly gifted at sales the candidate whose whole strategy was to get into the televised presidential debates was inconsistent at best on tv by his own admission i constantly apologize for being not the best candidate when it comes to articulating these issues johnson said from the libertarian national convention stage in a formulation he would echo throughout the campaign so many understand these issues so well and do such a good job talking about these issues of debating these issues discussing these issues and because of your efforts here we arrived today on the brink of changing america something that we ve always dreamed of this is the opportunity but was the ability to articulate those positions necessary to seize the opportunity what is aleppo on the morning of september 8 before gary johnson walked on the set of msnbc s popular program morning joe his polling average on realclearpolitics was 9 percent in the ballpark of where it had been for two months that s when interviewer mike barnicle asked him a fateful question what would you do if you were elected about aleppo johnson s wide eyed four word answer became the one and only time that the libertarian would dominate headlines all campaign long and what is aleppo one week later johnson saw the last of his 9 percent polling averages then began hurtling southward by september 26 the day of the first presidential debate he was under 8 percent for good the 7s were left behind two weeks after that and before anyone had much time to process it the critical 5 percent threshold which would have given the l p official minor party recognition from the federal government making it eligible for millions in taxpayer financing was also in the rearview mirror in the aftermath and even with the caveat that both hillary clinton and eventual winner donald trump had each said demonstrably worse things about the middle east many johnson supporters pointed to the gaffe as a turning point it really deflated a lot of the momentum that we were having says judge jim gray the 2012 libertarian vice presidential nominee who is now the honorary chair of the johnson created nonprofit our america initiative pre aleppo you d have a lot of strangers giving thumbs up honks claps screams of gary johnson while out waving johnson signs or passing out campaign flyers says the d c based l p activist and frequent candidate bruce majors post aleppo every eight steps some negative comment some guy in a loft while i m going down the street putting johnson literature on windshields was shouting what is aleppo i shouted back isn t that the city hillary clinton sold weapons to but aleppo reinforced the impression among those who were eager to believe or propagate it that johnson was ignorant of foreign affairs disqualifyingly unprepared and or just plain goofy he compounded those narratives by weirdly sticking out his tongue for 10 seconds of an msnbc interview on september 23 and then volunteering on the same network six days later that he was having an aleppo moment in not being able to come up with the name of vicente fox after chris matthews asked him to name a foreign leader he respected perhaps the questions were gotchas perhaps the media compounded the problem by misreporting his comments as when his response to matthews was inaccurately described as an inability to name any foreign leader at all regardless the result was the same for most of the people we spoke to who did retail campaigning for johnson aleppo became the no 1 objection to the l p ticket libertarians austin petersen stressed in an interview after the election have to realize that people are going to give them a much harder time than a major party candidate after all trump doesn t know what the nuclear triad is clinton has all her scandals but something as simple and silly as the aleppo gaffe can prove fatal a libertarian candidate has got to be on your game petersen says but september brought plenty of other problems besides johnson s occasionally tied tongue national polls as they always do began switching their topline results from registered voters to likely voters thus lowering the results for third party candidates and making any bad polling trends look worse the new york times published an article on september 15 about the clinton campaign s panic over millennial defections to third party candidates and then the nation s comedy newscasts and op ed pages erupted in a spasm of anti johnson content environmental activist billionaire tom steyer immediately announced principal backing for a 55 million campaign targeting young people in swing states the debate gambit the biggest blow to the libertarian party s chances came on september 16 when the commission on presidential debates the nonprofit launched in 1987 and still managed by representatives of the democratic and republican parties to gatekeep presidential discourse announced that the libertarians failed to meet the 15 percent polling threshold to qualify for the first presidential and only vice presidential debate making those debates had been the campaign s singular goal since even before the libertarian national convention johnson used it as his primary sales pitch for weld the campaign fundraised on a 15 million for 15 slogan and libertarians hit the commission with two separate lawsuits one was dismissed in august but is in the appeals process the other is scheduled to have first hearings on motions for summary judgment in january weld spoke almost threateningly about the technically nonpartisan body jeopardizing its nonprofit status johnson tried pleading for a one time relaxation of its standards in late august the candidate said on cnn that it would be game over should these efforts fall short a prediction that more or less came true no human being not already a sports star or equivalent celebrity can get to 15 percent in their time frame says sarwark the party chair even though strong majorities in three national polls favored third party inclusion in the debates and even though some libertarians are bullish about the prospects of legal action nothing happened in time to matter for 2016 still there were moments when even 15 percent looked tantalizingly possible in mid july just before the republican national convention a cnn orc poll put johnson at 13 percent wow within the margin of error recalls campaign field director carlos sierra we had just started a national tv buy the superpacs were doing their thing ground game was up and running we were making tens of thousands of calls a day visions of how much money we d get if we got in the debates all the hiring we could do offices we could open but that proved to be johnson s high water mark in the polls once it became obvious that he wouldn t make it into the debates multiple sources with the campaign say the money spigot pretty much turned off i think if we d have been in the presidential debates i think that you would have seen a twentyfold increase in the amount of money that we did raise johnson said the morning of election day i think that we would have raised hundreds of millions of dollars if we would have been in the presidential debates as it stands the campaign did have a banner year raising money even while falling far short of the 50 million that insiders say is the absolute minimum for running a potentially competitive presidential campaign in addition to the 12 million for johnson weld there was also around 2 3 million given to the gary johnson victory fund essentially a conglomerate of state parties combining their legal maximums to allow people who d maxed out on the 2 700 campaign contribution limit to give as much as 117 000 more which at least one donor b wayne hughes jr son of the founder of public storage did plus around 3 4 million donated in total to four separate super pacs that supported the campaign asked if he was disappointed that more money didn t flow in johnson says no i m pretty satisfied then emphasizes that the l p routed the competition when measuring votes per dollar we raised 12 million bucks hillary 1 8 billion trump 1 3 billion he said when you do the votes divided by the money we re going to get outspent by hillary 40 to 1 the 50 state strategy not all the theories of what went wrong center on tv brainfreezes or the debates the mistake made says austin petersen was the complete dismissal of the never trump movement and johnson weld s play entirely to the left the ticket s reluctance to attack hillary clinton harmed it petersen says as did the tone deafness to conservative concerns johnson shouldn t have gone to liberty university and talked about abortion these choices provided an opportunity for conservative independent evan mcmullin to steal the campaign s hoped for utah thunder petersen says utah home base of campaign manager nielson and campaign spokesman joe hunter was one of a small set of mountain west states the campaign thought it could excel in mcmullin a provo native and mormon ended up carrying 21 4 percent of utah to johnson s 3 5 percent and he also topped the libertarian in the country s second most mormon state idaho though he lagged far behind in the nine other states on which he made the ballot nielson suggests that the mormon church s official objection to legalized pot which johnson fervently supports was the prime killer of the l p s chances in utah petersen is confident that he could have raised as much money as johnson weld via endorsements and support from republicans disgruntled with trump prior to the libertarian national convention he had received an endorsement from longtime gop strategist mary matalin another boost from redstate editor erick erickson and much positive attention from glenn beck i was the right candidate for this election cycle he insists most of the funders and campaign staffers interviewed for this article had a counter view summed up by johnson weld staffer andy craig who also ran for the u s house of representatives in wisconsin this november and received an impressive 11 percent in a three way race against a democrat and an independent with no republican you can t run some random person with no qualifications no one has ever heard of for president craig says and expect anyone to take it seriously the biggest strategic complaint from those interviewed for this story was that the campaign should have more seriously focused on trying to actually win a state with johnson s native new mexico where he received 9 3 percent of the vote his best result being the most obvious choice if johnson had treated new mexico like mcmullin treated utah perhaps he could have gained the l p its first electoral votes since a faithless elector gave the party his ballot in its first presidential run in 1972 nielson doubts it it would have been a selfish endeavor trying to win a state he says great for our personal egos but bad for the libertarian party johnson s record vote totals across the country since they came with some impressive state level results led to new or renewed ballot access in over a dozen states including oklahoma where the national party spent more than 100 000 to get a libertarian name on the ballot for the first time since 2000 says party chair sarwark next election cycle such money can be plowed into actual campaigns instead of time consuming and expensive petition drives mcmullin s one state strategy did lead to those two third place finishes but the other nine results came in at under 2 percent johnson s national focus got him bronze medals in 47 states plus washington d c johnson s other fourth place finish came in vermont where write in votes propelled bernie sanders into third the trick for the party going forward is to make those relationships more permanent as new mexico state party chair marty swinney says we don t want people next time thinking oh gary johnson s not on the ballot i guess i have to go back to the democrats and republicans one reason for optimism on that score was johnson s impressive support throughout the campaign among millennials it s often said that however you vote twice when you are young that s the party you are likely to stick with says bruce majors i suspect voting libertarian even once makes it easier to do it again the next wave the johnson campaign s biggest long term influence may be in the first taste of campaigning it offered to thousands of activists putting political flyers on car windshields and doorknobs distributing yard signs manning tables making get out the vote calls and talking up candidate and party jacqueline passey mason who has been involved in the l p for more than a decade was amazed at the hundreds of new faces she saw doing gritty retail work in virginia the campaign provided an incredible learning experience says indiana libertarian mark rutherford who has decades of experience in the party no campaign anywhere doesn t have some bad sides but the great thing for the party is that even people with negative experience now have experience working on a real campaign with real money and that s going to be great colorado l p chair jay north says that in 2016 alone state party registration distinct from dues paying membership grew from around 33 000 to 40 000 which he credits mostly to growing disgust with the democrats and republicans a similar dynamic was at play among millennials says jason weinman who ran youth for johnson younger voters have been attracted to the l p not because of old libertarian dogmas certainly not people going around saying taxation is theft not the non aggression principle not young people reading hayek or rothbard but rather because of a general sense that the old ways of governing have been discredited but new blood exacerbates old conflicts such as the party s foundational tension between philosophical purity and political success d c area activist robert swartzwelder says he formally joined the maryland l p when he saw too many newcomers with big plans to change the party i don t think we should be conforming to public opinion he says we have a sound platform and principles and yet even swartzwelder acknowledges that i have seen a lot of libertarians myself included be really bad about running off potential new members because we have an abrasive way of expressing ourselves if we can stop being so off putting we have a great opportunity to grow dramatically while maintaining the l p s unique identity we can t become republican lite or democrat lite i don t consider us to be a centrist party but centrism is precisely how johnson and weld tried to position themselves and many of the campaign s most influential supporters consciously reached outside the usual libertarian box to bring in converts unfamiliar with the word millions of new young people who didn t know they were libertarians are now aware of and turned on to the ideas of liberty because of johnson says matt kibbe who ran the johnson supporting alternativepac kibbe s pac created an enormously successful online video starring dead abe lincoln aimed at linking voters scared of clinton with those scared of trump so that they could both vote for johnson without fear alternativepac very specifically did not go after the low hanging fruit not after self identifying libertarians kibbe says activists fighting over purity he warns really don t want the l p to grow at all seeing it more as a philosophical debating society or club but if you are a political party winning votes is fundamentally your business if gary johnson had focused his energy on trying to win new mexico some activists now wonder could he have gained the l p its first electoral votes since a faithless elector gave the party his ballot in 1972 the votes for president are the most coveted prize for any political party johnson said repeatedly that he s done running for office petersen definitely has his toe in the water for 2020 many activists are fond of larry sharpe an african american corporate consultant and a close runner up to weld for the vice presidential nomination who stressed the attractiveness of libertarianism to traditionally disadvantaged communities weld meanwhile said on election night that the libertarians have a very clear path in washington and i intend to participate in that but he will likely face fierce internal resistance virginia state l p vice chair andy bakker is adamant about the carpetbagger issue the young activists i talk to have a real desire for someone to come from the inside he says politics is about trust and looking out for your people and if we keep bringing in outsiders we can t be surprised if they don t trust us and don t look out for the l p s interests there s a big movement to make sure there are no former anythings on our stage in 2020 the next big thing the libertarian party finds itself in a place it s never been before with momentum stronger than ever but the l p still can t manage a lot of things a major party is expected to do d c activist majors points out that the national headquarters found it hard to cope with such mundane tasks as shipping campaign materials internal polling is too expensive tending to cost at least 20 000 per survey libertarians don t currently have a thorough database of their own registered voters let alone likely prospects though the johnson campaign will be sharing elements of its database with the party moving forward the specific details of this database sharing are currently covered under a confidentiality agreement signed between the l p and the campaign the l p doesn t currently have the institutional culture to know how a big campaign is supposed to be run how to raise money and how to spend it says youth for johnson s weinman nearly every local candidate interviewed laments that neither their state nor the national party machines are able to do much of anything for them other than provide ballot access one conflict almost certain to come up at the 2018 libertarian party convention is what to do should the next presidential candidate break through the 5 percent barrier nationally clearing that milestone would make the party eligible for federal campaign funds most of the activists candidates and funders interviewed for this story would have been perfectly happy to see the party s candidate accept the money which comes from voluntary taxpayer contributions it s a game changer johnson says you can t compete in politics without money but the radical caucus is much more circumspect about taking what they characterize as a welfare check what the party needs most nearly everyone agrees is more people willing and able to be candidates particularly if they have the willingness and ability to ask for money since the l p can t really help them with that johnson campaign worker and house candidate andy craig thinks the party needs to focus on intelligently learning about every state and federal legislative race in which a major party candidate is running unopposed such targeted investments of as little as 20 000 30 000 via either the party or affiliated super pacs could win state house seats with as little as 100 000 enough to win a federal one craig believes some lifelong activists are glum about third party prospects in a two party world i have been a member of the libertarian party for 32 years and never regretted a moment says bill redpath credited by many insiders for being the party s prime mover for ballot access success but i do not think it will be an electoral success until some form of proportional representation is adopted in the u s or perhaps ranked choice voting an idea maine voters approved in november being america s biggest third party does come with one distinct advantage if the other major parties should fracture or dissipate libertarians stand ready to expand i think in eight to 12 years the libertarian party could become the no 1 party in the united states in terms of size bill weld enthused on election night the line between here and there is not necessarily straight chris rufer a california based tomato magnate and occasional donor to reason foundation who gave over 650 000 to efforts related to the johnson campaign thinks libertarianism s eventual electoral victory is as inevitable as gravity but how to get there from here for now is a puzzle rufer says it s not going to happen tomorrow and that it s a puzzle makes it interesting jeff yass who gave over 1 million to johnson super pacs and who was new to supporting l p candidates this year says he s not at all discouraged that his investment didn t lead to electoral victory no matter how small the chance to live in a libertarian world he says i don t have to figure out the odds the payoff is so high it s worth it next

responsibility for comments which are owned by the readers who post them comments do not represent the views of reason com or reason foundation we reserve the right to delete any comment for any reason at any time report abuses i m going to offer a few comments clarifying my remarks which were given in a very long phone interview back in late october when we thought this article might have been a mid november article about whether libertarian should or should not accept federal funds if governor johnson got 5 1 i think governor johnson is great and deserves everyone s thanks i m sure he could have studied up even more and been even more prepared as almost everyone always can but i think what aleppo mainly tells us is that if an lp candidate begins to seriously pull votes from a democrat or republican the media in the case of democrats will follow the alinsky playbook to freeze and frame any gaffe and repeat it over and over with smear merchantry and spin to the exclusion of the libertarian s thousands of other speeches etc libertarian candidates in the future will have to be like the first woman or first black person in an organization is always alleged to have to be twice as good to get half the credit the bias against us is a fact of reality 2 i even think governor weld was overall positive given the increased initial attention he generated but perhaps an articulate and radical african american would have helped bring in millennials of color who were already giving gary johnson a look maybe i wish i had voted as a delegate for sharpe or that johnson had been more neutral in the vp race hindsight aleppo simply showed the usual establishment dirty tricks and hypocrisy was it the new york times whose crowing had its own two mistakes not the capital of syria not the biggest city in syria yet nobody talked about that because the establishment doesn t make mistakes the aleppo brouhaha was a typical media smear one johnson was totally unprepared for even though he should have been then he made the situatuin much worse by doing an apology tour and acting weird in other ways specifically the tongue out interview hopefully the next libertarian candidate will learn from the success of trump s tactics and go on the offensive when the media tries to smear him that could be true and he could still be the best candidate we had to run and we could still be grateful for his work and yet he wasn t good enough to get penn jillette s vote didn t penn moderate a libertarian townhall penn jillette voted for hillary clinton because his principles are up for sale i think any libertarian or objectivist and there apparently were a couple who voted for the apex predator level grifter instead of johnson or trump or mcmullin or even stein or a write in vote for one of the pauls has to be written off as a special needs personality who is delusional or deficient prima facie that includes mr jillette shut up and sing there s no doubt that the aleppo brouhaha was a smear by media scum in fact the particular media scum who set it up was mike barnicle the journalist who had to resign from the boston globe according to wikipedia barnicle was caught in serious misconduct in two separate stories in the first he plagiarized humorous material from george carlin in the second he could present no evidence to support fake news that he had made up the problem is that 2016 wasn t johnson s first rodeo he really had no excuse for being so poorly prepared for such smears the correct candidate response to barnicle s question would have been if the candidate did not understand what journalist had asked something like this in your question a leppo is a synecdoche a figure of speech what aspect of a leppo do you literally mean he also should have known to eschew intentional goofiness because it would be looped over and over again true it wasn t johnson s 1st time around he was awful in the 2011 debates for the gop nomination still lp nominated him in 2012 because they thought he was a big shot he was still pretty bad as a national campaigner what made anyone think he d be better in 2016 probably the same idea that makes people think lp still has great potential after 45 yrs ron paul and bob barr had gone back to the gop and mike gravel has retired so the choices were limited it s a smear to ask a candidate for us president a question about a city that is a major focus of current foreign policy events if clinton or trump had been asked that question and given the answer that johnson gave reason would be tripping over itself to repeat the event endlessly as evidence that they were dangerously ignorant of current events i don t think many americans thought of the syrian refugee crisis in terms of the word aleppo until after that exchange that s why there was a spike of people googling the term that day i think the msnbc people even knew that and deliberately had a question and maybe a list of them worded in a way to try to exploit the fact that gary doesn t read policy journals and international news they knew what they were doing for any libertarian to not see how the american media is a political party engaged in machinations for power not information is almost as bad as not knowing how price controls work trump s not knowing what nuclear triad meant is not comparable because that s just a bit of jargon trivial to the discussion of the actual issues involved aleppo by contrast is the name of a place that d been in the news quite a bit so johnson s not knowing it shows he wasn t taking the campaign seriously enough to pay att n to foreign affairs no you are completely incorrect i read about the syrian refugee crisis daily before that and i didn t think of aleppo either http www breitbart com 2016 benghazi but perhaps an articulate and radical african american would have helped bring in millennials of color who were already giving gary johnson a look facepalm you aren t going to get blocks of votes by pandering to sjws and the people controlled by the sjws the lp isn t going to be more relevant with a black vp or a transgender vp or a monkey in a tutu vp the people who would be impressed by that are owned by the democrat party and you will not win that fight there s a reason that sarah palin didn t impact the 08 election nearly as much as the gop had hoped and it s because the racists sexists and bigots that vote based on skin color gender and other characteristics are dyed in the wool democrats if the lp wants a serious look from a large block of people they need to reach out to their ideological similars the conservatives that aren t super into social conservatism a ticket that talked about restoring private property rights to business owners rolling back and modifying some of the 2nd amdmt regulations restoring sovereignty to the states and nuking the irs while also talking about overhauling how this country handles drugs and marriage would have been a great home in the 16 election for disaffected voters from both parties that either held their nose for their respective candidate or didn t bother to vote it is precisely this attitude that repels monkeys with tutus oddly in the planet of the apes movies and series the simians are all very binary and heterosexual they seem to have deported the bonobos koja is a bonobo so perhaps a racy adult spin off series is in the works if the lp wants a serious look from a large block of people they need to reach out to their ideological similars the conservatives that aren t super into social conservatism this there are many conservatives around who for a variety of reasons are disenchanted with the gop given that the democrats are all in for statist progressivism while the gop at least pays lip service to individual liberty and personal responsibility it would seem that this is where the lp should be looking anyone who buys what the democrats are selling is basically unreachable of course i m no professional political strategist but then the professional political strategists did get their collective ass handed to them this election the lp should learn from this because courting those icky conservative types means giving up on open borders reading comments i think there are a lot of libertarians that are statist assholes trying to escape the label while not actually stopping being statist assholes a lot of libertarians that are statist assholes trying to escape the label while not actually stopping being statist assholes 99 of them follow the statist bigotry of the paulist cult it helps if they know nothing about the constitution thus easily manipulated by ron s raging authoritarianism trump got more black voters than romney did hillary got fewer than obama why couldn t johnson 2016 get more than johnson 2012 and why couldn t amash 2020 get more than that q how many angels can dance on the head of a pin a it doesn t matter i think you missed his point bruce identity politics is a game of the left which incidentally didn t work out very well even for them this time libertarians shouldn t follow the democrats down this rabbit hole no i think you missed the point by failing to make distinctions i don t think say larry sharpe etc running on an lp ticket and talking about school choice or criminal justice reform or the war on drugs or how regulations kill small start ups and jobs is identity politics it s just larry sharpe talking about what he believes but young black voters and even voters of other races might pay more attention than they did to bill weld because his candidacy seems different or he looks more like them etc i know i pay slightly more attention to what gay public figures say usually i am even more irritated and offended because i m gay i lots of people do this that s not the same as running on some divisive platform where you play a victim card or only talk to one group or only talk about your identity i think i understand you very well and just to be clear i m not trying to demonize your positition but i emphatically disagree with you and i want to respond to your points thoroughly i don t think say larry sharpe etc running on an lp ticket and talking about school choice or criminal justice reform or the war on drugs or how regulations kill small start ups and jobs is identity politics it s just larry sharpe talking about what he believes great then let him run and win or lose on the merits of his ideas and his positions not the color of his skin sexual orientation etc no i think you missed the point by failing to make distinctions it is a distinction without difference if the lp begins to pick candidates in an attempt to target specific groups on the basis of these types of personal characteristics because he looks more like them that most certainly is identity politics no overt victim mongering is necessary for this to be true underdog and therefore special status is implied by giving any preference to a candidate based on these types of things i know i pay slightly more attention to what gay public figures say usually i am even more irritated and offended because i m gay i sic lots of people do this that doesn t make it right or even very smart i m still not convinced it is identity politics it s picking a candidate who you think voters you want to reach will pay attention to and favor for decades parties have picked men tall people people who had some charisma and looks and sex appeal when they could find them people with blue eyes way disproportionate among elected presidents i am told and people who are from populous states or who balance the geographical appeal of their running mate by being from another area were those identity politics is picking a tall westerner or a southerner with charm identity politics i should also mention that incidentally i would ve preferred larry sharpe or any number of others to bill weld for the vp nominee incidentally i understand that larry sharpe would get votes at the margin that a white candidate wouldn t get just like gayjay got votes from gay and stoner voters that another candidate wouldn t have gotten people really do vote on such silly things but the lp convention focus should be on whoever can deliver our message as best as possible regardless of such extraneous factors we need someone smart articulate and principled if larry sharpe can win their support on that basis then great but not because he has a bit more skin melanin than someone else on the stage that being said larry would have been waaaay better than that jackass weld you want to get more black votes play to their clergy not to their issues identity politics is a game of the left another severe denial on the right who play the same game with different voting blocs who also deny their own forceful imposition of pc speech codes their own trigger points and more the war on christianity is identity politics and all it s related hysteria which is a trigger point but fox news is a safe zone libertarians exposed their fraud and bullshit decades ago a simple equation left right zero umm that means no difference two warring tribes of thugs fighting over which s values should be mandated on everyone by force even counterfeit libertarians also both left and right a growing majority of american rject them both liberty is advancing as libertarianism remains stuck in the same quagmire of self righteous irrelevance for 30 years i see no reason why a libertarian can t but libertarians are never going to win the identity politics game it s a collectivist game and collectivist libertarianism just doesn t make sense as an ideology the way for libertarians to pick up votes isn t demography it s to make the case for libertarianism to different groups hell the case for libertarianism for blacks is very straightforward even if it s just we won t throw your young men in rape cages it just strikes me that too many libertarians are afraid to make it that s the case for the ism but it s not the case for voting people don t consider issues that much when voting for politicians more often they re voting for a friend of a friend of a friend that s why i say if you want more black votes you should play to their clergy rather than to their issues or play to their entertainers or to their barbers beauticians or cab drivers or doctors or dentists libertarians are never going to win the identity politics game it s a collectivist game but you play it even worse than they do the way for libertarians to pick up votes isn t demography it s to make the case for libertarianism to different groups identity politics proof hell the case for libertarianism for blacks is very straightforward even if it s just we won t throw your young men in rape cages appeal to their race this is why liberty is advancing across the board leaving libertarianism in the dustbin on history abandon david nolan for ron paul and die marginally improving performance in a demographic that you re losing badly can make the difference between major parties in an election that s close when you win the whites losing a little less badly among the blacks can put you over the top but that has no relevance to a candidate who s losing among everybody badly doesn t expect to come anywhere close to winning in that case it s better to plow more fertile ground there are more whites voting it s easier to get their votes you re debating which type of identity politics people don t consider issues that much when voting for politicians because more often they re voting for a friend of a friend of a friend that won t elect a dog catcher in any town over 1500 people most 12 year olds can do the math that s why i say if you want more black votes you should play to their clergy rather than to their issues or play to their entertainers or to their barbers beauticians or cab drivers or doctors or dentist fuck liberty which is not an intrinsic value for all of humanity liberty can be advanced by identity schmoozing who knew this is why we lose in a libertarian society we all live in gated communities with private police forces and competing court systems john galt s statue stands in every town square in a free society galt s gulch exists right next to a marxist commune lesbians up the street from a community of christian fundies retired catholic priests across the field from wiccans each community would be voluntarily populated and that statue would be voltaire inscribed i disagree with what you say but i will fight to the death for your right to say it americans can smell the self righteous contempt at 1000 yards that is why john weld was humiliated the defense rests if the lp wants a serious look from a large block of people they need to reach out to their ideological similars the conservatives that aren t super into social conservatism then you say the candidate should be for rolling back and modifying some of the 2nd amdmt regulations which is part of the media s very definition of social conservatism seriously your average voter will identify the classic socon issues as god guns gays and abortion and you re looking for a non socon candidate with a socon stance on guns guns are a socon issue if it is it s one socon issue that lots of non socons agree with the socons on but i d say the classic socon issues are god gays abortion and porn sure the media loves to paint guns along with home schooling as socon issues but that s because the media wants to smear those two issues by association with those nasty socons and even if the average voter does associate guns and home schooling with socons support for those two issues is still a consistent with libertarian principles and b a refutation of the charge that libertarians are just liberals who want to legalize pot maybe johnson should have stolen austin s bumpersticker about protecting the 2a rights of gay couples guarding their marijuana fields i can t believe i forgot homeschooling yes there s a classic socon issue i can t believe you forgot porn as being a classic socon issue deep lurker is taking on a whole new meaning i knew i d seen that on something in a store somewhere if the lp wants a serious look from a large block of people they need to reach out to their ideological similars the conservatives that aren t super into social conservatism or someone who simply isn t afraid to make the case for libertarianism for that block i remember the cnn townhall johnson got a question about blm from a black woman now this should have been a golden opportunity for a libertarian to hammer home the fact that libertarians have been pounding the table about overpolicing and law enforcement excess for longer than most of the blm folks have been alive instead we got johnson prattling buffoonishly about how blm is a wake up call and we need to spend more money on inner cities pathetic dalasio says we should be talking about ourselves instead of voters 19 year old salespeople are smarter than that that s the price we pay for never electing anyone abject ignorance of electoral politics wouldn t work in 2016 since the gop was running just such a candidate and people like winning the media won t care if the lp pulls voters from the gop bruce they may very well cheer it the media won t i think what i posted reflects that the gop will and they will use whatever tools they have e g ballot access the democrats use what they have which includes the media baloney if the media wanted to stop johnson they merely had to deny him coverage they invited him onto their shows they invited him onto their shows the media didn t consider johnson a threat to hillary they gave him air time because they thought he d steal votes from trump in other words he was a useful idiot unfortunately for them he hurt hillary too chip chip chip read your austrian econ you are thinking statically not dynamically at first the media loved johnson weld because they thought they would sap gop votes being former gopster guys when they realized kind of retardedly late actually that polls showed them hurting their grifter queen they still covered them but only to belittle them but perhaps an articulate and radical african american would have helped bring in millennials of color fuck principles identity politics could bring us an entire 3 4 of the vote but this movement has not gone totally off the rails right what failed was the wacky notion that vague mumbling about libertarian ideas without a single policy solution could win the day in an opening that many of us have worked 40 years or more toward 3 i actually said or meant to say before aleppo i only got thumbs up honks claps and affirmative shouts when i was wearing a johnson t shirt or putting out yard signs after aleppo i still did though about every 8th person not every 8 steps was someone who said something negative 4 i didn t actually criticize or mean to criticize the lp national hq as being dysfunctional i said that both the gary johnson campaign and the lp national office were unable to deal with the huge demand for signs shirts buttons stickers door knockers initially initially i had to order buttons from private vendors on amazon prime to have them in time for a gay pride table and other events in june as it was clear the order i placed with the campaign would take weeks to be filled both organizations eventually caught up with the huge demand for johnson material the lp national hq called in volunteers from the dc metro area to help do shipping the johnson campaign began sending massive boxes of signs and t shirts and bumperstickers to each state campaign chair though i did as the dc johnson campaign chair run into dc residents who had donated money to the johnson campaign and never had anything t shirt button etc sent to them so i was able from my massive stores to give them something if anyone wants a bumpersticker just contact me brucemajorsdc gmail com and a sase will get you one interesting not a single word about issues or solutions sigh what bruce said still has bearing on the analysis of gj s defeat i absolutely agree that the aleppo moment illustrated the media s extreme bias against third party candidates especially libertarians and this is a teachable moment to all future libertarian candidates assume that the media is an enemy and be prepared to have to fight all the unjust caricatures that they like to box libertarians in with that means lots of media training with special focus on adversarial interviewing techniques how to stay in charge of the message without seeming combative i think it s an overstatement to view aleppo as some sort of turning point gj was in trouble before that religious liberty is a black hole etc and aleppo was the final nail in the coffin the biggest enemy to the lp ticket this go around was the lp ticket the biggest enemy to the lp ticket this go around was the lp ticket absolutely for several reasons 1 gary johnson wasted time trying to appeal to the left the left hates libertarians to the depth of their souls if the lp ever wants to break 10 they ll need conservatives that of course means abandoning open borders a loser of a platform 2 leave the identity politics to the democrats who themselves suffered the consequences of calling people racists i cringed when gj corrected people s speech when they used terms like illegals 3 gj comes across as a bit loony when he gets in people s faces and yells at them then he stuck out his tongue during that one interview which surprised the hell out of the interviewer that looked bad 4 bill vouching for hillary weld hey dumbfuck aka paradigm libertarians have been socially liberal since 1969 can you engage in a mature discussion without insults i haven t seen substantial evidence to suggest you are capable or willing i wasn t talking about social liberalism gay rights abortion etc i was talking about how johnson would act like a sjw on the campaign trail he would say this or that is racist he d act like a progressive brown shirt by correcting people s speech when they used words like illegal instead of undocumented and whether you want to admit it or not open borders will only help progressive democrats they ll see to it that the undocumented s get enough benefits to keep them voting for bigger government which precludes the lp s winning anything can you engage in a mature discussion without insults i sincerely apologize for my totally unjustified reply to your errors i haven t seen substantial evidence to suggest you are capable or willing you turn to apologize scan the page i wasn t talking about social liberalism gay rights abortion etc umnnn that s part of the left and much larger than you surmise the left hates libertarians to the depth of their souls same error only extreme fiscal ones who are as useless to liberty as extreme social conservatives if the lp ever wants to break 10 they ll need conservatives that of course means abandoning open borders same error bias and ignorance of defining issues open borders are socially liberal i ll spell it out the common thread linking fiscal conservatism and social liberalism is individual liberty opponents of marriage equality and the like want government to impose and mandate their values on everyone by force no better than health insurance mandates from the fiscal left 59 of americans would accept the description of fiscally conservative and socially liberal so why would you target a mere fraction of that don t forget the apology i sincerely apologize for my totally unjustified reply to your errors apology accepted i think we probably agree on several things in using the word conservatives i am not talking about the jesse helms types on the extreme right who want gay people to crawl under their beds i don t even consider them conservatives they re evangelical christians and they re a lot like the hard left they are jealous intolerant and they vote based on useless items like the fact that romney is a mormon like leftists their greatest fear is that someone somewhere is having a good time the 10 to 15 of voters on either extreme end of the political spectrum are not conservatives and liberals in my opinion they are just inflexible pains in the rest of our asses johnson should not be wasting time and money trying to appeal to them and in behaving like a sjw hurling racism charges policing people s speech giving legitimacy to climate hysteria he went after the 10 15 on the hard left not social liberals even if he doesn t think he s campaigning to the hard left the roughly 70 of people in the middle are turned off when we hear the sjw crap come out of his mouth just my observations the left will find it very difficult to win elections from now on they have been calling people racists for 30 years and don t know how to do anything else and neither does the media i haven t seen substantial evidence to suggest you are capable or willing you turn to apologize scan the page don t forget the apology apology accepted you forgot ok i apologize this will be my final post as this article is moving down the list dchang0 blame the media instead of a fucking movement that has no policy solutions to anything every candidate had a screwup that big and they all got ridiculed but they had substance dumb substance but substance gary had nothing he relied on the movement which was suicidal hell trump fucked up worse than that 2 3 times every week and he still is i think you re reading too much into what i said i m not blaming the media as the sole or main source of gj s failure i m saying that as a bare minimum any lp potus candidate needs media training and lots of it and i fully agree with you that gj and the national lp did not present any serious policy solutions not beyond one liner soundbites at least but i don t agree with you that every other candidate had substance especially hillary relying on identity politics avoiding presenting any solutions at all out of all of the candidates the only ones that went beyond soundbites were imo rand paul and ted cruz but both of them are already known for getting deep into policy details as senators the rest offered platitudes that were essentially carefully tailored dog whistles to certain constituents but i don t agree with you that every other candidate had substance i did say dumb substance hilary had the most by far well over 50 trump had a fraction of that and has since reversed almost all of them but his bombast played well especially hillary relying on identity politics avoiding presenting any solutions at all huh she had over 50 detailed policy positions and papers on every major issue plus hot button issues for all the main dem constituencies nearly 40 topics here all in simple english https www hillaryclinton com issues each topic has at least 2 3 policy proposals behind the soundbite the rest offered platitudes that were essentially carefully tailored dog whistles to certain constituents preciseiy like rand and ted extreme social conservatives are a powerful constituency but too small on their own and too divisive to build a meaningful coalition that s how rand shot himself in the foot he spoke to a cheering crowd at berkeley on nonintervention then less than a week later he pissed it away by calling for nationwide religious tent to oppose the severe threat if marriage equality that is identity politics he was pandering to two totally opposites constituencies jesus christ he spoke to a cheering crowd at berkeley on nonintervention then less than a week later he pissed it away by calling for nationwide religious tent to oppose the severe threat if marriage equality that is identity politics being for nonintervention and against marriage equality is not automatically pandering to two different groups 1 someone can be a straight up isolationist and against gay marriage simultaneously not everyone can be shoehorned into the left right identity groups 2 there are perfectly libertarian arguments to be made against the obergefell version of marriage equality it s simply the expansion of a state licensing program for marriage something the government shouldn t be involved with in the first place it s really akin to the notion that to regulate and tax marijuana is not the same thing as to legalize and let go of it and that is the position rand paul holds he wasn t pandering to anyone those are consistent positions he spoke to a cheering crowd at berkeley on nonintervention then less than a week later he pissed it away by calling for nationwide religious tent to oppose the severe threat if marriage equality that is identity politics being for nonintervention and against marriage equality is not automatically pandering to two different groups berkeley liberals would not be offended 2 there are perfectly libertarian arguments to be made against the obergefell version of marriage equality do you have any or just memorized slogans it s simply the expansion of a state licensing program for marriage something the government shouldn t be involved with in the first place what do we do while government is still involved limited my that pesky constitution government should not be involved except to dole out hundreds of special legal and tax preferences as a strict constitutional conservative you would piss and shit on the constitution if government does things it shouldn t if government overreaches then punish the people he wasn t pandering to anyone those are consistent positions umm is it totally stupid to assume berkeley liberals would not be repulsed by nationwide religious tent revivals to promote severe violations of civil liberties equal rights and several constitutional guarantees podesta is that you bully tyler c bully confused by tyler s incoherent screeching do page search for his name see a total of 5 comments so far every single one an unprovoked attack against me not a single comment on any issue or topic not one pure aggression and a lot of self righteous whining two possibilities 1 he runs with the pack of wild dogs here which tracks and kicks the shit out of anyone who challenges their politically correct rules and restrictions 2 he made a total public ass of himself so created a new identity for the sole purpose of attacking me quite common part of the wild dogs but a raging psychopath reason comments are teeming with them like any market the only place which does not ban or moderate cyber bullies attracts an ever growing number of them as their asses get thrown off every other site please do not judge libertarian values by our own wacky extremists every tribe has at least one faction to be ashamed of the assault on aleppo was all over the news he s running for president he should have known about foreign policy matters in the news maybe the question wasn t phrased in the most helpful way but that s not the point this is especially damning since we ve been drubbed over the head with how qualified and credentialed and experienced johnson weld was it was bullshit because the media hack asked him what are you going to do about al eppo which is complete nonsense the implication is that he asked what do you think the us should do about the syria civil war or even more specifically what is you position on refugees fleeing the syrian civil war but note that said hack did not ask either of those straightforward questions it is analogous to someone asking a presidential candidate in 2004 what are you going to do about basra but note that said hack did not ask either of those straightforward questions it is analogous to someone asking a presidential candidate in 2004 what are you going to do about basra it s unfair of them to ask you questions like that is not an interview strategy ask them to rephrase the question to be less vague and more on point stall a little get clarification until you understand that they are talking about a city in the middle east that s being fought over by statists then answer something like we should have done the same thing that jfk should have done about the bay of pigs and do some fucking debate prep beforehand ask them to rephrase the question to be less vague and more on point he did that too much in 2011 already somebody asks you a vague question then good use it as an entry for a point you want to make if somebody d asked me i d ve said leave it to the russians or to assad this is the exact point i ve made before about why i so disappointed in johnson s performance the man was elected to statewide office twice admittedly in new mexico but still i assume it requires some degree of skill so he should have the ability to deflect or spin his way through a question he doesn t immediately understand or know the answer to doesn t matter how they phrased the question if he didn t know what aleppo was in the first place he didn t even know it was the name of a geographical location for heaven s sake said hack did not ask either of those straightforward questions it is analogous to someone asking a presidential candidate in 2004 what are you going to do about basra that seems to me like a perfectly straightforward q that a prez candidate should ve been able to address chip your pets the assault on aleppo was all over the news as were at least 50 massive fuckups by trump you need a new excuse i absolutely agree that the aleppo moment illustrated the media s extreme bias against third party candidates especially libertarians and this is a teachable moment to all future libertarian candidates assume that the media is an enemy and be prepared to have to fight all the unjust caricatures that they like to box libertarians in with that s an incorrect analysis and part of the problem the bulk of the media are out to get anyone who s not a left wing candidate if you assume that they are merely targeting third party candidates you are going to continue to make mistakes i m not saying libertarians should ally with the right but libertarians should realize that while the right might occasionally target libertarians as a target of opportunity the left will consistently target you i absolutely agree that the aleppo moment illustrated the media s extreme bias against third party candidates especially libertarians and this is a teachable moment to all future libertarian candidates assume that the media is an enemy and be prepared to have to fight all the unjust caricatures that they like to box libertarians in with that s an incorrect analysis and part of the problem the bulk of the media are out to

the right but libertarians should realize that while the right might occasionally target libertarians as a target of opportunity the left will consistently target you my comments were only to clarify the quotes and paraphrases of me in the article your contention is that johnson s failure to press issues hurt him more than gaffes or allowed gaffes to define him i ll buy that if he had announced a block grant type incentivization of charter schools and vouchers before trump did and harped on that and about 2 4 other such proposals that could be implemented in less than 4 years it might have made a difference white papers addressing it would have helped at the convention in may one delegate told me we were nominating an athlete who wanted to surf not a policy scholar i still think we should be grateful to him and that an athlete can hire a policy team to write papers but she was prophetic yep blew it big time a crushing rejection of anti government libertarianism they hate gary but he ran their type of race totally devoid of a single policy proposal when americans were eager for change the type of opportunity that appears only once or twice per century but nothing on jobs and the economy nothing on health care nothing on overall reform nothing on anything he could have won with almost any comprehensive platform fiscally responsible and socially accepting is a slogan not a platform we ve now seen how wacky it is to run on libertarian ideas how will they govern i have no idea does anyone gary is wise enough to know ron paul is no libertarian but somehow two experienced governors ran a ron paul campaign on nothingness slogans and soundbites they braggged of being successful governors but conveyed nothing on governance not a single word some of us have worked and waited 40 years or more for an opportunity like this how totally shameful how would libertarians govern apparently we cannot so who needs us the us we saw last year and spare the tribal bullshit how many of those votes were anti trump and anti hillary gary is wise enough to know ron paul is no libertarian that is really tough to conclude given his own statements he said those exact words in 2012 while paul may be the most libertarian minded candidate in the field of prospective gop presidential candidates johnson said paul doesn t fit the libertarian mold on a host of issues from abortion to marriage equality to immigration and marijuana he s a republican johnson said great i mean terrific johnson said sarcastically i mean the most libertarian candidate that republicans may end up fielding plus he s always stressed social tolerance or the equivalent gay jay is a joke period say what you will about ron paul and there have been a lot of insults being hurled by the sellouts that manage the liberaltarian party but his brand actually wins elections massie amash the pauls that can t be said for the sellout brand so popular with the reason staff that s an unhinged troll you re talking to just saying just say n that s an unhinged troll you re talking to just saying just say n i don t commit aggression laugh why the switch from hihn to this screen name giggles soils diapers what s your name and what can you link to lol i m not the one hiding my identity as i frequently link to the archive of my published works mostly to jam it up the ass of those who assume i must be a lefty because i escaped whatever brainwashed them galt seems an appropriate alias for someone who defends galt s unyielding opposition to aggression and other forms of oppression and thuggery the ron paul brand republicans running as republicans pretending to be libertarians which is actually what the reason com community is mostly republican in that sense drumpf is the perfect candidate all that remains is for him to be normalized here march by march johnson was a democrat with an r on his name nm republican austrian anarchy 1 7 17 10 48am johnson was a democrat with an r on his name nm republican 1 learn what he accomplished as governor 2 are you one of those who thinks socially liberal equates with only democrats and or only progressives no saying this or that is racist equates with democrats so why did johnson do it repeatedly because he is a democrat see also bloomberg because it often is racist and wacko bigots hate to be called out as such no saying this or that is racist equates with democrats and libertarians now answer the questions you re running away from 1 learn what he accomplished as governor 2 are you one of those who thinks socially liberal equates with only democrats and or only progressives i think our own internal lp consultant class thought running a successful governor trumped all other resumes ann coulter argued just 4 years ago that the gop should only nominate governors and other people with executive experience trump s election does somewhat overturn this conventional wisdom maybe we should have run penn jillette or drew carey maybe he would have voted for himself which is actually what the reason com community is mostly republican excuse me but here we call them by their proper name the stupid party say what you will about ron paul and there have been a lot of insults being hurled by the sellouts that manage the liberaltarian party but his brand actually wins elections you donl t know where to look 40 000 elected ones prove the opposite 57 of voters a nolan libertarians fiscally conservative and socially liberal and 91 of them reject the libertarian brand cato survey in our zogby survey we found that only 9 percent of voters with libertarian views identify themselves that way david boaz and david kirby correction 59 by the way there are people who argue that trump and johnson voters should be aggregated as should hillary and stein voters which leaves the smaller government side with 51 by the way you re talking mostly anti gunmint libs who destroyed the movement maybe 2 of the electorate the 59 have nothing to do with smaller government which suggests how badly they may have misled you here s a basic principle of salesmanship that i once taught to sales trainees as young as 19 you re not there to prove your prospect wrong you re there to agree with your prospect and ti show how your product or service will best provide what he or she already wants instead of babbling that free markets are better to our own choir why not give examples and narratives on how to it better our establishment has no clue what reality even is so neither do you most americans believe obama that a 50 000 school teacher pays a higher income tax rate that millionaires is that true what are the actual rates you call me ignorant of the work by mercatus cato reason foundation etc what has any of them reported on those tax rates the great recession was the worst economic downturn since the great depression was it what has our establishment said lady liberty is in the middle of a boxing ring arms at her side getting punched repeatedly in the face because nobody defends or promotes her they aren t even looking at her he could have won with almost any comprehensive platform extraordinary claims require conclusive evidence if the lp can t win with a moderate 2 term governor at the top of the ticket and an even more moderate 2 term governor as vp tweaking the platform won t help enough to close the deal johnson did great tripling the lp s historical high for support libertarians think he should have done better running against two unpopular major party candidates but their unpopularity and the closeness of the race is what kept voters from abandoning them they didn t want the other hated guy gal to win trump is a divisive celebrity billionaire how could any third party candidate have won against that i mean really 4 million votes for the lp was a miracle with regard to aleppo i think the question asked was itself telling as it included no context which i think most major party candidates would have been given in some form it was a question that was almost setup for johnson to fail when i attended conventions most attendees seemed to be on the radical side that obviously has changed a lot i also think choosing johnson again as a repeat seemed a mistake to be many of johnson s statements were amazing for their implication of his lack of understanding what the lp was supposed to represent lastly i think johnson played too much of a standard candidate who never seemed to really look for attention apart from his opportunities to talk on the media this too was a big disappointment to me as i questioned how committed johnson was his literally biggest advocate voted for clinton austrian anarchy his literally biggest advocate voted for clinton that s as bullshit as your link careful with the aggression and the bullying hihn don t feed the last tard left who doesn t know who penn voted for or that penn is 6 7 ish austrian anarchy don t feed the last tard left who

by a proven psycho psycho the exchange is only three comments back vomit bully ompey ho class mothersmucker bully mine was self defense yours was aggression by definition chump lol careful with the aggression and the bullying hihn yawn i attacked his link not him but you probably don t know the difference you really shouldn t attack his link in public unless you supply an actual video oh man you fed it attack video should always be live streamed on facebook you really shouldn t attack his link in public unless you supply an actual video a photo is all i need to expose his bullshit four times this is a screen shot of the blog page he linked to in case the psycho changes it http libertyissues com austrianasswipe jpg 1 do you see anything more than a picture of a reason cover 2 do you see a single word about anything let alone what he falsely claimed about penn voting for hillary 3 do you believe that penn jillette was literally gary johnson s biggest advocate here s his lie for which he

the pack of wild dogs here which tracks and kicks the shit out of anyone who challenges their politically correct rules and restrictions 2 he made a total public ass of himself so created a new identity for the sole purpose of attacking me quite common part of the wild dogs but a raging psychopath reason comments are teeming with them like any market the only place which does not ban or moderate cyber bullies attracts an ever growing number of them as their asses get thrown off every other site please do not judge libertarian values by our own wacky extremists every tribe has at least one faction to be ashamed of i actually thought johnson weld s liberaltarian flavor of soft scoop yogurt was a strategy for appealing to independents and democrats who could not bring themselves to vote for hillary including millennials of color and millennial generally http www breitbart com 2016 to shine but someone who was a paid staffer has since told me nothing was that conscious either way i think it was harder to emphasize policy proposals like deregulation or school choice if those sound just like gop proposals when you are trying to sound not like the gop in your cozying up to msnbc and other media of course in 2020 nbc and msnbc will be populated by megan kelly and gretchen carlson and greta van susteren when you are trying to sound not like the gop in your cozying up to msnbc and other media actually the opposite msnbc expected them to sound like gop that s why they had them on the obvious way of increasing lp vote totals was to peel off republicans from trump and msnbc liked that idea too they only got hostile when johnson acted like he was trying to steal democrat votes from hillary that may be why msnbc had them on but johnson weld had their own reasons for going on and they were to appeal to liberals democrats and independents they were kind of successful polls show in that appeal which is why the media turned on them successful they got 3 and judging by the differences between 3 way and 4 way polls probably 1 3 of that was people randomly selecting someone who wasn t clinton or trump either way i think it was harder to emphasize policy proposals like deregulation or school choice if those sound just like gop proposals when you are trying to sound not like the gop in your cozying up to msnbc and other media that s what we ve done for over 40 years fiscally conservative and socially liberal crosses party lines and a majority of voters well until lately libertarian party national chair nicholas sarwark crowed the morning after the election we control a bloc of the electorate now i know that he really means something less control and more represent but jeez could you please be a little less tone deaf that s the language i expect from hillary not a libertarian or even libertarian kinda like the libertarian moment not to mention that he s wrong they don t have any influence over even the meager sliver of the electorate who voted for johnson can the lp tell them who to vote for in 2018 or 2020 now the numbers are clear cato s brand preference survey was a shocker 59 of americans were libertarian would self describe as fiscally conservative and socially liberal that s the product marketers compare that with the brand to see if the brand enhances or detracts from the product of those who would call themselves fiscally conservative and socially liberal 20 walked away if that s also known as libertarian not if that means they re libertarian it got worse when they measured libertarian on its own 91 of libertarians refuse to be labelled as libertarian our brand is toxic the marketing term deadly for the product the survey is still on cato s website but it s essentially buried reason and cato now cite a gallup poll which doesn t actually measure libertarianism but they say it does so 52 of americans are nolan libertarians if they follow the averages that s 40 000 50 000 in elected local office actively engaged on their communities plus 150 000 250 000 activists so who is moving america toward supposedly libertarian ideas is it 52 of americans with a quarter million or more engaged in their communities or 5 3 who are movement libertarians 5 3 take those 5 3 add all the anti hilltrump protest votes and gray got 3 2 are we being hustled still record numbers of people are becoming lp members of course that might only be a couple of hundred thousand or so after martin moulton ran for office in 2014 in dc on a slate of 8 libertarians i did see someone he knew and african american democrat i believe tweet out that he had voted for his first libertarian ever i think once you do it once and tell all your friends you did it it makes it more likely you can do it again record numbers of people are becoming lp members of course that might only be a couple of hundred thousand or so that s registered libertarians actual members are much smaller of course how is that even remotely relevant when 15 20 times as many reject even the brand libertarian richard winger is the expert his newsletter was reported by politifact 325 807 registered libertarians nationwide the number of libertarians was substantially lower than two catch all categories which winger calls indp misc at 26 8 million and other at 2 9 million 477 129 american independent party california 430 072 independence party new york common knowledge the lp is the third largest national party which means organized nationally but any number of state and regional parties have much higher registrations so it s a bit of word play when i was executive director of the lp in washingington state 1998 2000 we had a little over 500 members i was also active in the national party which was highly secretive about total members a few eds and state chairs did our own research and estimated fewer than 20 000 godddamn hihn keeps posting and documenting facts gasp demopublican pols promise to get things done libertarians don t think the government should do so much that s why we can t even get a libertarian dog catcher elected he d say it was the owner s responsibility to catch the dog maybe more libertarians should run as major party candidates in the primaries there aren t that many around that s why we can t even get a libertarian dog catcher elected ignore the goobers and a lot of us win he d say it was the owner s responsibility to catch the dog or the ones who run for city council on repealing the federal income tax maybe more libertarians should run as major party candidates in the primaries the best ones do and win and achieve things when i was the paid director of the wa lp a guy joined the party he d been active around 15 years ago won a school board seat in a major suburb then ran for the state house as a republican formed a libertarian caucus bipartisan dems and reps wa may be the most libertarian state he rose to chair the house finance committee the third most powerful office in the state he rejoined the lp when he retired he had great insights which he shared in our newsletter engaged in his community he learned things that few people see my favorite that many people oppose pot legalization because they don t want their kids to see someone high on pot his legalization pitch was that being high in public would be a misdemeanor with a small fine like public drunkenness the goobers went ape shit with rage said he was treasonous conspiring with statists yada yada he probably did more every month in office than they would do in a lifetime which is why the libertarian brand is literally toxic a marketing term except for you you don t win you just about the shit out of everyone oh does that make me a bully tyler c oh does that make me a bully

asses get thrown off every other site please do not judge libertarian values by our wackos and fanatics every tribe has at least one faction to be ashamed of you actually have to collect massive numbers of signatures most places to get on an establishment party primary ballot in virginia right now people are collecting 10 000 signatures so ed gillespie can run in a primary as a republican for governor if the lp fields a candidate i think they may have to do that to be on the general ballot too you also have to have major donors a machine and pac money to do that though as amash massie etc show all those libertarians y all are talking about in this thread who don t vote lp will give money and knock doors for an effort like that that can win i am in favor of both strategies i m especially in favor of running lp candidates where one major party is weak or where a really bad major party candidate can be hurt by the lp like sean haugh in north carolina in 2012 i think when your candidate can be summed up to most people as just get him a bong already you ve failed remember aleppo the problem was not aleppo but gj s inability to recover from the gaffe and his inability to make a basic case for voting libertarian even the baseline case vote for me as the lesser of three evils morphed into the less compelling vote for the clueless one instead of the creepy one or the crooked one if i vote third party i expect to be told i m wasting my vote i shouldn t also be told your candidate is an idiot gj had the most impressive resume we have seen or likely will see for a libertarian candidate unfortunately it was necessary but tragically insufficient he was an absolutely terrible candidate his national performance was enough to make me question my belief that smoking marijuana is harmless clearly a self made millionaire and highly successful 2 term governor was transformed into a bumbling inarticulate ill prepared presidential candidate maybe it was the weed even limbaugh came up with a better libertarian answer to an aleppo question for johnson than anything johnson came up with on his own dressing up a democrat like a libertarian never works dressing up anything as a libertarian does not work best vote republican and convince yourself that you voted libertarian if a republican is what you want sure but the r s didn t even nominate one of them he had no platform running on theories and slogans is totally useless voters were eager for change and had no reason to vote libertarian i heard him describe voting for him as becoming libertarian which was a sure sign he d go nowhere he was so much better in 2012 i fear the movement may have destroyed him you know not that i think gary needs to be explained but people who write about ayn rand or murray rothbard or libertarians generally when they have lapses usually crankiness and hostility never seem to just realize part of it is maybe age or perhaps they merely disagree can one disagree without crankiness and hostility is it possible you mistake my meaning i wasn t referring to ayn rand vs murray rothbard i was referring to how both were brilliant in middle age and nastier and less interesting in their dotages ayn rand at 80 wasn t the same person as ayn rand at 40 ayn rand at 80 crusty would i wasn t referring to ayn rand vs murray rothbard they disagree with you so they re cranky nastier and less interesting in their dotages rand did the opposite which makes many libs cranky she even warned about wackjobs like ron paul who was far too extreme for even her virtue of selfishness chapter 15 government financing in a free society http aynrandlexicon com lexicon taxation html any program of voluntary government financing is the last not the first step on the road to a free society the last not the first reform to advocate it would work only when the basic principles and institutions of a free society have been established it would not work today dumbing down for ronpaultards 1 the first step to a free society is educate the voters 2 the second step is reduce government to the minimum necessary 3 final voluntary taxation a term then in use really pissed off all the libtards who think you start by repealing the income tax with a fucking stupid argument rand ridiculed libertopia the opposite of a free society by noting that galt s gulch was possible only because everyone there had the same values libs promote a free society for only us we get a wacky 1 000 point list of rules by mary ruwart how would a libertarian society handle anything whatever its people freely decided duh we reject voters so they respond in kind win a governorship first as a libertarian show the principles working in practice if your record is based on your background when you were a republican well aleppo is the difference that stands out a republican who did not know what it was i agree one thing we seem to have overlooked in the trump hillary election is the powerful role that national parties play a huge number of democrats lost elections at the state level this is due in no small part to being hitched to the unpopularity of the national party pelosi and obama what that means is that the party is a franchise brand and most democrats and republicans understand this if other democrats damage the party brand then down ballot candidates take a hit on the flip side a no name democrat can get elected just because he has a d next to his or her name the franchise brand lifts them up we also see the dems shitting bricks because they don t have a deep bench of experienced candidates to draw from for future elections and a pipeline of up and comers being groomed trained for higher office the lp has to build the same kind of political machinery that raises a huge stable or candidates up from lower office all the way to potus just like people are used to seeing a starbucks on every street corner they need to see a libertarian on every city council every county gov t and so on up to establish the mindshare needed to win potus i agree as much as i admire the lp s efforts i don t think they will be as effective at advancing liberty as the coopt the gop strategy taken by the pauls and liberty caucus downplaying and eventually eliminating the socon side of the gop will be incredibly effective judging by the behavior of millennial conservatives who tend to roll their eyes at that stuff the republican liberty caucus seems to me to have been dying and fractured before this election they often appeal to people in the dc lp to help them get a dc rlc chapter going they seem to have been quicker partly by over half their members organizing republicans for johnson chapters lp already runs candidates for state offices they have never done anything but play spoiler even there lp already runs candidates for state offices they have never done anything but play spoiler even there that s why effective libertarians run and get elected to state office as dems or reps the libertarian brand is toxic and the anti gummint libs screech that seeking election is conspiring wiith statists when i was still in wa around 2000 or so a guy rejoined the party after 15 years he been elected to school board in a large suburb parlayed that to the state house as a republican when he retired he had chaired the house finance committee the third most powerful office in the state he said he d met dozens more at political workshops and conferences the lp has little interest if any in electing people i saw that as a state lp exec director and on many national convention committees through the years scary win a governorship first as a libertarian show the principles working in practice showing the same principles work doesn t count if one is elected as a republican governor principle are secondary to party affiliation ron and rand paul are even worse no executive experience at all ot and fun for the whole famiy time is running out to pass this along to your unhinged leftoid friends say you saw it on a lawyer s website use link to the voting rights act of 1965 at wikipedia and of anybody says they can t find the clause just tell them trumpsters have been deleting important info from wikipedia since joe biden was obviously hacked by the russians it is time for the senate to implement a never before invoked article of the voting rights act of 1965 if the president and vice president in an electoral college vote have different numbers of votes trump had 304 pence had 305 the senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york can invoke the disenfranchised minority clause and reapportion up to 20 of the ec vote into line with the popular vote make sure to call the senate switchboard a switchboard operator will connect you directly with the senator chuck schumer s office on your request and tell him to invoke the dmc all my leftoid friends have banned me from speaking with them about politics for not toeing the sjw line i haven t gotten that ban last ban i know of was from one fb friend who was upset at my opposition to marriage licensing somehow true marriage equality made me homophobic or a gay basher i ve forgotten the technicalities but i have banned a few commie strangers and acquaintances from my hs days after they launched all manner of accusations the usual stuff racism for not being on the obama train nazi for not being in a sanders cattle car etc i had a surprise accusation from an aunt of mine who used to be a very sharp minded woman a few months ago she called me a trump supporter and ill educated for daring to criticize mrs clinton she showed up again today calling me a trump supporter for posting an earlier version of that plan to keep trump out of office anyway you have other friends and they have triggery little snowflake friends so share the plan with those you know and eventually it will make it to the right people and the senate switchboard yes ok looks like it is safe to talk down

exact same content read it i called him out as a bullshitter factually a he never mentioned penn he is a fellow thug who i also documented as a liar so austriamasswipe defended that thug with aggression b austrianasswipe is full of shit that penn was literally johnson s biggest supporter fail c austrtianasswipe s link to proof was also bullshit fail d and his comment on penn s height is drool running down his chin so called out factually he attacks me repeatedly for daring to challenge his diktats with more lies and aggression other goobers seeing the proof join the assault anyhow tyler c inventing his own special class of psycho he s like trump can say anything knowing his tribe will defend and assault it s just another vast conspiracy to the nodding bobbleheads see part 3 part 3 ridiculing austrian asswipe again in fact austrianasswipe is so psychopathic that he may go edit and change his blog so i took a screenshot posted on my website click here to see it http libertyissues com austrianasswipe jpg do you see anything about jillette voting for clinton sneer will you join me in laughing at austrian asswipe and his entire pack of snarling wild dogs or be in the goober tribe again acting in self defense this thread will be linked to as long as the aggressor continues stalking and attacking me no better than the very worst progtard tribe bellowingblowhards for liberty thank you reason for the only unmoderated political comments and for actually defending the cyber bullies who so badly defame our movement how stupid 1 a thug whining about bans by leftoids 2 documented proof of his own aggression and lies 3 his psychopathic reference to food also invented 4 fellow gang members pile on circling and kicking his victim 5 pkay because they re not leftoids 6 thug ridicules aggression as he commits it and then say your words are aggression the guy need his kids to come visit him at the home and make sure he s taking his meds snicker reason brags of having the only unmoderated comments defends a few dozen raging thugs inside the cult kicking the shit out of anyone who does not groupthink versus those who come to learn about libertarianism it s like any market if there s just one unmoderated forum then it attracts a growing number of cyber bullies who ve been thrown off everywhere else so a cato survey by a top pollster finds the libertarian brand rejected by 91 of libertarians in the election start with cato s proclaimed libertarians at 5 3 of voters add a yuge hilltrump protest vote equals gary johnson s 3 2 of the vote with ideas but no policies and declare a libertarian milestone they act like moonies branch davidians and jonestown but their koolaid is a different flavor so they re not a cult just another political tribe of goobers hey i wasn t convinced before but all the bolding worked follows hihn zombie like yes i am convinced too bernie 2020 yawn now austrianasswipe says i m a bernie supporter because only a

their parents proud would you be of your son all told the party has come a long way since its founding in 1971 when a small gang of dreamers hoped it would become a vehicle to get press attention for libertarian ideas maybe they should start leveraging it for that again beyond that johnson and weld do appreciate you keeping their names in the contemporary lexicon and ensuring they can translate their pop culture fame into continued business opportunities i have voted libertarian since 1973 but these two certainly did not represent my libertarian thinking so i wrote in ron paul and did not vote for the abominable libertarian offering did not represent my libertarian thinking so i wrote in ron paul so your libertarian thinking includes 1 extreme social conservatism 2 lying about the 10th amendment and ignoring the 9th 3 denying that scotus has any power to defend our constitutional rights which means no defense of our rights thus denying balance of power checks and balances and three co equal branches all while claiming to be a strict constitutional conservative 4 promotes the version of states rights invented by the kkk but calls it federalism strict constitutional yada yada yada states rights is an excuse to deny rights guaranteed to all americans in support of pure bigotry 5 claims states have powers which have never been delegated 6 sponsored a bill to forbid scotus from hearing any challenges to doma an open assault on equal right and trying to make homosexuals the first group of americans denied constitutional protection since slavery dem uppity negroes 7 claims we can repeal the income tax and run the entire federal government on fica taxes even though the fica revenues are a quarter trillion less than social security and medicare alone that ron paul might he be why the libertarian brand is rejected by 91 of libertarians cato zogby survey lololololololol don t feed it you will make it cry and austrian anarchy will go bat shit crazy with lies attacks and various aggressions the authoritarian mind https reason com archives 201 t 6665152 bully these dumbfucks confuse bullying with self defense they enrich my entire life i ll send the van round later to collect you you shouldn t soil a van for that people will have to ride in that thing later the mistake these guys made was to run as libertarians but then they could not get nominated on any other ticket the u s has grown too large for the populace to pay attention to libertarians if the federal government would collapse in some kind of convulsion resulting in a breakup of states into two or more nations libertarians might have an opportunity in the reorganization of a new government but that s the only way they have a prayer in the meantime we are stuck with finding the least liberal socialist marxist fascist candidate we can support in local state and national contests personally i like the way the confederate states of america was organized in 1860 but we ll never see that again either all they needed was a policy platform but the entire libertarian establishment has not one single credible policy for any major issue not a one and they have how much money for how many decades for an opportunity that arises only once or twice per century no the libertarian establishment mercatus the independent institute the reason foundation cato have a lot of policy proposals even the lp platform does the johnson campaign should have issued the kind of thick policy white papers the clark campaign did i tried to hint they should do so here http www breitbart com 2016 town hall but the media might not have covered them much anyway it kept claiming trump had no proposals and it really didn t cover hillary s either pussy grabbing etc were bigger topics maybe the next libertarian candidate should take a page from trump or a chapter and speak to more local media and do more tweeting and find other ways to bypass the establishment national media maybe the next libertarian candidate should take a page from trump or a chapter and speak to more local media and do more tweeting and find other ways to bypass the establishment national media not a bad idea the media is not a friend to libertarians the lp or our candidates johnson tweeted a bunch in 2012 and this time around the media would just ignore them trump s tweets got media attention because he was already famous and got spread by the media because they were interpreted as harming his appeal no the libertarian establishment mercatus the independent institute the reason foundation cato have a lot of policy proposals even the lp platform does not a one slogans and sound bites aren t policy cato s are so stupid they could be intentional fraud michael tanner is scary his social security privatization is bat shit crazy he admits the transition would be costly but a one time event omg a one time event that lasts 30 years with a first year cost over 350 billion look for details and paying for it is congress s job medicare vouchers are crazier insurance companies will increase competition in the wrong market insurance ain t health care duh it looks like privatization to goobers but insurers would add a costly and useless middleman between government and providers the johnson campaign should have issued the kind of thick policy white papers the clark campaign did ignore voters how many would even glance at substantial white papers we keep preaching to the choir and ignoring our majority who hate us maybe the next libertarian candidate should speak to more local media and do more tweeting and find other ways to bypass the establishment national media sorry sounds like another excuse to avoid solutions liberty works better for everyone just don t ask us how this comment only convinces me that you are ignorant of the work mercatus reason foundation cato etc do laughing name one i quoted their bullshit you just babble and add more trashmouth like the trump supporters want to see a mercatus report that lies about spending cuts including manipulated data published by reason lol gary johnson merely benefited from enough sensible americans defecting from clintrump which was historically unpopular he was never a compelling candidate who could bring together enough a coalition to threaten either of the major party when a white majority political party can t win the majority of white votes they will be forever irrelevant the lp didn t field a single minority candidate and the few non white libertarians with any influence larry elder sowell lean more conservative reason has no espanol counterpart and the one at cato is a ghost town johnson could hardly compete with the likes of santorum in the gop primary he secured the lp nomination the same reason my dad could be voted president of the family by my mom and my siblings a very small group of like minded people could effectively decided the nominee among a small group of nobodies who made half hearted attempt at running for the position the lp fielded a number of non white candidates i didn t pay that much attention nationwide but in d c martin moulton got 6 of the vote running against eleanor holmes norton and regained our permanent ballot status for the next 2 years https ballotpedia org martin moulton the dc non voting delegate has less power than the podunk county dog catcher talk about a stupid office for them to be running a candidate for yes but delegate norton has a lot more influence within a major party the government and the press than you do probably more than everyone at reason put together and she isn t non voting they let her vote on committees even now when democrats are in the majority they create a fake to be rubber stamped committee of the whole and put her on it and let her and the other territorial delegates i believe vote on it which is de facto the final vote and she isn t non voting they let her vote on committees even now she doesn t vote on floor votes committee votes are just procedural affairs set up apart from the constitutional powers of congress and even in committee her vote is meaningless if her vote is the deciding vote they throw it out yes but delegate norton has a lot more influence within a major party the government and the press than you do probably more than everyone at reason put together ah so now we re talking about ability to get invited to talk shows and public speech occasions rather than any actual power move those goalposts by that standard donald trump was more powerful than the entire house of representatives 10 years ago hihn use your actual account you can t run some random person with no qualifications no one has ever heard of for president craig says and expect anyone to take it seriously umm might disagree here did the libertarian party blow it early leader for understatement of the year the irreparable harm that gary johnson did to libertarian politics is a mystery to only those writing for reason yes gary johnson did indeed damage libertarianism 1 he comes across as a bit of a nut 2 open borders will kill a candidacy people don t want what europe has which will probably end in widespread violence europe may not have many guns but neither did rwanda and even absent any violence people don t want to pay for government benefits for non citizens which will only benefit democrats not libertarians why would welfare recipients vote for fake democrats when they can have real ones who won t run afoul of their party on growing government the democrats will eventually see to it that illegals can vote 3 saying policies and people are racist sexist homophobic xenophobic will also kill a candidacy people are sick to death of that myself included the solution to open borders is to advocate for the end of the war on drugs along with the exportation of capitalism to central and south america ending the wod stops the violence people are fleeing and implementing capitalism improves the lives of the people so they don t want to leave their home the exportation of capitalism to central and south america moar socialismz i somewhat agree with both of these calling trump a racist because he has been rude on a variety of subjects and he opposes unregulated immigration was a lie and given terrorism and also the attempts to replace american voters with new foreign voters i think lp candidates need to find a libertarian formulation about green cards and a free labor market that absolutely does not include easy citizenship and that involves much better vetting than obama did i think lp candidates need to find a libertarian formulation about green card i agree that they need to find a way to make legal immigration easier but increasing the flow of immigrants needs to not end in higher taxes so the immigrants can get government benefits if american citizens have to pay for free stuff for people who didn t pay into the system immigration will remain the toxic issue that enabled trump s election its pretty clear the lp won t win a presidential run yet with that i think the lp should run the best advocate for libertarian thought philosophy we should run people who quote mises and friedman on the fly they get invites to tv lets put the best message on that the focus for winning should be at a local and state level that is doable in any state and the national party would be wise to back the beat chances states the national party did better than average i agree that the focus should be on winning at the local and state level but for a more important reason than just winning we need to develop a pipeline for training lp candidates from the ground up you see this in calif with the democrats the whole state is basically a massive machine meant to propel democrats from local office into national office like kamala harris to the us senate the state s offices look like a game of musical chairs where dems hop from office to office gaining momentum name recognition and political connections but not skill and actual governing experience because they fuck up everything they touch it works several management books from the 90s talked about how the biggest corporations spend quite a lot of resources training up future management it is the same thing done in the political sphere but lp candidates have been running for those offices for decades they re still ridiculously far from creating such a promotional machine because they get elected only rarely because it s almost as hard to get elected to those offices as a newcomer as it is to get elected to high offices so don t try forever to create such a machine join an existing one that s what they re there for i think the lp should run the best advocate for libertarian thought philosophy we should run people who quote mises and friedman on the fly no people should quote them to politicians pols should not quote them to other people philosophy should be an input to politics not an output from it why is a party with 1 support trying to compete at the highest level win a city a county a state then worry about more don t start at the finish but they started in 1971 so it is their turn up at the party level and apparently the magazine level they begin sounding a lot like clintonistas they justify running a presidential candidate by saying it gets more attention for libertarianism of course the media usually utterly ignores the lp candidate and the one year they do show some interest the lp candidate was espousing the positions of a moderate democrat not a libertarian they didn t ignore the lp democrat this time he got plenty of attention like i said the media gave him attention because they thought he d take votes from trump not because they took him seriously as a presidential candidate the media gave attention to trump because they thought he would make clinton look appealing not because they took him seriously either agreed but the american people evidently took trump seriously and didn t listen to the media sorry to have to remind you but trump got fewer votes than clinton not denying the legitimacy of the election the electoral college is the agreed upon method of choosing the prez but it s not true that america chose trump three normally blue states mi wi pa chose him by razor thin margins rendering the opinion of the rest of the country irrelevant trump got fewer votes in the imaginary popular vote without los angeles and nyc trump would have won the popular vote by over a million hillary only won around 300 of the 6 000 counties in the us there is no perfect method but i d rather submit to those three states in the electoral college than deal with endless democrat fraud in the popular vote obama won 100 of the votes in certain districts in 2012 that is statistically impossible so the lesson is johnson could have preached the libertarian message if only he knew more than the pot line and the press would have been all over him as a crazy guy lots more visibility and likely lots more votes why is a party with 1 support trying to compete at the highest level win a city a county a state but they have only 1 support in the vast majority of the cities counties states too we are the only political party in the country that s growing libertarian party national chair nicholas sarwark crowed the morning after the election we ve tripled our vote totals over 2012 we control a bloc of the electorate that covers the spread in almost all if not all of the battleground states we ve beaten the other third party in every single state basically we got our ass kicked a little less hard this time like a football team losing 48 3 and celebrating because they didn t lose 51 0 like last week and can claim improvement paying no attention to the fact that this time was against a much weaker opponent it s funny the lp justifies continued existence despite electoral drubbing by claiming they re educating the public about libertarianism then they run a ticket with fundamentally unlibertarian positions utterly useless for promoting libertarianism obviously and claim victory because they got a couple of percent more votes this kid is a total moron fits right in with the lp looking forward to lp convention 2020 where jill stein and bernie sanders ally to defeat austin petersen penn decides to double down on clinton prompting reason to run this cover with a new date ala time and their ice age yes yes you blew it you wanted to attract voters who didn t want to vote for clinton or trump ok those people are all conservative republicans everyone else votes for whoever will give them the most free stuff unless they are already libertarian so because you guys hate religious people more than you love liberty you nominate the guy who is the least libertarian of the three people running you didn t give us a chance to move toward you you told us you didn t want our vote so we held our noses and voted trump i didn t i voted for gary but now that trump has won i am relieved to be honest and i ll be voting to reelect him the problem the lp has is how do you get anarchists to vote for you throw rocks at them you didn t give us a chance to move toward you you told us you didn t want our vote like i mention below this was the lp s version of pragmatism he was a terrible advocate for libertarianism instead he tried to pander to bernie bros dank ass sandboarding son sand luge the lp should drop open borders not only is it a political death sentence but in placing a financial burden on american taxpayers it violates the non aggression principle the lp isn t holding a gun to anyone s head to make them pay their open borders policies if left unchanged or increased will end in government force to make people pay to say otherwise is incurably naive keeping the borders closed is placing a financial burden on american taxpayers someone s got to pay the salary and benefits for 600 000 cpb employees and lose time in those lines when crossing and that s not including the cost of the wall that s a ready been built in money and civil liberty violations do you know how many americans now live south of the current border wall and must go through a checkpoint how many had their property ed d to get the right of way to build that wall there s costs on both sides of that issue bs the agents are not currently allowed to enforce the law and most americans would gladly pay that financial burden do you want the lp to win they won t win dog catcher if they don t enforce the law simple as that so you want no inspections at the border no checks for explosives weapons diseases etc cuz if you re checking for any of those you are going to have those lines and need a boatload of border patrol mike rowe kmele foster 2020 i m in oooh i d suggest the libertarian party run actual libertarians than failed republican centrists who smoke pot like gayjay what would that mean and what might it achieve unfortunately it will not get your kids to come and visit you at the home i m sorry hihn mostly because then they might keep you away from here bully tyler c called out runs away yawn tyler c will not get your kids to come and visit you at the home laughing confused by tyler s incoherent screeching do page search for his name see a total of 5 comments so far every single one an unprovoked attack against me not a single comment on any issue or topic not one pure aggression and a lot of self righteous whining two possibilities 1 he runs with the pack of wild dogs here which tracks and kicks the shit out of anyone who challenges their politically correct rules and restrictions 2 he made a total public ass of himself so created a new identity for the sole purpose of attacking me quite common part of the wild dogs but a raging psychopath reason comments are teeming with them like any market the only place which does not ban or moderate cyber bullies attracts an ever growing number of them as their asses get thrown off every other site please do not judge libertarian values by our wackos and fanatics every tribe has at least one faction to be ashamed of they don t have to be a purist if they have charisma johnson had the charisama of a wet towel you re a towel you re a beaner towel heard on radio about a protest at twitter hq in san fran the protesters demanded trump be banned because he s the next hitler etc in other news ryan lock a former british chef and nazzareno tassone a former canadian parking officer were both killed fighting isis this week they were 20 and 24 years old about 800 foreigners are fighting with the kurdish ypg forces against isis the ypg also known as the peshmerga those who face death have lost about 1 600 to isis including about 30 foreign volunteers how much has isis lost to the pershmerga since so many are actually answering the question in the title i will too yes you tards you blew it why you are even asking is the puzzle didn t you know you blew it when reason s staff was lining up to vote clinton didn t you know it when you were pimping johnson when you had an actual libertarian who made it to the top two maybe you didn t notice the libertarian in the room did you learn nothing from your std treatments after jeff flake hell that has been years yes the answer is yes you blew it and nothing will change others may laugh or spit at my earlier comment of a sanders stein lp ticket in four years but the way you are going it is fully within the realm of possibility and for my lesson in learning nothing that was not supposed to be a response to derpetologist exactly like trump austrian anarchy didn t you know you blew it when reason s staff was lining up to vote clinton show of hands is this hysteria wackier than his claim that penn jillette who he calls iliterally johnson s biggest advocate voted for hillary unless you swallow on tribal obedience that jillette actually was gary s biggest advocate or the austrian s revelation that hillary was born in kenya yes jeff is a flake i didn t like him then and i don t like him now i don t like the way he votes most of the time i voted for someone else in the primary in the election he won and he replaced the wrong senator but the libertarian party fail this year well the sub editors sure did but yes and no because of several things happening at the same time leading to quite possible the two worst candidates of all time being offered up by both parties solely for the sake of securing a win no matter the cost short or long term the libertarian party was in a position to increase the profile of third parties and they did johnson because of his centrist positions and relative normalcy i like mcafee but he s crazier than trump is were able to show that 3p s are not just a bunch of kooks at the same time from the way he dressed to his choice of weld not a libertarian nor a libertarian just a career politician and who couldn t keep himself on message and a whole bunch of other things showed that johnson was unprepared to handle the scrutiny that comes with being a serious candidate uptil i saw the paycheck for 7608 i accept that my friend woz realey bringing home money in there spare time on their apple labtop there aunts neighbour has done this for under 18 months and at present paid the loans on there house and purchased a new chrysler check this out http www homejobs7 com on their apple labtop fruit scientist for all the attention garnered by the radicals and freaks the pragmatists clearly won the day at the convention only in the bizarre context of internal lp politics can johnson and his supporters look like pragmatists sure he s a pragmatist in comparison to the murder suspect the youthful looking activist who resembles a student government president and the stripper dude but from the standpoint of normals johnson s approach to politics this year doesn t seem pragmatic at all but if you were trying to fashion a candidate from scratch who pragmatically appealed to discontented voters in 2016 breaking out of the libertarian ghetto and associated cliches about libertarians you wouldn t come up with a guy who ran a pot company who sticks out his tongue at reporters and who in express words endorses compulsory nazi cakes ay yi yi if this is the pragmatist what do the impractical people look like watches lp convention ew never mind now on a superficial level weld looks like a truly pragmatic choice despite a strong physical resemblance to leslie nielsen weld can come across as a serious and experienced candidate the sort of fellow who can talk and gesture like a seasoned statesman so if an experienced well spoken politician in a suit is the vibe you re going for in 2016 weld looks ok and if pragmatism means nominating someone who pisses all over your party s platform then weld s nominee is doubly pragmatic of course while i m not a political consultant i d think a party trying to be pragmatic would nominate someone who supports the ticket in fact that s basically the job description of a vice presidential nominee where s the pragmatism in nominating someone who just goes and vouches for one of the other candidates separated at http statici behindthevoicea n 0 66 jpg oops separated at birth all along they billed it as they were gonna be kind of co presidents instead of the normal president and vice president distribution which i found very strange not only is it stupid and weird it evokes thoughts of communes which is anti libertarian at least their campaign videos didn t have mawkish sentimental footage of their wives and children on the contrary where a regular campaign video would have had family footage the johnson weld videos had just two guys talking about how much they liked each other nttawwt good grief the entire l campaign was one giant facepalm one giant pragmatic facepalm well since it s only 30 degrees down here in the nation s oldest city i imagine some of you are a bit chilly this morning so as a public service i am providing the following that i saw this morning when i opened my dead tree edition of the nytimes perhaps it will warm you up a bit a winery battles warming but on this day ms jackson the vice president for sustainability and external affairs at jackson family wines was not just minding the usual haul of cabernet chardonnay and merlot grapes she also checked on the sophisticated network of systems she had put in place to help crops adapt to a changing climate http www nytimes com 2017 01 html r 0 oops i just opened the opinion section and found something even better here s the headline to kristof s opinion piece re the drought in madagascar as trump denies climate change these kids die meanwhile a guy two hundred miles away who finds climate change has led to his fields now being perfect for growing wine grapes can t get a permit for opening a winery because jackson family wines has successfully lobbied for regulations restricting competition in the wine business he will however soon have to start paying a climate impact fee every time he farts the proceeds of which will go into a fund to subsidize jackson family wines installation of 5 mw cooling fans to maintain a more suitable temperature in their vineyards and which will be powered by electricity purchased from a coal fired power plant in south dakota what are you saying it sounds like you are saying the whole global warming hysteria is one giant scam so is government the vice president for sustainability and external affairs at jackson family wines i am guessing this winery s days are numbered oh california capital of retardia i don t have the vocabulary to describe how much i loath the word sustainability nor do i but it occurs to me that the country really is more polarized than i have ever seen it the left has surged more than i ever dreamed it would growing up with the soviet union as an example of everything wrong with the left in a time where no one would openly admit to being a pinko what i am seeing now is kind of shocking their every premise every conclusion every course of action is so different from the rational that they don t even seem like members of the same species in addition to that the spittle flecked rants calling for actual blood and murder worry me quite a bit lefties are the same always and everywhere the only difference between the ones we have here and the ones who shoved bodies in ovens in europe who confiscated food and burned fields in the ukraine and china who led the struggle sessions in china is lack of opportunity i am hoping that a trump presidency might put a bit of a damper on all that but it looks like they are just going to double down and dispense with all pretense the only difference between the ones we have here and the ones who shoved bodies in ovens in europe who confiscated food and burned fields in the ukraine and china who led the struggle sessions in china is lack of opportunity i have to disagree with that i think the majority of the left here have been too deeply inculcated with the learned helplessness of the identity group politics of victimhood that they are psychologically incapable of exerting any actual physical effort beyond whining and crying it takes a certain amount of strength to commit actual violence and to people whose primary grievance is that they re helpless as new born babes from being shackled by the man constantly whining for somebody else to free them constantly complaining that everybody else has to change to suit them it would create an insurmountable cognitive dissonance for them to actually demonstrate the power to take matters into their own hands to effect change they re basically only capable of passive aggressive cry bully whiny bitch baby crap that you can and should slap out of them in about 5 seconds which is why i really wanted hillary to win either way there were going to be a lot of very unhappy pissed off people with a pretty strong belief the election was rigged and illegitimate but only one side has the will and the means to do anything about it i believe trump referred to those people as second amendment folks but i m not going to speculate as to what exactly he meant no sirree bob not me not suggesting anything i get your point but i disagree for this reason there are people available for hire to do the dirty work it s not as if your next door neighbor has to personally get his hands dirty my god you only have to look at the war on drugs how many leftist citizens would physically drag someone into a jail cell for smoking pot yet they sit by content with the status quo as their fellow citizens are dragged off to jail by the uniformed minions that they claim to be happy to pay for with their taxes beatings will continue until you decide to vote what we decide is in your best interest it is 20 here in central louisiana i went out at 4am to buy cigarettes and sausage biscuits the doors on my jeep were frozen shut had to yank like hell to get them open i sloshed water on the windshield to clear the ice and it froze on contact i ended up scraping it i don t think it is going to be above freezing today there is some ice on the roads and people here are morons behind the wheel in this kind of weather so i am staying in y all are stuck with me all day what time is it is it time to start drinking yet i didn t know you were allowed to stop drinking in louisiana last time i was in louisiana i stopped drinking around 4am i slept on a park bench in jackson square i woke up at 6am and went back to the bar we still had the pool table so i kept drinking and playing pool pretty clear to me these are symptoms of catastrophic climate change i sloshed water on the windshield to clear the ice and it froze on contact i ended up scraping it next time try a 1 3 water 2 3 rubbing alcohol solution yes they blew it i had great hope for johnson i was a never trump who had decided to vote for johnson as soon as trump started running away with the nomination but the more johnson talked the more i heard i want to legalize dope all i heard from weld was i want more gun control those are unfair representations of their whole set of positions but that is what stuck with me it came down to the three choices 1 i promise to raise your taxes and take away your guns 2 i promise to lower your taxes and let you take your guns into other states 3 i promise to legalize drugs and may or may not put more restrictions on your guns i had to vote for trump as much as i personally dislike the person the 2016 performance by the lp candidates was not a serious campaign to win anything not votes or respect johnson is a decent guy but has no interest in being president that was obvious libertarian or not the office of the president is a damn serious and important position and mr johnson s campaigning never ever reflected and acknowledged that fact weld was a democrat plant he was working for the dnc and hrc the whole way failure to perceive based on his governing in ma where his real interests lie makes the lp look like a bunch of idiots worse far worse than the fool johnson who set an honest if low and unserious bar i no longer take political libertarianism seriously philosophically i get it and am warm towards it practically not so much it is a pity when we see how actively bad the other parties including the greens are but there you have it the lp does not present a serious voice or a viable choice nothing but an interesting sideshow my advice is to concentrate on new hampshire and see what you can do in one place the lp is an organization of humans political libertarianism does not begin or end with it ot ban the fbi well penn it is not like they were enacted in an above board manner or anything can anyone tell me how the ft lauderdale shooter was apprehended i haven t seen it the lack of explanation has roused the tin foil hat part of me and i can t help but wonder if there was another civilian nearby with a gun he sat down and waited for the police to arrest him after he was done shooting thanks i didn t see that my hunch is that this is a simple case of ptsd iow not much to learn from this incident other than how to handle treat these guys with ptsd in the first place of course he adopted an islamic name in 2007 and was doing some kind of crazy allah praise music well before he was deployed anywhere a while back he turned himself into the fbi complaining of voices he was hospitalized for four days his guns confiscated and then returned to him if only the authorities had some warning the timing of a crazy person killing people with a gun right after the administration moves to take guns away from those they deem crazy is awfully convenient no maybe you didn t know he was in the gun free zone of an airport where all guns are supposed to be locked up unless it is a cop s gun i find the talk about being able to check guns in your luggage humorous just a matter of time before people are clamoring for banning such behavior common sense on the other hand is knowing that anyone meeting an arriving flight can waltz into the baggage area from the sidewalk with no security check anyone can do that today and avoid buying a plane ticket yep i predicted gayjay wouldnt break 1 i guess he got 3 2 i am so overwhelmed wait no i ain t the lp where never get anywhere for a bunch of reasons 1 human beings ate cowards freedom scares them being responsible for your own actions fuck thay shit 2 libertarians you guys couldnt agree on anything i mean yeah the pizza and beer memes are funny but there isnt anything say the sky is blue and some dochebag is gonna come along and talk about index of refraction 3 libertarian attachment to dogma take the border issue in a perfect world yeah sure there shouldnt be any brders but i dnt live in a perfect world but libertarions wont let that utopia go grow the fuck up marxism isnt going to gets its utopia and niether are you 4 you guys are usually good at the dialectic buy you get an f and because you cant do rhetoric you ll persuade anyone that might be symapthetic libertariansim get and f in rhetoric i am idiot youll never convince ummm are you okay troy let me know if you need any help buddy is this a good time to mention that you misspelled douchebag it s like he s doing an over the top parody of the johnmenter i will take that as a compliment it would be a failure of the hnr commentariat if one didnt even your attempt at a correction isn t correct sorry about typos i am really sick a cold maybe the flu bitv ueah typos on the internet oh no i blame global warming johnson defenders rightly point out that the libertarian alternatives were in order of popularity and a guy who angrily disputes the propriety of government issued driver s licenses they say it like meekly accepting having the automotive equivalent of a cattle brand is a bad thing though darryl perry would be more effective with less anger and more mild understated sarcasm it is a little out of place in a defense of the lp s viability to use the fact all their candidates for the presidential nom were terrible government issued drivers licenses i have bigger fish to fry we control a bloc of the electorate that does it i am outtahere rips lp card in shreds and throws it in the air while exiting room buncha statists 5 i suspect the libertarianish dont fuck enough that is if looked the birth rates of libertarians they are below replacement level why i wouldnt know some of you dont fuck enough because you are ugly pretty sure a marginally literate 14 year old wrote this some of you dont fuck enough because you are ugly to be fair crusty picks up a large share of other s slack sometimes when you fuck too much you end up living out of your car this was a race against a likely criminal who set the world on fire who would solidify obama s disastrous positions and an ignorant bigot the bigot could be dealt with later johnson imho lost for three reasons 1 johnson tried too hard to be a libertarian if he stuck with his gut instincts he may have lost some libertarians but he would have pulled in many others of course his lack of foreign policy knowledge did a lot of damage 2 weld as much as i think he would have been good in office was too concerned with preventing trump from winning clinton sucked just as bad and i wasn t going to vote for someone who was just trying to sway potential trump voters 3 the media was clinton s lap dog when johnson became a perceived threat to the would be queen they mobilized otherwise johnson s name was virtually banished from msm libertarians may have a shot in 2020 a moderate reasonably positioned candidate may have a chance against a collapsing democrat party and an ignorant bigot but your candidate needs to avoid the head in the sand extreme positions of the libertarian party taxes are necessary but they could be reduced foreign interventions may be necessary in extreme cases if you want to argue whether we should have been in wwi or wwii you won t get my vote would libertarians prefer a radical democrat an ignorant republican or a too moderate libertarian as their next president think about it terms of the dynamics some people are solids some liquids ans some gaseous the libertariansh are gasses we are by nature atomistic 4 years is a long time trump is going to suck at governing and has made a lot of enemies among tptb right now our economy is held together with duct tape and tissue paper and the fed the banks and many other interests could easily collapse it on a whim just by not doing their part no way the dems are collapsing they gained in both houses of congress and won the popular vote for president the loss of mi wi pa was a hillary clinton thing you can bet they re retooling for 2018 and 2020 as we speak and it won t be hard if anybody is collapsing it s the gop whose leadership is lining up behind trump like sheep to the slaughter it might not be such a good idea to hitch their wagons to his hairpiece we want less coercion fewer and better laws none of us want to be politicians and owe a debt of thanks to our candidates who help frighten the looters by earning spoiler votes libertarians are into weed not blow i voted for johnson but it wasn t cheerfully i sincerely believe that the lp could have done better in theory but not with the crop of candidates available gj and weld managed to estrange people they already had in their corner with rhetoric to appeal to lefties that would never succeed in attracting anyone the votes they got they would have gotten if they d snoozed through the campaign and skipped all their highly touted media exposure my longstanding pov is that the lp is a very poor vehicle for libertarian ideas overall i think if you want to influence politics in a libertarian direction you need to 1 pick specific policy areas where there is opportunity for change and 2 help elect congresspeople who are committed to change in those areas 3 once there help them in their efforts by explaining to the public why these changes are good ideas implicit in this is also knowing what battles not to fight i don t think a total package ideological libertarian candidate is ever particularly attractive to voters even libertarian ones frankly we don t even like each other very much a handful of ideological representatives is less useful than a few dozen competent ones who enable change in selected areas just my opinion i just don t see the lp brand being all that useful so weld perhaps cost the lp some 1 000 votes among the cognoscenti not even noticeable in the overall results if he was flakking for hillary it didn t do her any good did it when it all sorts out i believe there are about 100 000 to 200 000 committed libertarians in this country real libertarians all the rest of the lp vote are protests against one or the other of the major party candidates the size of the protest vote going to the lp will of course depend on the visibility of the lp campaign and the perceived kookiness of the candidate going forward the lp needs to decide if it wants to build upon the pure protest vote run real libertarian candidates who can articulate the platform and scare off 90 of the potential protest voters or do some pragmatic campaigns where the candidates acknowledge the platform is a dream but here s the practical things we can all agree need to be done now in order to expand individual liberty so weld perhaps cost the lp some 1 000 votes among the cognoscenti no that s pretty much the opposite of what i m saying they sacrificed scads of people on the nevertrump normally vote gop ticket who were aghast at trump and instead chose to try and appeal to disaffected bernie voters but whatever my larger point is that the lp is a shitty vehicle for libertarian ideas whether they do marginally better or worse in how much they lose by is in my view sort of meaningless p s congratulations on your receipt of drunken shout out on 40 of fifth column oh dear did the libertarian party blow it in 2016 short answer yes to the left mcafee wasn t the personality to bring it home either it s questionable whether libertarians had anyone in the candidate stable who would have done the job any better than johnson trump and clinton did perhaps that s the wrong question perhaps all these political parties blew 2016 back in 2012 and 2008 and we need to ask why there s such a shit crop of politicians with vanishingly rare up and comers and bright new sparks to replace them if they did though mcafee should have run the digital campaign that ad was pure genius html fail i ve been a lower case l libertarian for decades i m more than a little opposed to the official capital l libertarian position on open borders and in trying to persuade people to libertarianism have repeatedly encountered the same objection most people seem to think libertarianism is just another name for anarchy if the libertarian party ever wants to be a real player in american politics it s going to have to work hard and make some noise to correct that misapprehension and as far as i m concerned paragraph 3 4 of the platform needs a lot of work free trade is great as long as all parties play by the same rules and are of similar economic circumstances when china for example cheats on currency and in other ways and their workers are paid a fraction of what our workers are free trade falls apart and economic freedom demands the unrestricted movement of human capital across national borders no way if only because not every human is any kind of asset capital or otherwise that little caveat we support control over the entry into our country of foreign nationals who pose a credible threat to security health or property is nowhere near strong enough us immigration needs to be an earned privilege based on value brought to the country not a right when china for example cheats on currency and in other ways and their workers are paid a fraction of what our workers are free trade falls apart so free trade falls apart when one side has an inherent advantage in producing certain goods when guatemala can grow bananas without greenhouses free trade falls apart when the us can grow wheat without having to desalinate seawater free trade with saudi arabia falls apart that s the entire flipping purpose of trade to exchange what you can produce better for what i can produce better henry miller2 parrots the same lie the republicans made up the short platform says however we support control over the entry into our country of foreign nationals who pose a credible threat to security health or property this only shows the platform ought to be more to the point and distributed as mp3 in many languages so the league of non readers cannot be so easily gulled the platform is only 20 minutes long the republicans spent billions lying about our platform and hoping nobody would read and understand theirs when a republican tells you the lp wants to welcome in berserkers with nukes ask them if all persons born is better in the 14th amendment than all ova fertilized we also would do well to make sure that people who need political asylum can get it here they usually are an asset by the way here s my take for now the goal of a libertarian presidential candidate is two fold one get enough votes in order to be taken seriously and build a foundation for the guy who runs 4 years from now two educate people on what libertarianism truly is gary did the first one better than anyone before him has ever done and kudos to him of course he has the deplorable trump vs clinton dichotomy to thank for much of that as far as education i think he failed nothing wrong with the old fiscally conservative socially tolerant argument but only up to a point after the ron paul campaigns i think it was time to move past this simplistic argument hell i was touting that argument to acquaintances over 30 years ago and emphasizing the two primary libertarian arguments 1 the nap at its most fundamental philosophical basis and 2 the practical unquestionable benefits of free markets a la the economist don boudreaux the libertarian party will never do well in elections because people are rightly afraid a vote for a lp candidate is a wasted vote there is a solution the lp should organize a campaign with state party affiliates to organize referendum campaigns to promote irv instant runoff voting once it passes in states and people find it successful then some day it will have a chance on a federal level and only then will we have a chance for success for major offices the lp actually does better than the other parties when all factors are considered lp members are regularly elected locally libertarians welcome alternate pr systems and just had a successful campaign in maine the main focus however is spread of direct democracy as in florida lp members are regularly elected locally you must have a very loose definition of that word yet lpers piss moan about non instant top 2 runoff systems where those have been instituted wrong our spoiler votes scare the crap out of the looters problem is the ku klux tea party and econazi green party also scare the kleptocracy with their spoiler votes but the kleptocracy has to pretend otherwise and persuade the small parties to be so clueless as to sell out to kleptocracy promises to betray kleptocracy platforms both demogop programs promised asset forfeiture shoot first prohibitionism socialized medicine and bombing the other side of the planet our big advantage is that religious fanaticism of both the mystical and socialist varieties are waning colossal failures wealth and happiness increase in a smooth differentiable function as freedom replaces coercion and our model is way better than the low tariff mercantilism adam smith preached will they surrender meekly we may have to bitch slap them with some more spoiler votes covering the gap so what re https reason com archives 201 party blow the gary johnson campaign is now considered a model by world libertarians libertarians getting 4 5 million votes 4 5x past totals set a goal of 3 in every country in presidential elections in time the effect will be revolutionary even as pro libertarians continue their non partisan and local office focus activists from afghanistan to zambia have found his name brings immediate interest in discussions with prospects the reason staff should deepen basic research actual lp goals and commenters miss many facts the article is unhelpful one problem is the article ignores actual libertarian structures goals and assumes they re similar to other parties they are not libertarian post 2016 goals recommend work towards spreading the libertarian pledge and 30 local non partisan libertarians in public office and this is driving everything else and emplacement of direct democracy libertarians seek to develop partisan regional and eventually congressional people in office they also are at work doing this in all nations starting with creating or being a resource to libertarian direction interested parties in all nations these 3 goals that provide the soil and farm team for additional campaigns are outside the us lp and handled by 3 other groups libertarian program the libertarian congressional pac and the ialp the gary johnson campaign is now considered a model by world libertarians the johnson campaign is considered a model and not otto guevara and costa rica s partido movimiento libertario really what the flying hades does direct democracy have to do with libertarianism sounds like a really bad idea the gary johnson campaign is now considered a model by world libertarians 1 have the other two parties nominate trump and clinton 2 alienate your own base by opposing freedom of association 3 display your lack of knowledge about current events in foreign policy and even the places they are happening on national tv 4 have your running mate endorse one of the other candidates 5 get 16x fewer votes than the winner 6 6 libertarianism the us and canada lps set an example for the rest of the world most places communist anarchists scribble libertardio on a scrap of cardboard and screech about nationalizing stuff and legalizing murder but the geneva lp published a good platform in french and when mp3 recordings of lp platforms become available in many languages i m betting the tide will turn besides berserkerism the initiation of force and socialist genocide sorta quit paying dividends after nuclear weapons arrived on the scene note also johnson was the purist backed candidate and ran a libertarian therefore centrist directionist on the accepted motto for this phase of attention to less government and more rights his policy positions were well articulated at his site and he did everything the lp recommends based on what interests voters he was considered well likes and made libertarianism unobjectionable with majorities asking the lp candidate be included in debates politics is a trailing indicator of activism however and it must be remembered that libertarian focus is on voluntary personal lifestyle choices and local non partisan office those who voted for him were fairly evenly split among new infrequent voters dems largest group gop and independents he did better across minorities 4 and women than whites overall hispanic women and especially young professional progressive minorities loved him the clinton leftist aleppo and other smear campaigns backfired bringing international attention and raising his acceptability among progressive youth dramatically as they websearched what happened and realized the truth her attacks also undercut non lp libertarianist support that then stayed home or went to trump perhaps clinton should be recognized as lp recruiter of the year finally note also the or a main purpose of the lp presidential campaigns is to boost libertarian brand and improvements with public momentum and get the public comfortable with having an lp candidate in in the presidency johnson in 2012 did this with lgbt medical marihuana and in 2016 with the debate barriers essentially reversing public opinion in terms of acceptability a left poll group using a borda calculus found he would have won showing that libertarians are the number 2 choice for a growing number of us voters across the spectrum these re all lp firsts inspiring local and international activists they show the opportunity is in future elections and between elections lp members according to polls feel the lp should continue as the farm team develops to run retired or retiring distinguished past officials of libertarian bent from both older parties as it has since 2012 possibly with a vp who has done well as an lp member and explicit lp libertarian in state local office they wish the candidates to always hammer away at the debate issue as johnson did as their main platform for ongoing and past data driven work by l libertarians in nearly every country see the libertarian poll data fb workgroup https www facebook com groups 736882696414329 i voted for johnson in 2012 pretty enthusiastically in 2016 the last month of the campaign i was sorely tempted to go with the orange middle finger but in the end cast a vote for gay jo the lp has been a complete and total failure this will not change at least any time soon they should not be even putting up candidates for president until they score a couple seats in congress the goal for the next decade should be to get 3 or 4 elected to the house and possibly 1 in the senate the argument that running a candidate for pres will give more exposure to the lp has obviously failed miserably any lp candidate or any libertarian candidates in the future would also do well to learn some of the lessons from this election from the guy that won perhaps the most important is to never apologize to the media and progressives when attacked attack back harder you want to get good income at home do you not know how to start earnings on internet there are some popular methods to earn huge income at your home but when people try that they bump into a scam so i thought i must share a verified and guaranteed way for free to earn a great sum of money at home anyone who is interested should read the given article click this link http www joinpay40 com advice from an old fart for real progress forget the presidency get the whole lp organization behind a senate seat or two or three rand paul needs help so do lee and amash i think this would be easier to do and also do as much to further libertarian philosophy as a ron paul type presidential campaign this idea is not mine it has been around for decades and i think it has a lot of merit lp libertarians don t want to hear it and don t need to listen really they can carry on with their 40 yr old party which has gone basically nowhere with no prospect of going anywhere they won a few points more this time because the dem rep presidential candidates were so particular personally terrible so what the home for small l libertarians is the gop i know a lot of you hate bible thumpers but they pose much less of a threat to real liberty than socialists do whose number in the democratic base are growing if gary johnson didn t seem like such a stoner he would have done a little better if you d run weld at the top of the ticket i know even more distasteful to true libertarians than johnson a little better still doesn t change the basic fact the place for libertarians is the gop fighting the statist populists true believer trumpkins with some chance of taking back over the party so grass isn t legal how many really serious people care about that normally i would agree but the gop is in serious trouble trump is going to crash and burn in office and the idiot gop leadership is lining up behind him like sheep to the slaughter serious trouble being both houses of congress the wh and 32 governorships with even more state legislatures lined up with them yeah they might just vanish tomorrow that can change very quickly coming out of the 2004 elections gop had both the presidency won with a strict majority of the popular vote 55 votes in the senate and nearly the same majority in the house that they have now dick cheney was talking about a permanent electoral realignment in favor of the gop 4 years later they had lost both houses of congress and the presidency and even the ability to filibuster as incompetent as bush s second term was trump will almost certainly be worse the great disappointment will come when energy advocates realize they ve been had and the abortion banners see that robert dear is not going to be pardoned and put in charge of enforcing prayer and abstinence ku kluxers will not get to nuke mecca and trump will see to whatever dumb laws congress foists upon us including tax hikes asset forfeiture and mohammedan style prohibitionism i can already taste the delicious tears and hear the wailing and gnashing of teeth let there be schadenfreude alternately the libertarian party could promote actual libertarian principles and choose candidates who actually promote those principles but that would wacky right crazy talk straight up they have decided that playing dress up as a big party also means everything is a bait and switch don t be mean nick sarawak or whatever his name is needs a paycheck too it s been 45 yrs all this has been said repeatedly in cycles what reason is there to think lp has a future any different from its past it took the prohibition party 11 campaigns to make beer a felony that s 44 years the lp has forced the looters to make many changes so they could pretend to ignore us just like the kleptocracy pretended to ignore the prohibition greenback populist socialist and communist parties while stealing their planks but in the meantime they had much greater gains in the states than lp has lp hasn t forced the looters to do anything lp has discredited libertarian ideas by associating them w losing losers by losing so badly they keep confirming that our ideas can safely be ignored lp has discredited libertarian ideas by associating them w losing losers by losing so badly they keep confirming that our ideas can safely be ignored ideasm a k a slogans and soundbites totally devoid of policy solutions deserve to be ignored most prominent foundation libertarians agree sharon presley stated the challenge in an online reason interview 2 15 it is my personal belief that the libertarian movement is not really going to go too far forward until they get a better idea of how to appeal to the average person because the average person doesn t give a flying handshake about theory or austrian economics 6 10 we can t just say government is ba ad theory is just not going to convince most people as we saw on november 8th liberty isn t going to happen through government action it mostly happens through the failure of government action in fact i think assange describes what actually happened and what it means pretty well hillary clinton s election would have been a consolidation of power in the existing ruling class of the united states donald trump is not a dc insider he is part of the wealthy ruling elite of the united states and he is gathering around him a spectrum of other rich people and several idiosyncratic personalities they do not by themselves form an existing structure so it is a weak structure which is displacing and destabilising the pre existing central power network within dc it is a new patronage structure which will evolve rapidly but at the moment its looseness means there are opportunities for change in the united states change for the worse and change for the better so the real work begins now good one will rogers things in our country run in spite of government not by aid of it in fact i think assange describes what actually happened and what it means pretty well hillary clinton s election would have been a consolidation of power in the existing ruling class of the united states which is why only a special kind of fool swallows his denial on the podesta emails hardly a neutral party on the payroll of the russian government liberty isn t going to happen through government action it mostly happens through the failure of government action government action has been failing tor almost a century only if we can clearly articulate an alternative which we have so far failed horribly yes the lp blew it but i don t see how any other candidate could ve gotten higher than 3 johnson was not ready for primetime especially in the foreign policy arena his tax plan was also pretty questionable going forward i think the pragmatist wing has a better chance but the party can use a guy or gal who is more battle tested winning means changing bad laws the lp has been winning since it cowed the republican supreme court into the roe v wade ruling shortly after our hospers nathan slate got a single electoral vote i ll bet the looters also repealed laws against gay marriage the summer before this election because of the lp platform the close fight over electoral votes feeds us law changing clout even the candidates were better than we usually field for let s face it a brave show so we can gather votes and maybe elect a few candidates down ballot every lp vote has 6 to 36 times the effect of sellout votes or single issue lobbying the prohibition amendment made beer a felony with 1 4 of the popular vote on average we can repeal the income tax with similar numbers if we play out cards right i am also proud of nick sarwark s performance since when is a supreme court ruling that gives benefits only to mass prenatal axe murderers a libertarian ruling women need and deserve legal protection from abortionists women don t benefit from roe v wade abortionists do men who want to use us a sex objects do we bear the consequences medical emotional and spiritual and most of the time we didn t make a decision for abortion anyway someone else did and we were coerced yes the lp blew it libertarians blew it they should have gotten behind rand paul 100 gary johnson was an awful undisciplined inarticulate candidate rand paul is a good politician who can stake out a position stay on message win debates paul is the only chance libertarians have this generation to get anywhere near the presidency trump will implode the economy is not improving baby boomers are retiring the welfare state is bankrupt america is 20 trillion in debt trump will preside over continued stagnation or collapse libertarians and liberty limited government republicans should prepare for a primary challenge against trump in 2020 trump will be too old anyway if libertarians don t get their act together the next president will be a millennial socialist i bought brand new red ferreri by working online work six month ago i hear from my friend that she is working some online job and making more then 98 hr i can t beleive but when i start this job i have to beleived hernow i am also making 98 hr if you want to try just check this out http www homejobs7 com i like libertarian economics and the commitment to non intrusive government but the party always seems to end up being the drugs prostitution party and appears to be overrun by kooks there s the small minority of thoughtful economists but then the rest are tin foil hat people gary johnson seemed clueless not to mention slovenly and came across as a man whose brain was addled by marijuana you can t build a coherent movement on being anti authority and do not aggress is too simple minded a motto for dealing with the world s international complexities number 6 makes a great protagonist for an allegorical tv series but would be a horrible civic administrator well put and by the way most libertarians i have talked to fail to recognize the only way we can deal with aggressors from other countries is on their own turf jefferson knew this he pursued and conquered the barbary pirates on the high seas libertarians need to follow in his footsteps the last thing we need is for foreign terrorists to be able to plant ieds on our roads i should also add that most libertarians want to hoard liberty for ourselves and do not recognize that we do have some kind of duty to help other people become free i agree the idea that we never do anything militarily to an enemy even though we have reliable intel that the enemy is about to launch attacks on us is be a sitting duck if a foreign enemy is readying an attack they have already aggressed that semi pacifist approach is not government protecting the lives and happiness of its citizens which jefferson said was the primary purpose of government i remember that was part of what sank ron paul s candidacy his absurd notion that we should only act after we ve been attacked in other words after scores of our own friends and neighbors have already been killed how is that government fulfilling its job the same applies to the drugs prostitution policies drugs and sex trafficking infect and wreck whole communities most of whose residents especially children have nothing to do the original commercial exchanges but libertarians seem to think that human beings are just marbles who coincidentally happen to roll around in the same box as other marbles rather than as an organic body of interconnected people consent in itself alone doesn t make an exchange okay another example of that same simple mindedness i voted for johnson but it made me sick to do it his mealy mouthed idiotic performance made me embarrassed his inability to understand concepts like religious liberty i m agnostic for the record and a business s right to decide who they serve and hire made me angry i voted for johnson because i wanted to help give the libertarian party more legitimacy there was no way i was going to wave a johnson flag or put one in my yard there was no way i could convince other people to vote for johnson for the reasons i was voting for him people like my dad who s very conservative but liberty minded wouldn t even look at johnson because johnson treated them like scum and didn t even try to find common ground if the libertarian party wants to be a serious party they need a serious candidate who will clearly articulate libertarian ideas but also reach out to the sympathetic ears from both major parties what is the point of gaining lots of media attention if the candidate is a moron who can t articulate anything without looking like he fell off the short bus seems likely the lp would have a serious problem finding a serious and viable candidate those who qualify will want to run for a major party not the lp s fault as i see it if the lp wants to clear the 5 barrier it needs to start aggressively promoting vote swapping trade your vote in a swing state for half a dozen or a dozen libertarian votes in a safe one and suddenly half the libertarian votes come from safely red or safely blue ones and i suspect the party clears 5 easily i can t wade through this leviathan waste of words gary johnson is a joke seems like a really nice guy but where is the fire in the belly it s just not there i think he was just masturbating for the camera most of the time he wasn t crazy enough for you no enough mindless rage like rand ron paul his mistake was running their type of campaign slogans and soundbites totally devoid of a single policy solution that pisses of the trump style libs the lp will always be a tiny minor party the best it can hope for is that it becomes a bloc of voters one of the two levianthanic parties need for victory the lp may or may not be that useful in reality the libertarian movement the unwavering and principled commitment to the bill of rights freedom liberty and resistance to the abuse of state power and the worship of the state is what matters i believe our divided country can only be governed by libertarian principles both statist parties are obsessed with using the levers of government to silence defeat and shut down their opponents we need something like the utah compromise everyone has freedom live and let live both warring parties simply cannot accept letting others live in freedom the lp has to articulate to people why freedom and liberty are the very gifts given by the country s founders that will allow us to move forward as a nation and stop the punch and judy show called the federal goverment nevaeh i agree that richard s storry is shocking last wednesday i got a great bmw m3 from earning 5318 this past 4 weeks and just a little

on this site http www homejobs7 com dear lp i will not vote for johnson a 3rd time and if bill weld or anyone remotely similar is anywhere near the lp nomination i won t be donating money to the lp either give us a fucking libertarian ticket or close shop and shut the fuck up the choice of johnson and weld was a disgusting sell out of libertarian principles and a complete waste of an opportunity to get those principles heard running a rino alongside a neocon and calling that libertarian was an obscenity there are a number of problems not mentioned in this article in addition to the ones that were mentioned i did not perceive johnson as a true libertarian he was willing to let the epa run roughshod over property owners in northern new mexico i understand in addition he supported the right of abortionists to commit physical assault sometimes deadly on women and their children and opposed the right of women to have the legal protection against abortionists we deserve he also is deep into marijuana profiteering recreational marijuana use is not a victimless crime my husband and i and one of our children are all victims of other people s reactional marijuana use if recreational marijuana becomes legal we will suffer many more problems from users and finally i just plain didn t like johnson all other things being equal i wouldn t have voted for him anyway the libertarian party also suffers from a number of problems opposition to property tax seems to have slipped off the radar property tax is the most powerful and insidious attack on the right to property essentially completely negating it your home and your car do not belong to you they belong to the government the lp s failure to recognize the distinction between licentiousness and liberty has resulted in its being overtaken by people who want to legalize drugs and who have very little interest in true liberty licentiousness is actually destructive of true liberty liberty requires self control licentiousness is the lack of self control as long as taxpayers must pay for the upkeep of people who self destruct it is especially true don t ask me to support the legalization of licentiousness as long as i am being taxed to pay for those people the lp s failure to recognize a woman s right to legal protection from abortionists is another serious problem as is the failure to have a viable position on protecting the liberty of weak people the disabled the unborn libertarianism really only seeks to protect the liberty of the powerful and by the way taking taxpayer money for your campaigns is anti libertarian cut it out stand on principle that s unconstitutional it doesn t matter that it is voluntary to divert funds it is still taxation i never contribute why should this presidential slush fund even exist i mean look at the last several elections and note the hordes of republican candidates most of which were never going to pull more than 5 and knew it from the get go what were they doing there as they pretended to be the smartest man in the room waving with one hand and dipping the other in the treasury smiling the entire way i would appeal to constitutionality and propose that the personal income tax is even worse than a property tax the founding fathers permitted property tax but only collected by the individual states jefferson actually firmly rejected the idea of a tax on labor describing it as tak ing from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned i would appeal to constitutionality and propose that the personal income tax is even worse than a property tax the founding fathers permitted property tax but only collected by the individual states jefferson actually firmly rejected the idea of a tax on labor describing it as tak ing from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned i would appeal to constitutionality and propose that the personal income tax is even worse than a property tax the founding fathers permitted property tax but only collected by the individual states jefferson actually firmly rejected the idea of a tax on labor describing it as tak ing from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned the cause of liberty would be much better served if the libertarians got back into the major parties to assert their influence there thanks to libertarians leaving the gop the gop has drifted steadily leftward ever since i am not the only person who thinks this plenty of other libertarians do too they have stayed within the ranks where they can assert much more influence at present the only thing the lp can accomplish is to have the potential of throwing the presidential election to the lesser libertarian from the two major parties the election system is structured so that it is a two party system and this cannot be easily changed the gop only became prominent because of unusual circumstances and i sincerely hope it won t take another civil war to destroy a major party so the lp can take its place but something that serious is what it would require we have a media today that is largely fascinated by what the government has to say which leaves the people as a footnote if that isn t behind the looking glass i don t know what qualifies it certainly is backwards freedom of the press was intended to secure liberties to the people not pravda for peasants in service to the power class the good news is the brats inheriting fox are busy making it just like all the other networks which should render them to obscurity in short order the left will never forgive them their past and they will find a place lower than cnn in the coming decade an opening for a fresh perspective is about to present itself but networks are a billion dollar gamble i think so the campaign run by them was a loose one the companies backing them were not even interested in their win a sincere campaign would have helped them a lot nidhi company registration services i have to admit i was always lukewarm when it came to gary i recall his what s an aleppo statement and while i recognize it was gotcha politics being played by the diabolical and hateful within our media it was not his answer that put me off it was him blowing it off his gaffe as irrelevant and plowing into some other useless bit only to distract no he shouldn t have kow towed to the imbecile journalist but honestly most of the public never heard of aleppo either which means obama was not engaging world terrorists which was an issue worth grabbing i don t know what the wheels are looking at these days but if they are studying our media looking for a middle they are shoving their head in a very dark place remember it s the same media where nearly 90 were in the tank for bill clinton when he took office and that was before the purge involving hundreds of illegally obtained fbi files and lord knows what else this past cycle may have had more media exposure but it was also impotent if there was a lesson to be learned from harry browne s candidacy and the historic event of getting on all states ballots it was that libertarians are never going to be able to get onto that stage where the so called commission on presidential debates shuts out anything that doesn t fit into their good cop bad cop template in support of those actually running the country the cocktail party you and i are not invited and have to build our own stage part of the johnson weld problem was that after 4 years of left wing attack on first amendment freedoms johnson was unwilling to defend the free speech rights of disfavored groups such as masterpiece cakes asked in the debate by both austin petersen and john stossel a hypothetical question about a nazi cake being forced on a jewish baker he answered i believe incorrectly search google or any search engine you trust for this bit that bit lost my vote the right to free speech includes i believe the right to remain silent and the right to choose who you will speak for it would have been one thing if he affirmed that a grocery store did not have the right to select their customers or a gas station fire department or other essential service but wedding cake is not an essential service and free speech should have applied here just as is does to those who choose not to patronize a business for any reason the final convincing act bill weld s description of hillary and obama
