tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion nancy pelosi has the hardest job in town perhaps except for the president s she knows removing donald trump from office is probably impossible but a growing number of democrats in the house are itching to try how can the speaker please both the grown ups and the fantasists in her caucus and at the same time there s nothing sadder than a girl in trouble and mrs pelosi s predicament was made worse wednesday when robert mueller who was the santa claus the democrats were waiting for said he was finished with his investigation closed up his office and told congress the house in particular that if the democrats want to get rid of mr trump the u s constitution shows them how to do it they should pack a lunch because it s going to be an all day job the democrats wasted a lot time listening for sleigh bells on the roof the speaker enjoys working with her majority and wants to keep it and to do that she must work hard to elect a new president next year some of her obstreperous members are out for the fun of the hunt and appear to have given up something so boring as winning an election rep jared huffman of california for one example says betting everything on the 2020 election would be a historic mistake better to bet on impeaching a president top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the speaker blows cold and then hot and then cold again on whether to impeach or not to impeach she must keep a semblance of control of the nursery last week she lectured her caucus on the perils of impeachment not for the impeachee but for the impeacher impeachment has failed twice the first time to terminate the administration of andrew johnson the second to evict bill clinton from the white house she understands that if you set out to kill the king or eliminate a president you must make sure you leave in your wake a corpse not a wounded king angry for revenge the mueller investigation made a perfect hash of democratic wishes and dreams democrats were sure mr mueller s investigation would return a searing indictment that would set forest fires across not only the president s administration but banish him to unpleasant nether regions and ignite such public outrage even in republican and right leaning precincts that it would lead to a democratic landslide in 2020 so great that a republican wouldn t show his face for years if not decades mr mueller didn t come through he reminded the democrats and whoever else needs instruction that the constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing he said he had not exonerated the president but it was an admission that he didn t find either the high crime or the misdemeanor he set out to find impeachment of a president is a solemn proceeding not to be taken without long and careful consideration not only of justice but of the consequences of justice impeachment at bottom is a political decision and that s why serious people are reluctant to take that solemn step until all other remedies such as an election are considered some have compared the atmosphere in washington now to the sentiment in washington that led richard nixon to resign to avoid impeachment but this is a false comparison the atmosphere now is nothing like that of aug 9 1974 as those who lived through that squalid ordeal remember when mr nixon submitted a letter of resignation to henry kissinger the secretary of state prominent republican senators had joined the call for him to give up the presidency only a single obscure republican congressman has suggested that donald trump step down and if there are republican members of congress eager to join him in the public pursuit of impeachment it s difficult to imagine who they are there is scant evidence of a high crime or misdemeanor by mr trump that would persuade a jury made up of members of the u s senate as required by the constitution to convict him there is no evidence that mr trump has been deserted by his loyal constituency indeed he might well be elected to a second term as president at this time impeachment of this president is a democratic pipe dream republicans in the senate have made it abundantly clear they have no interest in that pipe dream or in threatening the survival of a republican administration nancy pelosi s latest broadside against the president accuses him of conducting a cover up in plain sight if you re conducting a cover up it seems to us in plain sight is not the place to do it but it s like so much about the rabid democratic pursuit of the president it doesn t make m
