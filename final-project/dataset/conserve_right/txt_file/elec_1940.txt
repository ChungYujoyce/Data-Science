likely voters clinton is ahead of trump by 44 41 percent another one in ten back a third party candidate and four percent are undecided last week she was up by six points 45 39 percent and before that by seven 45 38 percent the poll released wednesday finds clinton leads 49 44 percent in the head to head matchup that 5 point advantage is at the edge of the error margin she was up 7 a week ago 49 42 percent click here to read the full poll results trump is helped by increased backing among independents and greater strength of support 68 percent of those backing trump support him strongly compared to 61 percent for clinton independents favor trump over clinton by 13 points 41 28 percent he had a 7 point advantage last week and two weeks ago they were tied at 35 percent each third party candidates play a role here as gary johnson 14 percent and jill stein 7 percent receive the combined support of more than one in five independents in the four way race trump leads among whites 14 points and men 5 although his best groups remain white evangelical christians 56 and whites without a college degree 28 clinton has commanding leads among blacks 77 points unmarried women 27 voters under 30 18 and women 10 first time voters are also more likely to back her 16 the candidates garner almost equal backing among the party faithful 83 percent of democrats back clinton while 81 percent of republicans support trump to be competitive trump needs to consolidate support among republicans and carry independents says republican pollster daron shaw that s where he s made in roads in the last week mostly by focusing his attention on the economy and obamacare shaw conducts the fox news poll with democratic counterpart chris anderson trump s substantive strength is the economy he s trusted over clinton by four points yet that s the only issue where he bests her more trust clinton to handle foreign policy 15 points immigration 3 and terrorism 3 who would voters put across the table with russian president vladimir putin more trust clinton to negotiate with putin by 3 points 47 44 percent among registered voters that s down from a 13 point lead on this measure in april 53 40 percent all in all likely voters don t think trump is up to the task less than half think he s qualified to be president 46 percent and even fewer feel he has the temperament to serve effectively 36 percent plus over half lack confidence in his judgment in a crisis 56 percent clinton trounces trump on each of those measures 64 percent believe she s qualified 62 percent say she has the temperament and 56 percent are confident in her judgment plus clinton continues to receive more positive personal ratings she has a net negative rating of eight points 45 favorable vs 53 unfavorable while trump is underwater by 14 42 favorable vs 56 unfavorable in addition when undecided voters and those backing third party candidates are combined 26 percent have a favorable view of clinton vs 18 percent for trump yet despite trump s weaknesses on traits it s still a tight race that s because at least in part lots of folks prioritize issues when deciding their vote by a 59 28 percent margin more say their decision is about the issues as opposed to the character of the candidates those backing trump are more likely to be voting on issues than character by a wide 57 point margin 73 16 percent for clinton supporters the choice is more about issues by 12 points 47 35 percent compared to 2008 this is a more character driven election at that time voters said issues were more important than personal qualities by a 71 14 percent margin the bottom hasn apos t fallen out for trump and clinton hasn apos t pulled away but the race isn t as close as the 3 point lead suggests says anderson trump needs a solid majority of undecided voters and wavering supporters of third party candidates and that s extremely unlikely since most of them think he lacks the judgment temperament and qualifications to be president there are a couple of areas where the two are about evenly matched first 52 percent feel clinton stands up for people like them and 49 percent feel that way about trump also on their honesty or lack thereof a record low 30 percent of likely voters think clinton is honest and trustworthy while 34 percent say trump is pollpourri here are five additional takeaways from the poll 63 percent of trump s supporters believe things in the united states generally favor other people rather than people like them forty four percent of clinton s supporters feel that way twice as many voters expect clinton to win as think trump will 64 26 percent fully 86 percent of democrats think clinton will win while 49 percent of republicans think trump will trump supporters 34 percent are more than three times as likely as clinton supporters 10 percent to say they won t accept the election outcome if their candidate loses eighty eight percent of clinton supporters say they ll accept the outcome up from 74 percent in september the generic congressional ballot test is also tight 47 percent back the democratic candidate in their congressional district while 45 percent support the republican among those backing the gop congressional candidate 79 percent go for trump in the four way presidential race clinton gets 82 percent of those backing the democratic candidate models suggest a 2 point democratic advantage on the generic ballot would result in a gain of about 11 seats in the house and 4 in the senate says shaw that means the gop would retain an edge of about 20 seats in the house while the senate would be very much up for grabs the political parties are about evenly matched in popularity among likely voters the democratic party has a net positive rating of four points 51 percent favorable vs 47 percent unfavorable the republican party has a net negative rating by just one point 48 percent favorable vs 49 percent unfavorable the fox news poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1 309 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of anderson robbins research d and shaw company research r from october 22 25
