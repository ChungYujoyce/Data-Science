200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches on the quid pro quo sondland didn t exactly deny the existence of a quid pro quo when he testified to congress behind closed doors oct 17 but the only time he used the latin term in his opening statement was to quote trump s response when he asked him what he wanted from ukraine the president responded nothing there is no quid pro the president repeated no quid pro sondland trump s ambassador to the european union said at the time no quid pro quo multiple times on wednesday sondland went out of his way to use the term in his opening statement he said he knew a white house visit for ukraine s leader was contingent on the country announcing the investigations trump wanted into democratic presidential candidate joe biden he left no doubt that he viewed the proposed arrangement as meeting the definitions of a quid pro quo he said he presumed but was not told for certain that the release of military aid for ukraine later depended on the same conditions was there a quid pro quo as i testified previously with regard to the requested white house call and the white house meeting the answer is yes sondland said wednesday on vice president mike pence sondland made zero reference to pence in the opening statements he delivered last month when his name did come up it was mostly in response to questioning with no new significant information revealed on wednesday though he described a significant encounter with pence ahead of a meeting in warsaw with ukrainians last september he said he told pence he was concerned that the delay in military assistance to ukraine was tied to the issue of investigations he said ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy raised the same concerns with pence during the meetings and said the vice president replied that he would talk to trump pence s chief of staff marc short said the exchange recounted by sondland never happened on a phone call with trump the first time he testified sondland did not describe any phone conversation he may have had with trump a day after trump urged zelenskiy to investigate biden sondland s july 26 phone call with trump was not publicly known until a few days ago when a diplomat who overheard sondland in a crowded kyiv restaurant described the contents in vivid and evocative detail including the fact that the president and the ambassador had discussed investigations on wednesday sondland confirmed he did indeed speak to trump that day and said there was no reason to doubt holmes recollection that he and trump had discussed investigations he said the white house confirmed the call took place by sharing certain call dates with his attorneys he insisted the call did not strike him as significant at the time he had it perhaps explaining why he hadn t disclosed it during the closed door appearance on mick mulvaney sondland minimized his personal relationship with the white house acting chief of staff during his private deposition and he did the same on wednesday mostly sondland stressed last month that he had not discussed ukraine with mick mulvaney and had had minimal interactions with him but he said wednesday that mulvaney was kept abreast of the president s desire for investigations and was among the officials aware that a white house visit depended on ukraine announcing those probes to prove his point sondland brought emails to the hearing including one to mulvaney and other officials in which sondland said zelenskiy was prepared to reassure trump that he would leave no stone unturned in the investigations on secretary of state mike pompeo sondland had stressed last month that his actions had the blessing of secretary of state mike pompeo and that pompeo had supported his ukraine strategy and told him to keep up the good work and to continue working on ukraine he shed new light on their relationship wednesday pompeo was among the recipients of the july email that went to mulvaney and others he also recalled asking pompeo directly if they should organize a pull aside meeting in warsaw between trump and zelenskiy so zelenskiy could give reassurances that he would move forward with issues of importance to trump pompeo said yes he also described a separate email to pompeo s aides in which he said he and another envoy kurt volker had negotiated a statement that was to be delivered by zelenskiy again sondland said everyone was in the loop f
