register soapbox which over the coming days will provide over 20 candidates with the chance to pitch their message to voters and field their questions on stage mr biden vowed to reverse the god awful trump tax cuts to close tax loopholes for the wealthy and to raise corporate taxes to help pay for government programs for middle class which he described as the backbone of this country distancing himself from some of his primary rivals mr biden warned the push for a medicare for all health care system would lead to higher taxes on the middle class and cost taxpayers far more than his 750 billion proposal to expand obamacare with a public option he also took on his critics on one side they make well biden s kind of been around too long the other side is biden s naive well i don t know i ve been around a long time and you d think being around a long time you d learn a little something you know mr biden said sparking laughs from the crowd the thing i ve learned is that the american people after four years after three years already of this guy have decided that a lot of what he s talking about is hokum mr biden appears to have regained some of his footing after stumbling in the first democratic debate in miami democrats like ms menough were cheering him on this week when he delivered a blistering critique of mr trump following the mass shootings in texas and ohio blaming the republican for inciting white supremacist hatred and failing to show real leadership mr biden told reporters thursday if he is elected president he is confident he could pass gun control legislation because democrats now control the house and could pick up seats in the senate next year plus he claimed you have a majority of the members of the nra understanding that we should do something about

buttigieg of south bend indiana at 8 the iowa state fair hasn t always been good to mr biden his bid for the democratic presidential nomination in 1998 imploded after a debate here in which mr biden plagiarized passages from a speech by neil kinnock the leader of britain s labor party more than three decades later mr biden is well liked in iowa where voters say they re attracted to his candidacy because of his experience his ties to mr obama and their belief at least at the moment that he could unite the country and be the best candidate in the field to take out mr trump i think he can win if he gets through the democratic primary said bill friedricks 61 of west des moines i think right now the party has been pushed to the left and i think he has to continue to hammering the point that he can win the general election the appearance however here didn t go off without a hitch as he made his way around the fairgrounds mr biden briefly mixed it up with a trump supporter who accused the balding democrat of misquoting the president the lineup of contenders speaking at the soapbox on friday features former housing secretary julian castro businessman andrew yang former rep john delaney of maryland new age guru marianne williamson and rep tulsi gabbard of hawaii gov steve bullock of montana opened up things here thursday and got some laughs when he assured voters he wasn t here to remind them that his great great grandparents called iowa home and that his mother was born in the state we gather to make sure donald trump is a one term president mr bullock said never in my life did i think that i would utter that we have a president that gives aid and comfort to our enemies abroad and incites those who fight against decency at home he said the lies the misstatements that divide us by race gender and geography we expect more out of preschoolers now than we do the president of the united states afterward mr friedricks said mr biden and mr bullock delivered similar messages describing them both as attractive moderates i think they both understand how politics works and they aren t so driven by ideology he said steve vreza 71 a native iowan who made the trip from pennsylvania said mr biden will have his support as long as he maintains his polling lead we ve got to beat trump i don t care who it is mr vreza said i will go with whoever is leading in the polls at the time when i vote in the primary if elizabeth warren is way ahead of joe compared to trump i will vote for her with a throng of national media and supporters in tow mr biden bought an ice cream coated in chocolate and vendors urged him to come get a beer and come get a turkey leg after his speech mr biden dipped in steer n stein to sign autographs and pose for photographs with fairgoers and then made his way toward the exits as curious onlookers marveled at the scene i guess that is what it is like to be famous a woman said sunny kramer of des moines shouted out go biden i love him ms
