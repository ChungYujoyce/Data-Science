facilities some of which u s officials say were built underground to harden them against bombing and others located in populated areas to deter attacks that could kill civilians details of israel s assessment of the iranian nuclear program were outlined in a state department cable from 2005 made public april 8 by the anti secrecy site wikileaks despite frustrations with diplomatic efforts israeli officials are understandably reluctant to discuss possible military options the cable said quoting then israeli defense forces deputy chief of staff dani haloutz as telling u s embassy officials we don t want to go there the reason for israeli reluctance is that knocking out iran s nuclear facilities will be far more difficult than israel s successful 1981 airstrike on iraq s osirak nuclear reactor the cable said a senior military intelligence official told the embassy that the government of israel does not know where all of the targets are located and said that any attack would only delay not end the iranian program the cable said israeli officials also said that potential iranian nuclear target sites are well dispersed throughout the country with several located in built up civilian areas the cable said additionally the distance to iranian targets and the presence of u s forces in iraq and the persian gulf raise additional complications the cable said an israeli assault would necessitate prior coordination with coalition forces in iraq leaving the usg open to retaliation throughout the islamic world especially in iraq the cable said in addition the government of israel is acutely aware of iran s ability to retaliate both militarily and through attacks by its regional surrogates china protests report a recently disclosed state department cable reveals the sometimes difficult job of being a communist bureaucrat in china zheng zeguang director general of the north american and oceanian affairs for the chinese ministry of foreign affairs lamented the task of issuing an annual protest over the department of defense s 2009 annual report to congress on china s military by complaining the report upsets ties and was unfairly promoting the threat posed by beijing s growing military according to the cable which was released by the anti secrecy website wikileaks mr zheng reading unenthusiastically from prepared remarks formally protested to the acting deputy chief of mission dod s annual report to congress on china s military power the chinese bureaucrat a former no 2 official at china s embassy in washington is well known among state department and pentagon officials as one of china s key barbarian handlers the term used to describe government and communist party officials charged with what the chinese consider the odious and unappealing task of dealing with foreigners according to the cable from beijing mr zheng revealed he was not really upset about the report but was just following orders last year i did this with your predecessor after the 2008 report was released and now i get to do it again he was quoted in the cable as saying the cable also noted that in setting up the meeting mr zheng told a u s official we have to do this let s just get it out of the way so it will not be an issue when we are working on our leaders meeting china s government using former u s military officials has lobbied successive administrations and congress to kill the annual report in order not to offend china last year the report s title was changed by adding security developments in an apparent effort to soften its impact mr zheng likely will soon be repeating the task of protesting the report as the 2011 pentagon report already overdue to congress will be released again shortly likely triggering a new round of chinese ire a second cable revealed mr zheng again issuing a protest in may 2009 to express china s firm opposition to the presence of the u s navy survey ship victorious in international waters that china claims as its exclusive economic zone however instead of meeting in his foreign ministry office mr zheng met u s officials at a coffee shop in beijing he was protesting public statements by the pentagon over china s harassment of the victorious in the yellow sea in may 2009 when chinese ships made threatening passes close to the survey ship afghan novel photojournalist john cantlie has written a novel
