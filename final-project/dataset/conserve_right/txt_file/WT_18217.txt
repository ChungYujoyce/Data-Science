pentagon asia policy slot one administration official said the taiwan arms and report issues are simply one of timing and that the lengthy delay in formally approving the f 16 upgrade package worth an estimated 4 billion forced arms sales officials to go back and re price elements of it causing further delay the official said the air power study required under the 2010 national defense authorization act is being held up along with the f 16 upgrade package because you don t want to present a problem without a solution referring to what the pentagon has said is a rapidly shifting balance of air power in china s favor china s government twice in the past cut off military relations with the pentagon over u s arms sales to taiwan most recently in january 2010 over a 6 billion arms sale the obama administration and defense secretary robert m gates have made improving military relations with china a key element of its military diplomacy china s leaders according to defense

state department spokesman mark toner said no decisions on foreign military sales including anything related to f 16s have been made ever since the taiwan relations act was passed the entire

toner said it is inaccurate to say that state is delaying release of the taiwan air defense study because it is a product of the pentagon the pentagon already signed off on the f 16 upgrade deal last

press china to improve its human rights record by using the fact of the summit to draw greater attention to the plight of political dissidents and ordinary chinese who are unjustly incarcerated there

human rights situation has deteriorated as the chinese government appears to be fearful of the arab spring spreading so we re stepping up our diplomacy on human rights grounds and maintaining the security and economic and the other dialogues that are also critical for our national interests she said the comments followed an hourlong speech by ms power that included how the obama administration decided to use military force in libya after diplomatic and other efforts could not stop attacks on civilians by col moammar gadhafi s military we obviously have a long way to go in the cause of human rights promotion and protection ms power said during the speech but the president secretary of state hillary rodham clinton and the rest of his cabinet i think have charted a course that we are
