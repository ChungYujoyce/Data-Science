apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic joe biden s presidential bid got a boost monday from one of the leading latinos in congress with the chairman of the hispanic caucus political arm endorsing the former vice president as democrats best hope to defeat president trump people realize it s a matter of life and death for certain communities bold pac chairman tony c rdenas told the associated press in an interview explaining the necessity of halting trump s populist nationalism hard line immigration policies and xenophobic rhetoric that the california congressman called cruel c rdenas announcement follows presidential candidate bernie sanders weekend of mass rallies with rep alexandria ocasio cortez a freshman congresswoman from new york who has become a face of the progressive movement and a key supporter for the vermont senator s second white house bid bold pac is the political arm of the congressional hispanic caucus top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state the dueling surrogates highlight a fierce battle for between sanders and biden the leading democratic candidates among hispanics according to most polling while also demonstrating the two candidates starkly different approaches to the larger campaign biden is capitalizing on his 36 year senate career and two terms as barack obama s vice president to corral democratic power players across the party s various demographic slices c rdenas joins four other caucus members who ve already backed biden a show of establishment support in contrast to some latino activists who ve battered biden over the obama administration s deportation record sanders true to his long capitol hill tenure as an outsider and democratic socialist eschews the establishment with promises of a political revolution just as he did when he finished as runner up for democrats 2016 nomination together it s an argument on politics and policy at the crux of democrats 2020 nominating fight sanders and his supporters like ocasio cortez argue that existing political structures cannot help working class americans immigrants or anyone else that argument they insist can draw enough new irregular voters to defeat trump in november we need to be honest here retorted texas rep vicente gonzalez a biden supporter whose congressional district includes part of the u s mexico border if joe biden loses the primary democrats will lose in 2020 it s impossible for polling almost a year ahead of a general election to affirm that view but the contention echoes biden s consistent arguments about electoral college math texas rep filemon vela also a border district congressman who backs biden was not so absolute but he said biden is best positioned for a general election on immigration because of his plans to roll back trump s immigration restrictions and boost the asylum process while stopping short of decriminalizing all border crossings sanders supports making all border crossings civil offenses rather than criminal a position first pushed by the lone hispanic presidential candidate and former obama housing secretary julian castro in some swing states that might not go over well vela said even as he gonzalez and c rdenas said the distinction is more important to political pundits than to hispanic voters said c rdenas there is activist language and there are litmus tests and there are hard working people around the country who just want fairness he added another key plank of biden s case that meaningful change from reversing trump s migrant family separation policy to expanding health care coverage requires not only winning in november but then achieving some semblance of consensus in congress c rdenas pointed especially to biden s role in the 2010 health care law economic recovery during president barack obama s two terms and a key aid package for central american countries that trump rolled back exacerbating migration to the u s mexico border vice president biden has a record that s going to resonate with hispanic voters and wider general election audiences c rdenas said hispanic voters are a rapidly growing portion of the u s population and electorate though they have consistently had lower election participation rates than african americans and non hispanic whites at the least hispanics will play key roles in the nevada caucus third in the democratic nominating process and the texas and california primaries the two largest sources of delegates on the march 3 super tuesday slate biden advisers acknowledge a generational gap in his hispanic support corresponding to sanders strength with younger voters and reflected in polling and by massive crowds like those ocasio cortez drew this weekend in california and nevada immigrants rights advocates picketed outside biden s philadelphia campaign headquarters shortly after its opening castro a former obama cabinet member used democratic debates to challenge biden on why he didn t stop more deportations when he was vice president last month members of the movimiento cosecha which describes itself as an immigrant led group pushing for permanent protection and respect for immigrants confronted biden during a campaign event in south carolina one of them carlos rojas asked biden to answer for deportations under obama and to commit to an outright moratorium on all deportations a position sanders supports biden declined after rojas pressed him biden said you should vote for trump gonzalez called it ridiculous to question biden s commitment to immigrants but said the skepticism demonstrates that the latino community vote is not monolithic with a range of national origins and philosophical differences vela agreed adding that sanders rallies and ocasio cortez s social media following shouldn t obscure biden s standing among the traditionalist democrats he said constitute the majority of hispanic voters vela recalled an unplanned campaign stop he made recently with biden at la tierra an iconic restaurant in san antonio texas after a campaign event with several hundred people he went table to table vela said people getting up joe bid
