apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion is it possible that donald trump is winning on trade last week president trump apparently delivered two under appreciated victories as a result of his threat of stiff tariffs and renegotiated trade deals first seoul has agreed to reduce long standing non tariff trade barriers that have reduced american exports to korea though the details are still sketchy the koreans have agreed to buy more ford and gm cars and trucks and other u s made products this can only be good news for american workers the koreans have also agreed to increase reimbursement rates to american drug and vaccine producers top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century whether korea keeps these promises is yet to be seen but even the new york times grudgingly conceded the deal represents the type of one on one agreement that mr trump says makes the best sense for american companies and workers meanwhile china appeared to stand down in response to mr trump s jarring announcement of a record 50 billion of tariffs on chinese products premier li keqiang pledged to improve american companies access to chinese markets he also said in a news conference that china would treat foreign and domestic firms equally beijing has promised to stop forcing foreign firms to transfer technology to china and strengthen intellectual property rights enforcement that was a very smart and encouraging response but then on monday beijing appeared to reverse course china announced new tariffs of up to 20 percent on 3 billion of american pork nuts fruits and assorted other export products china has made no secret that it is aiming tariffs at areas of the country that voted for mr trump so what will it be with china concessions or retaliation if it is going to be retaliation this story won t end well for china s economy mr trump is a counter puncher he also doesn t back down if china wants unfettered access to american markets it is going to have buy a lot more of our exports not less mr trump also commands the moral high ground in this dispute you can t have free trade with a country like china that steals 500 billion and arms your enemies period a country that acts like this is an adversary not a friend or ally beijing s actions on monday are the response of a belligerent teenager who gets called out for bad behavior china s growth rates are already slowing how many millions of chinese workers will lose their jobs if beijing surrenders access to america s multi trillion dollar consumer market mr trump s message has been clear from day one there is a new trade sheriff in town mr trump once explained to me during a meeting at trump tower his strategy on trade i am not a protectionist and i am not an isolationist of course i understand the benefits of international trade i m a businessman i just want better and fairer trade deals that benefit america that s the card he s playing with china americans especially in the midwestern states whose products and workers china wants to punish are generally behind mr trump all the way the risk here is great mr trump may upend three decades of progress in opening markets for international trade this has benefited the citizens of the world and americans in lower prices for nearly everything the white house may be risking another 1930s style trade tariff war that shut down global trade and cratered the world in depression no one wants that but the status quo trading arrangement with china is untenable mr trump can t back down here and he may need to double down he s where ronald reagan was at the start of his presidency when the air traffic controllers called his bluff and walked off the job the gipper took an action that rocked the world he fired them mr trump recognizes what many of the globalists don t the enormous leverage america has on the world economic stage he s now demanding that as part of a new nafta mexico and canada respect american intellectual property rights and stop imposing price controls on our drugs and vaccines ditto for europe these nations also impose price controls on our pharmaceutical and technology products meanwhile the council of economic advisers reports that most nations impose de facto tariffs on our goods and services how is that free trade that has to stop and don t be surprised if the germans french italians and other eu members moan but ultimately agree to mr trump s terms if this plays out the way we all hope mr trump may score the biggest victory for freer and fairer trade practices in american history if china doesn t back down things could get ugly stephen moore a columnist for the washington times is a senior fellow at the heritage foundation and an economic consultant with
