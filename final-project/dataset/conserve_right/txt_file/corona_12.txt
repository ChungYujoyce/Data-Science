national review transgender student s bathroom access case returns to court apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound trump s grotesque tweets sessions says trump s anger over russiagate recusal is not all unjustified but stands by decision brexit architect cummings defends decision to travel amid lockdown pandemic in the land is putting strain on our self image as a free people for whom the rule of law is our ne plus ultra alas when it gets down to brass tacks even those two beacons liberty and law are as much in tension as in mutual need it is by law that society restricts our freedom on the other hand as burke observed without the order that a just legal system ensures there can be no liberty worth having we would descend into anarchy into the law of the jungle times of true security crises war natural catastrophes or the sudden spread of a potentially deadly disease have a remorseless way of reminding us about some brute realities it is all well and good for libertarians to say that the constitution is not suspended in emergencies and that are our rights are never more essential than when government s tyrannical tendencies rear their head but then real emergencies happen inevitably unavoidably our rights get restricted sometimes dramatically this is not because government tends to tyranny though it does if unchecked it is because people crave security and community they are willing to sacrifice their individual liberties at least to a degree and for a time to preserve them this does not make them craven it makes them rational

union and no constitutional system protecting our liberties if abraham lincoln had not persevered in defending them yet in 1861 lincoln suspended habeas corpus the right against arbitrary imprisonment the civil war was raging and with it secessionist terrorism in response supreme court chief justice roger taney he of dred scott infamy presumed to issue a writ of habeas corpus in favor of john merryman a maryland militiaman detained by union forces after he burnt bridges to stall the movement of troops in spurning the court lincoln rhetorically asked are all the laws but one to go unexecuted and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated history is romantic the lesson it most often gushes is that lincoln s impetuous order was unconstitutional so devoted are we to the rule of law you are to understand that we cannot abide the notion of an arrested american being denied due process including a prompt court hearing at which the government must show probable cause this very nice story elides a few inconvenient details taney did not rule that habeas corpus could not be suspended he ruled that it could be done only by congress not by the president the authority to suspend being spelled out in article i which enumerates legislative power see it is overwrought to speak of suspending the constitution in times of emergency it is not that the constitution is suspended rather the constitution explicitly provides for the restriction of some rights so that the government can effectively confront emergency conditions no surprise there the framers realized that the survival of the united states was no sure thing in 1787 we needed a government capable of quelling threats lincoln was justified in suspending a right fundamental to liberty for if the government were to collapse out of unreasonable deference to it all of our rights would perish indeed there remains a good argument that lincoln did have the unilateral authority he claimed at the time the constitution s habeas provision article i section 9 specifies only when the right may be suspended when required for public safety in cases of rebellion or invasion not by whom the president or congress it may be suspended plus unlike today congress was not easily called into session in the 1860s and in any event congress in 1863 endorsed lincoln s suspension of habeas corpus it was the right thing to do even if there is legitimate quarrel over who should have done it as we consider this episode amid the coronavirus outbreak we should bear two things in mind first because dread for our safety naturally elevates security over liberty in our minds we are susceptible to indulging measures that are too draconian it might for example have been sensible to monitor japanese aliens and even detain at least some of them during world war ii after all it has been the law of the united states since the late eighteenth century that nationals of a hostile power may be detained during a formally declared war nevertheless the government s internment of american citizens of japanese descent is one of the most shameful blights on our history when we permit restrictions in emergency conditions we must remember these are fundamental rights that are being limited restrictions should be no more extensive than the threat reasonably demands second we tend to give a wide berth to the authorities while a crisis ensues sometimes too wide a berth it is simply a fact that true emergencies do not afford the luxury of extensive deliberations bad things happen it is the history of the united states that abuses are eventually addressed by courts and legislatures but only after the emergency has subsided this of course is cold comfort to the people who have been harmed it does however establish norms of behavior for the next crisis the good news is that we do learn the bad news is that we learn from our mistakes get our conservative analysis delivered right to you
