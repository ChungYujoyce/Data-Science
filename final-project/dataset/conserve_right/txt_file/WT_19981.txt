apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic chicago ap the trump administration is moving forward with a nationwide immigration enforcement operation targeting migrant families despite loud opposition from democrats and questions over whether it s the best use of resources given the crisis at the border the operation could happen as soon as this weekend after being postponed by president donald trump late last month it would pursue people with final deportation orders including families whose immigration cases were fast tracked by judges in 10 major cities such as chicago los angeles new york and miami the plan has sparked outrage and concern among immigrant rights advocates and lawmakers top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches cbs evening

organizer said thursday at a rally outside the city s immigration and custom enforcement offices where some activists chanted immigration not deportation the sweep remains in flux and could begin later according to two administration officials who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity the american civil liberties union pre emptively filed a lawsuit thursday in an attempt to protect asylum seekers meanwhile activists ramped up efforts to prepare by bolstering know your rights pocket guides circulating information about hotlines and planning public demonstrations vigils outside of detention centers and hundreds of other locations nationwide were set for friday evening to be followed by protests saturday in miami and chicago the operation is similar to ones conducted regularly since 2003 that often produce hundreds of arrests it is slightly unusual to target families as opposed to immigrants with criminal histories but it s not unprecedented the obama and trump administrations have targeted families in previous operations this latest effort is notable because of the politics swirling around it trump announced on twitter last month that the sweep would mark the beginning of a push to deport millions of people who are in the country illegally a near impossibility given the limited resources of ice which makes the arrests and carries out deportation orders then he abruptly canceled the operation after a phone call with house speaker nancy pelosi a california democrat while lawmakers worked to pass a 4 6 billion border aid package plus details had leaked and authorities worried about the safety of ice officers the agency said it would not discuss specifics about enforcement operations as always ice prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security public safety and border security it said in a statement trump started hinting anew in recent days that more removals were coming he said last weekend they would be starting fairly soon well i don t call them raids he said i say they came in illegally and we re bringing them out legally ken cuccinelli the new head of citizenship and immigration services told cnn on wednesday that the raids were absolutely going to happen pelosi said she hoped the administration would reconsider families belong together she said advocates in border areas have received word that up to 1 000 families are expected to arrive at an immigration center in dilley texas according to attorneys representing separated families in a long running lawsuit in court papers filed thursday the attorneys said the government has not responded to questions about the operation the administration has been straining to manage a border crisis and some officials believe flashy shows of force in deporting families would deter others migrants from coming but others have criticized any move that draws resources away from the border at a time when the border patrol is detaining four times the number of people it can hold also a watchdog report found filthy potentially dangerous conditions at some stations democratic rep pramila jayapal of washington state co chair of the congressional progressive caucus and a former immigrant advocate accused the administration of showing a willingness to be cruel at every turn house minority leader rep kevin mccarthy a california republican blamed pelosi for the raids saying she had done nothing since they were delayed it is the speaker who caused this problem he said he said trump would have postponed the raids again if he saw progress in house some activists said they were gearing up for operations to start sunday and planned to protest organizers estimated a rally planned for saturday in chicago would draw around 10 000 people we will not be swayed by fear and fiat said justin valas with asian americans advancing justice in chicago in new orleans any operations were put on hold due to severe weather the city tweeted that it confirmed with ice that enforcement would be suspended through the weekend as the region braced for the first hurricane of the season the aclu lawsuit filed in federal court in new york argued that thousands of migrants fleeing violence in el salvador guatemala and honduras were not allowed a fair chance to request asylum due but were still ordered removed from the country they are asking that those individuals get another hearing others said they were skeptical that trump would follow through on the threat advocates have ramped up know your rights training since trump took office reminding immigrants regardless of their immigration status about their right to remain silent and to ask authorities for proper paperwork they have also explained that immigrants can often avoid arrest simply by not opening doors to agents who need permission to enter private homes that has forced ice officers to wait outside courthouses and other public places to make arrests we don t want to alarm folks but we want to alert folks said melissa taveras of the florida immigrant coalition long reported from washington
