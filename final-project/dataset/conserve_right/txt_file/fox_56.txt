dministrator brock long updates the federal response to the deadly storm that battered the carolinas this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday september 16 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace florence turns deadly as its devastating winds and flooding move inland from the carolina coast begin videotape unidentified male i do want to emphasize that this is only the beginning florence is a very slow mover unidentified male it aposs an uninvited brute who doesn apost want to leave wallace we aposll have live reports on the ground and get an update on the federal response from fema administrator brock long and we aposll learn about the impact on people in the storm aposs path from north carolina senator thom tillis then an allegation of sexual misconduct over 30 years ago will it affect the confirmation of judge brett kavanaugh to the supreme court we aposll ask a key member of the senate judiciary committee republican john kennedy plus former trump campaign chairman paul manafort strikes a plea deal to cooperate with the special counsel robert mueller unidentified male tough day for mr manafort but he aposs accepted responsibility wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what manafort aposs about face means for president trump and our power players of the week men of honor unidentified male i was doing it for my country and my fellow marines i had to win a war just imagine the great loss ph wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington as devastating as florence has been so far the worst may be yet to come the slow moving storm is now responsible for at least 14 deaths more than 30 inches of rain falling in some places and forecasters are warning of catastrophic flooding across the region for days in a moment we aposll discuss the threat and response with fema administrator brock long and north carolina senator thom tillis but first we have fox team coverage leland vittert on the carolina coast with the latest on the rescue effort but we begin with steve harrigan and a look at the damage further inland steve steve harrigan fox news correspondent chris 50 miles inland from where this storm made landfall there are already parts some north carolina towns which are seven feet underwater begin videotape harrigan families stagger to safety this woman is asked why she is shaking unidentified female i want to leave my house so that aposs my big thing harrigan despite round the clock efforts by power crews hundreds of thousands are without electricity homes and businesses cut off flooded or torn apart by the wind unidentified female we aposve been through worse than this unidentified male we sure have unidentified female yes we will make it we aposll start over harrigan the only way to reach some neighborhoods is by 7 ton trucks last used in the war in iraq unidentified male we aposve never seen anything like this we didn apost anticipate it like this we aposve just we aposve never seen it we aposve been here 11 years we aposve never seen nothing like this harrigan as the rain continues more residents of north carolina may soon be saying the same thing end videotape harrigan an evacuation order has already been issued for the city of fayetteville chris wallace steve harrigan reporting from sneads ferry north carolina steve thank you now let aposs bring in leland vittert off the coast in atlantic beach leland leland vittert fox news correspondent chris florence roared ashore here thursday morning and heavy rain has not stopped since many of the hardest hit areas we can even get to behind me is the crows nest marina so many of the charter fishermen and shrimpers who work these waters raced to pull their boats out of the water to protect them only to have them destroyed on land not only are so many homes here flooded or leveled but florence took people aposs ability to make a living in the channels and estuaries further east locals told me there are still lots of residents who chose to ride out the storm and are now cut off begin video clip vittert the rescue business right after the storm is a dangerous one we are right now just off of beaufort in the channels and you can see all of the boats that were trashed here believe it or not people actually try to ride the storm out on a couple of these boats now we are out looking for them the coast guard has been overwhelmed by the number of calls we aposve seen their helicopters circling above here end video clip vittert as the storm moves west so do the floodwaters so do the rescuers including the military who were lending a hand florence continues to move slower than most people walk meaning conditions that normally last for hours during a hurricane are lasting for days and what we can see an account for much of the wind damage like what is behind me the flooding and rain destruction continues and is getting worse chris wallace leland vittert reporting from atlantic beach leland thank you joining us now from fema headquarters here in washington is brock long the head of that agency mr long let aposs start with an overview how much damage has hurricane florence done how much more damage isn apost likely to do in the days and even weeks ahead brock long fema administrator yes you know unfortunately we aposve still got several days to go not only are you going to see more impact across north carolina particularly from the central to the western area dumping copious amounts of rains but we aposre also anticipating you are about to see a lot of damage going through west virginia all the way up to ohio as the system exits out wallace i saw an astonishing figure that this storm is going to dump enough rain to fill chesapeake bay trillions of gallons of rain how much damage is this going to do in terms of inland flooding of rivers and how do you compare this storm in terms of inundating an area to last year aposs hurricane harvey long yes you know i don apost think hurricane harvey is a little bit different than what we are seeing if you want to compare what type of damages go back and look in 1999 at hurricane floyd or the most recent events with matthew south carolina is probably looking at something like a joaquin ph that occurred several years ago so what we do is we work with the state as well as and we do modeling and we try to figure out ahead of time where we think the impacts are going to be the thing i aposm most worried about is the isolated communities those who are stuck in their homes right now that may not have access to pharmaceuticals food and water and medical supplies whatever so we aposre highly focused on taking care of people and fulfilling that mission as well as the hundreds of people have already been rescued and that aposs a coordinated effort from the urban search and rescue teams that we pre deployed many days ago all the way down to the local neighbor helping neighbor wallace what is your sense of the response from the federal level from the state level from the local level so far how much for instance did prepositioning of assets personnel and supplies help and do you see at this point any holes in the response from government long i don apost see any holes i think we were as prepositioned from the federal government aposs standpoint as we can be and what aposs great about this situation is you aposve got strong state emergency management agencies and strong governors that have built capability north carolina mike sprayberry is one of the most talented state directors out there north carolina has been through this they built a capability that we backfill so the way this works is you know it aposs locally executed state managed federally supported and that aposs the model that we shoot for so when governor cooper has a shortfall or is having trouble meeting a response to recovery goal then these guys behind me are coordinating the assets and resources down through him to that local level and that aposs what you are seeing play out wallace what aposs your biggest concern right now sir long taking care of people life safety you know i think the message that aposs got to be put forward to the people is please stay out of the flooded waters the waters can be charged from electric lines sometimes when people walk on streets that are flooded the manhole covers could be missing the road may not even be there it could have been washed out so please stay out of those waters don apost become a victim and we aposll continue to support as best we can but you have to set the expectations this is going to be a long frustrating event for people that have lost everything that are isolated the power is off but we aposre doing everything that we can to help our state and local partners get this corrected wallace you know i think most people focus on something like this on the impact on the coast and the storm surge but as i understand it we could have inland flooding of rivers that they could reach a crest sometime next week i mean that is a very strong potential danger isn apost it long you aposre absolutely right so what happened about a week before this event hit was the remnants of gordon tropical storm gordon pushed through the mid atlantic states saturating the rivers so all that water has got to come down and make its way to the coast and it aposs traveling south so the rivers are pretty saturated which exacerbates this problem and you know you aposre going to see some we are seeing some dams like in bowling springs north carolina be compromised luckily there aposs no life safety implications so what we have to focus on are there any dams that are going potentially going to break that could cause great impact to loss of life and right now we monitor all those situations wallace mr long obviously one of the things you want to do in these disasters is learn from your mistakes and the response to hurricane maria last year became an issue this week here is president trump begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i think puerto rico is an incredible unsung success i think it is certainly the best job we did was puerto rico but nobody would understand that end video clip wallace but this summer fema did an after action report that said this the agency could have better anticipated the severity of hurricanes irma and maria would cause long term significant damage to the territory aposs infrastructure so which is it long look i mean our after action report is an open and honest assessment but the way that this works and i keep saying this is emergency management successful disaster response and recovery is like a chair with four legs one leg is the federal government the second leg is the state and local the third leg is the private sector which owns 85 percent of the infrastructure and then the fourth leg is the citizen being properly prepared and neighbor helping neighbor i think what you saw in the california wildfires texas to florida is all four of those legs were present so the chair is stable you know going in to that obviously in puerto rico there were several parts of that chair missing you know the commonwealth and the local municipalities where we are concentrating on building a robust emergency management capability so i aposm one of the largest employers fema is now one the largest employers in puerto rico trying to build that capability but when it comes to the infrastructure the greatest thing the deferred maintenance the dilapidated infrastructure infrastructure that was that crumbled is nothing that aposs within my control but now we got to go back in and fix and make sure that we are rebuilding puerto rico in a manner that it aposs more resilient economically viable so that we don apost go through this again so what the nation learned is it takes all of us coming together like what we are doing in north carolina wallace mr long whoever is responsible officials in puerto rico now accept a study that there were around 3 000 hurricane related deaths but this week mr trump tweeted this this was done by democrats this number to make me look as bad as possible question simple factual question do you dispute this number of 3 000 hurricane related deaths long well there are several different studies that are all over the place when it comes to death in the official stance of fema is we don apost count deaths you know the only thing that would come remotely close to data that we would have is the funeral benefits that we push forward you know i think the president is fully supportive i know he is fully supportive of fema and he realizes that the mission that we went in to help support was incredibly complex and there is a difference between direct deaths and indirect deaths one study could have studied the entire year that aposs gone by about a number of indirect deaths over time or whatever versus a six month study in george washington so that aposs you know there aposs a lot of issues with numbers being all over the place it aposs hard to tell what aposs accurate and what aposs not but we have got to come together as a country to focus on the rebuilding of puerto rico and building a resilient infrastructure at the bottom line is you know puerto rico had one of the oldest power grids on the globe 44 years old it did not work and when the power is out you see escalated problems big time when it comes to a functional hospital system or whatever it may be working water and different things that escalates problems in the future and that aposs what we aposre trying to focus on that aposs where our attention is focused and we got the full support of the president behind us and you know he understands how complex this has been and he aposs frustrated by it wallace mr long thank you thanks for taking the time to talk with us and obviously you aposve got a big situation on your hands right now thank you sir long thank you wallace let aposs move now to a red cross shelter in charlotte north carolina where senator thom tillis is standing by senator what are you seeing on the ground in your state did people obey evacuation orders and are they finding shelter sen thom tillis r north carolina well they are finding shelter i want to thank the red cross for the work they are doing here and across the state but there were some people who made the dangerous decision to not heed the evacuation notices down in new bern a number of people who had to be rescued over the past 24 36 hours were largely people who decided to stay in an area that was judged unsafe we aposre going to have more evacuation notices as the rivers rise and after they overflow their banks you need to heed the warnings get out of harm aposs way wallace what can you tell us about problems with looters tillis well down in we aposve had one report down in wilmington i don apost think that is widespread and law enforcement takes it very seriously in that particular report i think the store manager chose not to have law enforcement intervene for the most part i think people have really been focused on keeping themselves safe and obeying the law and order that we need as we go through the recovery wallace how much damage obviously it aposs just a guesstimate at this point but how much damage will this do to your state are we talking billions of dollars and how long before life in north carolina gets back to anything close to normal tillis well chris they gave you a comparison matthew had about two years ago a little less than two years ago we are still recovering from hurricane matthew i think that this storm is likely going to produce impacts greater than hurricane matthew the agriculture industry the largest industry and our state is hard hit we will have to sort out the crop damage the floods that are going to come as you mentioned with the fema director the floods that come midweek are likely to be as damaging or more damaging than the original event so we aposve got to sort all that out i think that it aposs fair to say in terms of economic impact rebuilding that we are talking in the billions of dollars wallace and how long before life in north carolina gets back to normal tillis well it aposs very difficult to say with the rivers and with the statewide impact i mean i aposm in charlotte right now we are beginning to get the rain bands that have been taking days to get here then it aposs going to move up into the mountains those are all going to fill river basins they aposre going to flow down to north carolina and south carolina or out to our coast and it aposs very difficult to really understand what aposs ahead but i did a flyover about 36 hours after matthew at the eastern part of the state and we thought it was bad then and two days later we saw damage that far surpassed what the initial impact of that category one storm so people need to take it seriously the fact that it aposs a tropical depression means that it aposs a very serious weather and rain event so listen to local authorities find access the help i was also going to mention also fema has an app that you can get on an android or iphone that will give you access to resources you may be able to volunteer in your community and help other people know what their resources are that out there at the state and local and federal level to help us as we go through this disaster wallace and finally senator i aposve got about a minute left and you took me just where i want to go what have you thought of the response from government at all levels federal state local were they as prepared as they could be for a terrible storm like this tillis well i think so because with the way the storm was tracking you know there were some people that would say position here or position there i think they positioned in a central location and got them out of there as quickly as they could the governor is doing a great job i agree with the fema director mike sprayberry is one of the best at what he does for disaster management they aposre coming together we aposve had sadly experienced this with before i aposm proud of what they aposve done i aposm sure we aposll do an after action and see things we can do better but i think north carolina does it about as well as anybody in the country wallace unfortunately you have too much experience with it senator tillis thank you thanks for your time our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those caught in the storm sir tillis thank you chris wallace up next former trump campaign chairman paul manafort reaches a deal to cooperate with special counsel robert mueller we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss what it means for the president and the russia investigation commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states he worked for me for a very short period of time but you know what he happens to be a very good person and i think it aposs very sad what they aposve done to paul manafort kevin downing manafort attorney tough day for mr manafort but he aposs accepted responsibility and he wanted to make sure that his family was able to remain safe and live a good life end video clip chris wallace fox news host well president trump last month expressing support for his former campaign chairman and manafort aposs attorney on friday explaining why his client took the plea deal agreeing to cooperate with the special counsel and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and author of the deep state former republican congressman jason chaffetz well julie paul manafort has long ties to pro russian ukrainians he was one of the people who attended the trump tower meeting in june of 2016 how significant potentially is his decision to cooperate with the special counsel and how concerned are they in the white house by manafort aposs decision julie pace washington bureau chief associated press i think there are a lot of unknowns here still if we don apost know the extent of what paul manafort is going to be telling bob mueller we don apost know what mueller aposs team is hoping to get out of paul manafort but it actually is that unknown that i think is really unnerving the white house because despite what the president and a lot of his advisors say about manafort playing just a small role in the campaign he was the campaign chairman and he was there for a significant period of time both during the trump tower meeting and also one thing that hasn apost gotten quite as much attention is he was there during the republican convention when there was a change in language on the platform that related to ukraine and manafort was directly involved in it and so the unknown what he could tell bob mueller and what bob mueller is after in this deal with paul manafort is what does have the white house nervous right now wallace and we should point out it aposs not like mueller just bought on speculation the fact is to get a deal lawyers have to offer something called a proffer where they in effect say if you were to give us a deal here aposs what our client would say so they pace exactly bob mueller knows what paul manafort can offer him it aposs the white house that doesn apost know they aposre the ones that are in the dark right now but bob mueller would not have made this deal with manafort presumably unless they thought there was some amount of information that would be helpful to their case wallace congressman chaffetz how worried should president trump and his team be about manafort aposs decision to make a deal jason chaffetz r utah former u s congressman i think there aposs a reason to be very worried and as long as there aposs a special counsel i think the president has some degree of peril you combine that with cohen and his striking a deal you just don apost know exactly what it is that they have there aposs been no evidence of any collusion there aposs been no evidence that has anything affecting the outcome of the election but it still is a huge question mark wallace karl your thoughts karl rove fox news contributor well like julie i think one of the interesting things that we are likely to learn more about is the republican national convention where an official j d gordon tells the chairman of a subcommittee you need to change language on ukraine from calling for supplying defensive lethal defensive weapons to ukraine to a more generalized assistance but at the end of the day i aposm not certain that that involves anything that aposs chargeable it simply shows how much it could show how much manafort was attempting to use his involvement in the trump campaign to heal his relationships with his paymasters in moscow and kiev i have to as a matter of personal reveal paul manafort for some strange reason in his letter to trump offering his assistants declared that i was his blood enemies since college days i haven apost seen the guy in 20 years and haven apost had any interaction wallace you weren apost in college 20 years ago so maybe he aposs still feeling the inaudible laughter rove ok but i you know look i this is a parlor game we don apost know what we don apost know but i go back to one fundamental thing this was a campaign that leaked more than any campaign that i aposve seen in my lifetime and if there was collusion we would have known it by now this i think we aposll see some entertaining things we aposll see some important things but i aposm not certain that were going to see anything that touches necessarily the oval office wallace president trump kept saying how much he respected manafort for not caving to prosecutors but a few weeks ago he almost seemed to anticipate friday aposs developments take a look begin video clip trump for 30 or 40 years i aposve been watching flippers everyone aposs wonderful and then they get ten years in jail and they flip on whoever the next highest one is or as high as you can go it almost ought to be outlawed it aposs not fair end video clip wallace congresswoman harman i mean let aposs be realistic here the special counsel crushed manafort he crushed him financially he crushed him legally in the sense that manafort is a man of 69 faces at least 10 years in prison or did at least before this deal is the president right is there something wrong with flipping jane harman d cali former u s congresswoman i don apost think so i mean congress does have a role in setting procedures for federal courts and in defining what is a crime and so trump isn apost wrong that you know maybe someone could argue that maybe some of the procedures should be changed but we have a vested interest in speedy trials that aposs one of the laws that congress passed while i was a staffer and making deals with people is a way to resolve their issues and the goal is the truth the goal isn apost crushing people if manafort did all these things wrong i aposm sorry i aposm not particularly sympathetic let me say just one other thing though to support what karl said karl i aposm agreeing with you a lot of what aposs going on is manafort aposs bluster that aposs my view i mean it aposs out there that he directed some think tanks to do stuff including the wilson center he didn apost but my point is that mueller is meticulous and he aposs doing a mob prosecution here circles within circles and manafort my guess is has a lot to explain and that aposs why he made this deal wallace but i want to pick up on that with you congressman chaffetz because this is what happens not to say this is any comparison to president trump on the white house but this is what prosecutors do in mob deals you get the little fish you get them you convict them and you squeeze them and you get them to flip on the bigger fish chaffetz well that aposs been done for eons wallace right chaffetz but what is so different to conservatives who look at this that aposs not how they dealt with the hillary clinton situation five times they handed out immunity and in those immunity agreements which i have read there is no requirement that they cooperate with the federal government and yet you go and look at how this is handled and it aposs totally different it aposs the duplicity that is driving conservatives crazy here in washington d c it aposs just not fair because it aposs not done the same way wallace julie i want to pick up on one other issue and i don apost expect you to have an answer i aposm asking it basically for theory because the expectation was that one of the reasons that paul manafort was hanging so tough and going to trial and spending all this money was that if he stayed true to the president and the president kept praising him that eventually he aposd get a pardon from the president and his problems would go away why do you think that manafort decided to give up on that strategy pace well i think there are a couple of reasons and you alluded to some of them paul manafort is 69 years old he has a family to worry about he aposs had so much financially taken away from him already i think he is concerned about what happens to his family if he does go to jail after his first trial and i think if you are anybody not just paul manafort and you are hanging your future on a decision that president trump is going to make that aposs probably about strategy because trump is so unpredictable and certainly he was signaling at some of his rhetoric after the first trial that if manafort did hang if he didn apost make a plea stayed firm that he could get a pardon but trump again is so predictable i think if that is your strategy to go through a second trial and hope for a pardon i think he was probably getting some pretty strong advice to think otherwise wallace and he apparently took that advice panel we have to take a break here we aposll see you all a little later up next the bitter confirmation battle over supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh takes a new turn involving an allegation of sexual misconduct decades ago we aposll talk with a key republican on the committee john kennedy next commercial break wallace coming up supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh denies an allocation of sexual misconduct while he was in high school as the judiciary committee prepares to vote begin video clip chuck grassley r iowa senate judiciary committee chair all i know is whati aposve read in some two or three sentences that was in some report that came out overnight end video clip wallace we aposll ask republican senator john kennedy about the fallout next commercial break wallace the senate judiciary committee has scheduled a vote this week to send the nomination to the supreme court of judge brett kavanaugh to the senate floor but will a letter accusing kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in high school derail his confirmation joining us now from louisiana senator john kennedy a republican member of the judiciary committee we should note we invited all ten committee democrats to join us today none of them accepted but we aposre happy to have you senator kennedy what do you make of this allegation against kavanaugh back when he was a teenager do you think it will do anything to derail his nomination his confirmation john kennedy r la senate judiciary committee i aposm fairly confident that our founding fathers did not intend the process to work this way so far it aposs pretty much been an intergalactic freak show senator grassley our chairman did the best he could at the hearing senators kept interrupting him they ignored the rules we had over 240 protesters who stood up screaming the only thing missing i think was the the genitalia shaped headgear there were wild accusations about kavanaugh that he aposs evil and he hates women he hates children he hates little warm puppies and now we have this recent allegation by senator feinstein i mean here aposs what we know she she aposs produced a letter it aposs a secret letter and we aposre we aposre not entitled to see it or know who wrote it it supposedly was put together with the help of stanford law school the lady in the letter says that 35 years ago when she was a teenager and judge kavanaugh was a teenager he allegedly made sexual advances against her at a party now kavanaugh denies it the only other person in the room denies it senator feinstein has had the letter since july for three months she aposs said nothing nothing zero nada zilch she didn apost say anything in the confirmation hearing she didn apost say anything in our in our confidential session with judge kavanaugh when the senators and the nominee met privately and now after it aposs all over she produces the letter i think chris in my opinion most americans are looking at this most mainstream americans and they aposre thinking that congress has hit rock bottom and started to dig and and i have been embarrassed by the whole process and frankly i aposm no disrespect to senator feinstein or to stanford law school but i aposm a little bit offended i sit on judiciary committee they aposve had this this stuff for for three months if they were serious about it they they they should have told us about it wallace ok so that was that was a full answer do you think that your committee will send will approve the kavanaugh nomination and send it to the floor on this week as scheduled kennedy yes i think i think the vote will be 11 10 a party line vote wallace that aposs a straight party line vote kennedy straight party line vote i think the nomination will come to the floor that will be up to senator mcconnell i think every republican will vote for judge kavanaugh i think at least two and probably more democrats will you may disagree with judge kavanaugh aposs political or judicial rather philosophy i don apost kavanaugh believes that the role of a judge is to interpret the law not make a lot and i agree with that no fair minded american can believe that he aposs not qualified he went to yale law school he didn apost get his law degree from costco he has a total command of supreme court precedent i think he aposs a legal rock star now this new allegation i don apost know what our democratic friends expect us to do what do they want us to do we got a letter but it aposs it aposs secret we don apost know who wrote it all we know is that a female wrote it from california and stanford law school helped to write it and we can apost we can apost see who who are we going to cross examine senator feinstein i mean give me a break wallace i want to ask you you you you as i think folks already recognize if they didn apost know you already your colorful and one of the things that you say is that this hearing shows that crazy never takes a vacation in congress i want to ask you about two democratic senators and what they did in the hearings first of all cory booker who said he was defying the rules and releasing confidential e mails here he is begin video clip cory booker d nj senate judiciary committee i will say that i did willingly violate the chair aposs rule on the committee confidential process i take full responsibility for violating that sir begin video clip wallace but of course as we all know now it turns out that the committee had already released those confidential e mails before cory booker made such a big show about releasing them kennedy right wallace and then there was democratic senator kamala harris who sounded like she had a bombshell here she is begin video clip kamala harris d cali senate judiciary committee have you discussed mueller or his investigation with anyone at kasowitz benson and torres the law firm founded by marc kasowitz president trump aposs personal lawyer brett kavanaugh supreme court nominee ah harris be sure about your answer sir end video clip wallace but as alarming as that sounded senator harris never produced any evidence that in fact kavanaugh had talked to anyone at the law firm about robert mueller what do you think was going on with the democrats in this hearing kennedy well i aposm not going to impugn the motives of senator harris or senator booker in fact i was i was presiding for senator grassley when senator booker first started his cross examination of the judge with a document that was supposed to be confidential and i was asked to cut him off i said no i aposm not going to cut him off let aposs let it rip let it rip let it all come out but here aposs here aposs the bottom line both cory and senator harris they want an activist liberal judge they want a judge who will rewrite the constitution every other thursday to to advance political agendas that they can apost get by the voters and a representative democracy through congress now i don apost i think that i think that judges are supposed to call the balls on the strikes wallace ok kennedy they aposre supposed to say what the law is not with the law ought to be we just disagree now that aposs why god made congress let aposs go vote here aposs where we are let aposs go vote we we aposve done everything we can do we i know we got the last minute secret allegation but there aposs nothing we can do about that kavanaugh has been through six not four not five six fbi background checks none of this stuff has ever come up before wallace senator kennedy let aposs go vote wallace senator i aposve got about a minute left so i am going to ask you kennedy ok wallace i aposm going to invoke closure here i want to switch out subjects with you and ask you about paul manafort aposs decision to take a plea deal and agree to cooperate with the special counsel your thoughts on how big a deal this conceivably could be kennedy i you know all of this is just speculation i can speculate as well as anybody else but none of us know chris here aposs what i do i do know that russia tried to interfere in our election in 2016 they aposve only been doing it for 50 years and other countries probably did and are trying to do it right now for the midterms that aposs number one number two i don apost think that mr mueller should should be should be fired think we ought to let him finish his investigation i wish he would hurry he needs to get to the bottom of this but do it quickly wallace right kennedy number three i want him to report to the american people give them the facts the american people are smart enough to figure it out and then let aposs then let aposs get back to the business of trying to fix this country wallace senator kennedy thank you thanks for your time and of course we aposll follow this week aposs vote by the judiciary committee thank you sir kennedy thank you chris wallace up next the face off between secretary of state pompeo and his predecessor john kerry over the iran nuclear deal commercial break begin video clip chuck grassley r iowa senate judiciary committee chair all i know is what i aposve read in some two or three sentences that was in some report that came out overnight and i since i don apost know anything more about it then just what i read that aposs all i can say at this point end video clip wallace senator chuck grassley who chairs the judiciary committee reacting to news his democratic counterpart dianne feinstein referred a letter to the fbi alleging sexual misconduct by supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh when he was in high school and we aposre back now with the panel karl what do you think of this latest allegation against judge kavanaugh about something that he did when he was or allegedly did when he was a teenager and generally how do you think democrats handled the confirmation hearing karl rove fox news contributor well look this has gone from bad to worse i mean senator spartacus inaudible embarrassed himself kamala harris mistook the hearing for an addition for law and order for a minor part as a prosecutor in law and order and now we have this dreadful letter from dianne feinstein who aposs had this since july the letter is anonymous from somebody who doesn apost want the issue pressed and doesn apost want her name exposed and suddenly we aposre supposed to take this as a reason to either delay the process or worse yet to take one of the most distinguished persons ever nominated for the supreme court and deny him a seat and i think this is shameful it aposs a sign of the depths to which our congress has fallen and this all started with with a great man doing a bad thing by borking robert bork and it has gotten worse and worse and worse over the years ninety five percent of republicans voted for ginsburg 75 percent voted for stephen breyer half the democrats voted for roberts 10 percent of them voted for alito and i would be shocked if more than one or two or three democrats voted for for brett kavanaugh thus far the decline wallace julie do officials at the white house think that this allegation about something that happened decades ago literally could derail his confirmation how confident are they even at this point that judge kavanaugh will be justice kavanaugh when the supreme court starts its new session in october julie pace associated press one of the things that give them a bit of confidence towards the end of last week after this letter from feinstein came out was that you didn apost see a lot of democrats really jumping on this democrats have been looking for some way to slow down the nomination and there was a sense that if the letter from feinstein was real if they felt like it could actually have an effect at holding off his confirmation that you would see harris and booker and some of these other democrats really piling on and that hasn apost happened to your point earlier that you didn apost have any democrats from the committee wallace yes we asked every single ten members democrats on the committee and we assumed that one of them would want to come on to pace and it aposs striking if you do feel like if you aposre a democrat and you do feel like this is something that could slow down the nomination you would expect to be out here pushing this forward i think that republicans are still a little worried about collins and murkowski the two swing republicans who haven apost said either way what they aposre going to do a lot of attention will be on them early this week but at this point i think the white house is fairly confident that this is going to move forward wallace i do know that collins spoke to kavanaugh on the phone for an hour on friday so whatever she aposs going to do she aposs she had a full time to ask him about it let aposs turn to another interesting story this week it turns out that former secretary of state john kerry has been talking this is file tape has been privately talking with iranian foreign minister zarif several times since leaving office and he acknowledges that they discussed the iran nuclear deal a deal of course that president trump pulled out of this spark the current secretary of state the successor to john kerry mike pompeo to blast kerry this week take a look begin video clip john kerry former secretary of state i think everybody in the world is sitting around talking about waiting out president trump mike pompeo secretary of state actively undermining u s policy as a former secretary of state is literally unheard of end video clip wallace congresswoman harman did john kerry do anything wrong jane harman director woodrow wilson center i don apost think so the logan act has to do with directly negotiating with a foreign power when you aposre not an employee or authorized by the united states to do so he wasn apost negotiating he was taking meetings my understanding is that he informed our government i aposm not sure where that he was taking the meeting and he gave them the summary of what happened at the meeting i think he has a right as a private citizen to meet with whoever he wants to but i don apost think i think i understand why mike pompeo is upset because this is a tricky moment for the administration and i think they wrongly i personally think they wrongly pulled out of the deal but i don apost think that kerry crossed a red line in anyway i just want to say one thing about that letter chris if i could and that is wallace the kavanaugh letter harman the kavanaugh letter and that is that it is unsubstantiated and i think feinstein delay doing anything because the woman didn apost want to come forward on the other hand if that did happen if there aposs any proof that the activities alleged happened i think that might reflect on kavanaugh aposs character and all i would recommend is that the committee meet again now that all members have a redacted version of the letter without the names and in private session they aposre not voting until thursday they could meet tomorrow and then decide whether there ought to be an additional public session so that the rest of us could catch up on where they are i think that should have been part of the formal hearing and i aposm sorry it wasn apost wallace ok well let me just say on that we aposve only got a couple of minutes left she had plenty of opportunity she had the letter since july she met for an hour alone with kavanaugh she was there in the hearing she didn apost attend apparently the private hearing that she had plenty of opportunity to bring this up let let me let me just go on with back to kerry do you think there aposs anything wrong i mean this is a delicate moment the president has pulled out our european allies may want to continue to do business and here you have john kerry who aposs one of the architects of the deal talking to foreign ministers zarif jason chaffetz fox news contributor i i understand former officials whether it be members of congress or administration meet with other government officials on a regular basis where it crosses the line where i do think secretary kerry should be interviewed by the department of justice is was he actively trying to subvert the trump administration you have a very serious charge by the current secretary of state mike pompeo but i do think it is worthy based on kerry aposs comments and his actions plus what he aposs done in the past that somebody from the department of justice should investigate this i think you cross a line when you aposre actively trying to subvert the current administration wallace well i mean you say when you aposre actively you don apost know that he was trying to chaffetz all i aposm suggesting is it aposs worthy of an investigation by the department of justice to sit down and do that interview and look at the facts and find out if he did potentially violate that that act wallace got less than a minute left karl where do you come down on this rove look it aposs important that previous administration officials have the freedom to you know talk to foreign leaders and share those insights with the current administration it aposs valuable what we don apost know is what did he say was he listening was he discussing or was he advocating in his body language in his television appearance leads me to believe that he was maybe advocating yes wait him out until the next administration if so that aposs problematic now it aposs i i don apost think it aposs worthy of a justice department investigation the logan act has had two unsuccessful prosecutions in its entire history since being passed in whenever it was 1803 so and that aposs wrong but it but if john kerry walked into that meeting and said my advice to you as a former secretary of state of the united states of america is wait this current administration out that was wrong and unhelpful to our country wallace all right we aposre going to have to leave it there thank you panel see you all next sunday up next some very special power players of the week three of america aposs bravest who went above and beyond the call of duty commercial break wallace this week i had a once in a lifetime unforgettable opportunity to sit down with some of america aposs bravest at the congressional medal of honor society aposs annual convention i moderated a town hall for the more than 4 000 midshipmen at the u s naval academy in annapolis a sea of white where i got to speak with three of the nation aposs 72 living medal of honor recipients the nation aposs highest military honor begin videotape wallace voice over woody williams the only living marine from world war ii to receive the medal of honor at the battle of iwo jima he took out a network of japanese pillboxes to clear the way for the infantry hershel woody williams medal of honor recipient the flame thrower was the most effective weapon that we had against the pillboxes because they were reinforced concrete wallace kyle carpenter who took the blast from a grenade in afghanistan to shield a fellow marine kyle carpenter medal of honor recipient i essentially came to terms with reality that this was it and i was bleeding out and this was the last few seconds i would have wallace edward byers the most decorated living navy seal he jumped on top of an american doctor taken hostage by the taliban to protect him from the firefight master chief edward byers jr medal of honor recipient the doctor finally said hey i aposm i aposm over here i aposm over here and in that time i was adjusting my night vision to get some facial recognition on the person that i was on top of wallace speaking to the brigade of midshipmen i asked how their training prepared them for the heat of battle williams other marines taught me what i knew but i aposm a farm boy byers there are so many unknowns that go into a hostage scenario and it takes a lot of highly confident people and a lot of support personnel behind them to give them the tools they need to be able to execute a mission like that wallace on camera do you feel any sense of fear in that moment williams i aposve always said if you aposre being shot at and you have no fear there aposs something wrong with you you don apost think that way you think victoriously you think achievement you aposre going to accomplish this thing it makes no difference what it takes to do it carpenter i truly feel like no matter what the situation was or who was in my position you know if they were a united states there with me they would have done the same thing wallace i think i know the answer to this question woody do you think your hero williams absolutely not no i was just doing a job that the marine corps taught me to do and that was my duty i was doing it for my country my fellow marines and to win a war just imagine if we aposd lost wallace what advice would you give to these young men and women byers i mean post 9 11 willingly signed up to support and defend the constitution of our united states and that experience will transcend the rest of your life carpenter you could have gone to any other big school you could have gone to the party schools you could have done anything else and you chose to come here williams less than one tenth of 1 percent of our people serve in the military so every one of you have something in you that the average person doesn apost have every one of y
