one reason why it s surprisingly difficult to disprove many conspiracy theories is that they typically contain a real germ of truth however small in some places and eras jews really were overrepresented among communist cadres and the media john f kennedy s administration really did propose false flag operations as an excuse to invade cuba and assassinate fidel castro certain aspects of the world trade center collapse including the fall of building 7 really were odd and unprecedented some military video footage of unidentified aerial phenomena really is hard to square with conventional aircraft flight patterns and then of course there are the various detours of the single bullet believed to have caused no fewer than seven entry and exit wounds to president kennedy and texas governor john connally on november 22nd 1963 this same complication applies to unfounded or thinly evidenced theories regarding the origins of the covid 19 pandemic did the sars cov 2 virus originate in bats sold at a wet market in wuhan or an artificial virus created in a bio lab did dr li wenliang the wuhan central hospital whistleblower who warned his government weeks before officials locked down the city really die from covid 19 or was he murdered the whole area of inquiry has become a fertile playground for conspiracists in part because no one can reasonably dispute the germ of truth behind their theories the dishonesty and lack of transparency that often has characterized china s response to the pandemic conspiracism always flourishes when people are faced with uncertain open ended sources of suffering or evil the mind abhors a vacuum of explanation so when gaps in knowledge open up the empty spaces are filled with available explanations that however implausible seem morally compelling usually conspiracists target the suspected evildoers they had their eye on anyway plagues and pandemics are especially popular feedstock for conspiracism because their causal agents bacteria and viruses remain invisible to the naked eye and were invisible full stop until the invention of powerful microscopes but the jews targeted by medieval mobs for poisoning wells and other imaginary acts of biological terrorism were not invisible nor today is bill gates whom some members of the pro donald trump qanon conspiracy movement accuse of seeking to undermine the trump administration now that impeachment efforts have failed anthony fauci the medical lead on the american government s response to the pandemic often is lumped in with this alleged deep state movement supporting the gatesian agenda an analysis by the new york times found over 70 accounts on twitter promoting the hashtag faucifraud with some tweeting as frequently as 795 times a day in some cases the theories are quite complex in late january a youtuber named jordan sather proclaimed that the government funded pirbright institute out of the uk possibly planned the release of this disease through modification of a coronavirus that might otherwise be used to vaccinate birds the connection to gates was that the pirbright institute once received a grant to study livestock antibodies from the bill melinda gates foundation this convoluted theory was given a boost on april 13th by fabulist roger stone who told joe piscopo on his am radio program the answer that whether bill gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate he added that gates and other globalists are using it for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people so we know if they ve been tested given that anti vaxxers have been spreading false rumors about vaccines for generations and that microchip based conspiracies have been common since the 1970s it should not be surprising that covid 19 conspiracists were able to tap into pre existing networks of true believers even if the assertion that the deep state has claimed fauci perhaps the most trusted man in america since walter cronkite should test the credulity of even the most hardboiled conspiracy theorist as for pirbright a surrey based institute that when it is not helping evil globalists spread diabolical plagues dedicates itself to the study of infectious diseases among farm animals a spokesman for the organization noted that its patent does not include any coronavirus based vaccine that affects humans that its work in this area isn t funded by the gates foundation and that the patented work cited in the conspiracy theories involved infectious bronchitis virus ibv only and we made four changes in the gene responsible for replicating the virus s genetic material this has weakened the virus so it is no longer able to cause disease and thereby has potential to be used as a vaccine but has not yet been developed my emphasis one grain of truth bolstering the vaccine related subniche of conspiracy culture is that many jurisdictions really do require citizens to get vaccinated for certain common diseases such as measles and so it is not crazy to assert as some conspiracy theorists do in the lead up to more far fetched accusations that governments may in time impose covid 19 vaccination mandates if a safe and effective vaccine is developed what is crazy is to imagine that all of this will be in the service of some kind of hollywood villain style genocidal or thought control agenda an idea that emerged during the original sars epidemic in the early 2000s the 2009 h1n1 pandemic and the subsequent ebola crisis then there s the anti vaxxer claim that the ordinary flu vaccine regime that governments have been promoting for years actually makes people more vulnerable to covid 19 and since china allegedly ordered more flu vaccines in 2019 than in prior years this somehow explains why the outbreak began in wuhan and not say wichita this theory has been addressed in detail by alternative medicine and cancer quackery debunker dr david gorski at sciencebasedmedicine org among other things he cheekily points out that antivaxxers love to claim that the flu vaccine doesn t work which if true would undercut the idea that it could cause interference with other viruses and so antivaxxers really need to make up their minds wireless networks electrical grids and cordless devices also have provided conspiracy theorists with rich fodder since like microscopic pathogens they are invisible to the naked eye even as they surround us the same is true of the mind control chemicals supposedly contained in the contrails produced by airplanes yet oddly with the skies now clear and almost entirely contrail free during the pandemic lockdown i haven t noticed any radical change in human behavior and so the timing of the coronavirus outbreak following the rollout of 5g cell technology in many markets predictably served as a dynamo for certain conspiracists including woody harrelson john cusack and robert f kennedy jr indeed the latter added a twist by introducing the further idea that the collective lockdown many of us are now enduring might have been intended to obstruct 5g rollout and has effectively ended the opportunity for mass public protests which were our best hope for derailing the 5g robber barons from microwaving our country and destroying nature such theories coupled to related claims that energy from 5g towers is the real source of covid 19 even led to recent arson attacks on british mobile phone towers in birmingham liverpool and merseyside it also apparently led to a train engineer in los angeles derailing a locomotive near the navy hospital ship usns mercy he later explained to investigators that the ship had an alternate purpose related to covid 19 or a government takeover and that you only get this chance once the whole world is watching i had to people don t know what s going on here now they will as fullfact org notes there are almost too many 5g conspiracy theories to track and they often contradict each other perhaps the most jason bourne ish conspiracy theory is that covid 19 did not really involve any kind of wet market in wuhan but is actually a bioweapon the germ of truth here is that many nations really have been researching bioweapons for generations including research on such scourges as ebola smallpox and anthrax in 2001 a handful of americans were killed by anthrax delivered through the mail and in 1979 anthrax spores were accidentally leaked from a soviet military research lab near the russian city of sverdlovsk now yekaterinburg leading to an estimated 100 deaths although precise details were subject to the usual soviet obfuscation including the claim the deaths were caused by tainted meat china s autocratic form of government press censorship occasionally aggressive foreign policy and repression of whistleblowers all make the idea that the virus was created by artificial means instead of ordinary natural selection among animal borne pathogens seem like it could be credible even if there is no real evidence for it in fact the evidence points in the opposite direction according to a genetic analysis of the virus published on march 17th in the journal naturemedicine if genetic manipulation had been performed one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used however the genetic data irrefutably show that sars cov 2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone the scientists noted the similarity of sars cov 2 to bat sars cov like coronaviruses concluding it is likely that bats serve as reservoir hosts for its progenitor with the transmission to humans most likely occurring in late november to early december 2019 the fact that bats are mammals living in massive colonies numbering in the millions and are regularly infected with virus based respiratory diseases makes the link to humans all the more credible these are just a few of the many conspiracy theories ricocheting around the internet a full catalog would be almost impossible to create and would quickly become obsolete as old conspiracy theory strains mutated into new species much as with actual pathogens this conspiracism will likely continue so long as people experience covid 19 related fear and anxiety emotions that always have been linked to conspiracist movements throughout history even when there is no pandemic to worry about all of us tend to harbor something that social scientists call a negativity bias by which bad feelings assert themselves with greater perceived urgency than their positive counterparts there are more words to describe pain than pleasure there are more cognitive categories for negative emotions than positive bad impressions and negative stereotypes form faster and are more resistant to change than those that are positive losing money and friends is more painful to us than making money and friends is pleasurable in the same way negative global events generate more attention and causal explanations than positive events everyone asks why is there war but almost no one asks why is there peace even though a broad examination of human history might suggest the latter question to be more apt one reason for this cognitive asymmetry is that human progress typically is made incrementally in small steps whereas catastrophic setbacks can occur all at once around the world right now millions of businesses that took decades to build up may now go bankrupt because of a tragedy that has unfolded in a matter of months moreover the mental habits we ve developed through evolutionary processes are well suited to sensing the presence of large predators but serve us poorly when the enemy can t be detected that s when our thinking can go sideways and whole societies become susceptible to conspiracist notions which often represent mere extrapolations of existing populist political themes leaders around the world know this and are leveraging our uncertainties and anxieties to grab more power as in viktor orb n s hungary recep tayyip erdo an s turkey benjamin netanyahu s israel vladimir putin s russia and especially xi jinping s china this is one of the great ironies of conspiracism unjustified fears about fictional conspiracies can themselves be leveraged by governments to facilitate their own very real machinations which in turn reduce public trust thus does the cycle of conspiracism continue michael shermer is the publisher of skeptic magazine a presidential fellow at chapman university and the author most recently of giving the devil his due cambridge university press a defense of free speech featured image freedom or bust may day rally columbus ohio may 1st 2020 the world is unfortunately chaotic and messy we like conspiracy theories because when faced with a chaotic and miserable world the thought that someone is controlling what s going on is comforting even if that someone is malicious i grow concerned about the overuse of the phrase conspiracy theory these days a conspiracy is a secret collaboration many theories that are untrue or assume maliciousness do not assert that the activity is trying to be hidden or do not assert that it is a collaboration easy example suspecting that a desire to malign the us response to covid 19 is motivated by a desire to harm the presidency of donald trump is not a conspiracy theory no coordination is needed for people to do this nor are most perpetrators making an effort to keep their agenda secret it is an open obvious effort the use of the phrase conspiracy theory then seems often to be an effort to malign a theory without having to formulate a rational argument against it it s just another that s racist there is a point to be made about the fact that the public s loss of trust in institutions makes it easier for inane conspiracy theories to take hold blame for this belongs much more with the institutions than with the people i am reminded of october 2018 in the us after weeks of firebombings ricin mailings physical assaults and vandalisms perpetrated by left wing activists against republicans suddenly packages starting being mailed which contained badly misspelled names of prominent democrats that were all but written in crayon and contained pipes and wires which were very very far away from being functional bombs the reaction on the right was exactly what it should have been suspicion that this was a false flag attack perpetrated by democrats just weeks before an election in an effort to change the conversation about pervasive left wing political violence to one about trump supporter violence turns out it actually was a trump supporter a guy who genuinely has an iq around 80 and was genuinely that clueless or at least that s the best information i have democrats enjoyed mocking republicans for their inaccurate false flag assumption but the assumption made a lot of sense if we want to see fewer conspiracy theories it would help if various institutions did more to earn the public s trust as it stands they seem more interested in tearing each other down generally a good article however i would take exception to the following statement that s when our thinking can go sideways and whole societies become susceptible to conspiracist notions which often represent mere extrapolations of existing populist political themes there is ample evidence to suggest that populism is a perfectly natural response to high rates of foreign born citizenship historian niall ferguson has suggested that it occurs when rates of foreign born citizenship reach around 14 and is most likely to happen when combined with an economic downturn something that has occurred three times in america s history and seems to be occurring everywhere in europe where this threshold has been reached the only exception to this rule seems to be australia where an extremely strict merit based system reassures the public that migrants will not be competing for working class or lower middle class jobs it s about our moral foundations and our weird psychology to use the terminology developed by jonathan haidt and his colleagues simply put if you are born into a relatively affluent secure and comfortable environment and have educationally aspirational parents then the moral foundations which are universal throughout the rest of the world common to the bottom 60 of the western society and which basically equates to ingroup preference will be switched off and you will likely be a cosmopolitan liberal if you are less fortunate you will be normal which is to say the same as the vast swathe of humanity in the rest of the world this difference is made manifest most strikingly in the strong preference for the familiar it s why migrant populations group together whenever they transplant themselves from their country of origin to a new environment the attachment is to culture not race or ethnicity is witnessed most succinctly in britain where 2nd or 3rd generation people of colour have been fully integrated into british culture but high levels of migration from white eastern european migrants of culturally distinct origin has led to a sentiment opposed to mass migration it s about the preservation of existing culture of social norms and customs more than anything else something which the cosmopolitan liberal abhors with their obsession with universalism and oikophobic prejudice their intolerance of their social subordinates is based on the mistaken belief that experience and the process of education can correct this fault when it is the circumstances of educational family background which is the deciding factor all of which distracts from the main point mass migration is only good at a macroeconomic level and only when one discounts the negative repercussions at a detailed level when we look at the income spectrum the top 20 benefit whilst the lowest paid suffer for the worst paid this amounts to a 6 to 8 pay cut and for those somewhat further up the economic ladder the decline in wages is closer to 4 to 5 at least when the rate of foreign born citizenship reaches 14 a far bigger issue is the impact of migration on labour participation rates particularly amongst the less well educated over a 34 year period the 14 figure for foreign born citizenship equated to a 2 overall reduction in rates of labour participation this might not seem like much but if you are in the bottom 40 of the population and happen to be male it might mean you are somewhere just under 10 less likely to secure employment this contains hidden cost in terms of incarceration drug addiction family break up single motherhood and mental health which are never costed at the macroeconomic level often second or third generation minorities are hit the worst with labour participation rates 5 lower for these communities than for the majority population all this skirts the main issue that brexiteers were more concerned about unelected and unaccountable bureaucracies in europe and as well the baleful influence of creeping transnationalism if you are james o brien and follow the same blogpost on eu regulations then you will know that there is little in the way of eu regulations that impacts our daily lives although personally i would look more to the ecj and echr and the current supremacy of european courts on this issue but this entirely misses the point it s not eu regulations individually which cause a problem it s eu regulations collectively which stifle prosperity and cause stagnation eu bureaucracy and it s regulations effectively protect existing corporations from competition from new entrants to the market in the form of small businesses the cost of regulatory compliance is simply too high until a business reaches certain economies of scale and the eu knows this because that is the way the regulations were designed the result of this is a general reduction in the number of jobs in many european economies because it is often at the newer and more innovative end of the marketplace where processes are at their most labour intensive critically the types of varied work that occur in new enterprises are the most rewarding on a personal level and the most conducive to the building of human capital th upshot of all this is that whilst the us has seen a decline in it s overall share of the world economy from 37 to 31 as asian economies rise the eu has seen a far sharper decline of 31 to 17 that s what happens when you clog up the valves of innovation that new businesses represent it s worth noting that one the few european countries which has managed to keep pace with world innovation producing a disproportionate rate of unicorn businesses is sweden which shares the uk s cultural disdain for eu regulation and maintains scepticism over the prospects of monetary union to quote niall ferguson regulation is the disease of which it pretends to be the cure so please let s stop with the nonsense about populism and call it what it is democracy in action many might find they have more sympathy for opposing viewpoints if they could be bothered to take the time to understand the people who hold them beyond that it might help if the media didn t keep choosing the most extreme outliers in any group to represent the larger mass of popular movements most people protesting right now are just worried about their livelihoods the prospects of surviving in a far less hospitable economy and the potentially higher number of people who will die from lockdown as opposed to covid 19 after all the right could just as easily point to the fact that a number of bernie supporters were secretly taped expressing the view that they wanted to lock conservatives up in reeducation camps after the election ultimately mischaracterising a whole demographic with a tiny minority is a framing device as divisive as it is dishonest let s stop my apologies to the author for taking umbrage at a simple choice of words but there is a growing tide of cosmopolitan liberals who simply refuse to understand that ordinary people have different ways of looking at the world and different goals from them so please let s stop with the nonsense about populism and call it what it is democracy in action yes populism has become the slur to help some people try to avoid having to accept other people s democratic rights refusing to accept that greek pensioners should have their pensions cut in order to pay back german and french banks you re a populist people need to stop using this word as it shows a real lack of awareness as it is their rights being eroded by unaccountable organisations like the eu as well leaders around the world know this and are leveraging our uncertainties and anxieties to grab more power as in viktor orb n s hungary recep tayyip erdo an s turkey benjamin netanyahu s israel vladimir putin s russia and especially xi jinping s china still a blatant and unashamed cherry picking why not add to this honor list the presidents or prime ministers of italy france uk spain belgium as well as a great deal of the us governors i m badly surprised by the constant endeavour of quillette to mitigate even cover the ugly management of a bunch of western leaders which sends a number of us to the final ruin as innocent blunderers or even poor victims of the circumstances that shouldn t be surprising from the msm which are establishment propagandists even more in war time but quillette very strange in this incredible man made mess i however single out the honest consistent and brave stance on the whole of the swedish dutch german leaders who have resited the mortal assault of the hysteric trump has been rather good and sane so far among this huge insanity africans did very well what is not usual but i guess they had not the luxurious choice to make them poorer quillette where pedestrian thought lives seriously man yes anti vaxxers have it wrong yes the 5g conspiracy theory is looney tunes however guess what just as not every person who didn t vote for hilary is a deplorable redneck neo nazi so too then let s just momentarily consider that perhaps not every lockdown or covid skeptic is a nutjob screaming lizard people for starters and i m someone who is very grateful for every vaccination i ever got as a kid it really is the case that flu vaccines have a low efficacy rate about 20 30 on average i think the efficacy rate of the h3n2 flu vaccine in 2017 18 was 10 this is not conspiracy it just is and so the idea of a vaccine coming to our rescue is not altogether realistic second just because some nut tried to burn down a 5g tower doesn t mean the hysterical overreaction to covid and a lockdown that guarantees an economic collapse is now a model of sanity third enough with the digs at the pro trump faction every second contributor to quillette feels obligated to make left wingers have had tons of their own tetchy conspiracy theories putin rigged the elections dingbat scare stories all those crap armegeddon predictions by the world renowned scientist al gore and selective science bill nye the butt stuff guy i agree with geary i like shermer s work and i agree with 95 of the article but he weakens his argument by making it political i note that he could not resist a dig at netanyahu who unlike the dictators he mentions was democratically elected multiple times it must be those uneducated rubes and here i thought we jews were supposed to be smart there goes that stereotype grin conspiracy theorists and populists are separate and distinct groups conspiracy theorists believe that there is an evil secret group of elitist businessmen government officials jews pick your group that gets together and secretly controls policy populists sometimes not always play to group anxieties about being left behind and or perceived victimhood for example critical race theory which holds that white men are responsible for all evil in the world plays to fears and anxieties it is a populist movement but the theory does not suggest that all white men get together and secretly plot ways to screw over blacks and women we just happen to be evil grin more rationally you can recognize that globalism and the move towards a knowledge economy has left people behind without assuming that all highly educated people purposely plotted to screw over blue collar workers can you believe it those stupid rubes actually think there is some deep state conspiracy they think that distinguished long serving government employees lied to a fisa court citing a report that they knew to be discredited they think that these officials edited out exculpatory evidence in emails the rubes even think that the fbi spied on the trump campaign further they think a group of high ranking officials got together to set up trump s national security adviser with bogus charges the idiots actually think that the fbi pressured him plead guilty by threatening his son and made a secret side deal with the attorney defending him have you ever heard anything so ridiculous ah wait a minute speaking of conspiracy theories revealed major anti lockdown group s links to america s far right guardian sometimes the best evidence that the left is crazy is provided by left wing people themselves willingly and eagerly this guardian article is chock full of standard left wing fallacies all in all what we have here is a typical left wing circlejerk anything right of center is racist by definition so it deserves to be attacked and because it s been attacked that proves it deserves to be attacked and nothing with a whiff of right of center belief is bipartisan or grassroots or any other good word because republicans don t get good words read your ap approved thesaurus thanks rodmclaughlin for giving us a timely reminder of how weak the propaganda that powers the left is as well as the astounding lack of basic scrutiny that left wing people apply to their own claims before sharing them memo to guardian s editors leaders around the world know this and are leveraging our uncertainties and anxieties to grab more power as in viktor orb n s hungary recep tayyip erdo an s turkey benjamin netanyahu s israel vladimir putin s russia and especially xi jinping s china dear author please fuck yourself with a cactus i m afraid that the editors do not care too much about their reputation allowing such a piece of shit to float on this site not being a scientist i have to go with what the government tells us is the cause of the illness we are calling a virus these are the same people who said florida would be under water by now so i tend to doubt a lot of what the government says wuhan virus getting out of the wuhan lab which was doing perfectly legitimate research in support of advances in viral infection treatments while having abysmal safety record is not a goofy conspiracy theory that similarly to any accident or crime investigation is a reasonable scenario to check and follow or eliminate we did land on the moon and chernobyl did happen there is a danger in mixing the idiotic with the possible i couldn t agree more with your comment i would add that the use of the term conspiracy theory is not only silencing legitimate disagreement or dissent but any discussion at all this is becoming very apparent in the last few months with the pandemic and the censorship shown by facebook and youtube people who write about conspiracy theories rarely point out one very salient fact the united states government does in fact engage in a lot of very shady and highly impactful conspiracies in other news we re seeing pretty solid evidence that a conspiracy inside the fbi and the democrat party tried to sabotage the trump administration and succeeded to be perfectly frank the fbi and cia have done nothing but conspire about things since they were founded conspiracies or at least serious deception underlay the beginning of the spanish american vietnamese and iraq wars and probably our entry into wwii as well a us president not so long ago was booted from office because of conspiring to spy on his opponents add to that that most everything on the news is obviously bullshit if people believe weird shit it s because they have no reason whatsoever to trust most of the information they re given or the people giving it to them and plenty of reason to believe that what they re being told is specifically designed to manipulate them just a thought if elites want the proles to believe in fewer conspiracies they should try to be less conspiratorial didn t we just find out the russia collusion thing that was shoved down our throats for years was a complete and deliberate fabrication and that the people who were branded conspiracy nuts were right all along russia collusion is interesting on the one hand rachel maddow spun wild conspiracy theories night after night for about 3 years these were frequently hour long monologues linking everything in the news to her theory that trump was an asset of russian president putin in the end not one single thing maddow ever reported on made it into the final mueller report except facts like moscow is the capital of russia on the other hand many believed there was a conspiracy in the deep state to at least weaken or worse the trump presidency by getting trump s national security advisor fired and then prosecuted and also disseminating the information obtained via a suspicious dossier compiled by a british foreign agent with the help of kremlin associated sources this led to wire taps of innocent trump campaign workers the dossier was funded by the hillary clinton campaign the media still dismisses all of this as a conspiracy theory even though none of the facts are contested they can all be found in sworn senate and house testimony and the ig report 154 more replies
