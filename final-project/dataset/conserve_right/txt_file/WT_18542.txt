domestic growth western companies are turning to emerging markets with greater frequency participation in those markets however is not without risk businesses face challenges ranging from corruption to unfair regulations and a host of other issues executives must weigh the difficulty of operating in such an environment versus the potential benefits and nowhere is this truer than in china one particularly daunting problem that companies face is the chinese government s harassment of foreign firms through coordinated efforts between state owned media and government regulators this threatens international competitiveness in the chinese market and is an impediment to the long term viability of these ventures it is time for the administration to demand an end to such unfair attacks on american companies this pattern of harassment of foreign firms by state controlled media outlets ironically being carried out in the name of combating corruption is well established according to testimony by american foreign policy council s joshua eisenman china has been making it harder for foreign firms to operate in the mainland by disproportionately targeting them in crackdowns clamping down on their operations and employing innovative discriminatory tactics to restrict their ability to conduct business top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections

kfc mcdonald s and pizza hut cases brought by regulators typically begin with state run media breathlessly reporting questionable exaggerated or inaccurate claims about the american firms in the case of kfc state controlled china central television cctv made the seemingly shocking claim that ice cubes used in kfc stores were 12 times dirtier than toilet water according to bacterial tests conducted by the news agency perhaps if the experiment had been conducted by academics instead of chinese government propagandists it might have disclosed that raw bacteria numbers are meaningless not all bacteria is created equal according to food safety expert dong qingli the bacteria count on your teeth or on the bottom of your shoe is about the same what matters is the type of bacteria and whether it is harmful to people the cctv report in other words said nothing useful about actual health risks cctv also led the attack against apple with charges of greedy and incomparably arrogant behavior the cause for such accusations nothing more than allegedly subpar service for chinese customers even if the claim is true consumers are more than capable of resolving the problem themselves by shopping elsewhere legal force is unnecessary and counterproductive car manufacturers have faced similarly excessive scrutiny and overblown accusations from cctv last summer husi food a subsidiary of u s based food processing corporation osi group that supplies companies like mcdonald s and kfc became the latest victim of chinese officials the shanghai food and drug administration arrested six

feel unwelcome doing business in the country it would be easy to suggest that american and other foreign companies operating in china should simply leave for more hospitable destinations and if present trends continue that may start to happen but the nation s massive population and growing consumer class is highly attractive and it s an undeniable benefit for american corporations to succeed
