apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap a massive hacker attack has crippled an overseas website that has reported extensively on china s biggest political turmoil in years underscoring the pivotal role the internet has played in the unfolding scandal north carolina based boxun com was forced to move to a new web hosting service friday after its previous host said the attacks were threatening its entire business website manager watson meng told the associated press he believes the attacks were ordered by china s security services but it isn t clear where they were launched from the assaults on boxun s server followed days of reporting on bo xilai formerly one of the country s most powerful politicians who was fired as head of the mega city of chongqing and suspended from the party s politburo amid accusations of his wife s involvement in the murder of a british businessman top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender the scandal has deeply embarrassed community party leaders obsessed with controlling their image and imposing strict secrecy over their inner workings six years ago when shanghai s powerful boss was toppled chinese social media was in its infancy and months went by with no word on the case against him today the dynamics have changed and when the government fails to release information about a key political development the online rumor mill goes into overdrive with china s half a billion internet users taking to blogs foreign news sites and most significantly weibo china s hugely popular version of twitter people on weibo used to care mainly about lifestyle issues but this time we re seeing it play an unprecedented role in spreading political information and opinion said zhan jiang a professor at beijing foreign studies university s school of mass media the first whiff of the bo scandal came when his former right hand man ex chongqing police chief wang lijun breached protocol with a surprising feb 6 visit first reported in weibo postings to a u s consulate in a neighboring city there were rumors of a spat with bo but neither chinese nor u s revealed any details of the consulate visit at the time bo admitted to not properly managing his staff but it appeared he would keep his job and remain a candidate for the party s all powerful politburo standing committee when a new generation of leaders is picked this fall but then the scandal caught fire with suggestions online that wang was spreading the word about the alleged involvement of bo s wife in the death of briton neil heywood a business consultant with close ties to bo s family those suspicions first appeared in a brief posting in early march by a reporter from the southern weekend newspaper group who said he d received the information via a feb 15 text message from a telephone number used only by wang that happened after chinese authorities took wang into custody on feb 7 so it wasn t known who sent the message however it was widely circulated online and the foreign media flocked to chongqing to investigate making it impossible for the government to ignore the case without sparking an international incident a few weeks later on march 15 bo was sacked as chongqing party chief and on april 10 authorities announced he was under investigation and that his wife and a household aide were suspects in the heywood murder boxun which has reported on the scandal since early february was brought down for several hours friday in a denial of service attack in which hackers deluge a website to paralyze it we publish articles critical of the chinese government so we re accused of having ulterior motives meng said in an online chat but in the west most media is critical of its government so why can t we be he said foreign governments and

edgy nature has brought it under hacker attack before and forced it to go without advertising since 2005 the u s government funded national endowment for democracy provided funding for several years but meng says it is now wholly independent not all of boxun s reports have held water and it has offered competing accounts of what drove the decision to cashier bo but many of its reports on allegations of gu s involvement in the heywood death and the bo s falling out with wang have since been proven true or been corroborated by other sources traffic to the site has grown 155 percent over the past three months according to internet monitoring firm alexa with the second largest chunk of visitors coming from china despite government blocks china heavily censors the internet and blocks twitter facebook youtube and scores of other overseas sites government monitors swiftly remove sensitive postings and have tried to rein in weibo by requiring proof of identification for new accounts and sometimes disabling sections where comments can be posted still the sites have a profound effect witness reports on a horrific train collision last year prompted disgust at officials callousness and a sweeping safety review one reason why the government may not have cracked down harder on the internet so far is because parties within the establishment also use it to attack their foes spread disinformation or advance their own agendas said xiao qiang director of the china internet project at the university of california berkeley but they can t completely control the online discussions or
