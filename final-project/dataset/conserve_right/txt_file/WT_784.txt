congress senate democrats neared an agreement with the white house tuesday night on the unprecedented economic recovery plan that includes democrats demand for the government to pay furloughed workers up to four months of lost salary delivers 500 billion to distressed companies and provides 130 billion for besieged hospitals democrats negotiated all day and into the night with treasury secretary steven t mnuchin on the package which also will include direct cash payments to the average family of four of about 3 000 both sides said they were very close to an agreement we are working to pass the biggest and boldest financial relief package in american history mr trump said at the white house they re getting very close right now to a very fair deal and a great deal for the people of our country combined with roughly 4 trillion in expanded lending and backing by the federal reserve white house economic adviser larry kudlow said washington will be injecting 6 trillion into the economy this package will be the single largest main street assistance program in the history of the united states he said leaders in congress and the administration have been working for several days to pass as quickly as possible the economic stimulus package in a move that resolved one sticking point mr mnuchin agreed to an inspector general and a five member congressional oversight panel for the 500 billion fund for distressed companies senate minority leader charles e schumer said at mid day that he was very pleased with a substantial increase of about 55 billion in funding for hospitals as well as republicans embrace of about 250 billion for what the new york democrat called unemployment insurance on steroids essentially full wages for affected workers for up to four months this is a great plan mr schumer said unemployment insurance would be expanded from 26 weeks to 39 weeks in most states boosting benefits by 600 per week through july to essentially provide full wages and salaries jobless benefits also would apply to freelancers and contractors the package also would provide nearly 400 billion in grants and loans for small business with fewer than 500 employees with loans forgiven if companies keep their employees on the payroll mr trump said the 500 billion fund for larger companies would help prop up the hard hit airline and cruise ship industries with loans the loans will be very secure and they will be very profitable the president said but mr trump emphasized the bill is very much focused on the small businessperson it s the engine of our country the owners are going to need some help and we re going to take care of them lawmakers have included a 150 billion fund for state and local governments republicans said the package also sets aside 75 billion for veterans services 20 billion for public transportation 10 billion for airports and 4 5 billion for the centers for disease control and prevention senate republicans again criticized democrats for blocking two earlier procedural votes on the package as more and more workers were laid off around the country the urgency and the gravity of this moment cannot be lost on anyone said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell everyone needs help we re all in this together in remarks directed at house speaker nancy pelosi mr mcconnell said the senate wasted time on democrat counteroffers that demanded things like new emission standards or tax credits for solar panels we saw the speaker of the house release an encyclopedia of unrelated demands as though it were a coronavirus proposal somehow in spite of all that we are very close he said democratic rep ben mcadams of utah currently hospitalized for coronavirus warned his colleagues against pursuing partisan policies as they work on a phase three economic stimulus package using a public health emergency to insert unrelated partisan provisions is wrong mr mcadams said in a statement both parties and both chambers must put politics aside and put working families lives and livelihoods first in the house lawmakers looked past democrats rival 2 5 trillion plan including a liberal wish list such as same day voter registration focusing instead on the merits of the senate package and how to approve it when most house members are back in their districts house republicans said there was general support for approving the final package by unanimous consent rather than a formal roll call that requires lawmakers to be physically present in the chamber but the gop conceded that the procedure is risky because a lone lawmaker could object and block the deal at an early evening briefing on the coronavirus task force s efforts mr trump urged congress to get the rescue package over the goal line the legislation developed in the senate is the first step to restoring confidence and stability to america s economy as we look ahead to the time when we can carefully and responsibly reopen our country
