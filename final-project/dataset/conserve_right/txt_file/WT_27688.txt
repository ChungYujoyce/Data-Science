ecomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn congress gave final approval thursday to spending increases in 2020 and 2021 but it delivered a final black eye to president trump when nearly half of senate republicans refused to back the deal he struck with house speaker nancy pelosi the agreement did clear on a 67 28 vote democrats provided most of the votes in favor signaling which party thought it got the better of the negotiations the deal sets limits for the next two years freeing the spending committees to write the dozen bills that fund government operations in the near term the agreement lessens the chances but doesn t entirely eliminate the risk of a government shutdown top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties it also marks the end of the 2011 austerity agreement between president obama and house republicans thanks to the sequester cuts and budget caps the agreement constrained at least some spending over the past decade democrats cheered the end of those limits this deal ends the threat of sequester permanently that is huge said senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat most of his troops agreed just five democrats opposed the bill though two michael f bennet of colorado and amy klobuchar of minnesota were among his party s presidential primary candidates republican leaders asked for the same level of support from their caucus this is the agreement the administration has negotiated this is the deal the house has passed this is the deal president trump is waiting and eager to sign into law said majority leader mitch mcconnell kentucky republican but 23 of his troops defied mr trump the defectors were budget committee chairman michael b enzi of wyoming and a host of other conservatives who said the deal added too much debt the agreement rewrites the spending caps mr obama signed in 2011 over the next two years the government will be able to spend 320 billion more than the current law would allow on discretionary spending the additional money is divided roughly between defense and domestic needs the deal also creates a two year debt holiday giving the treasury department the power to borrow and spend as much as needed to keep the government running through july 2021 well after the next presidential election based on trends the country will likely add 2 trillion in debt over that time mr trump who last year said he would never sign another bloated spending deal is backing this one he reportedly called some senators to ask them to support the bill preventing an even more lopsided republican tally the president said he struck the deal and accepted higher debt and domestic spending in order to get democrats to agree to higher defense spending rebuilding the military from what he called the hollow years of president obama was a major campaign promise but mr trump in an interview with c span this week suggested he will get more serious about cost cutting in 2021 if he wins reelection i think getting costs now that the military is very close to being totally rebuilt i think costs are going to be a big factor the president said sen rand paul kentucky republican tried to lead a rebellion by blasting both democrats and republicans for ignoring the explosion of red ink but he saved his worst gibes for his own party

is the republican party and they don t care either mr paul speaking ahead of the vote also dismissed mr trump s defense that it makes sense to swallow other spending in order to bolster the defense department maybe the mission is too big it isn t that the budget s too small the senator said republican leaders though said they saw reasons beyond the troops to support the deal democratic leaders agreed to forgo any major policy fights as they write spending bills over the next two years that means there will be no attempts to upset the abortion compromise that restricts federal taxpayer funding for the procedure only to cases of rape incest or threat to the life of the mother it also means democrats will not be able to use the spending process to try to derail mr trump s executive actions on immigration the far left was denied any such victories mr mcconnell said no poison pills a big win for the white house still mr mcconnell who was involved in the negotiations has been
