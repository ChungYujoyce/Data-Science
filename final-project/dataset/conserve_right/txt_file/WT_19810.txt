apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap republicans found themselves unwilling monday to swiftly and unequivocally rebuke president donald trump s attack on progressive women of color in congress almost ensuring no real fallout from his party in congress some republicans spoke up against trump s suggestion that the women should go back to the countries they came from but others leveled their criticism of trump in careful comments that also criticized the women most notably the gop leadership in congress said more than most by staying silent or defending the president s incendiary remarks the result is that once again republicans in congress are allowing trump to break the norms of civic behavior as when he equivocated over the neo nazi rally in charlottesville and used a vulgarity to describe immigrants from africa and other countries with a muffled response that does little to change outcomes top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by
