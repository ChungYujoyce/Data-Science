 michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic berlin middle east analysts acknowledge that they underestimated syrian president bashar assad who remains in power and on the offensive a year after protests against his regime erupted they say that with continued backing from russia and china mr assad could cling to power for years in contrast to the crisis in libya regional and international variables have complicated and exacerbated the situation in syria and that is why one year later assad is still there said fawaz a gerges director of the middle east center at the london school of economics top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed we underestimated the staying power and strength of assad s regime neighborhoods that had become strongholds for opposition groups have been decimated swiftly the united nations reported that more than 8 000 people have been killed in the brutal crackdown over the past year but thousands of syrians across the country still take to the streets in protest and further violence in the region has led analysts to fear that the conflict could turn into an all out sectarian civil war or even a drawn out guerrilla war on monday deadly clashes rocked a neighborhood in the capital damascus as international efforts picked up pace to initiate a daily humanitarian truce and for monitors to be deployed across the country russia a syrian ally added its voice to calls for a daily truce so that aid can be delivered to affected cities in moscow foreign minister sergey lavrov joined jakob kellenberger chief of the international committee of the red cross to demand that mr assad allow in humanitarian aid syrian security forces meanwhile launched attacks in several regions opposition activists said pre dawn fighting in a heavily guarded area of damascus erupted as residents reeled from deadly weekend bombings a car bomb explosion was reported in syria s second largest city aleppo on sunday one day after three bombings at security buildings killed dozens in damascus since the beginning of the conflict russia and china have twice blocked u n security council resolutions condemning the syrian regime it is not so much that syria remains their strongest ally in the region rosemary hollis professor of middle east policy studies at london s city university said about moscow and beijing it s very clear that they don t like the idea that on the grounds of responsibility to protect the population or humanitarian atrocities western governments can go in and change regimes or can interfere and help the locals overthrow their governments this is something they can t tolerate on principle because it could come and get them at some point russia has experienced its own protests after the presidential election this month in which vladimir putin won by a landslide but moscow remains one of the syrian regime s closest allies and has called for mr assad to agree to a number of reforms even while russia supports keeping him in power islamists worry russia china analysts say moscow is concerned that power gained by islamists in the middle east could resonate with russia s muslim communities i think russia will stick to their position for the near term especially if the syrian regime relatively succeeds and scores a couple of victories said paul salem director of the carnegie middle east center in beirut however if the situation in syria takes a dive for the worse and the massacres become dramatically more extended and if the regime seems to be declining and failing russia is not going to stick with them to the end he said in china the government has sought to play down dissent in towns and villages in december censors blocked internet searches relating to wukan where protesters were involved in clashes with security forces over the death of a villager in police custody they fear most that the essence of the arab spring will reach their populations mr salem said from the very beginning china was very panicked about the arab spring so it s not surprising that they continue to oppose it although many analysts have said mr assad s days are numbered with the country s economy in shambles and continuing sanctions by western governments others say the regime has done well in comparison with governments toppled by the arab spring uprisings such as those in egypt libya and tunisia they note that mr assad is not looking for an exit strategy there are many places he could go doha iran russia and other countries might offer as well but that s not where we are mr salem said the regime is fighting for victory and they haven t been defeated they ve lost control of many areas but compared to other regimes in the region they ve done remarkably quite well and they feel they could ride this out and come out more or less victorious at the end other analysts said there have been some top defections to the opposition which is beginning to arm itself so far assad s regime has stayed relatively cohesive although we have started to see a few high level defections said jane kinninmont of the london based think tank chatham house many analysts say mr assad will have to resign eventually the regime is very strong and cannot be defeated but their time has passed mr salem said their legitimacy is largely gone and they don t represent a solution for the future this article is based in
