apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinion authoritarian governments are paranoid but just because they are as the saying goes it doesn t mean they aren t threatened the chinese regime is no exception we see a demonstration in the shadowy but decisive action taken by a normally ultracautious regime to purge a leading member this political drama results from china s pursuit of an alternative strategy from its original soviet mentor attempting modernization by integration into the world economy rather than through the pursuit of autarchy but that pathway has come with a growing threat and fear of outside influences that accompany the strategy it has been counterintuitive fear of internal implosion that has taken a higher priority top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century chinese leadership obsessed over the ceausescu regime s sudden demise in december 1989 especially after romania aped china by throwing over the soviet model even down to producing bucharest s own cultural revolution the ruling ceausescu couple s fall demonstrated that competition within the communist party elite rather than popular revolution could destroy quickly a supposedly monolithic regime a generation later the threat is still manifest it will be years if ever before we know all the intricacies of the current party scandal that s despite a continuing and from beijing s point of view dangerous explosion of information and disinformation via the internet but critical elements are known bo xilai a princeling son of one of the nine immortals of the party s legendary early years and a rising party figure has been summarily expunged mr bo s spectacular rise as a successful executive with ostensible anti corruption credentials was accompanied by the flamboyant use of maoist propaganda and advocacy of the great helmsman s repressive methods to meet dissension increasing social friction has arisen again contradictorily as much from china s success in becoming a major cog in the world industrial economy for at the same time economic integration lifted living standards for tens of millions if still a minority of the 1 3 billion chinese it has created sudden new appetites and vast regional and class disparities including intensifying dysfunctional governance at the local level inordinate waste which as much as any other factor brought down the soviet union also has characterized rapid chinese economic progress market processes have not managed to weed out failed enterprises huge soviet style government behemoths top down planning and controls unrestricted land and water use stultifying pollution and unparalleled corruption have accompanied extraordinary economic advances pumped up by exploited labor foreign investment and technology and the manipulation of subsidies but vainglorious expansion of infrastructure and unlimited growth in markets for low wage manufacturing for the u s european and japanese markets the two motors of chinese success are slowing dramatically further credit for building unlimited unused capital threatens the whole system abroad the u s and the eurozone s crippling financial crises trim markets for chinese imports growing competition limits transfers of intellectual property from the west legal and stolen other lower wage and or more efficient producers from vietnam to the u s have begun to compete more fiercely at a time when chinese costs are rising the crisis of how to deal with this changed economic situation including lower rates of growth for a still growing population now faces a new generation of party leadership scheduled to take over this fall mr bo s jockeying for a role on that team produced his at least temporary political demise but as with any player in the party s power monopoly his tentacles led in all directions from a chief go fer s attempt to escape assassination through a failed appeal of sanctuary at an american consulate to a string of foreign and domestic business partners accusations of corruption however legitimate are largely political weapons however much publicly outgoing prime minister wen jiabao now appeals for political reform despite mr wen s warnings that continued inaction could lead to the kinds of fratricidal battles and chaos characterizing the mao era is there realistically any hope that the current regime s basic characteristics could be changed quickly if at all china has no democratic cultural grass roots on which to grow such as those that helped the former eastern european nations after liberation from the russian occupation neither the hong kong takeover ironically with its marginal freedoms from colonial times now at risk nor taiwan s successful democratic experiment provides an alternative template acceptable to the masters of the mainland s one party rule the chinese model probably will survive this immediate crisis but the threat and its outcome are still to be determined sol sanders a veteran
