apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic an unexpected bystander may get caught up in the crossfire in president trump s trade war with china your juul vape pen conceived as a way for addicted smokers to kick the habit e cigarettes and vape pens particularly the sleek usb shaped juul have become increasingly popular with younger users across the u s unlike earlier models juul markets itself as small rechargeable and easy to use consumers change out flavored pods filled with a cigarette pack s worth of nicotine to ease their cravings from middle schoolers to adults the juul s popularity does not discriminate generating 224 million in sales in one year top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey but like many other products that are popular among americans vaping mechanisms are not manufactured at home they are made in china if the trump administration s second round of 25 percent tariffs on chinese imports takes effect buyers may take a hit in the wallet if they want to keep taking hits on their juuls neither side is showing any signs of yielding in the larger trade war beijing on friday announced plans to impose tariffs of 5 percent to 25 percent on some 60 billion of u s imports including honey coffee and industrial products the white house on tuesday confirmed that a second round of tariffs on 16 billion of chinese imports was coming aug 23 restrictions on chinese investment in the u s are also in the works the commerce department revealed that the u s trade deficit and the bilateral deficit with china increased in june which is likely to reinforce the white house s determination to stand firm in the trade war china is like the opec of e cigarettes with just about all of the world s vaping delivery systems although not the nicotine bearing pods made in china officials in shenzhen say that more than 100 companies in the province produce over 90 percent of the global e cigarettes including juuls trade analysts say e cigarette devices fall under the category of other machinery and would be squarely in the crosshairs of the next round of mr trump s tariffs arnaud dumas de rauly co founder and co ceo of the blinc group a developer and distributor of vapor technologies for cannabis and traditional vaping industries has already seen the economic impact of the trade war in his day to day business the products i imported two weeks ago are already costing me more than they did a month ago said mr de rauly the margins on these vape products for businesses here in the u s are between 10 to 15 percent if on top of that we have to pay a 25 percent extra tariff there s not going to be much left part of the extra cost could be passed on to the consumer limiting access to these therapeutic products to patients and consumers he said vapor technology and e cigarette industry groups testified last month against tariffs on chinese imports in hearings held by the u s trade representative yes it will hurt consumers yes it will hurt the industry tony abboud executive director of the vapor technology association a trade group representing more than 600 companies told bloomberg news last month it is a dramatic impact especially for anybody who s low or middle income taking the loss chris a representative from a local vape shop called vapor solutions who preferred not to give his last name said that if e cigarette prices go up then the store s profit margins will be sliced yeah we d probably try to cover that cost said the representative morgan fox spokesman for the national cannabis industry association noted another potential downside to higher vaping prices a tariff he said could create a black market for several products not just the juul the medical and recreational marijuana industry could also suffer any increase in the price of legal cannabis through licensed producers could have the tendency to incentivize the illicit market mr fox said when consumers are faced with extremely high legal prices for their products there is a possibility that they will look for alternative and lower priced options and that creates an opportunity for illicit actors he said though some consumers will engage in illegal activity to satisfy their cravings others say they will quit their habits altogether alexis hynes a rising junior at tulane university said that if the price of a juul goes up she will quit i ve been looking for an excuse to quit i wouldn t pay extra to keep buying more pods she said government regulators and public health specialists are sharply debating the long term health effects of juul and similar products and whether the benefits of cutting adult smoking rates outweigh the impact of creating a generation of vaping addicts the negative health impact of cigarette smoking is widely accepted but the effects of heavy e cigarette use are far less certain pitched originally as a way for heavy smokers to wean themselves off the habit juul and its rivals have found an unexpected but exploding market among young nonsmokers who become addicted to the potent nicotine rush the devices supply many users believe that because the juul does not contain some of the harsh chemicals found in cigarettes the health downsides are also relatively small producers and consumers may be the obvious victims of the impending tariffs but mr fox said a number of other industries will face spinoff effects if the u s china trade war is prolonged ancillary businesses that have piggybacked on the vaping trend will be forced to scramble he said everybody from lighting manufacturers to plumbers and general contractors to sdhc manufacturers all of these things will be affected by the tariffs negatively mr fox said bis research said sales of e cigarette devices pods and batteries hit 5 4 billion last year up 15 percent from 2016 convenience stores grocery stores and vape shops are all major distributors while mr trump has warned that manufacturing abroad takes business away from american producers mr de rauly said this is not the case for e cigarettes don t forget for the entire industry the know how the manpower and the raw materials are only available in china he said the entire rationale of this trade war in china is that china is stealing jobs from americans well these jobs are not in america in the first place the know how is not in america in the first place so it doesn t even fit into the rationale of
