catastrophes is unfolding faced with a murderous onslaught by bashar al assad s regime and its russian and iranian backers around 900 000 people have been displaced from their homes and shelters in the past two months and 300 civilians have been killed in pursuit of complete victory syrian and russian jets have bombed hospitals schools markets and bakeries as international aid groups are forced
