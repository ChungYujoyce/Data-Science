apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion washington should offer to sell aerial refueling tankers to help taiwan to counter china s ongoing military constriction involving air and sea exercises surrounding the island democracy and its dangerous manipulation of sensitive airliner routes over the taiwan strait on jan 5 china unilaterally announced that airlines can use four new flight routes over the taiwan strait including three extension routes that connect perpendicularly to the major route m503 which runs close to and parallel to the sensitive mid line of the taiwan strait starting these routes unilaterally violates international civil aviation organization iaco rules requiring consultation with affected parties as it violates a march 2015 chinese agreement with taiwan that it only operate southbound m503 flights and not use the extension routes top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century china s use of all four routes increases the chance of accidental military clashes over the taiwan strait as it will now be more difficult for taiwan s air defenses to keep track of civilian flights especially if china s people s liberation army air force plaaf exploits aerial congestion over the strait to gain military advantage failure to follow sensitive air routes already has caused tragedy on sept 1 1983 a soviet sukhoi su 15 fighter shot down korean air lines flight 007 after it had strayed too close to soviet nuclear forces on kamchatka killing 269 people china s risking of passenger s lives is cynical and dangerous both china and taiwan station hundreds of accurate and deadly surface to air missiles sams on the strait giving both sides the ability to immediately intercept perceived aerial threats perhaps beijing wants such a crisis to justify further military action this is only the latest chinese move to increase military pressure on taiwan starting in late 2016 the plaaf began exercise flights that surround taiwan using its new xian h 6k strategic bomber that can carry six nuclear armed land attack cruise missiles or over 36 precision guided bombs then this past november and december h 6k bombers flew clockwise and counterclockwise missions around taiwan with the later mission featuring plaaf sukhoi su 30mkk fighters china s aerial intimidation exercises are deadly serious they are real preparations for the day china chooses to impose an aerial blockade around taiwan which would usually precede a much larger aerial and amphibious invasion last dec 27 spokesman for china s taiwan affairs office an fangshan indicated these flights will continue stating everyone will slowly get used to it indeed they could escalate in 2018 through 2017 the pla tested a new aerial refueling capable version of the h 6k that could enter service soon meaning with regular aerial refueling h 6k bombers could fly multiple circles around taiwan in a single mission today the pla has a small number of h 6u and russian il 78 aerial tankers but this number could grow should the pla produce refueling versions of its new xian y 20 heavy transport aircraft soon plaaf bombers could be escorted by pla naval air force shenyang j 15 fighters operating from china s two and soon to be three aircraft carriers informal sources indicate the carriers may host an improved version of the shenyang j 15 fighter with phased array radar making it just as capable as taiwan s lockheed martin f 16a fighters now being upgraded with similar radar taiwan requires better lockheed martin f 35 fighters but with aerial tankers its 144 f 16s can better deter chinese aggression over the taiwan strait and better respond to china s air and naval constriction a force of 4 to 6 boeing kc 135 tankers taken from u s air force service is perhaps the most economical option washington could offer taipei tankers would allow f 16 to better maintain a combat air patrol cap presence beyond the range of chinese sams giving cover to other taiwan manned fighters searching for errant airliners rather than using one way sams kc 135 tankers would also allow taiwan f 16s to keep constant pace with circling plaaf bombers and fighters some may regard tankers as the kind of offensive capability that washington has avoided selling to taiwan since the late 1970s but in the context of china s military constriction tankers can also be a defensive weapon to interpret the august 1982 communique with china seeking to restrict arms sales to taiwan which he clearly disliked president reagan approved a little known aug 17 1982 national security memorandum it stated it is essential that the quantity and quality of the arms provided to taiwan be conditioned entirely on the threat posed by the prc mr reagan s wisdom endures selling defensive aerial tankers can equip taiwan to better deter china s aerial intimidation before it becomes far more militarily serious james a lyons a retired u s navy admiral is a former commander in
