elizabeth warren d mass and mayor pete buttigieg will you end the regime change wars both equivocated warren said that the u s should not have a military presence in the middle east but that our troops needed to be withdrawn slowly and carefully buttigieg asserted that quickly pulling out troops as president donald trump has currently ordered represents a betrayal of our kurdish allies and thus constitutes america breaking its word the best way to protect the kurds would actually be to let them come into this country not commit the u s to an endless war on their behalf former vice president joe biden later criticized gabbard saying that the u s s involvement abroad was not just for the defense of the kurds but was intended to tie terrorists down and prevent them from hurting americans at home that he initially confused iraq and afghanistan did not make his remarks more persuasive indeed gabbard was the only candidate on the stage tuesday night to advocate a unilateral immediate end to the disastrous policy of intervening in every conflict in the middle east with the goal of changing the regimes as she wisely noted such schemes have backfired in iraq afghanistan and libya and likely would have backfired in syria if undertaken there as well refreshingly gabbard called out both parties andthe mainstream media for their complicity in the u s s foolish foreign policy interventionism just two days agothe new york times said i was an assad apologist an asset of russia said gabbard completely despicable asreason s christian britschgi noted earlier this week thetimes lazy attack on gabbard relied on a mix of thin evidence guilt by association and conspiratorial framing of actions that any single issue focused dark horse candidate is liable to do gabbard is a progressive democratic on domestic policy and supports many policies that are anathema to libertarians but among the democratic candidates on the specific issue of regime change abroad an issue on which the executive branch has gained nearly unlimited power given congress s refusal to check any president s military ambitions gabbard is very nearly the sole advocate of foreign policy that is realistic about the manifest failures of the u s s approach to the middle east since at least the turn of the century advertisement next most americans don t want to work for the federal government

side thing homewrecker food at that wedding was probably pretty tasty likely not steak tartar can talk her into a tag team probably concur i was about to denounce this piece for being insufficiently critical of putin s favorite democrat but then i got to this part the best way to protect the kurds would actually be to let them come into this country not commit the u s to an endless war on their behalf and i couldn t stay mad anymore see this is why i love reason even more than huffington post the unwavering commitment to charles koch s immigration agenda is truly inspiring openborders immigrationaboveall gabbardstillsucksthough you know your argument is a failure when you link to shikha gotta agree with you on this one i knew that sentence would trigger you lol i don t even understand this line or dalmia s article for that matter isn t the whole point that the kurds want their own sovereign country why the hell would they want to come here then well we could give the kurds california no great loss there i m interested to find out what kurdifornia would look like certainly an improvement over the current mismanagement and despotism i doubt they d be interested there s too much pork in the legislation bingo you suck suckup and your parody is lame wanna see how it s done watch this video of max blumenthal walking through a grocery store in venezuela and no one dies or keels over due to starvation my only worry is that it s just too ridiculous https m youtube com watch v mbxqginlwww i suppose tulsi gabbard would hate on the venezuelan opposition to since she is a russian and cuban agent you suck suckup and your parody is lame look in the mirror you pathetic piece of shit not many customers there and he only gives the prices of dog food and the most expensive imported olive oil how much does normal food for humans cost obl s parody is better than yours tulsi was doing well in the limited time the dnc granted to her until she parroted the stupid talking point about abandoning the kurds to turkey lady stick with your anti interventionism it s the best thing you have going for you besides your fine self that s exactly what i thought the moment she said that that s the same old tired excuse used in order to keep us there it makes me really wonder how sincere she is about her non interventionist stance does anyone denounce or criticize any more or is it all calling out tulsi is killing it on the drudge poll gratuitously sexist comment it would be better if she was killing it on my pole among the dems she seems the most reasonable along with yang and it s no surprise those two generally get the highest marks from internet polls whoever is the dem nominee would do well to consider her as vp gabbard is a progressive democratic on domestic policy and supports many policies that are anathema to libertarians this is the democrat presidential primary camapign i m not planning on donating to or voting for a major party candidate in the general election but i always support to varying degree the best option in either party tulsi is anti interventionist anti establishment pro religious freedom and pretty damn good on the wods anyone who strongly agrres with her on these issues should be supporting her in the primary in a contest between trump and tulsi i d gladly pick tulsi at least she seems serious about not getting us involved in any more stupid me wars it s ironic that trump pulling out of syria has gotten all the democrats to criticize him for doing so wasn t it almost always the democrats freedom caucus excepted criticizing our involvement in foreign wars i also find it interesting that months ago democrats were telling us trump would get us into a war with north korea then recently they criticized him for being too chicken to go to war with iran for shooting down a drone of ours the democrats show they re all behind the military industrial complex except for gabbard it s also interesting that you d pick gabbard over trump while trump is at least pulling us troops out of syria because she seems serious about not getting us involved in any more stupid me wars the difference between her and trump on syria is she wants a negotiated settlement which is something trump sought but participants refused now erdogan just announced he will meet with pence to stem the bloodshed seems like trump s approach is working to me a surprising number of people are incapable of clear thinking when it comes to trump he s pulling troops out of syria but the billets are just getting shifted to saudi arabia so it s kind of a wash the military industrial bs nation building complex is so friggin huge now so many jobs our economy are so dependent upon it that even if we pull out troops in the me n africa they will have to go somewhere else to continue the money making rip off of the american taxpayer new excuses for more spreading freedom interventions will be invented uh as far as i can recall the democratic party establishment has been hawkish since like 1910 somewhere thereabouts literally every war we ve gotten into since the wilson administration has had the majority of the blue team supporting it up to and including the ones under unpopular red team presidents a la bush and the iraq invasion that isn t to say there haven t been blue team critics but they ve definitely been a minority prior to wwii the red team was reliably anti interventionist but afterwards with the rise of the soviet union they were persuaded to buy into the washington consensus and since then we ve been toppling regimes left and right and bogging down in whatever quagmires presented themselves there were some realignments in the parties along the way that contributed to this but what i m saying is there are very few politicians from either of the major parties who have ever advocated against getting involved in whatever the geopolitical mess of the day is they ve often favored bombing things over invasions because it gives the appearance of doing something without the risk of significant american casualties but it s exceedingly rare to find any who say we should just stay the hell out i don t agree with all that she proposes but she is the only dem candidate that i have any respect for this is why the nyt trashes her 1 000 000 they do respect her but t they love to watch her strut bob seger she forgot to mention shikha dalmia i thought congresswoman gabbard s comments on impeachment were telling she is dead on when she says that impeachment will tear apart the country yet that is the opening the democrats seek to steal power for eternity it s pretty unlikely they re even gonna get power for the next four years much less forever how dare we talk about trump s crimes let s just pretend like it never happened only republican crimes are bad democrat ones are the cost of doing business which ones pod october 16 2019 at 7 56 am how dare we talk about trump s crimes if you ever find any which aren t imaginary make sure to get back to us shitstain thanks searing your post http www zamila in i am making 10 000 dollar at home own laptop just do work online 4 to 6 hour proparly so i make my family happy and u can do read more the times lazy attack on gabbard relied on a mix of thin evidence guilt by association and conspiratorial framing of actions almost as if she was a republican one set of attacks is richly deserved the other not anti whites insist black fine asian fine white unacceptable needs diversity no white person anywhere is allowed to escape the gift of diversity diversity means chasing down white flight white privilege no borders anti racist is code for anti white you forgot left right zero left right 0 but might not be wrong either gabbard is the only sane person in the entire democrat debate this cycle i m not a fan of medicare for all but she offers a return to rationale transparency and civility which i am a huge fan of also she s easy on the eyes just saying i ve never voted democrat in my life but i just might in the upcoming primary since nobody on the right seems to have the cajones to challenge trump yep like i said before she s a closet libertarian sevo backlash in 3 2 1 yep like i lied before she s a closet libertarian fixed took you long enough did drumpf pull you out of his asshole long enough for you to chime in do any of you have a link to last night s democratic debate i would like to watch it in its entirety thank you in advance my message to tulsi would be why are you hanging out with these assholes and losers let the progressives eat other they don t like you they re mean people come to this side whatever this is all i know is this side is much more sane it s the same message i d give to marc garneau and jagmeet singh you guys seems like nice folk what the heck are you doing in those shitty liberal and ndp parties come hither wishful thinking she disagrees with you on healthcare taxes military spending abortion and civil rights that doesn t mean she s a retarded demagogue unlike your dumb ass pretty close yes dullard no one s perfect we can work with her you on the other hand lay off the tide maybe rand paul mike lee thomas massie could recruit tulsi start a new party the constitution peace party i think soave and stossel have hard on s for gabbard given that they repeatedly mention that most of her positions are not compatible with libertarianism i think they just admire the novelty of a congresswoman from the blue team even advocating against getting into these useless wars and getting out of the ones we re already in unless you mean literal hard ons in which case probably she s pretty easy on the eyes for a politician looks way over rated for her tulsi gabbard is the only relatively sane person running for the potus position for the democrats but breathe easy folks she ll never get nominated she has some sense in her ramblings which is an automatic disqualifying mandate fortunately for all us mentally ill folk there s hitlery who will come to the rescue naw more likely bloomyberg will step in give it a shot obama also sounded sane as a candidate anti war pro constitution pro privacy once he got into office he became the master of executive overreach war mongering drone killings domestic spying and a bit of election interference thrown in for good measure i expect tulsi would end up pretty much like that i don t agree with all that she proposes but she is the only dem candidate that i have any respect for yawn i feel sorry for the gal the dem platform is soooo 1850 red republican but the energy planks pretending to see a warming trend in doctored data as a pretext for ecological national socialism is not working even with a good candidate their platform is so suicidal as to even rob it of spoiler value but if those voters rouse from the stupor and nominate her they may escape extinction the don is again talking about bringing our boys home someone is definitely listening to what tulsi is saying about entangling alliances and policy is changing before our eyes just as important is getting our small nuclear weapons out of those medieval dictatorships before someone has a go at hijacking them lots of presidents had a side thing jasa seo please log in to post comments charles oliver 5 27 2020 4 00 am john stossel 5 27 2020 12 30 am
