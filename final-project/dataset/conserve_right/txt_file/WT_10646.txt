apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap china s announcement of a 7 percent rise in military spending for the year came shortly after president donald trump called for a 10 percent increase in america s defense budget prompting renewed scrutiny of how the two countries capabilities compare while the u s military remains the dominant force in asia and the world china has been moving from quantity to quality and is catching up quickly in equipment organization and capability and is increasingly able to project power far from its shores rapid economic growth lavish spending and a desire to regain china s historical role as east asia s leading power are helping drive the moves below is a comparison of the present state of the two militaries based on figures found in recent u s government research on china s capabilities and information from defense think tanks and government websites some figures are estimates or approximations top stories ravi zacharias may be

only partial information about its order of battle the pla s mission and future plans although outside analysts have produced detailed estimates u s troop strength varies depending on need but as of jan 31 there were 1 4 million active service members spread throughout the services budgets china announced this week that defense spending would rise by 7 percent this year to 1 044 trillion yuan 151 billion while china has the world s second largest defense budget it s just a fraction of what the u s spends even if analysts estimates of hidden additional spending are taken into account trump s request for an additional 54 billion in spending would bring the u s defense budget to a record 603 billion and that s before including tens of billions of dollars for overseas military operations if approved the increase would mean the u s was spending 3 4 percent of its gross domestic product on defense up from 3 2 percent of gdp last year china says its budget this year would equal 1 3 percent of gdp ground forces owing to the pla s origins as a guerrilla army and former tensions along its land border with russia the ground forces continue to dominate with 1 6 million personnel and a weighty emphasis on armored vehicles 9 150 and heavy artillery 6 246 the u s army boasts 460 000 personnel with another 182 000 in the marines it has a smaller emphasis on artillery 1 299 and armored vehicles 8 848 but places a greater emphasis on air support and special forces operations air power the u s can boast more than 13 000 aircraft of all types to china s nearly 3 000 the gap is especially great in helicopters where the u s has more than 6 000 to china s 802 despite having fewer aircraft some of which are under the chinese navy china s air force has 398 000 personnel to 308 000 for the usaf both air forces are seeking to upgrade their aircraft although the introduction of the fifth generation f 22 and f 35 jets puts the u s several years ahead china s stealth fighters remain in the prototype stage although it has managed to replace more than half of its fighter fleet with fourth generation aircraft navy china s navy has many more vessels 714 to 415 but the u s has more where it counts in terms of power projection the u s has 10 aircraft carriers to china s one although more are being built 62 destroyers to china s 32 and 75 submarines to china s 68 the u s navy has 323 000 personnel to china s 235 000 reflecting the breadth and depth of a service that operates worldwide china s navy has made strides in that direction since it established a permanent overseas presence by joining in multinational anti piracy patrols off somalia in 2008 and has begun exercising in the western pacific beyond the first island chain that blocks its access to open seas missile command the pla has a completely separate branch the rocket force to operate its formidable arsenal of short medium and long range missiles including those capable of delivering nuclear weapons estimates say china has a stockpile of approximately 260 nuclear warheads for delivery by nearly 150 land based ballistic missiles 48 sea based ballistic missiles as well as bombers the u s has an estimated 1 740 nuclear warheads deployed for delivery by the same means china s development of the df 21d ballistic missile that is thought capable of threatening aircraft carriers has garnered much attention although it remains untested in a conflict overseas presence china hasn t fought a conflict outside its borders since it invaded vietnam in 1979 and officially eschews overseas alliances nonetheless the pla has been expanding abroad from garrisons atop man made islands in the south china sea to u n peacekeeping operations joint naval exercises with russia in the mediterranean and the
