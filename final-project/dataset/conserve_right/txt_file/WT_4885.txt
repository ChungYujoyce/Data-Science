expressions that infuse bursts of energy into what will be a lengthy debate on the legal justifications for impeaching a president we have a saying down south when something is going to be important my mom would tell me go on put your sunday best on and we are going to go to town the georgia republican said tuesday bracing for the democrats next move for impeachment top stories doj warns gavin

fairness he said he made the remarks as the house permanent select committee on intelligence cast a party line vote to approve its report backing impeachment sending the 300 page document to the judiciary committee and launching the next phase of the process mr collins will take over from rep devin nunes of california the ranking republican on the intelligence committee who provided a stern and measured beat to the gop resistance when that committee handled the first leg of the impeachment effort stylistically he s obviously very different from devin nunes rep andy biggs arizona republican told the washington times devin s a little bit more stoic doug is more animated both are vigorous and aggressive defenders of truth here mr collins is known as a front line trump defender who previously battled democrats probe of alleged russia collusion and obstruction of special counsel robert s mueller s probe he was at the forefront of gop objections to the process by which democrats subpoenaed the administration for documents and testimonies calling it an overreach of congressional oversight the judiciary committee which is charged with writing articles of impeachment takes up the inquiry wednesday with a public hearing where legal scholars will opine on whether mr trump s actions warrant removal from office democrats have called three legal scholars that have been critical of president trump noah feldman pamela karlan and michael gerhardt while republicans have jonathan turley who has repeatedly condemned the impeachment proceeding tomorrow provides nothing except a dreary eyed drowsy proposal for this country to watch as the impeachment process slowly drags on with no direction no focus because they are having one big problem mr collins said and the big problem is the president did nothing wrong mr collins spent six years in the georgia house of representatives before winning a seat in congress he represents a rural district that includes his hometown of gainesville which has been dubbed poultry capital of the world because of its numerous poultry processing plants he has been married to lisa collins since 1988 they have three children daughter jordan and sons copelan and cameron a four term congressman mr collins replaced retiring rep bob goodlatte of virginia this year as the top republican on the judiciary committee as the gop settled into the minority throughout the impeachment inquiry mr collins has been mostly sidelined as his panel was moved out of the way of investigating the allegations that mr trump attempted to pressure ukraine into investigating former vice president joseph r biden and his son hunter as well as ukrainian interference in the 2016 election the ukraine allegations are the center of the impeachment inquiry but there are rumblings on capitol hill about judiciary looping in other investigations the democrats have been pursuing against mr trump as they draft articles of impeachment in the public hearings and closed door investigations held by the intelligence panel republicans and democrats clashed over both the process of the inquiry and the substance of the allegations the clashes often featured mr nunes versus rep adam b schiff california democrat and intelligence chairman on the judiciary panel mr collins will face off against chairman jerrold l nadler new york democrat but in the new setting a sharper focus is expected on legal issues rep ben cline a virginia republican on judiciary said his party is ready and have a powerful leader in mr collins he unites our side of the committee as we shine a spotlight on all the shortcomings of chairman nadler s impeachment circus mr cline said before the first hearing in judiciary even began mr collins launched the republicans aggressive defense of mr trump he made the rounds on tv news shows delivering a preview of the gop s arguments staunchly defending the president s innocence and slamming the democrats process as rigged and partisan it s like me telling y all i want you to go into the kitchen i want you to bake me something he said of the impeachment process on fox news and i say it doesn t matter just go bake me something well what do you want i don t know what i want that is how bad this is he has led the push for testimony by mr schiff whom republicans think helped orchestrate the whistleblower complaint that set off the impeachment probe but democrats are unlikely to allow mr schiff to be put on the stand republicans on monday preempted the democrats impeachment report with a rebuttal report that rejected all allegations against the president and doubling down on criticism of the process mr collins role in those efforts earned him praise from mr trump great job by rep doug collins of georgia over the weekend in representing the republican party and myself against the impeachment hoax he tweeted as he claims the national spotlight mr collins has eyed a run for the senate seat being vacated by sen johnny isakson who is retiring at the end of the year due to failing health georgia gov brian kemp is expected to tap atlanta businesswoman kelly loeffler to replace mr
