to enjoy all the benefits of our website in politicaland mediacircles an arrayof thinkers national conservatives integralists traditionalists and post liberals are crossing ideological boundaries what is happening on the american intellectual scene in washington and new york it is increasingly common to hear people say they are enemies of neoliberalism they think liberal democracy is insufficient they are in favour of government intervention in the economy sceptical of free trade dealsandlong to demolish what they call zombie reaganism these people are not bernie sanders supporters in fact they are not on the left at all they are catholic professors or writers for us conservative magazines they run tech companies in california or work for republican senators on capitol hill meet the new american right if you would like to find yourself a place in the vanguard of american conservatism these days you can choose from a widening panoply of neologisms to describe yourself national conservative integralist traditionalist post liberal you might even be welcome if you are a marxist anything just so long as you re not a libertarian the once dominant intellectual lodestars of the us right friedrich hayek john locke milton friedman ayn rand and adam smith are out the ideas of carl schmitt james burnham michel houellebecq and christopher lasch are in edmund burke and alexis de tocqueville are barely clinging on what happened one explanation for the american right s leftward turn lies with catholic opinion resentment was already building among us catholic conservatives by the time of donald trump s election in 2016 from around 2013 as pope francis appeared to be compromising on certain social issues such as acceptance of homosexuality catholics began to suspect the grand bargain of the american conservative movement since the 1950s free markets combined with social conservatism was heavily tilted in favour of the former they saw a republican party guided less by religion than by money money which seemed little disposed to advocate on behalf of their beliefs they saw themselves as foot soldiers in a culture war their party seemed content to lose even worse for the privilege of fighting they had been obliged not to think too hard about what catholic social teaching might have to say on issues such healthcare for fear of offending the jealous god of the free market a demonstration of this anger came in 2018 when university of notre dame professor patrick deneen published a provocatively titled book why liberalism failed by liberalism deneen did not mean the american progressivism embodied by sanders or elizabeth warren but the entire liberal project from the 17th century philosopher john locke to the postwar theorist john rawls by replacing old commitments to community religion or tradition with pure self interest deneen said liberalism atomised citizens rendering them helpless nihilistic and alone the book quickly became a touchstone for conservative discussions in the us about liberalism instead of a threat to american liberal democracy perhaps trump was merely the latest symptom of a defect the liberal project had contracted at birth therage emanating from communities hollowed out by a corrosive liberalism as a balm for these social ills deneen advocated retreat from national politics into the enclaves of small rural communities echoing other writers on the american right such as rod dreher a senior editor at the american conservative but more recently deneen has taken an interest in populism hobnobbing with the hungarian prime minister viktor orba n in november 2019 and proposing a politics of aristopopulism the notion borrowed from the 16th century florentine philosopher niccol machiavelli that friction between the masses and the elite is the best way to ensure that neither class dominates the other and that material inequality remains at a moderate level deneenism however came up against a fiercer

popular movements they still wield real power and they re angry as a 2020 financial timesarticle on the middle class by simon kuper put it populism is less a working class revolt than a middle class civil war a parallel set of clashes is happening between conservatives over economics the most salient example is oren cass who served as mitt romney s domestic policy director during the republican senator s 2012 presidential campaign casshas branded himselfan advocate for an american industrial policy a government coordinated effort to boost domestic manufacturing based on similar efforts by countries such as germany and japan the notion of an industrial policy challenges the free market economic wisdom that once reigned and cass routinely does battle with libertarian aligned economists who accuse him of advocating for a planned economy that is doomed to fail the free marketers are all the more enraged by cass s apostasy because he is supposed to be on their side furtherevidence that the old conservative libertarian partnership is under severe strain how might the covid 19 pandemic affect the outcome of this intramural brawl among american conservatives many on the new right believe the virus hasvindicated their scepticism of globalisation as well as their demand for a stronger more capable state that does not shrink from curbing liberties when circumstances demand it a dictum emerged nobody is a libertarian in the midst of a pandemic yet the libertarian minded have protested that the virus is best combated by slashing regulations and spurring medical innovation they emphasise the missteps by the us federal government in the early days of the anti viral effort and praise the prominent role played by local and state governments the 2trn coronavirus stimulus package has already cast aside republican ideas of fiscal discipline but the cheques americans will soon receive in the mail bear a resemblance to the helicopter money proposals by libertarian economist milton friedman any verdict issued while the world remains wracked by the virus is bound to be provisional the intellectuals of the new american right want to revolutionise the conservative establishment but it s not clear how they might go about it one idea is to convince conservative donors to support the new agenda a bigger state more generous with money and more inclined to use it to achieve desired outcomes whether in the economy supporting manufacturing or in society larger stipends or tax cuts for families with children this will be a tough sell the conservative establishment is accustomed to dismissing such proposals as bad for business another idea is to put forward a fellow traveling candidate in 2024 a few options were on display at the 2019 natcon conference in washington dc heldto showcase the new nationalist american conservatism one candidate is tucker carlson the incendiary fox news presenter who has recently promoted books by elizabeth warren and complained about american engagement abroad another is josh hawley a republican senator from missouri a staunch abortion opponent and a vocal critic of the tech industry there is also florida s republican senator marco rubio who didn t attend the conference but who recently referenced catholic social teaching in a first things article that read suspiciously like a measured critique of free marketism this is not the first time rubio has been set up as the poster boy for the latest obsession of the conservative avant garde during the lead up to the 2016 presidential election he was feted by centre right intellectuals as the candidate of reform conservatism a movement that hoped to make the republicans viable with non white and working class voters by proposing child tax credits and a points based immigration system rubio was bulldozed by trump in the primary and the republican party did indeed end up appealing to segments of the working class but to say the least not in the way the reform conservatives wanted politicians tend to acquire pet intellectuals the process does not generally operate the other way around there is the risk that a president hawley or president carlson might actmore or less astrump has generally done andlet the conservative ruling machine do what it does best maintain populist rhetoric and sprinkle in a few adjustments by way of camouflage could this rebellion of the right wing intellectuals be coming to britain it seems unlikely while many on the new american right delight in the return of a more adversarial style of politics in the uk boris johnson won a crushing victory in december 2019 on a platform based more on anti politics aren t you tired of it all was the conservative message to a country exhausted by three years of brexit if the new american right is machiavellian placing hopes for a better future in the clash between the masses and the elite then the tories are hobbesians promising peace and prosperity on the condition that the british people surrender the political arena to them nor is the national appetite for rough and tumble politics likely to increase amid an ongoing public health emergency brexit pushed conservative british intellectuals in new directions but only temporarily as the economist s bagehot columnist noted in august 2019 a party once defined by the burkean tradition turned to the radical idioms of the 18th century genevan philosopher jean jacques rousseau and his notion of the general will in order to defend its brexit position but after december 2019 this civil war ended and no doubt rousseau will slip from tory lips johnson s senior adviser dominic cummings takes inspiration from americans but of a less original sort the models for his eccentric behaviour and technocratic scorn for the humanities are the venture capitalists of silicon valley the uk s intellectual landscape too lends itself less to such an insurgency british intellectuals are more often historians less interested in formulating unorthodox policy proposals than they are in recasting opinion on the levellers or the jacobites british conservatism has just lost its leading light in roger scruton an atypical figure who has no obvious successor the sovereignty of the party of the right over conservative intellectual activity is also more total in britain than in america krein emphasises the stranglehold of the republican donor class over conservative intellectual activity but from a transatlantic perspective he and his magazine are evidence that the american landscape is more multifarious and less easily commanded still the intellectuals of the american right are paying close attention to the johnson premiership because it has promised to enact a programme that reflects the opposite of the old libertarian dictum not socially liberal fiscally conservative but rather socially conservative fiscally liberal johnson is hardly a social conservative by american standards but his move to win over working class northern voters and retain them with increased spending on national infrastructure are seen in these circles as a blueprint for a 2024 realignment in us politics but that is a long way off and there is another presidential election before then one many on the new american right are not particularly eager to contemplate these people are not bernie sanders

hawley a republican senator from missouri a staunch abortion opponent and a vocal critic of the tech industry there is also florida s republican senator marco rubio who didn t attend the conference

conservatism a movement that hoped to make the republicans viable with non white and working class voters by proposing child tax credits and a points based immigration system rubio was bulldozed by

business another idea is to put forward a fellow traveling candidate in 2024 a few options were on display at the 2019 natcon conference in washington dc heldto showcase the new nationalist american conservatism one candidate is tucker carlson the incendiary fox news presenter who has recently promoted books by elizabeth warren and complained about american engagement abroad another is josh hawley a republican senator from missouri a staunch abortion opponent and a vocal critic of the tech industry there is also florida s republican senator marco rubio who didn t attend the conference but who recently referenced catholic social teaching in a first things article that read suspiciously like a measured critique of free marketism this is not the first time rubio has been set up as the poster boy for the latest obsession of the conservative avant garde during the lead up to the 2016 presidential election he was feted by centre right intellectuals as the candidate of reform conservatism a movement that hoped to make the republicans viable with non white and working class voters by proposing child tax credits and a points based immigration system rubio was bulldozed by trump in the primary and the republican party did indeed end up appealing to segments of the working class but to say the least not in the way the reform conservatives wanted politicians tend to acquire pet intellectuals the process does not generally operate the other way around there is the risk that a president hawley or president carlson might actmore or less astrump has generally done

adviser dominic cummings takes inspiration from americans but of a less original sort the models for his eccentric behaviour and technocratic scorn for the humanities are the venture capitalists of

sovereignty of the party of the right over conservative intellectual activity is also more total in britain than in america krein emphasises the stranglehold of the republican donor class over

intellectuals of the american right are paying close attention to the johnson premiership because it has promised to enact a programme that reflects the opposite of the old libertarian dictum not socially liberal fiscally conservative but rather socially conservative fiscally liberal johnson is hardly a social conservative by american standards but his move to win over working class northern voters and retain them with increased spending on national infrastructure are seen in these circles as a blueprint for a 2024 realignment in us politics but that is a long way off and there is another presidential election before then one many on the new american right are not particularly eager to contemplate hazony s critics including those on the right often respond that the distinction between

presidential election before then one many on the new american right are not particularly eager to contemplate this will be a tough sell the conservative establishment is accustomed to dismissing such proposals as bad for business another idea is to put forward a fellow traveling candidate in 2024 a few options were on display at the 2019 natcon conference in washington dc heldto showcase the new nationalist american conservatism one candidate is tucker carlson the incendiary fox news presenter who has recently promoted books by elizabeth warren and complained about american engagement abroad another is josh hawley a republican senator from missouri a staunch abortion opponent and a vocal critic of the tech industry there is also florida s republican senator marco rubio who didn t attend the conference but who recently referenced catholic social teaching in a first things article that read suspiciously like a measured critique of free marketism this is not the first time rubio has been set up as the poster boy for the latest obsession of the conservative avant garde during the lead up to the 2016 presidential election he was feted by centre right intellectuals as the candidate of reform conservatism a movement that hoped to make the republicans viable with non white and working class voters by proposing child tax credits and a points based immigration system rubio was bulldozed by trump in the primary and the republican party did indeed end up appealing to segments of the working class but to say the least not in the way the reform conservatives wanted politicians tend to acquire pet intellectuals the process does not generally operate the other way around there is the risk that a president hawley or president carlson might actmore or less astrump has generally
