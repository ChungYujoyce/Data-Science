apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinion china s rise has the obama administration looking as uncertain as the proverbial deer in the headlights caught between the unappealing alternatives of embracing or containing china it largely chooses inaction its famous pivot to asia has stalled a casualty of secretary of state john f kerry s near obsession with the middle east there has been little meaningful response to china s aggressive territorial claims against u s allies meanwhile widespread defense cuts have led inevitably to a depletion of american military power in the region see also ominous warning admiral concedes u s losing dominance to china china s a tough issue no doubt but that s no excuse for not having a coherent policy america s interests in east asia are simply too important to be managed as an afterthought the united states needs to demonstrate clearly and concretely that america plans to stay involved in asia as a great power china has clearly been upping the ante its most recent move was to announce that all foreign fishing boats must obtain clearance from beijing before sailing in areas of the south china sea that we recognize as international waters china essentially is laying claim to the entire south china sea putting it at odds with washington and with our ally the philippines as well as taiwan vietnam brunei and malaysia this move follows an even more brazen assertion in november amid tension with japan over the senkaku islands china declared an air defense identification zone over a large swath of the east china sea that it claims as a maritime exclusive economic zone china also angered south korea by incorporating an undersea mountain by pressing territorial claims across the board china is trying to force us to decide between it and our allies it s looking for that sweet spot of confrontation in which we abandon an ally which beijing knows will send shock waves throughout the region dean cheng a senior research fellow at the heritage foundation s asian studies center has some suggestions on how to respond effectively to china s assertiveness first we must revert to the pivot only this time we should mean it we should reverse mr kerry s neglect of the region and show explicit high level interest mr cheng says this should include a consistent pace of visits and consultations by the secretaries of state defense and treasury second we need to put some military meat on the asia pivot the services are doing the best they can to deal with the budget cuts but they worry privately about an inability to complete the missions that the nation assigns to them at the very least we should avoid gutting our naval capability in east asia once that is gone it is very expensive to get back far better to spend a little more now to avoid spending a whole lot more later when a more robust force may be needed a third step mr cheng recommends is to stop signaling weakness the administration has reached out to beijing repeatedly yet all we get in return is more chinese aggressiveness a chinese surface ship for example nearly rammed the uss cowpens which it claimed was getting too close to china s new aircraft carrier at the very least we should be insisting on more reciprocity from the chinese for example we should demand the same access for the u s military to chinese military exercises as we afford to china we have invited the chinese people s liberation army into our multilateral rimpac exercises but they won t give us access to theirs this means they get lots of intelligence on our operations while we are nearly blind to what the pla is doing it s true half the battle is showing up but we can do better than that we need to meet chinese aggressiveness not in kind but by firmly standing pat this will calm allies and will show beijing the limits to its aggressiveness kim r holmes is a distinguished fellow at the heritage foundation and the author of rebound g
