voluntary president trump found something to briefly celebrate monday some bad news for what are emerging as his biggest detractors during the virus crisis the media advertising in the failing new york times is way down washington post is not much better he tweeted i can t say whether this is because they are fake news sources of information to a level that few can understand or the virus is just plain beating them up fake news is bad for america whatever the merits of trump s dissatisfaction with the two papers it s clear that advertising has plunged because some companies are shut down while others are slashing spending while most of their customers are stranded at home pandemic politics trump biden and the virtual campaign as america s coronavirus death toll exceeds 10 000 two clashing narratives have come to define the president s handling of the pandemic trump is courageously leading the country with a disruptive approach despite the naysayers according to his supporters or from a press perspective he is royally botching the emergency because of severe character limitations trump posted four positive retweets after sunday s edition of media buzz as he embraced criticism of the press it s not the first time he s commented on my program sometimes critically he s also called supporters after their appearances but it underscores a sharp focus on his coverage as a self proclaimed wartime president for instance he retweeted conservative commentator gayle trotter as saying to this day the establishment have not admitted that they were wrong and the president was right she was talking about his early restrictions on travel from china but did not address as i pursued with other guests media criticism of a slow response on testing medical supplies and recognizing the magnitude of the threat some in the press in fairness also minimized the potential impact as late as february nbc didn t ask a single virus question at its democratic debate that month the president seems increasingly disgusted with the media even beyond the bitter hostilities of the russia probe and the impeachment battle at pressers over the weekend he accused certain outlets of spreading false rumors fear and panic and given the life and death stakes the press seems increasingly angry with trump liberal times columnist frank bruni says he s shriveling into nothingness in a piece titled has anyone found trump s soul anyone cnn s don lemon and msnbc s rachel maddow and chris hayes say cable news shouldn t carry the trump briefings live because he spreads lies and misinformation the president for his part is increasingly doing verbal combat with reporters last night when fox news apos kristin fisher asked about an hhs inspector general s report detailing problems with testing the president told her youshould say congratulations great job instead of being so horrid in the way that you ask a question and when abc s jonathan karl followed up on that report trump called him a third rate reporter who will never make it karl is president of the white house correspondents association trump has also taken swipes at such correspondents as nbc s peter alexander pbs s yamiche alcindor cnn s jim acosta and cbs s weijia jiang it was particularly noteworthy that he called one of alcindor s questions threatening when she accurately quoted his evolving position on the feds providing ventilators subscribe to howie apos s media buzzmeter podcast a riff of the day apos s hottest stories a number of people on my twitter feed agree with trump and trotter that reporters are peppering the president with gotcha questions these are usually along the lines of you said x and now you re doing y but every politician faces gotcha questions some fair some unfair and finessing them is part of the job i don t recall trump supporters demanding that reporters be positive when barack obama or bill clinton was grappling with difficulties in another tweet tied to trotter trump said monday i only wish the public could fully understand how corrupt dishonest so much of our lamestream media is it s also fascinating that trump is fighting some side battles during the pandemic after firing michael atkinson as the intelligence community s ig the president called him a disgrace atkinson s sin was notifying the hill of the whistle blower s complaint on ukraine he said monday it is hard not to think that the president apos s loss of confidence in me derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial inspector general my question is why would trump engage in such score settling right now in such a polarized country somewhere around half the public is going to cheer trump s evisceration of the press and somewhere around half is going to applaud the journalistic denunciations of the president but right now people are dying we re facing what trump s surgeon general called a pearl harbor moment and yet the two sides keep carpet bombing each other get all the stories you need to know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox subscribed you ve
