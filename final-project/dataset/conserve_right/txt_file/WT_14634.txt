said in an interview with cnbc we are looking at it the chinese are looking at it preparations are being made i can t say 100 percent certainty but there is no question everybody is looking at it kudlow said that so far the administration viewed china s negotiating offers as rather unsatisfactory but that maybe talks between the two heads of state will bear fruit asked if china would need to make specific concessions for such a meeting to take place mnuchin said to the extent that we can make progress toward a meeting i would encourage that and that s something we re having discussions about but for the moment there s no preconditions the president will decide on that the trade feud has been fueled by u s accusations that china engages in cyber theft and coerces foreign companies

chinese they had made clear that they didn t see a further weakening of the chinese yuan as being in their interests concerns have been raised that china the largest foreign holder of u s treasurys

robust u s demand and a weaker chinese currency which makes their goods cheaper abroad louis kuijs of oxford economics said in a report the chinese yuan has lost nearly 10 percent of its value against
