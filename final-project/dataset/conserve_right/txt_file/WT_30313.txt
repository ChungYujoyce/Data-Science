tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn lexington ky ap on thursday as president donald trump mused about a possible spy in the white house democrats alleged a cover up and washington fired up the gears of impeachment the democratic candidate for governor in kentucky andy beshear was politely shaking hands at a senior center he vowed to crack down on robocalls that target the elderly and talked about combating the cost of prescription drugs for a few minutes in a corner of this center it was a trump free zone beshear and other southern democrats running for governor this fall want to keep it that way top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director while democrats in washington charge ahead with an impeachment inquiry their party s candidates for governor in kentucky mississippi and louisiana are doing all they can to steer the conversation away from trump and toward safer ground back home as red state democrats their best chance at winning is to sell their platforms and personalities not their partisan affiliation and keep their distance from the turmoil in washington house democrats decision to launch an impeachment inquiry has undoubtedly made that harder the ugly debate suddenly threatens to turn their races into the first test of the unpredictable politics of the impeachment a gauge on how effectively democrats can focus voters on issues amid partisan warfare for republicans who ve been working to nationalize their races all along the impeachment news couldn t have come at a better time in kentucky beshear is locked in a close race with gov matt bevin a trump loyalist with a slash and burn style similar to the president s republicans are circling the wagons and bevin is helping lead that charge longtime kentucky political commentator al cross said in an interview he s likely to benefit at least at the start but nobody knows how this thing is going to play out trump who easily carried kentucky in 2016 remains a commanding presence in the bluegrass state his appearance at a mid october rally for an endangered republican congressman was seen as crucial in the kentucky incumbent s reelection in 2018 bevin often plays up his ties to the president in campaign ads tweets and speeches the state republican party quickly challenged beshear to stop hiding and take a stand on whether he supports impeaching trump beshear a state attorney general whose affable demeanor cuts a contrast to bevin s bombast wouldn t bite as kentucky s top prosecutor i make my decisions based on facts and evidence and all i have right now are news stories he said in an interview making no reference to the two public documents fueling charges that trump abused his power by asking a foreign leader to investigate a political rival the white house has released a loose transcript of a phone call in which trump pressured ukraine s president to investigate joe biden the call is part of a whistleblower s complaint which is also public my hope if they choose to proceed is that they set it up in a non partisan way that is focused on getting to the truth and evidence and not scoring political points beshear said asked if he thinks trump committed impeachable offenses beshear said he didn t have evidence or facts to make that conclusion in louisiana democratic gov john bel edwards was directly critical of his party s move toward impeachment he said the probe makes it harder for congress to work across party lines to deal with the nation s business this is at least a distraction that s going to keep the federal government from actually governing and you know it s hard enough for them to do that anyway edwards said wednesday in an interview edwards who leads in the polls faces two major republican opponents in the oct 12 primary under louisiana s election rules all candidates regardless of party run on the same ballot if no candidate tops 50 of the vote the governor s race will be decided in a november runoff between the top two vote getters mississippi democratic gubernatorial candidate jim hood the state attorney general took a similar approach using the moment to contrast the partisan discord in washington with his efforts to work with republicans i m focused on our race for governor and on the local issues affecting mississippi such as education roads and bridges and health care hood said in a statement provided by his campaign after the associated press requested an interview on the matter all of the craziness and gridlock in washington has created a positive response here in mississippi where moderates in both parties are coming together to move our state forward the focus on bipartisanship is political necessity hood is mississippi s only democrat elected statewide and republicans control both chambers of the legislature trump won the state by nearly 19 percentage points trump ran even stronger in kentucky winning by 30 percentage points republicans hold both u s senate seats all but one of the house seats the governorship and both chambers of the legislature the partisan hurdles aside beshear says his focus is on kitchen table issues that matter most to voters in the bluegrass state public education health care jobs and pension security that s what this race is going to be decided on beshear said after his remarks at the senior center kentucky voters are smart enough to know that a governor has nothing to do with whether an impeachment proceeding moves forward or not tommy evans a driver at the facility may prove beshear s case he sees political motivations behind the democratic led inquiry of the republican president i just think they ve been trying to get rid of him ever since he got in he said but evans didn t blame beshear he said he hasn t picked a candidate and he mentioned a kentucky specific issue bevin s feud with some public education groups as something he ll weigh when deciding who to support deslatte reported from baton ro
