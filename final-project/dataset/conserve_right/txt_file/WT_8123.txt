will during the lockdown wuhan residents could leave their homes only to buy food or attend to other tasks deemed absolutely necessary some were allowed to leave the city but only if they had paperwork showing they were not a health risk and a letter attesting to where they were going and why even then authorities could turn them back on a technicality such as missing a stamp preventing thousands from returning to their jobs outside the city residents of other parts of hubei were allowed to leave the province starting about three weeks ago as long as they could provide a clean bill
