apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic ukraine is at the center of today s east west geopolitical battle but it s feeling increasingly alone and abandoned by its u s backers amid the impeachment drama unfolding in washington the u s ambassador who was pushed out earlier this year and testified friday in congress hasn t been replaced neither has the influential u s envoy tasked with helping ukraine quell its russia backed separatist insurgency the lower level u s officials remaining in kyiv are keeping an unusually low profile the erosion of washington s readiness to protect its eastern

waste of time dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ukrainians increasingly feel the u s impeachment inquiry is making their country toxic a member of the ukrainian parliament s foreign affairs committee told the associated press that u s officials have shown increasing indifference to ukraine and have been reluctant to attend meetings this has been particularly visible the lawmaker said since the september resignation of envoy kurt volker whose departure led to the disappearance of a coordination center made up of people who were engaged in ukraine s affairs the lawmaker discussed the sensitive issue of u s aid on condition that his name be withheld ukrainian government officials refuse to talk about relations with the u s while the impeachment inquiry is ongoing and influential lawmakers are similarly wary of saying anything publicly that could make matters even worse for their country moscow is happy to fill the void further bolstering russia s position along europe s geopolitical front line with consequences around the region the mixed messages to ukraine from president donald trump s administration are also damaging u s diplomatic credibility at a time when american foreign policy influence is already waning trump s policy toward ukraine looks badly incoherent and inconsistent said mykola sunhurovskyi the head of military programs at the razumkov center a kyiv based independent think tank it s like a swing and kyiv has found it difficult to adapt to that in a july 25 phone call that triggered the impeachment inquiry trump pushed ukraine s newly elected zelenskiy to investigate the country s activities in the 2016 u s election and his potential 2020 rival joe biden while the trump administration was withholding about 400 million in military aid to ukraine democrats say that trump was engaged in bribery and extortion abusing his office for personal political gain the president denies wrongdoing the military aid was ultimately released in september after congress was informed of the phone call u s military aid makes up about 10 percent of ukraine s defense budget according to sunhurovskyi he said the american aid is necessary to shore up the underfunded and badly equipped ukrainian army but is even more crucial as an indication of washington s determination to stand firmly behind its ally the u s military aid is an important political signal indicating that ukraine is a victim and russia is an aggressor sunhurovskyi said president barack obama s administration provided ukraine with nonlethal military supplies including countermortar radars night vision devices and medical items the trump administration in 2017 agreed to provide lethal weapons committing to sell 47 million in javelin anti tank missiles the u s handed over two repurposed patrol boats wednesday to ukraine s navy part of over 1 6 billion in u s security assistance since 2014 speaking at the

ubiquitous in kyiv arriving daily on flights to boryspol airport and filling lobbies of the city s high end hotels u s officials appear to be lying low notably those visiting from washington when assistant secretary of state denise natali visited last month none of her schedule was made public and media had no access volker the u s special envoy for ukraine peace negotiations used to regularly visit kyiv maintained close contacts with the european union nations to coordinate their support for ukraine and met with his russian counterpart to defend ukraine s interests the trump administration hasn t named a replacement since he resigned trump himself encouraged zelenskiy to meet with putin and solve your problem trump s hesitations and the absence of a clear u s strategy forces kyiv to make concessions to russia said vadim karasev head of the kyiv based institute of global strategies that s worries many in ukraine especially ahead of zelenskiy s long awaited meeting with putin and the leaders of france and germany on dec 9 after ukraine s former moscow friendly president was driven from office by massive protests in 2014 russia annexed the crimean peninsula and helped foment a separatist insurgency in the east more than five years of fighting has killed over 13 000 and ravaged the country s industrial heartland the u s and the eu responded by hitting russia with a slew of sanctions that hampered russia eu trade european nations also provide ukraine significant aid but ukraine fears their support is slipping too some eu nations have pushed for lifting sanctions against moscow and french president emmanuel macron recently called for reaching out to russia lawmaker iryna gerashchenko said that could herald pressure on ukraine to agree to a deal on russian terms the u s military assistance cemented the western position karasev said any doubts suspensions or delays will cause the western coalition to collapse and allow paris and berlin to play their game and make a deal with russia once the u s role in europe weakens russia s influence inevitably grows it s a historic pendulum that trump has already set in motion karmanau reported from minsk belaru
