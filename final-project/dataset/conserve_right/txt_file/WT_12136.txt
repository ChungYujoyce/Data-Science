of them will tell me anything about why he was taken away or where he has been taken to mr jiang s wife jin bianling said this month she said that after her husband s disappearance in february a beijing police officer told her that the case was being handled meaning he was under investigation her repeated efforts to get more details from police have been fruitless more than 100 people have been questioned or followed by police or placed under house arrest the hong kong based chinese human rights defenders said in a recent statement mr jiang and others who have disappeared for weeks were at risk of being tortured to extract confessions the group warned nicholas bequelin senior asia researcher for human rights watch said the crackdown is even more serious than the one in december when the nobel peace prize was awarded to a jailed chinese dissident liu xiaobo mr bequelin said it is also more extensive than when police questioned and detained activists involved in signing charter 08 a manifesto for peaceful democratic reform that mr liu co authored in 2008 there is a sense that the authorities want to put an end to the kind of open defiance of the government by rights activists people who have been fairly active on twitter and other social networks who were allowed for a couple of years to do that mr bequelin said china employs a wide range of extralegal measures to silence

heilongjiang have been officially detained on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power or face the more serious charges of subversion of state power and endangering state security an official
