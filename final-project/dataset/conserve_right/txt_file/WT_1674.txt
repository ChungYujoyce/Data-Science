apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap the government has a palette of options it can use to shore up an economy imperiled by anxiety over the coronavirus outbreak they start with the middle class payroll tax cut that president donald trump is suggesting and include quicker more targeted federal aid as well but the options could come with pitfalls and may raise unrealistic expectations the white house and congress have started wrangling over measures to spark the wounded economy as fear around covid 19 has threatened to tip it into recession the crisis of confidence over the virus with more than 118 000 people infected worldwide and 29 deaths in the u s is keeping american consumers the spending engine of the economy away from public places like shopping malls grocery stores and movie theaters beyond the payroll tax cut stimulus measures that may be considered include aid to wage earners missing work because of illness or quarantine who don t receive sick pay special loans for small businesses subsidies or tax relief to affected industries like airlines hotels and cruise ships and aid to certain parts of the country bearing the brunt of virus illnesses and deaths top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender aiding wage earners who don t receive sick pay is a top priority along with the payroll tax break larry kudlow a senior economic adviser to trump told reporters at the white house tuesday evening he said they re also considering assistance to small and medium size businesses and possibly to some distressed industries everything the trump administration has proposed so far is way too small says simon johnson an economics professor at mit s sloan school of management who s an expert on financial and economic crises johnson wants to see emergency sick pay covered substantially by the government overtime paid to health care workers and a massive transfer along the lines of a proposal by a top economic adviser to president obama congress would send every american adult 1 000 and 500 to every child under jason furman s proposal at an estimated ultimate cost to taxpayers of 350 billion trump s signature proposal of a payroll tax cut has spurred criticism from both conservatives and liberals and it met bipartisan resistance tuesday on capitol hill it s a very untargeted measure said joseph stiglitz a nobel laureate economist who teaches at columbia university some americans are at the brink they need to show up to work to feed their families that means infected people could come to work in restaurants extending a vicious cycle he said help is needed to cover low income workers sick leave at a white house briefing monday after another day of stock market convulsion drove the dow jones industrial average to its steepest one day drop ever of 2 013 points trump put forward a possible payroll tax cut as a centerpiece of his team s emergency economic plan kudlow said the white house team is looking at a suspension of all payroll taxes paid by employers and workers through the end of the year it s a bold move it s a very bold move and this is a bold president he said it s an idea that trump considered last summer to avert an economic slowdown as some experts warned the u s was heading for a pullback that could hurt his reelection chances but trump quickly reversed course and touted the economy s strength blaming the federal reserve and its chairman jay powell for not cutting interest rates with payroll taxes employers deduct some money from workers each pay period normally as a percentage of their salary it goes toward advance payment of income taxes and contributions to social security and unemployment and disability insurance cutting that may sound like a winner especially in an election year but critics say such a cut would be unfair because it favors higher income wage earners not gig workers people knocked into joblessness by economic dislocation or coronavirus quarantine and others with only part time jobs or who are self employed at any rate some experts say no matter how much emergency cash might be freed up by the government consumers may not spend it to jump start the economy if they re afraid to open their doors it s a different kind of shock said kenneth rogoff a professor of public policy and economics at harvard who s an expert on financial crises across time you don t have enough money to buy stuff and the government makes a transfer to you that s great but not if you re hiding under the bed instead critics point to solutions that target federal aid directly to the health care sector and efforts to contain and fight against the coronavirus for manufacturing face masks and virus test kits developing vaccines adding new hospital icus and ventilators funneling support to certain industries such as airlines hotels and the oil business could unleash a torrent of special interest jockeying on capitol hill as companies seek special status and exemptions and lawmakers champion businesses in their states and districts trump on tuesday said the cruise industry and airlines are facing particular difficulties and added they re two great industries and we ll be helping them through this rough patch the associated press receives support for health and science coverage from the howard hughes medical institute s department of
