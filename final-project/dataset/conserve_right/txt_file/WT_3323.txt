prayers he answered this one this very specific need in a very specific way ms white cain writes in something greater i have no doubt asked whether she believes that was god s intervention ms white cain said she doesn t understand the rules and regulations and the politics of the church but she knows what it was to be an 18 year old girl who is hungry for god that innocence is maintained in this
