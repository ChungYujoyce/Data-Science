apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic brussels ap europe s top officials closed ranks thursday to demand that the international monetary fund s next leader be one of their own someone with enough technical expertise and political savvy to handle the continent s relentless debt crisis frenchman dominique strauss kahn who has been praised widely for his leadership of the imf and its involvement in solving europe s woes resigned wednesday to devote all his energy to fighting sexual assault charges in new york the move heated up simmering debate over his successor with europe aggressively staking its traditional claim to the post even as fast growing nations such as china and brazil say it s time to break that monopoly and seek an imf chief from a developing nation the washington based imf is empowered to direct billions of dollars to stabilize the global economy top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 hours after mr strauss kahn s resignation everyone from the european commission to the german chancellor to the french finance minister herself a potential candidate said the replacement should come from europe not because of any tradition they insisted but because intimate knowledge of europe s debt crisis should be a critical element of any candidate s portfolio from a european point of view it is essential that the appointment will be merit based where competence and economic and political experience play the key role said olli rehn european commissioner for monetary and cconomic affairs and in this current juncture it is a merit if the person has quite solid knowledge of the european economy and decision making french finance minister christine lagarde in recent days has been touted in many european capitals as a good choice a sharp articulate negotiator she has a strong international reputation and impeccable english after living in the united states for many years i am convinced that she is a good candidate i made a few trips with her to asia i was able to verify her popularity among ministers of large emerging countries french transport minister thierry mariani told france info radio thursday despite ms lagarde s popularity mr mariani was the first member of the french government to speak about her publicly that s partly because she is a member of french president nicolas sarkozy s conservative ump party and if mr sarkozy openly pushes for her candidacy that could fuel the widespread belief in france that the accusations against mr strauss kahn were part of a conspiracy to knock him off what appeared to be his march toward the french presidency ms lagarde herself mentioned no names but said she too supported a european for the job i m a true european and i m convinced that europe is the way to go as far as we are concerned she told reporters on a visit to a french supermarket i am a convinced european and i think that for such a candidacy the europeans must be united in berlin german chancellor angela merkel pushed for a quick decision on a successor to mr strauss kahn and underlined her hopes for another european it is of great significance of course that we find a quick solution she said thursday without naming specific candidates the imf s executive board released a letter from mr strauss kahn on wednesday in which he denied the allegations against him but said he felt he must resign to protect his family and the imf mr strauss kahn is facing a bail hearing thursday in new york that could have spelled the end of his leadership of the imf anyway he faces charges of assaulting a maid in a new york hotel room and has been jailed in new york since monday the maid a 32 year old immigrant from the west african nation of guinea told police the 62 year old mr strauss kahn came out

leader would begin but that in the meantime john lipsky would remain its acting managing director europeans have led the imf since its inception after world war ii americans have occupied both the no 2 position at the imf and the top post at its sister institution the world bank the world bank funds projects in developing countries developing nations see europe s stranglehold on the position as increasingly out of touch with the world economy china s is now the world s second largest economy india s and brazil s have cracked the top 10 many emerging economies have become forces of financial stability while rich countries have become weighed down by debt we must establish meritocracy so that the person leading the imf is selected for their merits and not for being european brazilian finance minister guido mantega said wednesday you can have a competent european but you can have a representative from an emerging nation who is competent as well china suggested it was time to shake things up at the imf with foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu saying the leadership should be based on fairness transparency and merit the united states has a major say in determining who will head the fund in part because it holds the largest number of votes the prevailing view among analysts and former treasury officials appears to be that washington would back a strong european candidate who could be approved in a smooth process other potential european candidates include germany s former central bank chief axel weber the head of europe s bailout fund klaus regling and peer steinbrueck a former german finance minister candidates from elsewhere include turkey s former finance minister kemal dervis singapore s finance chief tharman shanmugaratnam and indian economist montek singh
