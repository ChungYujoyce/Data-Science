source ap photo jae c hong after a month of sheltering in place hundreds of millions of americans will soon emerge from the new normal georgia colorado and alaska among other states are giving their residents some freedom to return to their old lives with many non essential businesses resuming operations plenty of public health advocates are concerned and have raised legitimate questions about the timing of such policies but done right a cautious re opening of america can lay the groundwork for renewed prosperity and lead to better health outcomes than continued blanket stay at home orders and a robust system of american federalism allows states to emulate best practices and learn from failed policies with prudent practices and state centric experimentation america can finally get past the coronavirus crisis for the beleaguered residents of new york and washington d c it s hard to see life as we knew it returning anytime soon there s a very different reality for state citizens of say alaska who are already distancing themselves from social distancing on april 24 anchorage restaurants resumed dine in services albeit under a series of strict stipulations agreed to by the city and state anchorage daily newsreports you can only go to a restaurant as a household with no other guests at your table and you have to make a reservation first no walk ins allowed restaurants can only be filled to 25 of their capacity at once furthermore restaurants are required to have a logbook with names and phone numbers of patrons over a month long period to aid with track and trace efforts colorado has opted for a more restrictive route continuing to restrict restaurants to delivery and carry out pending further progress against covid 19 but under governor jared polis d safer at home initiative a phase of his larger response plan services such as childcare hair salons and tattoo parlors started to re open on april 27 teleworking is still strongly encouraged while many offices re open to half capacity pundits public officials and twitter denizens have wasted little time arguing about these re opening plans thanks to a poisonous political environment that long predates the current crisis these debates are much worse than they need to be while it s tempting and politically gratifying to lump alaskan and coloradan state officials with the protests that have popped up across the country there s a wide spectrum of different approaches to re open america one extreme is pretending the coronavirus doesn t exist anymore and going about our lives as if nothing happened this approach demanded by some protestors would likely result in a second wave of the deadly disease and necessitate further quarantines continuing a lockdown indefinitely would also spell economic disaster for millions of american households george mason university economist dr tyler cowen notes if we keep the economy closed at current levels it will continue to decay and at some point turn into irreversible non linear damage no one knows when or how to model the course of that process that decay also will eat into our future public health capacities and perhaps boost hunger and poverty around the world there is little choice other than to try out different approaches to slowly but surely re open the country dozens of states can come up with dozens of different educated guesses about whether say allowing 50 percent restaurant capacity makes more sense than permitting 25 percent capacity that s the advantage of federalism states can learn from each other s successes and failures along the way the federal government must adopt permissive policies that keep families and businesses informed and safe for example by approving more at home testing the u s food and drug administration can empower consumers to let restaurants and salons know that it s safe to serve them ultimately federal state and public health officials have little idea what s next or the right way to proceed but america will decay and suffer by embracing one extreme of indefinite complete isolation or the other of coronavirus denialism the middle road is the best one and federalism can chart the course thom tillis s first tv ad of the election is a candid one townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
