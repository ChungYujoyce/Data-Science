lines seven in 10 70 democrats support beginning impeachment proceedings while 87 of republicans oppose it reports a politico morning consult poll conducted sept 13 15 and released wednesday

says he has qualified to participate in the next democratic debate in october all hysteria all the time i rarely watch cable news anymore it s all hysteria all the time writes veteran newsman john stossel i m glad my favorite magazine reason cuts through the gloom and tells us the truth there is less war and more food we live healthier and longer lives hiv will soon be history we are increasingly free to be whoever we are and love whom we want even work has become more pleasant notes mr stossel who produces video features for the publication it s a surprising message since most journalists tell us everything s terrible he says they re wrong reason editor in chief katherine mangu ward tells the columnist ms mangu ward says all the media negativity is related to evolution which wired humans to detect bad in the world if you are a caveman who hears a little rustling in the weeds and you say oh it s probably fine and the other guy says it s probably a tiger that s the guy who lives that guy was our ancestor she advises so today as life gets better my profession wins clicks and ratings points by hyping whatever makes us afraid reporters ignore gradual improvement and sometimes miracles mr stossel observes applause for robert o brien one observer is delighted with president trump s decision to appoint robert c o brien as national security adviser i can honestly say it s an outstanding choice says harry j kazianis a senior director at the center for the national interest who has worked with mr o brien for a decade o brien is known in the national security community as someone who saw the rise of china especially its naval aspirations as a key challenge to the u s in asia he was years ahead of the curve in calling out beijing as a major threat to u s interests and was criticized heavily for it however it seems clear that through china s aggressive actions in recent years o brien was proven correct says mr kazianis robert has been someone who has been very vocal about the challenges the u s navy faces in terms of taking on new threats from russia iran and north korea who are building advanced military assets to damage washington s force projection capabilities around the world o brien has advised countless u s presidential hopefuls on u s foreign policy over many years from mitt romney to scott walker to ted cruz and he will serve
