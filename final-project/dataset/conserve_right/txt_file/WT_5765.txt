apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap a common denominator runs through the impeachment probe and the chaos unfolding in syria president donald trump s improvisational style of conducting foreign policy the president s decision to push ukraine to investigate a political rival prompted democrats to launch the house impeachment inquiry and trump s critics equate his abrupt decision to pull u s troops out of northern syria with throwing a match on a powder keg both actions reflect an increasingly confident trump s inclination to listen to his gut over his foreign policy and national security advisers a proclivity that is rattling u s allies and emboldening enemies where trump believes that standing up to the foreign policy establishment holds appeal for voters in next year s election his critics see him gambling with u s national security and making america s word worthless on the global stage top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump s response has been to dig in his heels despite bipartisan criticism on both counts the president says he did nothing wrong on the july 25 phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy that is now at the heart of the impeachment inquiry a conversation that set off alarm bells throughout his foreign policy apparatus in the call trump urged zelenskiy to investigate a firm tied to political rival joe biden s son hunter and to look into ukraine s own involvement in the 2016 presidential election trump staffers expressed concern that he was misusing his presidential authority in making the request and white house lawyers ordered that a memorandum documenting the call be moved into a computer network typically used for covert operations to keep it under wraps on syria trump insists he understands the situation better than most he argues that america should not be the world s policeman but admitted over the weekend that now i m sort of an island of one on his decision to withdraw troops from northern syria indeed the house delivered a bipartisan and overwhelming rebuke wednesday of trump s withdrawal of american forces voting 354 60 to condemn the action the president is taking a backwards approach to policymaking in the view of foreign policy experts instead of listening to his advisers then making a decision trump does the reverse in the case of syria trump talked to turkish president recep tayyip erdogan on the phone and warned him against launching an offensive against kurdish forces turkey views them as terrorists but they were america s ally on the battlefield against islamic state militants after warning erdogan that he would pull the trigger on economic sanctions trump announced that he was pulling u s forces out of syria the kurds felt abandoned is fighters that kurds were guarding escaped from detention iran and russia saw a green light to amass more influence in the region it s a complete debacle said mark dubowitz who has advised the bush obama and trump administrations and lawmakers on u s foreign policy he keeps doing the same thing making decisions without advisers and then everybody has to scramble to mitigate the damage dubowitz said he cited treasury secretary steven mnuchin s rush to craft new sanctions against turkey and the president s decision to dispatch vice president mike pence and secretary of state mike pompeo to the region to mediate trump for his part sees his approach to turkey and syria as strategically brilliant it also dovetails nicely with his campaign pledge to bring american troops home from what he calls never ending wars he has told aides that the chants of bring them home from his rally crowds including one in minnesota earlier this month are evidence that the decision is popular with his base supporters republican sen lindsey graham of south carolina typically one of the president s strongest allies on capitol hill says the president is not listening this decision and line of thinking is against all sound military advice graham said no one in his national security team believes that turkey s invasion of syria is of no consequence to us on ukraine meanwhile trump and his personal attorney rudy giuliani did an end run around the formal diplomatic circles in ukraine asking kyiv to investigate the bidens trump listened to giuliani instead of seasoned diplomats former white house aide fiona hill testified that then national security adviser john bolton was so alarmed by giuliani s back channel activities in ukraine that he described him as a hand grenade who is going to blow everybody up there s little sign that any of the criticism on either ukraine or syria has caused trump to rethink his approach in fact he sees political gold in both he seemed to conflate the two issues when he lashed out wednesday and called house speaker nancy pelosi a third rate politician i think we re going to take the house based on what s happening with the impeachment stuff he told reporters earlier in the day he was equally bullish on the politics of pulling troops out of foreign entanglements i won an election based on that and that s the way it is he said whether it s good or bad that s the way it is editors note deb riechmann has written for the a
