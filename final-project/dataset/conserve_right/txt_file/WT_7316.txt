bama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion madrid mass testing is more than ever a necessity at this stage of covid 19 s outbreak but would you trust a testing kit with a 30 percent accuracy rate only if america launched mass testing on these terms would you feel safer here in spain with the world s fourth largest case count at 70 000 the point is moot my country s government returned more than 600 000 flawed kits to its manufacturer a chinese company by the name of shenzhen bioeasy technology so easy was the deal that when they bought the kits on wednesday spanish health authorities didn t seem the least concerned that the company isn t even permitted to sell them in china itself when microbiologists pre trialed the kits on a sample of known covid 19 patients and only 30 percent were accordingly diagnosed health minister salvador illa tried covering his department s back by claiming bioeasy was licensed to sell kits across the eu but provided no evidence to prove it spain may not be the only victim the entire world is scrambling to sort the healthy

hungary bans people from legally changing their gender as china keeps flattening its covid 19 curve beijing is playing the world s altruistic savior while its companies turn a juicy profit by stepping in to meet the demand it creates the poison and then sells the cure to it china expert gordon chang said it now seems as though the cure isn t one spain s purchase was part of a larger 467 million spend on medical equipment for frontline health staff to deal with a rampant inflow of patients and an aimed for testing rate of 15 000 per day rapid test kits like the ones spain bought take only 15 minutes to churn out a diagnosis as opposed to real time polymerase chain reaction tests rt pcr the nurse intensive four to six hour long procedure undergone to this day the czech republic has also found itself on the short end of a similar bargain finding out the 300 000 kits it d bought this week for 1 83 million to carry out its 900 daily tests were only 20 percent accurate the eu medicine agency s guidelines on par with the u s centers for disease control and prevention s cdc require that tests be 80 percent accurate on average spain s press is reporting that 30 percent of the kits 20 percent in the czech republic s case were valid this is an understatement of the equipment s defectiveness likely fed to overworked and time short reporters by ministry spokespeople looking to play down the disaster if a certain type of testing kit fails to detect 7 out of every 10 known covid 19 cases it doesn t mean you can somehow trust 30 percent of the kits to work fine testing isn t exact science rapid testing even less so the success rate of a test kit is assessed over a large number of trials and by no means equates to a sure outcome for every individual kit you may even feed it the same swab sample twice and get two different results if it shows to be insufficient after the kit has been tried many times it means that none of the kits are valid because none can be individually trusted to deliver an accurate result on average in this case there were 70 percent false negatives shenzen bioeasy s response raises questions too a company spokesperson blamed the incorrect results on a failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly adding that the company had not properly communicated with buyers on how the kits worked china s embassy in madrid cared to concoct an alibi slightly more plausible but flawed nonetheless it claims bioeasy didn t feature in a list released after the purchase of recommended chinese suppliers available to spain s health ministry accepting this as an excuse would assume that any medical equipment chinese firms have exported prior to the official list release is beyond beijing s responsibility to quality control how reassuring to be sure the blame lies majorly with either spain or the eu s medical agency the bloc s fda equivalent which may have stealthily relaxed licensing standards to channel necessary medical equipment into europe spain s health ministry may have ceded to the urgency of the moment and placed an order for a batch of testing kits that didn t meet the eu s unchanged standards it initially sought cover stating the purchase had been made by a trusted spanish supplier which merely budges the commercial nexus at which the sale occurred it also played down the scandal by claiming only 8 000 kits proved defective at first by the minister s own admission the figure turned out to be 58 000 and then 640 000 the purchase was in fact part of a much larger deal to bring in 5 million test kits those undelivered as of yet will supposedly be replaced by functional kits although no hint has been given as to how bioeasy will meet eu standards this time does this mean spain s covid 19 preparedness is beholden to bioeasy s whims on top of the spanish public s outrage at both its health authorities and china the main losers are the health care staff the tests were intended for along with scarcity of means and overburdened hospitals primary care workers are outraged incredulous and strained to the limit as they take stock of the flawed test kits scandal per a union press release the bureaucrats who bought the kits will be duly held accountable for their careless illegality but china is as much to blame as bioeasy and the spanish health ministry beijing is looking to play the role of world savior by dispatching medical staff and upping equipment sales other countries that have turned to china for help include georgia serbia ethiopia liberia iran and iraq but what friendly country allows exports of test kits that it wouldn t use on its own population given the predatory nature of china s development aid likening its medical equipment sales to the belt and road initiative may turn an accurate parallel but when this is all over ask yourself if china really helped your country flatten its curve jorge gonzalez gallarza hernandez jorgeggallarza is a writer based
