seat becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion on this week s last week tonight host and political comedian john oliver was making fun of the rumor that president trump was going to purchase greenland to be honest it s a funny topic the concept of america or any country for that matter purchasing another country at this point in history is absurd and gives comedians piles of material to work with or should at least unfortunately for the team at last week tonight who i would estimate is around 20 or more writers and producers many of whom are probably great comedians they always have to fall back on the same tired cheap orange man bad premises in the middle of what could have been a solid monologue mr oliver dropped the old melania doesn t love trump and is a prisoner tired joke when he said greenland is icy distant and semi autonomous it s exactly trump s type while an image of the first lady appeared on screen boring top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century since mr trump became a serious candidate for president in 2015 late night comedians especially the four heavily political ones john oliver samantha bee stephen colbert and trevor noah have beat the same jokes and concepts about the man to death then dug them beat them to death again and repeated that even a few more times here are literally all the ideas they have in no particular order he s not as rich as he claims to be women hate him melania is a prisoner he s stupid he s a nazi he has tiny hands he s crazy he s evil he s racist he s a putin puppet he s a corrupt businessman his hair is bad he s orange i m sure i m missing a few probably but you get the point millions upon millions of dollars get poured into staffing and producing these jokes on tv when they are the same hacky eye roll inducing criticisms you can get for free on twitter another problem with all of these joke premises is that they come from a place of hate not one of actual humor sure it works for their audiences but even they are getting tired of the same stuff the only people who watch and enjoy these shows anymore are bubble living liberals which makes perfect sense every one of the hateful premises for the jokes that they enjoy are based on the same unfounded hateful claims that they yell to each other all day long the numbers for the shows whether on social or in tv ratings may stay consistent but that consistency comes from the same liberal bubble communities sure there might be a spike when you see stephen colbert draw a swastika on a chalk board or say something about mr trump having mr putin s penis in his mouth both he s done because it s so shocking that people want to see what the extra hateful fuss is about but other than that it s the same stale and tired material michelle wolf remember her found out the hard way that hateful jokes don t sell she bombed at the white house correspondents dinner not because of her making fun of sarah sanders i know that was the headline but because her material was mean instead of funny she didn t try to make fun of mrs sanders she went to berate her which i m sure plays well with the crowds who currently write for political comedy shows one out of touch step further were her jokes about abortion she even had a happy abortion day sketch on her show which i m sure plays to ultra liberals in bubbles but not to anyone on either side of the issue because whether you re pro choice or pro life abortion is never funny one of the best pieces of advice that is given to every comedian early in his career is to go to open mics to perform in front of people who don t know you people who know you and like you will almost always laugh to be nice people who don t know you will sit silently or heckle if your jokes are something they ve heard before or are just plain bad sadly for the creatives for the late night hosts i mentioned it seems as if they re just writing for their friends in their liberal bubble it s been old for trump supporters since about the first time they heard jokes based on those premises and here s where they should heed my advice it s getting very old for democrats that they think are on their side outside of their realm while democratic candidates for president push very little policy and more of the premises of hate about donald trump that i mentioned above democratic voters are slowly losing hope in their 2020 chances and when they try to escape the stresses of life and politics by tuning in to a comedian who says nearly the exact same thing their party turns them completely off so where one might simply write off mr oliver s tired joke about melania not loving her husband democrats that don t live in the bubble groan roll their eyes and turn off the tv and eventually their own party by the way the best joke about it was the meme of the huge gold trump tower in greenland which mr trump copied and tweeted my only complaint he should have given the creator jon gabriel credit tim young is a political comedian and author of i hate democrats i hate republicans post h
