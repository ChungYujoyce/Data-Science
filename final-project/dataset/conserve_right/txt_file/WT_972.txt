time if people wanted to wear them they can mr trump said of masks deborah birx the coordinator of the coronavirus task force said the forthcoming advisory will not be a substitute for hand washing and standing far apart from others because people tend to touch their faces and might get a false sense of security from masks for his part mr trump scolded democrats after house speaker nancy pelosi said thursday at least two of her committee chairs reps bernie thompson of homeland security and adam schiff of intelligence are calling for a 9 11 like after action review of the administration s handling of the coronavirus threat mrs pelosi said there is absolutely a need for such an investigation but not right now the president said democrats have a lousy track record of investigating him saying the russia investigation and the impeachment inquiry over aid to ukraine have already done extraordinary damage to our country we want to fight for american lives not waste time and build up my poll numbers because that s all they re doing mr trump said conducting these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic is a really big waste of time mrs pelosi did announce the creation of a special bipartisan house committee on thursday to review how the administration spends part of the 2 2 trillion economic rescue package for businesses harmed by the nationwide shutdown is there a need for an after action review absolutely she said but i don t want to wait for that because we are in the action now the fireworks came as the coronavirus pandemic reached the grim worldwide milestones

workers he also said manufacturers must facilitate the supply of materials to general electric and several other companies that are making life saving ventilators amid the coronavirus pandemic today s order will save lives by removing obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators he said in using the defense production act of 1950 mr trump s order follows a similar move last week to compel automaker general motors to build ventilators for the fight against the virus ventilators can mean life or death for patients hit by respiratory distress from the viral disease covid 19 and new york gov andrew cuomo said his state could exhaust its supply in the coming week mr cuomo also said mr trump granted his request to let the javits convention center in new york city to accept covid 19 patients it had been set up as a makeshift hospital site in partnership with the federal government originally the 2 500 bed emergency medical facility was intended to house non coronavirus patients to free up space for covid 19 patients in other hospitals mr cuomo has estimated that his state could need 110 000 hospital beds for covid 19 patients and the current capacity is half that roughly 53 000 beds vice president mike pence said mr trump took the unprecedented step of directing the defense department to operate covid 19 operations at convention centers in new york city new orleans and dallas mr trump characterized his efforts as a courtesy to states saying the federal government is a backup to state efforts the states should be building we re a backup we re not an ordering clerk he said they should have been on the open market just buying the white house outlined its role and plans hours after the democratic national committee moved its

peach state relenting after computer models and medical professionals insisted the worst is yet to come in a state far from peaking in terms of infections the rules will go into effect friday and will remain in place tentatively until april 13 according to the republican governor georgia had nearly 5 350 cases of covid 19 and 163 deaths as of noon thursday the state has a population of roughly 10 5

dropped his piecemeal efforts and issued a statewide order wednesday to stay at home except for trips for essential services such as grocery shopping pharmacy visits or pet care mr desantis said thursday he exempted religious services from his order because people need the solace of worship more than ever and services can be set up safely with congregants spread out new york remains the epicenter of the crisis with nearly 92 500 positive coronavirus cases among its population of 20 million it s seen 2 373 coronavirus related deaths a 22 increase from a day earlier while 7 434 patients have been discharged about a 21 increase from a day earlier mr cuomo a democrat said his state has enough ventilators in its stockpile to last about six days though he said it s taking extraordinary measures that put them in fairly good shape to meet demand amid the coronavirus outbreak if a person comes in and needs a ventilator and you don t have a ventilator the person dies mr cuomo said at his daily briefing on the covid 19 outbreak that s the blunt equation here and right now we have a burn rate that would suggest we have about six days in the stockpile he said they re in the process of moving ventilators from upstate locations to areas in greater need downstate mr cuomo has estimated that the state could need 30 000 to 40 000 ventilators at the apex of the crisis he said hospitals are taking steps to increase supply by ending all elective surgeries using anesthesia machine ventilators and experimenting with splitting ventilators so more than one person uses them he also said they re converting some bipap machines which are used to treat sleep apnea to be used as ventilators the burn rate of ventilators is troubling and six days of ventilators in the stockpile is troubling but we have all these extraordinary measures that i believe if push comes to shove will put us in fairly good shape he said also thursday mr trump said his administration is ordering nursing homes to use the same staff for the same group of residents to minimize any potential spread of the virus it is also ordering homes to set up separate areas for healthy and sick residents the
