national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions stacey abrams has another distinction to add to her resume she s among the most preposterous potential vice presidential candidates ever her attempt to leverage a failed georgia gubernatorial bid into a spot on the democratic ticket is so brazenly absurd that it s hard to think of precedents but the 46 year old african american activist is not one to be constrained by standard political practice or reality she refused to concede her narrow but clear 2018 gubernatorial loss instead alleging she d been undone by a massive voter suppression scheme as she put it at a recent event my opponent who was a cartoon villain stole the voices of georgians usually candidates who won t acknowledge their defeats are written off as sore losers such is the inflamed and paranoid state of democrats in the trump era that rather than being embarrassed by the georgian s graceless and unsubstantiated claims of electoral theft they have embraced and parroted them jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist https cdn jwplayer com v2 playlists xtkmeukk contextual true search

23390304 labelmapping labelmapping abrams could be forgiven for thinking that if she could get her party to accept that she is the rightful governor of georgia she has a chance to convince it that she deserves to be a heartbeat away from the presidency in the administration of a 78 year old man by her own estimation she d be an excellent running mate she has no doubt that she s prepared to be president on day one and touts her foreign policy credentials of having visited more than a dozen countries trump has rewritten the rules of political experience yet it s still a stretch to imagine someone who has only served in the georgia legislature and as a state representative not even a senator is ready to become the leader of the free world even pete buttigieg has more executive experience abrams told the new york times that she s been so forthright about wanting to be biden s selection because she doesn t want anyone to ever look at my answer and say well if she can t say it then i can t think it yes anyone who aspires to lose a statewide election and make it a credential for high office can look to abrams for inspiration she considers the old etiquette around the veep selection process oppressive as she told the washington post tradition does not serve those who have been marginalized or disadvantaged and therefore my response has to meet the moment meet the moment she s only been answering questions in interviews about veep speculation her foremost political achievement to date of making her gubernatorial loss into a cause c l bre among democrats is built on nonsense it is true that her victorious opponent brian kemp was serving as secretary of state at the same time he campaigned for governor he wasn t responsible for counting the votes though which is done at the local level kemp did purge the voter rolls in keeping with georgia s use it or lose it rule if you don t vote in an election for three years you get notices in the mail if you don t reply to them and then don t vote in the next two federal elections you are taken off the rolls this measure is unlikely to affect active voters regardless people can always reregister it is often said that kemp shut down polling places but these decisions were made by localities and the ones that cut polling places were usually cash strapped rural areas abrams can reasonably boast of an ability to stoke turnout among minority and young voters she won more votes than any democrat who has ever run statewide but given her high octane progressivism she d have limited appeal to working class swing voters and suburban women by picking her biden would also be undermining one of his chief arguments namely that he s a low risk experienced steady hand this means that abrams is likely to be passed over and if the past is any guide conclude that she got robbed 2020 by king features syndicate get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national
