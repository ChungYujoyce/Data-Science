whatever else you want about president trump s relentless tornado diplomacy aimed at north korea it is at least original see also 2020 democrats knock trump over north korea it s all for show unconventional secretary of state mike pompeo acknowledges with a smile he stares at these problems and says if we keep banging away the way we have been forever the positions are staked out the likelihood of success is almost nil he told the washington times let s try and come at this from a different direction mr trump s latest meeting with north korean president kim jong un whom he once dubbed little rocket man came about in typical trump fashion see also unlike obama south koreans impressed by trump s efforts to reach peace the president was going to be in south korea after group of 20 meetings in japan and says i m gonna be up there mr pompeo recounted from pyongyang to the border is not that far maybe chairman kim will come meet me this alone would be enough to make history but mr trump was not finished doing things differently he decides the best way to communicate this is to the world mr pompeo said so mr trump took to twitter after some very important meetings including my meeting with president xi of china i will be leaving japan for south korea with president moon the president tweeted to his 61 million followers around the world at 7 51 a m saturday while there if chairman kim of north korea sees this i would meet him at the border dmz just to shake his hand and say hello within an hour mr pompeo said they heard from officials in north korea they responded saying hey what does this mean what are you really thinking it was mr pompeo said 20 maybe 30 hours between tweet and meeting globe trotting week in his first interview just hours after returning from the dmz with mr trump mr pompeo is clearly pleased with the day s events he is seated at the desk in his office aboard the air force 757 carrying him home after an eight day diplomatic journey around the world last week mr pompeo headed east out of washington to saudi arabia and the united arab emirates along the gulf of oman where iran is accused of bombing two oil tankers and is threatening to resume enrichment of nuclear material then it was on to afghanistan where mr trump is urgently pressing for a stable peace with the taliban so u s troops can come home from there mr pompeo ventured to new delhi to encourage india the world s largest democracy and its 1 3 billion people to take a larger more powerful role in that region then it was on to japan for the g 20 and to south korea where mr trump was hoping for a historic handshake with mr kim look for decades now this has been a challenge mr pompeo said for the last 12 years there s been this real worry that they had a functional nuclear capability after decades of strategic indifference by previous administrations mr pompeo has been the spear point of mr trump s diplomacy with north korea president trump set about seeing if there wasn t a possibility beginning with sending me when i was cia director on easter weekend of 2017 to see if it was possible if chairman kim was ready to do this any optimism remains cloaked in caution and wariness of the pitfalls of negotiating with despots there is always a risk mr pompeo said the president always says it may not work that is certainly the case even today a trumpian gamble when sunday morning dawned over seoul mr trump still had no idea whether mr kim would show up as with so much of what mr trump does it was a gamble at a meeting with business leaders in the morning mr trump joked that since he had made such a public invitation it would be easy for the north korean dictator to humiliate him by not showing up for the handshake at the dmz but even that vulnerability revealed the uncommon confidence of mr trump so around 2 p m mr trump mr pompeo and a clutch of american officials loaded into a fleet of helicopters and headed for the dmz we landed just outside the dmz mr pompeo said mr trump went up to the observation point where u s and south korean soldiers keep an armed eye on north korean soldiers across the border and spent some time talking to american and south korean soldiers posted there then we learned that chairman kim had arrived mr pompeo said mr trump headed for the border he walked up to the leader formerly known as little rocket man and shook his hand and then the two men walked across the border and into history courtesy and respect like mr trump mr pompeo is careful to refer to the north korean leader as chairman kim it may seem strange for american leaders to salute a dictator with his communist title but there is a purpose to such honorifics he treats his counterparts with respect mr pompeo said of mr trump they are the leaders of their people and entitled to the right to execute sovereignty over their nation and he respects that and i think the other leaders see that so they are prepared to engage in ways they might not be with a president who was different from that with chairman kim mr trump is no different he talks about his relationship i watched him deal with mr kim today in the room it s a serious conversation they both respect each other mr pompeo said perhaps that respectfulness is all the more appreciated coming from a guy who is more than willing to publicly hurl withering insults at people during an hourlong press conference in japan on saturday mr trump reminded reporters of that cutting wit cnn s deeply jaundiced white house correspondent jim acosta a frequent target of mr trump s abuse asked mr trump whether he failed to bring up an issue with another world leader because he was afraid of offending no not at all i don t really care about offending people i sort of thought you d know that mr trump shot back sparking an eruption of laughter from reporters gadhafi precedent in searching for peace on the korean peninsula the central question is how to ensure north korea the security it would need in order to give up its nuclear ballistic missile program we have to find out what that would mean for them mr pompeo said they have talked about a few things one would be just documenting the end of the 1950 53 korean war which is technically ongoing by signing a formal peace treaty but there is enormous generational mistrust between north korea and those seeking to disarm the regime mr pompeo thinks that mistrust is somewhat misplaced for an ordinary american sitting in wichita kansas where i am from there is no interest in the destruction of north korea we just want peace we want them to not threaten the world with their nuclear weapons mr pompeo said it is a difficult challenge for north korea mr pompeo said one that is made all the more difficult with the 2011 overthrow of moammar gadhafi in that case the libyan strongman persuaded by president george w bush s 2003 invasion of iraq and the fate of saddam hussein had agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction only to be savagely killed anyway by islamist rebels with a helping hand from nato forces they stare at history where in previous cases some country has given up their nuclear weapons and the country was essentially then run over and the leader killed mr pompeo said that has to be on their mind despite the cautious optimism he said negotiating today beats the strategic indifference of past administrations my observation is that talking decreases overall risk in the absence of working with the north koreans to try and resolve this problem the risk just accumulates mr pompeo said and it s accumulated over a period of time we have to crack the code we have to res
