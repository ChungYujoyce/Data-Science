dicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion if you told me my life would change in a matter of hours by trying to raise awareness about an ongoing problem endured by one of the most vulnerable groups in america i wouldn t believe you if you told me my 250 red sony camera would capture video that would play around the world i would laugh if you then told me that powerful political forces in baltimore along with well known journalists in the national media would turn on me for exposing the city s blight in six videos i would later post i might have thought twice before hitting send after watching congressman elijah cummings on a sunday morning talk show claim his constituents were afraid of president trump because of his rhetoric i got curious and decided to investigate the first two men i stopped to ask about mr trump in west baltimore gave me answers i never expected they initially laughed as we began conversing the men explained they were on board with the president s immigration policies i was shocked national media such as cnn never reports such views from people in neighborhoods like this not only were these men not afraid of mr trump as their congressman claimed they found hope for their community in president trump you see i had no idea the elected city officials were putting illegal immigrants above the residents until i heard about the issues the gentlemen had with all of the contracting jobs being filled by mexicans without id taking cash and accepting lower wages apparently many residents in the neighborhood are against baltimore becoming a sanctuary city however there is never anyone around to listen to their perspective it quickly became apparent that city officials were operating on their own agendas these constituents in mr cummings 7th congressional district had absolutely no input top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century mr cummings hasn t been seen in this area in years they told me his listed home address is just six blocks north after a brief conversation i allowed one of the men in my car i know not smart we drove two blocks down to the congressman s home that he shares with his wife in his row home there are three separate apartments very hard to believe considering how small the home looks from the outside the gentleman took me to the side alley where mounds of garbage have sat since december 2018 it was easy to see the trash was dumped by a contractor old carpet furniture and drywall all strewn about i learned illegal dumping was a huge problem in west baltimore residents constantly call the city to pick the dumped items up but no one shows for months an abandoned row home shared the same alley so we went inside also not smart but i now i was on a mission inside i found pill bottles used needles blankets and feces it smelled of urine according to my new friend homeless people especially addicts use the home for shelter i shuddered at the thought of living next door to such a mess however after thinking of the children i saw on the block living near it i felt sick to my stomach definitely a vision i wish i could un see i was told rats and all sorts of rodents were a problem after being in the home for two minutes i was attacked by fleas which was actually a relief considering that bedbugs exist my focus quickly shifted from questions about president trump to getting the neighborhood some help i spent four days capturing video of the living conditions i posted each video on twitter adding mr cummings to each post in hopes he would see it and make the necessary calls thanks to a few retweets from a friend at the daily wire fox news producers i have never spoken to before contacted me and asked me to come in and explain i thought great this will reach people across the country and there will be many urging mr cummings to do something about the conditions in his district as i prepped for the morning show i came across all of the videos of mr cummings being outraged about the conditions at the border i immediately knew i had to address the hypocrisy i had no idea the president would be watching after president trump retweeted my videos the story took on a life of its own brian stetler aired a hit piece about me cnn later corrected some of the mistakes stetler made but not others he falsely claimed i was just trying to help president trump actually i was just trying to help the residents in mr cummings district by exposing horrid conditions in the neighborhood fellow conservative commentators i thought were friends lashed out one friend told me my videos weren t comprehensive and needed data and research as it currently stands i have a total of three friends in the industry it seems people want you to do well just not better than them knowing i trusted a stranger to guide me through an abandoned row house you probably guessed i am too trusting and believe in applauding everyone s success silly me now that you know the truth about how all this began i am excited to see this through i was able to raise money for the gentleman and the interviewees for my videos we found shelter for the homeless man living in the neighboring abandoned house scott pressler busted his tail to get a neighborhood clean up together hundreds of volunteers from across the country is no small task currently i am working on a permanent solution to introduce to congress in hopes every major city in america implements the idea and allows the average resident you know the ones unable to pay to play to have oversight forgotten neighborhoods are not forgotten by the residents they either live there or drive through them forgotten neighborhoods earned the name because those particular voters do not have the money to donate to campaigns nor do they reside in a tourist attraction they are forgotten by the people they ve elected
