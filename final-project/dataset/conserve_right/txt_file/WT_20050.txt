apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic bangkok ap vietnam s selection as the venue for the second summit between u s president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un is largely a matter of convenience and security but not without bigger stakes washington s goal for the feb 27 28 talks is for north korea to agree give up its nuclear weapons north korea frames the issue more broadly seeking a removal of the nuclear threat from u s military forces in south korea host vietnam hopes to boost its diplomatic leverage against its powerful neighbor china which contests waters in the south china sea claimed by vietnam top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots but vietnam s history as a u s adversary that transitioned on its own terms to a dynamic free market economy under a communist political system suggests a larger meaning for the summit by choosing vietnam the two leaders send a strong strategic message to the world that they are willing to make a breakthrough decision to turn an enemy into a friend and together make the world a better place following the example of the u s vietnam relationship said vu minh khuong an associate professor at singapore s lee kuan yew school of public policy a fresh secure stage america s past military involvement in vietnam whether it s seen as tragic or noble provides a historically dramatic stage for trump to again draw attention to his foreign policy accomplishments as a single party communist state vietnam boasts tight political control and an efficient security apparatus and successfully hosted the asia pacific economic cooperation meetings in the central coastal city of da nang and the regional edition of the world economic forum last year in the capital hanoi like singapore where they met last time vietnam is a very secure place said murray hiebert senior associate of the southeast asia program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington vietnam s security police are able to keep away crowds of the curious and keep journalists in designated areas trump s attendance at the 2017 apec meeting means he s familiar with the country and has good rapport with its leaders hiebert said communist ties this is friendly turf for kim even though north korea has remained mired in cold war isolation while vietnam s postwar path led toward integration with the globalized economy the two communist countries share a history of anti imperialist struggle and ambivalent relations with common neighbor china vietnam and north korea have long had fraternal communist ties so north korea is familiar with the country and its officials north korea would also feel confident that vietnam s security apparatus could secure kim s protection hiebert said there s also the bonus that a flight from pyongyang to a meeting in vietnam is roughly two thirds of the six hour flying time to singapore and none of it over hostile territory a forward looking north korea might learn something from vietnam s impressive economic growth due to bold economic reforms proactive integration into the world economy and excellent partnerships with strategic partners with the u s and south korea among the most important ones khuong said u s secretary of state mike pompeo made a similar point when he visited hanoi last july after two days of talks in north korea the leaders of vietnam realized their country could reform it could open up and build relationships without threatening the country s sovereignty its independence and its form of government he said in a speech to hanoi s business community i have a message for chairman kim jong un president trump believes your country can replicate this path it s yours if you ll seize the moment what vietnam gains vietnam is locked in a pretty intense rivalry with china in the south china sea so hanoi is looking for regional and international diplomatic support as a hedge against beijing and hosting a summit like this would certainly strengthen its international profile said csis scholar hiebert in particular helping washington achieve its korean policy goals could help fulfill vietnam s desire for closer relations with the u s both to encourage trade and investment and serve as a strategic counterweight to china trump s abandonment of the trans pacific partnership free trade group dampened hopes for a takeoff in trade and vietnam s poor human rights record especially its harsh repression of political dissidents has hurt chances for closer security links the country may attract significant international attention especially from tourists and investors through the intense media coverage of the summit said le hong hiep a research fellow at the iseas yusof ishak institute in singapore it can also be a chance for vietnam to showcase its active foreign policy through which vietnam would like to contribute more to the international community as well as to regional peace and security associated press writer annabelle liang
