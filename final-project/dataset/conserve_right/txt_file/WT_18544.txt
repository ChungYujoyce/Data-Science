south china sea according to officials and video footage wednesday in a dangerous escalation of tensions over waters considered a global flashpoint several boats have been damaged and at least six vietnamese on board them have been injured officials said the united states said it was concerned and accused china of ramping up tensions in the area china s decision to introduce an oil rig accompanied by numerous government vessels for the first time in waters disputed with vietnam is provocative and raises tensions state department spokeswoman jen psaki said in a statement this unilateral action appears to be part of a broader pattern of chinese behavior to advance its claims over disputed territory in a manner that undermines peace and stability in the region top stories

harassing vietnam and philippine vessels and fishermen in the potentially oil and gas rich waters it claims almost entirety a shaky stance to many international law experts but china s deployment of the oil rig on may 1 and the flotilla of escort ships some armed is seen as one of its most provocative steps in a gradual campaign of asserting its sovereignty in the south china sea with neither country showing any sign of stepping down the standoff raises the possibility of more serious clashes hanoi which has no hope of competing with china militarily said it wants a peaceful solution and unlike china hadn t sent any navy ships to areas close to the 1 billion deep sea rig near the paracel islands but a top official warned that all restraint had a limit our maritime police and fishing protection forces have practiced extreme restraint we will continue to hold on there ngo ngoc thu vice commander of vietnam s coast guard told a specially arranged news conference in hanoi but if the chinese ships continue to ram into us we will respond with similar self defense after china stationed the oil rig vietnam immediately dispatched marine police and fishery protection vessels but they were harassed as they approached thu said video was shown at the news conference of chinese ships ramming into vietnamese vessels and firing high powered water cannons at them thu said the chinese vessels have done so dozens of times over the last three days he said vietnam had not carried out any offensive actions of its own close to the rig about 220 kilometers 140 miles off the vietnamese

neighbors even as they are aware they need to keep relations open with a vital trading partner hua said the u s has no right to make unwarranted remarks on china s sovereign rights vietnam has limited leverage in dealing with its giant neighbor while it is no longer as isolated as it once was the country can t expect much diplomatic or other help from powerful friends it appears likely to try to rally regional support against china s actions china seems intent on putting down its footprint squarely in contested waters and force hanoi s hand it appears a critical juncture has occurred and one would expect hanoi to be weighing its options said jonathan london a vietnam expert at the city university of hong kong the philippines has filed a legal challenge to china s territorial claims at a u
