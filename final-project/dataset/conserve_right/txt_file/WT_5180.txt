apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the fbi s top brass has not been cleared of wrongdoing for the slew of errors in the agency s trump russia collusion probe and serious questions remain justice department inspector general michael e horowitz said wednesday testifying before a senate panel mr horowitz rebutted claims his report released last week exonerates the fbi he pointedly cautioned that his investigation of fbi abuses in obtaining a wiretap warrant for trump campaign aide carter page did not reach any conclusions about the agents motives the findings he said do not determine whether animosity toward mr trump was a factor in the fbi s stunningly sloppy application to the secret foreign intelligence surveillance act court top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots mr horowitz said he could not conclude that bias was a factor but he also could not offer explanations for the fbi s actions which included errors mistakes and omitted critical information there are so many errors we couldn t reach a conclusion or make a determination on what motivated those failures other than what we did not credit what i lay out here the explanations we got he told the senate homeland security committee mr horowitz said the fbi s intent remains a lingering question for him despite reviewing more than 1 million documents and interviewing more than 100 witnesses in his 18 month investigation how did all these failures in the fisa process that is layered with all these controls happen and why he asked at this stage we didn t get good explanations on that and that is something we would have liked to have had good explanations about a day earlier the fisa court lambasted the fbi in a rare public order based on mr horowitz s conclusions judge rosemary m collyer the court s chief judge said the bureau s actions were antithetical to the heightened duty of candor committee chairman ron johnson said at the hearing the court s order is a dramatic rebuke of the fbi adding that he is questioning whether other fisa applications were also riddled with errors i think the fisa court is in jeopardy personally the wisconsin republican said mr horowitz last week released his extensive report on the early stages of the russia probe that the fbi dubbed operation crossfire hurricane his team found at least 17 mistakes in the fisa application to wiretap mr page fbi missteps included submitting a doctored email as evidence and failing to include information that undercut allegations mr page was working with russia mr page was never charged with any wrongdoing the inspector general also concluded bias was not a factor in the investigation s initial stages saying the fbi was right to raise flags about mr page democrats have seized on that finding saying it proved mr trump s claims of a politically motivated coup were unfounded sen gary peters of michigan the top democrat on the committee glossed over the fbi s bungling of its fisa application to surveil mr page instead he focused on mr horowitz s conclusion the fbi probe was justified the most important fact that we should take away from this report and this hearing is that russia a foreign adversary engaged in a sweeping and systemic effort to interfere in the 2016 election and that the fbi was right in investigating those who may have been involved he said republicans on the committee repeatedly pressed mr horowitz on whether his failure to find bias didn t rule out bias an explanation for the fbi s errors just because you didn t find it doesn t mean it didn t exist said sen rand paul kentucky republican sen josh hawley wondered how the fbi could keep making the same mistakes in the subsequent renewals of the page fisa warrant were they all just stupid the missouri republican asked while ticking off the complex process to obtain a fisa warrant mr horowitz said the fbi s mistakes went beyond fouling up the page warrant he said agents should have reassessed whether to continue surveilling mr page after learning the allegations against him were not credible fbi officials should have ended monitoring mr page in january 2017 when no evidence of wrongdoing turned up after months of surveillance mr horowitz told lawmakers instead the bureau continued to watch mr page until september 2017 if you are getting information that isn t advancing and in fact potentially undercutting or simply undercutting your primary theme or theory as was happening here you d look at the carter page file and say should i keep going on this he said mr horowitz said even as agents pushed the page investigation forward others questioned why they had not reevaluated a probe that wasn t fruitful we ve got agents talking to one another about why page is even a subject anymore he said mr johnson said the investigation should have been shut down sooner he said mr trump was tormented for over two years al
