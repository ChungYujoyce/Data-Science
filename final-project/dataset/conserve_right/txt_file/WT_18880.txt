apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic u s strategic nuclear forces are old in dire need of modernization and face draconian cuts because of the federal budget crisis the commander of u s nuclear forces said tuesday air force gen c robert kehler head of u s strategic command also said china and russia are engaged in aggressive nuclear force buildups while the u s government is fighting over funding for modernizing its strategic forces in an interview with the washington times gen kehler also said cyberattacks are escalating toward destructive attacks he made the comments as investigators are looking for a foreign link to a recent cyberattack on an illinois water control system top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore on the nuclear buildup by beijing and moscow he said both are committed to modernization programs and are pressing ahead and we are reaching a critical point here where we ve got to make our own commitment gen kehler said the view here in omaha is that we need to sustain a safe secure and effective nuclear deterrent gen kehler said echoing a view expressed by the president the strategic command is based in omaha neb i am concerned about the congressional marks in the fiscal year 12 budget about the national nuclear security administration investment in particular energy and water appropriations committees in the house and senate have not fully funded the administration s request for 7 6 billion for nuclear arms modernization agreement after debate last year on ratifying the new strategic arms reduction treaty start gen kehler and navy adm james a winnefeld vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff have written to congress expressing concerns about the funding said rep michael r turner chairman of the house armed services subcommittee on strategic forces mr turner ohio republican stated in a recent letter to the office of management and budget that the military leaders letter has been held up for review for several weeks gen kehler said nuclear modernization is only one of his worries with the budget slashing i m concerned about a lot of things here in addition to the nuclear deterrent he said i m concerned about space i m concerned about cyber i m concerned about missile defense i m concerned across the board ballistic missile submarines need to be replaced strategic bombers are old and land based missiles are aging the four star general said strategic command also is taking part in a white house led nuclear posture review implementation study gen kehler said any nuclear force cuts whether in a treaty or unilaterally by the united states should be based on a strategy he said gen kehler said u s nuclear weapons and infrastructure are now aged we have reached one of those critical points where investment is required to sustain the weapons and performed the necessary life extension on the weapons as well as to upgrade the complex he said getting full funding is definitely critical the triad of nuclear forces bombers land based nuclear missiles and sea based missiles remains robust but gen kehler was less confident that it would remain so without a major investment in modernization all areas of strategic command s missions nuclear forces space defense cyberwarfare and missile defenses are being reviewed as part of the pentagon s initial 10 year 450 billion spending cut now that the congressional supercommittee s inability to reach a deal is about to trigger another 600 billion in defense cuts gen kehler said strategic forces are facing draconian reductions something reflected in a recent letter to congress from defense secretary leon e panetta realistically i think as we have watched the budget debates unfold it isn t clear to me what s going to happen the general said but i can tell you we still stand by the need to make the investment in strategic forces without fully funding the nuclear forces upgrade we re not going to be able to execute the program as it s currently envisioned gen kehler said noting that it would send strategic command and the energy department back to the drawing board a critical need he added is to conduct a life extension program on old nuclear warheads u s nuclear forces face the budget crunch as china and russia are engaged in a major buildup of strategic nuclear forces in china s case one that is being carried out in utmost secrecy both of their programs are very ambitious he said and we are watching those programs evolve we are mindful of the capabilities that they already have at the table and will bring to the table through their modernization asked about mr panetta s statement to congress that the coming 1 trillion cut in defense spending will result in elimination of the land based intercontinental ballistic missile force gen kehler said he thinks that keeping all three strategic legs land air and submarine fired missiles is needed strategic command the recent nuclear posture review and ratification debate on the new start agreement stressed the importance of sustaining the triad as the preferred way forward he said i would also say we have the flexibility within the new start treaty to mix our forces in the way that suits us the best he said we would look very carefully at how we would mix our force if we have to go forward with sequestration numbers sequestration is congress term for cutting the additional 600 billion from defense spending over the next 10 years on cyberthreats gen kehler said investigators are examining whether there is a foreign connection to the cyberdisruption of an illinois water control system a water utility in a town near springfield ill was hacked by people suspected of operating through a server in russia they gained access to the system s controls and could have taken steps that would have damaged pumps that control water supplies our concern is that cyberactivities we have seen have progressed the general said and they go from things that were exploitive in the past to disruptive to the potential that they can become destructive on space security another responsibility of strategic command the u s military is aggressively planning our defensive space activities gen kehler said in general terms we have increased the gain on our ability to protect our space assets he said increased resilient architectures for space systems and cybersystems has boosted deterrence since 2007 he said planning the response to space attacks also has improved much of the defenses were upgraded after china s 2007 test of a ground based direct ascent anti satellite missile that destroyed a chinese weather satellite and scattered tens of thousands of pieces of debris in orbits th
