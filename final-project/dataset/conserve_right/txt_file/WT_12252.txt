n of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic it was announced with great fanfare as a momentous shift in china s 35 year old population control policy the long awaited adjustment in the country s one child policy has raised hopes that 10 million extra babies will be born in the next five years but the early returns suggest the relaxation of the one child limit may not produce the baby boom that many expect i think 10 million new babies 2 million per annum is unlikely said timothy beardson a china researcher in hong kong top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time mr beardson s latest book stumbling giant the threats to china s future looks at china s alarming problems of anemic fertility rates a workforce that is shrinking by the millions an elderly population that is growing by the millions and an eye popping male to female imbalance some analysts estimate that china has more than 50 million excess males because of abortion and infanticide of girls under the one child policy the new birth policy permits married couples to apply for a second birth permit if either spouse is an only child projections of 2 million extra babies a year for five years are based on the assumption that there is huge pent up demand to have more babies said mr beardson however this remains to be seen especially since other massive social and economic factors especially urbanization already discourage chinese couples from having children he said one child policy eased although mr beardson is not alone in his skepticism about a surge in births in china chinese officials and academics are hopeful that their people will respond to the policy change in november chinese officials said that to spur economic growth married couples may apply for a second birth permit if either spouse has no siblings including half blood siblings previously each spouse needed to be an only child to have a second child an estimated 15 million to 20 million people are affected by the policy and 50 percent to 60 percent have indicated in surveys that they would consider having a second child china s national health and family planning commission said with about 2 million extra births a year in addition to the current 16 million births the policy should help maintain a reasonable labor force slow the pace of population aging boost sustained and healthy economic development and creat e a sound population environment for the realization of the chinese dream of rejuvenation of the great chinese nation wang pei an vice minister of the commission said in november loosening of the one child policy will slow the aging phenomenon and relieve pressure on pensions li jianmin a demographer with nankai university in tianjin told china daily moreover chinese officials and academics have estimated that the policy change will boost china s total fertility rate of 1 6 children per woman to 1 8 children per woman closer to the 2 1 children per woman that constitutes replacement level fertility baby boom but these rosy baby boom forecasts for china run counter to broader trends that lower the childbearing rate regardless of government rules mr beardson founder of crosby financial holdings in hong kong said at a recent event at the cato institute in washington these include china s growing urbanization the accompanying higher cost of living the education and professional employment of chinese women and the tendency to marry later in life those trends have depressed childbearing rates in the developed world for decades other barriers to childbearing in china include high costs of housing education and care for children 35 years of social messaging about how one child is best and china s many rules about childbearing that are enforced sometimes ruthlessly by its massive family planning bureaucracy it would be a blessing to chinese society if china could have this additional 10 million children yong cai a sociology professor at the university of north carolina at chapel hill wrote to the times but with all these factors in play mr cai said the estimate of 2 million extra births a year is overly optimistic and it s impossible that the surge will last for five years in other words he said we will not see this additional 10 million another china watcher is adamant that the one child policy needs to be abolished the adjustment does nothing to stop the coercion that is at the core of the policy said reggie littlejohn founder and president of women s rights without frontiers and a vocal opponent of the one child policy china s rules still are strict she and other critics said in some chinese provinces a mother must be older than 28 and have a child older than 4 before she can apply to become pregnant again couples who are expecting or have a baby without state permission face massive fines seizure of property forced abortions and other punitive measures women s rights without frontiers reports also china s extraordinary issue of excess males surely will confound its hopes for a baby boom in 2010 the chinese academy of social sciences estimated that china that could face a bride shortage of 24 million women by 2020 since the one child policy was implemented in 1979 millions of chinese families aborted killed or lost their girls to ensure that their one child was a son the baby girls born over the next five years will not address the vast gender imbalance in the older age cohorts said ms littlejohn adding that abuses such as human trafficking prostitution bride buying and bride stealing are already happening china has a little window of time about 20 years to address its demographic challenges mr beardson told the cato ev
