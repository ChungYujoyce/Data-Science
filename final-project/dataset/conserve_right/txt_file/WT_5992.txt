apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic rome ap facing intense surges in the need for hospital icu beds european nations are on a building and hiring spree throwing together makeshift hospitals and shipping coronavirus patients out of overwhelmed cities via high speed trains and military jets the key question is whether they will be able to find enough healthy medical staff to make it all work even as the virus has slowed its growth in overwhelmed italy and in china where it first emerged hospitals in spain and france are reaching their breaking points and the u s and britain are bracing for incoming waves of desperately ill people it feels like we are in a third world country we don t have enough masks enough protective equipment and by the end of the week we might be in need of more medication too said paris emergency worker christophe prudhomme top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century global stock markets skidded wednesday and in a remarkable turnaround rich economies where virus cases have exploded are welcoming help from less wealthy ones russia sent medical equipment and masks to the u s on wednesday cuba sent doctors to france turkey sent masks hazmat suits goggles and disinfectants to italy and spain from the virus ravaged new york region to jordan s capital and cities across europe authorities are boosting temporary hospital capacity to keep up london is just days from unveiling a 4 000 bed temporary hospital built in a massive convention center to take non critical patients so british hospitals can stay ahead of an expected surge still there are concerns about finding thousands of medical workers to run it spain which hit a record wednesday of 864 deaths in one day has boosted its hospital beds by 20 hotspots in madrid and northeast catalonia have almost tripled their icu capacity dozens of hotels across spain have been turned into recovery rooms and authorities are building field hospitals in sports centers libraries and exhibition halls intensive care units are particularly crucial in a pandemic in which tens of thousands of patients are descending into acute respiratory distress those icu units are much harder to cobble together quickly than standard hospital beds milan opened an intensive care field hospital tuesday at the city fairgrounds after the health situation turned dire in italy s lombardy region where bodies overflowed in morgues caskets piled up in churches and doctors were forced to decide which desperately ill patient would get a breathing machine we aren t happy to have done this fairgrounds head enrico pazzali said it s something i never would have wanted to do the pressure is easing on hard hit italian cities like bergamo and brescia as the rate of new infections slows yet many italians are still dying at home or in nursing homes because hospitals are saturated and they could not get access to icu ventilators with over 12 400 dead so far italy has the most coronavirus deaths of any nation the strain facing some of the world s best health care systems has been aggravated by hospital budget cuts over the past decade in italy spain france and britain they ve now called in medical students retired doctors and even laid off flight attendants with first aid certification to help fight the virus although all need re training the medical staffing shortage has been exacerbated by the high numbers of infected personnel in italy alone nearly 10 000 medical workers have been infected and more than 60 doctors have died while spain s confirmed infections shot past 102 000 wednesday and its deaths are now beyond 9 000 the increase in infections was less than the previous day offering some hope still covid 19 patients who need intensive care can occupy a bed for three to four weeks meaning nations will still see increasing pressures on their hospitals for days or weeks to come the paris region more than doubled its icu capacity over the past week but the beds are already full paris was sending critically ill patients to less saturated regions on special high speed trains wednesday others have been moved by military planes helicopters or warships one reason germany is in better shape than other european countries is its high proportion of icu beds at 33 9 per 100 000 people compared to 8 6 in italy germany has only 775 virus deaths 16 times fewer than italy britain still has some free icu beds available but the outbreak is likely weeks away from its peak there and the u k has one of the lowest number of hospital beds per capita in europe the new hospital inside london s excel center plans to admit its first patients this week but it will need thousands of doctors nurses and volunteers we re trying to get thousands of people into the bank and fill tens and tens of thousands of shifts said juliette cosgrove chief nurse of nhs professionals which is recruiting and training medical professionals and other support staff for most people the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough but for others especially older adults and people with health problems it can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia and lead to death u s health authorities warned the number of dead in america could reach up to 240 000 even with social distancing measures in place the new york region also rushed to set up extra hospital capacity at the mammoth javits convention center on a navy hospital ship and in the indoor tennis center that hosts the u s open i want every american to be prepared for the hard days that
