 charles babington sunday 02 november 2014 07 29 am all along the biggest question in this election was whether republicans could take over the senate and add it to their solid house majority republicans need to gain six net seats to do so three in states where democrats are retiring seem nearly certain west virginia montana and south dakota republicans chief targets elsewhere are democrats running for re election in states that president barack obama lost alaska louisiana arkansas and north carolina three other possibilities iowa s open seat and strong challenges to democratic senators in colorado and new hampshire give republicans multiple paths to a senate majority five things to watch on election night can democrats topple a gop giant in kentucky kentucky often an early reporting state has seen one of the year s most costly and fierce senate races from the start democrat alison lundergan grimes faced a steep climb in trying to unseat five term sen mitch mcconnell who hopes to become majority leader in january pundits like to cite mcconnell s relatively low popularity in kentucky but that ignores the extreme unlikeliness of grimes getting votes from conservatives who find mcconnell too accommodating and moderate obama lost kentucky by a whopping 23 percentage points a grimes victory would rank among the greatest upsets in modern politics what are signs of a strong republican night if republican nominees run ahead of expectations in virginia and new hampshire even if they lose it will be a bad sign for democrats elsewhere democratic sen mark warner of virginia is expected to cruise past republican ed gillespie if gillespie stays within say 5 or 6 percentage points it could suggest tepid support for democrats in new hampshire democrats have always assumed sen jeanne shaheen would hold off republican scott brown a former senator from massachusetts if brown keeps the race razor close it s a worrisome sign for democrats if brown defeats shaheen democrats can start packing their bags for the minority side of the aisle which way will north carolina tip north carolina is one of the nation s most closely divided states politically aside from indiana where obama hardly tried in 2012 it s the only state he won once and lost once fittingly the state s senate race has stayed relentlessly close first term democrat kay hagan proudly calls herself the senate s most middle of the road member she said her gop challenger thom tillis speaker of the state house led a conservative revolution that veered too far right for the centrist state this race may be too close for an early call tuesday night but both parties will watch intensely not only for the hagan tillis outcome but also for hints of where a moderating southern state might trend in the next presidential race can democrats grab georgia s gop seat without a runoff georgia democrat michelle nunn and republican david perdue have made a few rookie mistakes in vying for the seat that republican saxby chambliss is leaving but they ran well funded campaigns obama lost georgia by 7 percentage points and it s seen as a republican state that might reach toss up status in few years a nunn victory would vastly improve democrats hopes of keeping the senate majority a perdue win would let republicans sigh in relief but the results might not be known for two months with a third party candidate running a jan 6 runoff between nunn and perdue is possible if that runoff decides which party controls the senate georgia will see campaign spending like never before will senate control be in doubt for days or weeks even without a georgia runoff it s possible that senate control will be in doubt when most americans go to bed tuesday night a dec 6 runoff in louisiana seems likely the alaska race between democratic sen mark begich and republican dan sullivan could be so close that the final tally could arrive with the east coast s sunrise wednesday or even later late results from louisiana and alaska won t determine the senate s control however if republicans do well elsewhere assuming they don t lose in georgia kentucky or kansas republicans could secure the senate majority with three victories among these competitive states arkansas north carolina iowa colorado and new hampshire copyright 2020 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed newsmax comment policy keep discussions on topic avoid personal attacks and threats of any kind links will not be permitted newsmax moneynews newsmax health and independent american are registered trademarks of newsmax media inc newsmax tv and newsmax world are trademarks of newsmax media inc
