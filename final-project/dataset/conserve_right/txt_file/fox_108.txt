enforcement officials confirmed to fox news they have begun the removal process beginning with raids in new york and elsewhere begin videotape corke from coast to coast protests across america greeted

president every family that i spoke to told me that they were being well cared for different than some of the harsh rhetoric that we are from democrats on capitol hill corke this as president trump retreated from an effort to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census announcing in the rose garden a new strategy to find out who aposs in this country by using a broad spectrum of federal agency records trump we will utilize these vast federal databases to gain a full complete and accurate count of the noncitizen population corke this in a week that aposs all the president lose yet another cabinet member as labor secretary alex acosta stepped down over his past involvement in a highly controversial plea deal for financier jeffrey epstein who is now facing sex trafficking charges end videotape corke more ice protests are expected today around the country chris as raids get underway and about a dozen american cities chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thank you joining us now for an exclusive interview white house counselor kellyanne conway kellyanne welcome back to fox news sunday kellyanne conway white house counselor thank you chris wallace well you just heard the official news i aposm sure you already know it coming out of the white house that the raids have begun what can you tell us where are the raids taking place there was a potential population of a million people who are in the country illegally who have received orders to leave how many is ice going after conway i won apost discuss operational details and i would push back on even your terminology of raids ice does this every single day it aposs called enforcement actions law enforcement in this country enforces the law it aposs the tautological definition of their duties and this of course happened under president obama he was referred to as deporter in chief very harshly in 2012 and he pushed back on actually telemundo a spanish language station when they criticized him and he said they said you aposre deporting 184 000 quote noncriminal and he said i aposm not a king i have to enforce the law just this week you saw massive protests at joe biden aposs philadelphia headquarters his campaign headquarters and those people are angry that he was complicit in the obama biden deportation so this is a regular enforcement action let me make clear i agree with dhs secretary under president obama jeh johnson he says these are not extraordinary exercises when in fact as is the case here chris your appeals have been exhausted your rights have been adjudicated these are final removal orders for people who are here illegally and ice is going to do what they do every day which is go ahead and enforce the law i also have to say since ice is in the news in a different way right across there in the capital you have these radical democrats now calling for the elimination of ice they are ridiculing them mocking them doxxing them publishing asking people on twitter and elsewhere to publish their home addresses their contact information this is a disgrace you have some of the loudest mouths over there denying 4 6 billion in humanitarian aid all but four democrats voted for a form of that package all but 95 democrats voted for the actual 4 6 billion in aid they have no moral authority to then say let aposs eliminate all of dhs we aposd eliminate fema the people helping out the secret service ice customs and border protection i was at the border two days ago with the vice president and senators wallace i aposm going to get conway and those are brave men and women trying to do their job they aposre tired of being discriminated against by people in their perches here in washington wallace i aposm going to get to the visit to the border in a moment i want to ask you one more question about the ice actions i think the president may have called them raids i aposll have to check on that he certainly made a big deal about it what provisions are being made specifically about separating families especially the possibility of separating parents in this country illegally from children who may have been born in this country and therefore would be u s citizens and what is your pushback to local democratic officials who are openly advising people in this country illegally how to avoid getting rounded up by ice conway sure but actually that includes speaker pelosi who is telling people how to avoid ice enforcing the law in some places she should go spend a little bit more time in her hometown of san francisco where you now have more people are addicted to drugs than you have enrolled in the public schools i read in one report this morning so it aposs really outrageous for people who take the oath of office and are elected to uphold the law to then tell people how to flout and abuse and in fact evade the law that is not their job and that i mean look at what the upshot of that chris is you have people in rural colorado tearing down old glory tearing down the american flag and putting a mexican flag in its place these protesters at the ice facility they don apost deserve that and the people on capitol hill who won apost do their jobs i put it it made it so easy i aposve been talking about a for a long time but it made it easy for them fix flores fix asylum laws fix tvpra it aposs on an index card i actually put it on a post it for them to say it wallace ok let me ask about what about the family separation crosstalk conway they won apost act all they do is scream and scream so i aposm against separating families let me make that clear i think i was the first person in need administration to go on the show on sunday and say that i think you can enforce the law without separating families and i know firsthand had my boss and our president been told ahead of last year aposs zero tolerance policy by people who are no longer in the administration that the net effect of that would have separating children from their parents while the parents apos claims are being adjudicated the idea was to protect the child so the child is not crosstalk wallace i aposm not talk about that conway no i aposm talking about all of it wallace i aposm talking but today the possibility of parents who are in the country illegally being separated from the children what are going to do about that conway so i was briefed yesterday on this by the officials in ice and i will tell you that and dhs i will tell you that there aposs every measure taken to try to not separate families as the law allows and that aposs important if i were put in jail today my four children would not come with me nor would i want them to so we are often protecting the child as well from not being detained not being put in these circumstances let me make very clear i think there are ways to enforce the law without separating children young children from their parents i aposm against separating children from their mothers in the womb and i aposm against i aposm against separating children from their mothers outside of the womb wallace ok i want to get back to what you raised which is the trip to the border with vice president pence on friday eleven days ago president trump seemed to play down the problems that these detention centers i want to put up his tweets many of these illegals are living far better now than where they came from no matter how good things actually look even if perfect democrats will act shocked and aghast at how terrible things are how would you describe the conditions you saw on friday at the detention centers conway well two things and i was glad to make that trip because you can apost get the same vantage point and vista unless you aposre there first we went to the donna processing facility that is where this is all in texas chris that is where families are being held and they won apost be held for long you know under flores they won apost be held for long i witnessed no overcrowding the we had two senators there i was there with seven republican senators lindsey graham the chairman of the judiciary committee organized the codel i was part of that he invited all of the wallace i aposm to try to move you along conway no no he invited everybody but no democrat came which i think is a shame because all they have to do are the same things crosstalk wallace ok what aposs your view of mcallen conway here aposs my view wallace mcallen conway here aposs my view of what i saw i saw a lot of supplies i saw diapers i saw food i saw endless supplies of water two of those senators speak spanish fluently and were speaking with the migrants they won apost be there for long because under our law we can apost hold them and i think nobody really understands the tens of thousands of uacs unaccompanied children and family units that have been released into interior of the united states just this year but also what i saw is what happens when congress gets its act together passes humanitarian aid so now we have more money for consumables for transportation for processing and for housing crosstalk wallace the reason i want to ask conway and then i went over to these facilities with the men wallace i want to ask about that because this is what came out of the inspector general for the department of human services of homeland security they issued a report on july 2nd with this warning and i want to put it on the screen this is dhs inspector general management alert dhs needs to address dangerous overcrowding and prolong detention of children and adults in the rio grande valley i want to show because the reporters were able to take pictures of the mcallen texas center that you visited with the vice president they aposre up on the screen this was the full report almost 400 men were in caged fences with no cops the stench was horrendous some of the men were sleeping on concrete they began shouting and wanted to tell us they had been there 40 days or longer i understand conway i was right there wallace i understand that president trump is trying to stop the flood of people across the border which contributes conway also trying to accommodate those who are here wallace which contributes to the overcrowding but how does it help for the president to minimize the situation and say it aposs much beer than what they had or for vice president pence and kevin corke aposs piece to say they are all being well treated when your own i mean you can look at the conditions there it aposs a disaster conway well let me just say a couple things that are facts first of all not every facility is the same and so wallace but i aposm talking about that one conway ok well i aposm talking about the one of the media who were on the same trip is asked completely ignored in all of their coverage they aposre also completely ignoring the briefings they received from the brave customs and border protection folks wallace what to say about mcallen texas kellyanne conway what i would say is this that that facility was meant to be this is what i was briefed on that facility was meant to be a 72 hour holding facility it aposs not equipped to keep single males who have broken the law by coming here and were apprehended if you just want to let them go and then say that we aposre just for open borders let aposs all be honest at some of those democrats raising her hands wallace but does it help for the president to say the conditions are pretty good and for mike pence to say they are pretty good crosstalk conway in plenty of facilities they are they have improved including the one that we saw with the families i saw the house oversight committee tweeted out a picture crosstalk wallace the mistreatment of these people conway under obama biden and jeh johnson wallace shouldn apost we be judged on that conway oh yes and let me explain to you i want people treated humanely that aposs why when i received a briefing with the senators and the vice president with the media in the room but they didn apost publish any of this as far as i can see those men get three hot meals from local restaurants they now have access to showers there were no shower facilities there to accommodate that many people in the past but there are now there aposs a bank of showers in the back they have access to deodorant they have to access to hygienic products they have access to toothbrushes and so we don apost want that but that aposs why we also don apost want people to come here illegally and i would again quote the words of president obama he thinks that having the ice enforcement action was quote a deterrent from other people coming here wallace ok conway you know listen we are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants come here legally wallace i aposve got one last question for you excuse me you know we got to try to cover the news and we aposre going to get way over the congressional hearings with former special counsel robert mueller was supposed to happen this wednesday they have been delayed to the following wednesday july 24th on friday president trump said democrats are just playing politics take a look begin video clip trump how many bites of the apple do you get we aposve gone through 500 witnesses 2 500 subpoenas i aposve let them interview my lawyers i aposve let them in because i had nothing to do with russia now that aposs come out there was no collusion end video clip wallace does the president think that congress has a legitimate oversight role as part of its constitutional function and what does he hope and i you aposve got less than a minute for this what does he hope comes out of the mueller hearings conway i expect that very little will come out because director mueller himself said that his report is his testimony and he told the whole country within the last six to eight weeks that he aposs retiring to private sector this is over and he has nothing further to add now they are subpoenaing him they aposll have him go republicans and democrat were both pleased with the delay it allows an additional hour for questioning but that means republicans will be able to question also confirming under oath with director mueller did you issue 2 800 subpoenas more than 500 witnesses how much did this cost to taxpayers the mueller report was presented before people didn apost like what was in it that it was going to be the definitive authoritative final word on this investigation about russia collusion in a campaign that i ran to successful conclusion nobody aposs ever apologized us they should apologize to the taxpayers for wasting money sure oversight oversight has a function but i think americans are watching the wasted taxpayer dollars wallace ok conway with a bunch of comb over is doing a big do over that we don apost need wallace okay comb overs and do overs conway sure wallace that aposs pretty good conway some were wallace just another morning with kellyanne conway conway by the way it aposs on a post it all congress has to do it aposs a post it you fix flores you fix tvpra fix our asylum laws and wallace kellyanne thank you thanks for your time crosstalk wallace we aposll continue this in the post show show always good to talk with you conway thanks chris wallace up next house democrats battling with the president and each other one of their leaders assistant speaker ben ray lujan joins us next commercial break wallace house democrats have made a lot of news this week hammering the president aposs immigration policy delaying the robert mueller hearings and breaking into open warfare inside their own party joining us exclusively here in washington assistant house speaker ben ray lujan who is the highest ranking hispanic in congress and congressman welcome back to fox news sunday rep ben ray lujan d n m good to be with you again chris wallace well you just heard kellyanne conway say that these raids that have now started the ice raids she doesn apost like to call them raids are a normal enforcement effort they are for people who entered this country illegally and have been ordered by the administrative process to leave the country they aposve gotten a deportation order they aposve had their day in court as she points out president obama did it why can apost president trump lujan well chris just as congressional hispanic caucus and members of the democratic membership have been saying all along is we would just want the president to simply use his time to go after criminals and felons not children and families and that aposs the concern that many of us have many american born children are terrified that they may come home from church today or if they go to school tomorrow that they come home from school and their parents are gone wallace in fairness their parents did come illegally and have gone through a process and they aposve received a final deportation order lujan but again the president should be using his time to go for the criminals on the felons as opposed to the children and the families and that aposs what we aposre talking about here i aposm terrified as to the fear that the president is instilling in families the impact that this is going to have on small businesses across america people whose only decision may have been to come to the country and the way that they did but are working in restaurants as chefs they are teaching our kids in schools they aposre serving in our military defending the united states of america i think that the president should concentrate his time on the criminals not on those families wallace i want to switch to a related subject democrats celebrated when president trump decided he was not going to try to push to have a question on the census about whether or not people are citizens but here aposs how the president described your party aposs opposition to that question begin video clip trump they probably know the number is far greater much higher than anyone would have ever believed before maybe that aposs why they fight so hard end video clip wallace question why is it wrong in a national census accounting of all the people in the country to ask are you a citizen or aren apost you lujan chris i believe that the founding fathers envisioned getting an accurate count of everyone that aposs in america and there should not be questions being put on this information gathering initiative that aposs going to discourage people from answering their doors to answer that very question and the concerns that many people have or most people have not just democrats but republicans especially coming off the u s supreme court aposs decision that gerrymandering is allowed based on partisanship advantage is president trump recently even admitted that the reason for him gathering this information was for partisan gerrymandering but also to cut programs from communities and so if our republican colleagues want to cut access to food programs school programs housing programs they should just put their vote up or down on the house floor and the senate floor as opposed to trying to hide what they aposre trying to get done wallace let aposs talk about the delay in the robert mueller hearings as i discussed with kellyanne conway from this wednesday july 17th to the following wednesday july 24th that will only be two days before congress leaves washington for six weeks for the august recess isn apost that going to make it pretty darn hard for democrats to build on anything that robert mueller should say i mean one of the points here was to try to build momentum to pursue the president in whatever he did or didn apost do but if you have this big hearing and then you leave two days later for a month and a half what does that accomplish lujan while i support the work of chairman nadler and the members of the judiciary committee the special counsel and his report are only one part of this now i want to encourage everyone across america to read the report make sure you get your eyes on those 438 pages but also to tune in because the special counsel will be answering questions associated with what aposs in that report and i want to make sure the american people tune in but chris make no mistake there are many other investigations that are being looked into the importance of understanding the allegations associated with tax evasion with money laundering as well the importance of getting financial documents from deutsche bank or even understanding the president aposs tax returns even those that have been made available at the local level in new york even so look there are many areas that have to be looked into this is one area and two days of important tuning in by the american people into the questioning that will be taking place wallace tensions inside the house democratic caucus went very public this week speaker pelosi dismissed these four freshman congresswomen who are the so called squad this way all these people have their public whatever this is pelosi talking about the squad all these people have their public whatever and their twitter world but they didn apost have any following alexandria ocasio cortez responded the persistent singling out it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color is speaker pelosi losing control of the democratic caucus lujan chris look i aposm always a believer that well the answer to that question is no second i aposve always been a believer that when you have disagreements with your colleagues you have a conversation with them you sit down you talk i mean that aposs what we should be doing wallace but you didn apost have that i mean you had nancy pelosi dissing the squad i can apost believe this sounds like high school dissing the squad in a maureen dowd column in the new york times and then you had aoc firing back in an interview in the washington post they aposre not sitting down and talking lujan well this week the speaker was very clear that if numbers apos of a difference of opinion or if they had questions of even the speaker that they should take the time to sit down and talk and that aposs been my approach all along i think it aposs something that i aposve learned from predecessors and even my colleagues and even speaker pelosi and look as a person of color as the highest ranking hispanic in the congress i can tell you that nancy pelosi has lifted up my voice to make sure that i aposve had opportunities and that my voice has been heard as well and i continue to look towards her leadership for the good of the country wallace you talk about doing this quietly doing it in private as a family friday night your house democratic caucus issued a tweet a public tweet couldn apost have gone more public going after aoc aposs chief of staff i want to put this up he had attacked the chief of staff had attacked a democratic congressman for quote enabling racism here was a tweet from the official democratic caucus keep your name out of your mouth so much for in house talking are some members honestly are some members of your caucus losing patience with aoc and some of the other freshmen shooting inside the tent lujan well first saying those things about congresswoman sharice davids is absolutely wrong as the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee i got to know sharice i actually had a big role to play in that important race where sharice won and flipped this important district as well but again i aposm of the approach that you need to sit down and have a conversation and bring people into that room to do that i think that this week and into next week you aposre going to hear more from our democratic colleagues about the importance of that but again the tone of what was included in that specific message to sharice davids a congresswoman from kansas was wrong it aposs something i did not support wallace i finally i want to talk the president surprise has been tweeting this morning and i want to put up a tweet because he specifically has been calling out progressive democratic congresswoman who come originally from countries his words whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe and he says this why don apost they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came then come back and show us how it is done your thoughts about president trump saying to duly elected members of congress go back to your homes lujan chris that that aposs the first i aposm hearing of that that aposs a racist tweet telling people to go back where they came from these are american citizens elected by voters in the united states of america to serve in one of the most distinguished bodies in the u s house of representatives i think that aposs wrong and especially with all that aposs going on across america for the president to spend time saying such racist things this morning it sounds like wallace yes lujan look the horrendous detention facilities that we have across the country that vice president pence brought attention to that even he said smelled horrendous that the inspector general has called out that the commissioner on human rights from the u n has said these facilities are in horrendous condition the price of insulin which has increased over a thousand percent wallace right lujan that aposs what the president should have his attention on not picking these fights and especially sending out racist tweets wallace congressman lujan thank you thanks for sharing part of your weekend with us please come back sir lujan i look forward to it sir wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the ice raids and the president aposs change of course in trying to find out if people in this country are u s citizens commercial break wallace coming up president trump says he aposll find ways other than a census question to count whether people in this country are citizens begin video clip trump we have great knowledge in many of our agencies we will leave no stone unturned end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the administration aposs new strategy next commercial break begin video clip trump we are really specifically looking for bad players but we aposre also looking for people that came into our country not through a process they just walked over a line they have to leave end video clip wallace president trump defending ice raids that have started today to round up immigrants with orders to leave the country and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz columnist for the hill juan williams director of the woodrow wilson center former congresswoman jane harman and senator mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff josh holmes well congressman chaffetz let me start with you any problem with these ice raids which as kellyanne pointed out these are people who are in the country illegally who have been through the process and have received a final deportation order jason chaffetz contributor i don apost like the advance notice i want ice to be able to do this on a regular basis and i would hope that the locals would actually cooperate because these are people wallace but they aposre not doing that chaffetz they aposre not they aposre not cooperating they aposre wallace they aposre they aposre they aposre they aposre actually telling people how to avoid getting rounded up by ice chaffetz where are the democrats on this how in the world when you aposve gone through the final adjudication and a judge has ordered you to depart the country how can we not all be united in say then you have to leave we aposre not a nation where you just ignore a judge aposs order but that aposs the position democrats are taking and it is fundamentally wrong wallace well we happen to have a democrat and a former congresswoman here jane harman i mean it is a fact whether it aposs nancy pelosi whether it aposs the new democratic mayor of chicago there are a lot of democratic officials who not only have said these raids are wrong but have openly advised people who fall into this category how to avoid getting picked up jane harman director wilson center well first let me applaud what kellyanne conway said about the use of the term raid which is unnecessary and she also said family separations are bad so good for her i don apost think it aposs a binary choice between enforcing the border which i am for i aposm a democrat i aposm for it and humane conditions which we don apost have i mean why not plan better for this administration is doing quite well wallace but i aposm asking about these ice enforcement harman i know but i aposm about to say this is doing quite well with the floods in louisiana and and mississippi good for them they can do this so you aposre asking me about enforcement actions i think it aposs fine to do proper enforcement actions but have a process that is humane to people seeing those men stand up in the smelly quarters that we just saw and that vice president pence saw and said this is rough this is not acceptable congress has provided money that money should be used before this happens which is what senior dhs staff recommended also we should be doing more to shore up the governments of the northern triangle something vice president prince was for a couple years ago so that the push factor is reduced and we should be helping mexico not just forcing mexico helping mexico police at the southern border the flow of immigrants there are lots of things we could do better and let aposs do them and enforce the law and have a secure border chaffetz deport the people that a judge has ordered to leave the country harman fine do it according to a humane process chaffetz but don apost work against right don apost work against ice and make their job and put their lives in danger harman i i chaffetz that aposs what democrats are doing harman well some democrats are doing it this democrat thinks that ice has a responsibility to carry out the law but it should be done humanely wallace let aposs talk about another issue and that is the census which got a lot of attention the president seemed to flip on the census he had been pushing very hard to put a question on the census questionnaire are you or are you not a citizen he backed off that here was mr trump aposs defense begin video clip trump not only didn apost i back down i backed up because anybody else would have given this up a long time ago end video clip wallace josh did the president back down did he cave which is what a lot of his conservative supporters that he did josh holmes founder cavalry well in terms of what he aposs trying to accomplish he didn apost cave because he aposs not going through the departments to try to gather this information from a separate process wallace which incidentally was suggested over a year ago and he turned down at that time holmes sure i i think his hands were tied because obviously the conducting of the census itself requires this questionnaire to be out there and to begin almost immediately if you aposre going to have to get this in place to actually count the citizens we know that no matter what he would do if he tried to put a question on that questionnaire it would have been locked up in court for months so in order to do the the census itself he had to he had to do this one thing i think he did succeed on which i i i find it amazing how every time he does this he was able to get the entirety of the democratic party to somehow take the position that it is irresponsible and inappropriate to count the number of americans living in this country i don apost know how he does it but literally almost every time he takes a position he gets his political opposition to to embrace a position that is so far out of the mainstream of the american electorate it aposs almost laughable wallace well let me you you look troubled about this juan i mean the fact is juan williams political analyst i am i am baffled by what josh just said wallace well no no but but i mean i just talked to congressman lujan williams yes wallace the top hispanic in the the congress and he seems to think that there aposs something wrong with asking a question on the census are you a citizen or not i think to most americans that seems like a pretty reasonable question williams well first to josh aposs point i think everybody wants everyone to be counted that aposs the point not to intimidate or scare people who are here undocumented on an undocumented status that they aposre not counted what the constitution what the founders said was an enumeration of the population that aposs everyone but i think what we know is wallace but is it is it unreasonable to as part of that williams it aposs not un wallace i mean wait they they we ask a lot of questions in the census williams sure wallace about race williams sure wallace about about income about gender what aposs wrong with asking citizenship williams nothing in fact it aposs on the long form what we aposre talking about is the short wallace no it isn apost no it isn apost on the long form williams yes it aposs on the long form i think there have been historically there has been in the past a question about wallace there there is one for the when it goes up to 3 million people right williams thank you that aposs what i aposm talking about wallace yes ok williams ok so but on the short form not and i think this is an effort by this president and his administration as part of stirring anti immigrant fervor to say to the immigrant population don apost participate if you participate there aposs a risk to you to your family nancy pelosi said this week this is an effort to make america white again i think that aposs what aposs going on because we know that republican operatives wanted to depress this count in order to limit congressional districts that were run by democrats and the supreme court said the wallace let well let let let me bring josh back in williams the commerce department aposs rationale of doing this was contrived wallace no they holmes it aposs juan i think it is beyond irresponsible to suggest the asking of whether or not you are an american citizen is somehow racist and has roots in trying to exclude people of color from this country williams well you should look at the documentation put out by republicans that said just that josh holmes no it look this is a pretty straightforward issue and my point was it is amazing how this president can get folks juan like you who are eminently reasonable on a whole range of issues to embrace a embrace a discussion that actively says we should not know how many americans live in this country that is wild ph williams no i want everybody i want everybody counted so i want not only americans every because what the constitution and the census is about is how many people live here harman the supreme court didn apost say never the supreme court said the way this was being handled was contrived holmes that aposs right harman there will be a chance if the trump administration wants to handle it responsibly for them to come back in ten years oh my god not trump will be president but for people who want to do this to come back in ten years and do this responsibly if if there aposs a good goal in mind holmes and i and i harman no one is saying it is terrible to know who aposs a citizen and the president aposs executive order directing something that was happening that aposs been happening for a year which is having the departments collect information or share information they already have on who the citizens are is is a valid order williams that was a face saving maneuver by a president who folded wallace ok i aposm glad we settled that all right panel we have to take a break here when we come back race what we aposre talking about becomes the new flashpoint as nancy pelosi struggles to control her caucus amid a feud with freshman progressives like alexandria ocasio cortez commercial break begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif house speaker an offensive tweet that came out of one of the members offenses that references our blue dogs and our new dems essentially as segregationist manu raju cnn senior congressional correspondent do you think she has racial animus is she a racist rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y no no absolutely not end video clip wallace house speaker nancy pelosi trying to move on from a public feud with freshman congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez and other progressives in her own party and we aposre back now with the panel well congresswoman harman i think it aposs fair to say you had your own problems with nancy pelosi when you were in congress has she finally met her match with aoc harman well let aposs separate pelosi one and pelosi two i was in pelosi one and yes i wallace her first time as speaker harman that aposs right and yes i think she should have been much more tolerant of people who were blue dogs that would be me and people who were staunchly bipartisan that would also be me i was disappointed not to become chair of the house intelligence committee no one missed that but then she lost the majority in 2010 and who lost the people in the center i i won actually but a lot of people lost in in pelosi the sequel i think she aposs much more cognizant of the need to build the broader tent i actually think the squad whom i don apost know bring a lot of energy and creativity to the caucus and i think the challenge is not to dismiss them but to embrace some of their ideas some from the center and and the blue dogs and really build not just a bigger tent in terms of people getting along but in terms of a showcase of ideas if she can do that she aposs keep the majority which will be a gigantic legacy for the only person who happens to be a woman who has been elected to a complete second tour as speaker and i think she might be able to pull it off wallace josh things are much more orderly in the senate than they are in that unruly lower chamber as it aposs known the house what do you think aposs going on with the house democrats holmes well i mean for those of us who have watched nancy pelosi aposs leadership over the last ten years and and and really democratic leadership in general i think they aposve been very reckless at accusations of racism for a long time now so it aposs really difficult for a lot of us to shed a tear about watching them reap what they sow with aoc and the rest of them in this latest clash i will say it she is in a more tenuous position than john boehner ever was and wallace she pelosi holmes she pelosi and and i think wallace why be i aposm a little surprised you say that because the house freedom caucus had a lot more members than the squad does i love the squad we aposre going to make it aposs the squad holmes the squad it aposs the squad from here on out wallace yes holmes the first opportunity that they had in a legislative function to sort of show these rifts is right before the fourth of july and i think if you back up and look at the timeline in 2010 for when john boehner aposs problems started these are accelerated these are much much quicker in a much much more aggressive way and personal way that house republicans ever were at that stage what is equally hard for me to figure out is how she can ever repair it i mean we aposre talking about extreme differences that are manifesting themselves on the national stage in extremely personal attacks with two sides of the conference never the two shall meet and so the governing at this stage looks to me to be very very difficult wallace all right i aposm going to turn to another subject we were gearing up this week for the big hearings with robert mueller this wednesday july 17th all day coverage on fox and then they were delayed to july 24th a week from wednesday here aposs one of the house democratic leaders david cicilline on the muller hearings begin video clip rep david cicilline d r i it aposs very important that the american people have the opportunity to hear from robert mueller that he have the opportunity to convey to the american people all the evidence he collected end video clip wallace juan one what do you make of the delay and two the same question i asked congressman lujan with the delay the hearings are now going to be on wednesday and two days later congress leaves for six weeks doesn apost whatever if there are is anything that they can build on doesn apost that really end the momentum on that williams i don apost think it ends the momentum in fact i think the entire intent of this given that mr mueller has made it very clear that he issued his report he aposs not going to say much beyond the report is to give the american people from the democrats apos perspective a chance to hear what mueller has said and i think a lot of people didn apost read the report and so for them to have televised coverage of robert mueller sitting there saying what his findings were not listening to the attorney general bill barr spin it but actually get to the point and the largest point would be the criminal process is not the place to go after this president we should go after non criminal and that means guess what impeachment wallace i understand that but then to have everybody leave town for six weeks williams well i don apost think it aposs going to stop this argument over russian interference and over the participation of this trump campaign with that russian interference and whether or not there was any effort to obstruct the mueller investigation i don apost think that aposs going away in six weeks wallace congressman chaffetz mueller has made it very clear he is a reluctant witness he does not want to do this he aposs also made it very clear he is going to stick to what was written by him and his team in the 448 page report what are the chances these big hearings turn out to be a dud chaffetz i think highly likely first of all i think there aposs still about a 50 50 shot as to whether or not we actually even have the hearing i mean you had the attorney general say out loud that he would support mueller should he decide not to attend i think mueller aposs concerned about his long term presence and tenure and he doesn apost want to go out having you know ignored a subpoena but at the same time he has nothing new to say other than what republicans are going to ask him about all the things that mueller didn apost do so democrats they can apost seem to put this hearing together it aposs been a couple of months now since the report initially came out that should be their first clue that hey this thing is not going well they the democrats just seem to want to have it read aloud because they aposre frustrated that oh my gosh how come nobody aposs listening over here because there aposs nothing in there that aposs going to prosecute anybody in the trump orbit in any way shape or form that thing is over wallace congresswoman harman harman you know what is it aposs a teachable moment for everyone not just democrats there will be three hours of judiciary committee hearings two hours of intelligence committee hearings all public and if the members on both sides ask serious questions i think we aposll all chaffetz oh come on when aposs the last time congress asked serious questions harman i you know actually chaffetz they that is going to show the bumbling idiots that are on that committee that are going to show that they have nothing else to do except re read a report they aposve had for a couple of years or for a couple of months harman i i i wrong ph there there aposs always hope there is always hope i live in hope and i think congress could have a really good day on the 24th williams i would say this i just i worry that what mr chaffetz just said is absolutely right that you aposre going to see now an effort by the white house the president describing this as democrats seeing another bite of the apple to discourage mueller from ever testifying and we know that the justice department has stopped two of mueller aposs top aides from testifying so i and and they aposre going to go after the credibility oh why did this investigation start it was based on phony documents harman yes chaffetz your right harman but chaffetz and that is where they aposre going to go williams that aposs why were chaffetz that aposs absolutely right that is what aposs going to happen harman let holmes i think we can all agree it aposs a wonderful opportunity to congress harman yes holmes for congress to humiliate itself once again harman oh williams oh harman you aposre all pessimists wallace well and the other thing which i have to say i find discouraging is in fact that instead of giving all of their time to the chairman or one member or to a staff member and let him for an hour and a half talk they aposre going to each get there five minutes and that means no consistent questions thank you panel that aposs my comment see you next sunday up next our power player of the week an inside look at one of washington aposs most prestigious and most private homes commercial break wallace there are some landmarks in washington people rarely get to go inside and last fall we got to wondering about one
