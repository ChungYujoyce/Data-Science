clinton s private email server anyone who counted donald trump out before the second presidential debate in st louis doesn t know trump sunday night they got a lesson to put it simply trump owned the debate at washington university he was in command he was in rare form he crushed it trump has nine lives he s like freddie kruger in nightmare on elm street you can t kill him i mean politically of course you can t stop him or slow him or beat him down he just keeps popping back up he is relentless like trump i pride myself as always telling the raw truth i ve been a trump supporter from the beginning literally i wrote the case for trump winning the election back in june 2015 right here at fox news opinion on the day he declared for president i ll always be in trump s corner but in the first debate trump was mediocre low energy unprepared and played ondefense most of the night the polls reflected his lackluster performance then came the release of trump s secretly recorded tape it has been an unimaginable 48 hours since it was made public on friday trump was counted out many gop leaders demanded that trump step down trump was expected by political experts to step down trump certainly lost all his credibility and support or so the experts thought in 48 hours donald trump went from a near death experience hanging by a thread losing the support of almost every elected gop politician to king of the hill i fielded dozens of gloating calls from my liberal friends they all believed trump was finished they were congratulating their candidate hillary as if she had already won this is what i call premature prognostication trump was even abandoned by his own party many in the gop leadership and establishment politicians turned against trump in the past 48 hours to them trump was over history an embarrassment a short term blip on the american political timeline they all misjudged they disregarded the one rule all of us who know trump understand never count trump out trump lost none of his loyal base the latest poll after the infamous tape by politico morning consult showed trump didn t lose any of his base yes he lost the establishment politicians but not the people who love and support him perhaps they forgot it s the people who elect the president not the washington establishment sunday night trump was the comeback kid he was strong confident high energy credible prepared colorful and on the offensive most of the night against hillary and the moderators he even pulled a page from ronald reagan s book yes trump was funny what people remember from these debates is who was in control who looked confident who had one or two memorable lines trump won on all three counts when hillary said she was glad people like trump don t run the country trump s response was the line of the night that s because you d be in prison when hillary tried to compare herself to abraham lincoln to explain why she has both a public and private answer to each question trump subtly made the point that hillary is no honest abe trump s promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate hillary if he s elected president was the memorable moment of the night most importantly trump made the point throughout the night that we cannot trust hillary s judgment trump made it clear that whether it is obamacare or jobs or foreign policy hillary always talks big but does nothing and when she actually does do something she makes all the wrong decisions see libya syria the arab spring sunday night trump shocked the political establishment the liberal world even the gop establishment in 48 hours he went from a near death experience hanging by a thread losing the support of almost every elected gop politician to king of the hill by the way trump also proved on sunday night that he s the anti romney mitt romney blew an election that was handed to him wrapped in a bow he performed best at the beginning when it mattered least he choked in the clutch when it mattered most he won the first presidential debate the one everyone has long forgotten by the last debate he went all downhill after that trump understands the importance of the moment trump was mediocre in the first debate but he crushed it in the second debate when he needed it most i apos m betting his best performance yet will come in the third presidential debate in my hometown las vegas vegas is where all showman come to shine trump was counted out by everyone it seemed but me because i know donald trump he is the guy you always bat in the cleanup position he s always best under pressure he always shines at the important moments in life he hits home runs when they are most needed with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth inning that s why i believe donald j trump will be the next president of the united states get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week subscribed you ve successfully subscribed to this newsletter this material
