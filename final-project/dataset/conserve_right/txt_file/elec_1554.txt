candidates getting supporters to the polls voters likely will hear a familiar refrain tuesday night as the election returns stream in too close to call from alaska to iowa to florida and virtually everywhere in between a surprising number of congressional and gubernatorial candidates are locked in tight races on election day the battle for the senate boils down to a referendum on president obama apos s final two years in office which could be decided in roughly 10 toss up or battleground races though a few others could yet surprise when the ballots are in and at the state level nearly a dozen governors are at risk of losing their seats a volatile landscape not seen in decades turnout is key for both parties especially democrats as they battle historical midterm headwinds that typically punish whichever party holds the white house polling consistently has shown gop voters are more enthusiastic about this year apos s elections suggesting an edge in turnout but democrats
