tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion potential is probably the wrong word to use when president trump tries to coax north korean dictator kim jong un to trade nuclear arms for investment he rhapsodizes often about the great potential that he sees in north korea ever a real estate guy the president seems particularly fond of north korea s shoreline but to say someone has great potential is to imply they re not living up to it that almost certainly is perceived as an insult by the north korean regime whose propaganda bangs on incessantly about the inherent superiority of its system is the potential insult the reason that talks between the president and mr kim collapsed in hanoi certainly not exclusively contrary to john f kennedy s quote failure has many many fathers but whatever the reasons behind the abrupt end to the kim trump beautiful friendship there will be widespread collateral damage beyond the two principals involved the most obvious loser is south korean president moon jae in mr moon a thoroughgoing leftist presiding over a stagnating economy that is hammering his poll ratings has staked his presidency on increased integration between the two koreas indeed it was his administration that midwifed the first summit between mr trump and mr kim but now mr moon s plans for further economic cooperation with the kim regime will be stymied by the international sanctions that look set to stay in place for the foreseeable future the collapse of the talks also will call into question whether a scheduled visit to seoul by kim jong un will go forward that visit was to be a crowning achievement in mr moon s engagement strategy top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender the government of vietnam the summit s enthusiastic host also will be disappointed so too will moscow which would like an end to sanctions on north korea but the biggest loser of all may have been china beijing irritated by the nuclear armed regime on its eastern border while it simultaneously works to manage threats on its restive western edge clearly wanted this summit to succeed consider the extraordinary measures it took to foster mr kim s train journey to vietnam for 60 hours mr kim rode the chinese rails this was a significant undertaking wreaking havoc on china s extensive railroad network which millions of people use every day the security investment on the part of the chinese must have been tremendous the investment in internet security certainly was chinese censors worked overtime deleting any references to mr kim s magical mystery tour lest anyone figure out where he was at any given time this shows if nothing else that beijing really really wanted mr kim to make a deal it s also telling that immediately after the collapse of the talks members of mr kim s entourage immediately flew to beijing it was as if they had been summoned but perhaps even more upsetting to beijing than the collapse of the talks themselves will be what mr trump s behavior says about his negotiating style washington and beijing are in the midst of heated trade negotiations after all and on a recent visit to beijing people i met were positively rubbing their hands in anticipation of what they expected to be a forthcoming trump cave in on various sticky trade issues notably forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft but now mr trump has shown he s willing to walk away from a deal that he perceives as bad this will cause no small amount of heartburn in beijing the potentials for china suddenly just got a lot worse ethan epstein is deputy opinion editor of the washington times contact him at emailprotected or on twitter ethane
