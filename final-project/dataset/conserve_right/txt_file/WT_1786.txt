a administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump on tuesday met coronavirus survivors who counted their blessings and thanked the president for pushing an investigational drug for the virus though scientists say it could be a tough road to full recovery for many patients who make it through a nasty bout of the new disease even the people with success stories who trekked to the white house said they weren t fully fit with one former nfl player complaining of diminished lung capacity and one arkansas woman saying she tested negative five days ago but is still only 85 well stay away from me please mr trump said to laughter in the cabinet room top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens much of the public focus on covid 19 has been on the awful death toll and the frantic scramble to test for the virus and provide acute care but 465 000 people have officially recovered from covid 19 worldwide including more than 45 000 in the u s according to a johns hopkins university tracker for these survivors there s the upside of full or partial immunity to future infection yet patients who have made it out alive are writing op eds and twitter posts that suggest the road back to health is a rocky one fraught with breathing problems anxiety and a struggle to regain their senses of smell and taste the pandemic could cause lifelong problems for those were vulnerable from the start it s not fun being in an intensive care unit you lose muscle mass said dr william schaffner an infectious disease specialist at vanderbilt university there are people particularly older people or those who are particularly frail who may not ever make it back to that same level of function of daily living in our society while covid 19 is new the disease can lead to a well documented condition known as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards we know a lot about the outcomes from that particular syndrome which can be caused by covid 19 said dr russell buhr a pulmonary and critical care doctor at ucla health we know the long term survival from that can be lower about 3 to 10 of covid 19 patients appear to develop the syndrome as the virus causes a profound immune response resulting in damaging inflammation typically about half of those who develop ards from any cause survive but those people often require longer hospital stays or supplemental oxygen or even become candidates for lung transplants it s not just the lungs either viral infections can attack muscle cells in the heart resulting in damaging inflammation a recent study of blood tests among 34 patients in wuhan china where the pandemic started found evidence that the new coronavirus attacks the liver muscles the gastrointestinal tract and lymph nodes even among patients who survived were discharged and tested negative twice there were signs that certain physiological measures had failed to return to normal compared to healthy volunteers in the study this finding indicates that these discharged patients regardless of the severity of their previous symptoms had not been fully recovered from the disease in the aspect of metabolism particularly liver function the authors said those patients will still need better nutrition and care that would be very helpful for their faster and full recovery from the disease the new coronavirus has genetic similarities to the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak that devastated parts of asia in 2002 2003 experts say the research may offer clues to the post covid 19 world a study from 2009 found that nearly a quarter of former sars patients had problems with lung capacity well after they got sick exercise capacity and health status were markedly lower than the general population at one year after illness onset according to the research fund for the control of infectious diseases in hong kong covid 19 survivors struggle to get back to 100 will be a factor that business owners and policymakers will confront as they try to get life back to normal it s not as simple as just trying to get people back to work quickly you have to account for people who ve gotten sick trying to get them back to work is going to be a challenge too dr buhr said a recent new york times op ed by fiona lowenstein a writer producer and yoga teacher says that s already a problem for those locked in the unseen struggle to recover some of the young people in my online support group are struggling to get more time off from work they are after all supposedly recovered she wrote almost all are experiencing mental health problems including severe anxiety panic attacks and depression as they struggle to understand what s next for them in addition to the physical symptoms that still keep me up at night i have frequent nightmares in which i am once again gasping for breath she wrote that the news is filled with uplifting stories of patients who have survived covid 19 including my own but rarely do these narratives cover the long and jagged road to recovery that follows mr trump asked his guests tuesday whether they felt back up to speed and while many did ex nfl tight end mark campbell said he s still about 95 the only thing is my lung capacity isn t quite where it was mr campbell said saying it is harder to go for a jog mr campbell and democratic state rep karen whitsett of michigan both said they recovered after taking hydroxychloroquine a malaria drug that mr trump has promoted as a potential game changer in the covid 19 fight had you not brought this to the forefront i wouldn t be here today to even have this conversation with you and talk about the needs of detroit and talk about the people who really need this mrs whitsett said mr trump who won michigan in 2016 and is hoping to nab the state in november joked there may be a political upside to the legislator s story i don t see her voting for sleepy joe biden mr trump said medical experts have said they would like to see more clinical trials of the drug to understand its impact on covid 19 and possible side effects before declaring it a success story hydroxychloroquine is part of a long list of investigation drugs being used across the country mr trump also has cited one by gilead sciences remdesivir as a promising treatment to get patients out of the hospital and back to full health there s a lot of science happening right now dr buhr said a lot of studies on treatment and outcomes and we re going to know a lot more a few months from now just like we know a lot mor
