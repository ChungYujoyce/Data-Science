tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap the fight over president donald trump s u s mexico border wall is heading to the gop controlled senate putting republicans in the uncomfortable spot of deciding whether to back his declaration of a national emergency enough republicans are chewing over whether to support trump s plan to create suspense about the vote and how the issue will play in the 2020 elections their objections range from constitutional to pragmatic with many seeing trump s plan as a slap at congress control over federal spending sixteen states have

hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk here are some senators to watch as the debate unfolds first what s a resolution of disapproval in this case it s an official one sentence statement that says trump s emergency declaration is hereby terminated the resolution is almost certain to pass the democratic controlled house which is expected to vote tuesday if it also survives the senate trump would be expected to veto it congress is not expected to muster the two thirds majority to override a veto which means the republican president s declaration could move forward but no president wants a rebuke from his own party the math the senate is controlled by a 53 47 republican majority so it would take four republicans voting with every democrat to pass the measure and send it to trump more than four have voiced significant discomfort with trump s move the moderates they re two republican women trump hasn t been able to count on voting with him and they say the situation at the border does not merit the wall that trump is demanding sen susan collins of maine who is up for re election in 2020 this week became the first republican to publicly state that she would support the effort to stop the emergency declaration that trump says is appropriate to secure the border i don t think that is what the law was intended for collins said it was intended for catastrophic events such as the attacks on our

doesn t like trump s emergency declaration the constitution grants congress the authority to appropriate federal dollars grassley said pointedly in a statement he has not said how he d vote on the resolution for disapproval but frowning on the president s declaration could send a signal to less senior senators on the fence conservatism and precedent sen mike lee r utah says trump s declaration is probably legal but whether or not it should be legal is a different matter congress has been ceding far too much power to the executive branch for decades lee said in a statement we should use this moment as an opportunity to start taking that power back lee has not said how he d vote on trump s declaration but he has recent history of bucking trump over ending military assistance to saudi arabia in yemen s civil war the candidates the 2020 elections loom and not just for the presidency twenty two republican held senate seats are on the ballot including some targeted by democrats among

trump over the emergency declaration was so striking it wouldn t provide enough funding to adequately secure our borders tillis said i don t believe a national emergency declaration is the solution he
