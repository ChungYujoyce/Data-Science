apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic florida gov ron desantis on wednesday ordered his state s 21 million residents to stay home for 30 days retreating from piecemeal efforts to thwart the coronavirus after the white house called for a national pause and scientists warned of flare ups outside of the new york epicenter mr desantis a republican who speaks to president trump often had resisted a statewide order even as florida cases roughly doubled in recent days to nearly 7 000 and experts warned that miami and other places could be slammed by the disease mr desantis justified the delay by noting broward and miami dade counties accounted for the majority of florida cases while other parts of the state experienced low transmission but he changed his mind after mr trump decided to extend social distancing guidelines until april 30 top stories ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey people aren t going to just go back to work mr desantis said that s a national pause button the governor s political rivals said the statewide order is the right move though a belated one after scenes of spring breakers clogging florida beaches caused a national uproar in mid march it is distressing that governor ron desantis waited until the coronavirus had spread to so many floridians before finally issuing a statewide stay at home order said terrie rizzo chairwoman of florida democratic party i hope this will finally slow the rise in infections and that his actions are not too late like in other states floridians can still go out to buy groceries medicine and other necessities the coronavirus was discovered in wuhan china in december it killed thousands in east asia before the epicenter shifted to europe and the americas the u s has recorded the most covid 19 infections of any country with over 200 000 though a secret u s intelligence report has reportedly cast doubt on the official numbers out of china where the outbreak began calling them intentionally incomplete mr trump said he hasn t seen the report we have not received that but their numbers seem to be a little on the light side mr trump said though added i m not an accountant from china over 4 750 people in the u s have died of the virus s disease covid 19 while nearly 8 500 people have officially recovered according to a johns hopkins university tracker new york state with a population of nearly 20 million is by far the hardest hit in the nation with 83 700 positive coronavirus cases and nearly 2 000 deaths speaking at the white house mr trump said every american heart is joined with new york as it bears the brunt of the crisis i love new york said mr trump who grew up there he said the epicenter might shift to other parts of the country however there are some areas and hotspots of other states that are really exploding mr trump said some like louisiana were really late then all of a sudden it was like an explosion amy acton director of the ohio department of health said there are various hot spots around the country and that new york is in a terrible situation and so you re trying to get all the supplies to them dr acton said wednesday the problem we re going to face with this unique pandemic is that within two weeks a lot of us are going to go off at the same time she said and there needs to be a combination strategy of prioritizing hot spots as they exist mr trump said he might look at restrictions on domestic flights from hotspot to hotspot though he s worried about its impact on the financially beleaguered airline industry we re thinking about doing that at the same time to start this whole thing over again is very tough mr trump said once you do that you really are clamping down an industry that s desperately needed the president said 17 000 national guardsmen have mobilized across the country to move medical supplies from warehouses to hospitals also he confirmed the possibility of using veterans affairs hospitals to treat the civilian overflow from other hospitals we re ready to move very quickly if we need them hopefully we won t need them mr trump said we are preparing for the worst in new york meanwhile gov andrew cuomo said officials are closing down new york city playgrounds citing the lack of compliance with social distancing rules he called on the city police department to get more aggressive in enforcing the rules and said people who continue to flout them are reckless who else has to die for you to understand you have a responsibility in this said the governor a democrat all told nearly 300 million people in 37 states 74 counties 14 cities the district of columbia and puerto rico are under government stay at home orders members of the white house coronavirus task force on tuesday said there could be 100 000 to 240 000 coronavirus related deaths in the u s even if people practice proper social distancing mr cuomo went through another model run by a group funded by the gates foundation that projects 93 000 americans and 16 000 new yorkers would die by the time the virus runs its course if this model if correct this could go through the summer he said citing projections of a high death rate through july he said he didn t quite understand the ratio since new york comprises a significantly greater share of covid 19 deaths in the u s right now but noted that the model shows tens of thousands of deaths outside the state so to the extent people watch their nightly news in kansas and say well this is a new york problem that s not what these numbers say he said it says it s a new york problem today tomorrow it s a kansas problem and a texas problem and a new mexico problem that s why i say to my fellow governors and elected officials all across this country look at us today see yourself tomorrow he said and let s address it in new york and let s cooperate to address it in new york because it s going to be in your town tomorrow metaphorically some leaders are taking the warning to heart maryland gov larry hogan recently warned that his state is going to be looking more like new york by easter while d c mayor muriel bowser sent robocalls to residents in the capital region wednesday warning them to stay home or practice social distancing if they do venture out mr desantis said that non essential businesses in florida will be able to make deliveries instead of shuttering completely under his order though people cannot gather inside establishments the governor s order allows religious services to proceed despite concern these gatherings might allow the virus to spread and it says residents will still be able to get care for their pets and buy food for them seeing an opportunity the governor told his transportation secretary to accelerate over 2 1 billion in construction projects because fewer people will be on the roads during the shutdown anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases said he hopes social distancing practices can be relaxed once the disease is brought under control though a solid program of containment must be in place first the ultimate solution to a virus that might keep coming back would be a vaccine dr fauci said noting various candidates are in clinical trials in the meantime states are looking at onerous lockdown measures to thwart the virus s spread mr cuomo said he s not sure that the u s would stomach nationwide restrictions along the lines of the ones imposed in wuhan china where officials banished most private vehicles from the road conducted door to door health checks and limited the number of family members who could venture out wuhan basically just locked up society mr cuomo said i don t even know that if the federal government enacted the wuhan model that the american people would comply we have a totally different social structure governmental structure tom frieden former director of the centers for disease control and prevention under president obama said the u s will need to test aggressively and then track remaining infections once the nation turns the tide against covid 19 we need an army of contact tracers in every community in the u s dr frieden who is the ceo of resolve to save lives a public health organization he also said it is concerning that cdc officials haven t been the public face of the u s response as mr trump grabs the spotlight with select members of his coronavirus task force each day let s be frank they are our number one experts in how to address a pandemic dr frieden said i will feel safer when we re hearing from them every single day dave boyer and james varne
