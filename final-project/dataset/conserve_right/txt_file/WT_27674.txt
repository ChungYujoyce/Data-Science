tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn whether president trump withheld military aid to ukraine to force president volodymyr zelensky to investigate the bidens has emerged as the linchpin of democrats impeachment drive mr trump says he held up the 250 million aid package because european nations were not coughing up enough money even as ukraine served as a literal wall between them and russia but he relented after republican allies convinced him to look beyond his pocketbook concern he said i gave the money because sen rob portman and others called me and asked but i don t like to be the sucker and european countries are helped far more than we are and those countries should pay more to help ukraine mr trump said at a press conference with finnish president sauli

president joseph r biden didn t come up nor did former new york city mayor and trump lawyer rudolph w giuliani cited by a whistleblower as a central figure in mr trump s alleged efforts to get foreign nations to investigate his 2020 democratic rival rob has long been ukraine s staunchest supporter as it works to combat russian aggression and strengthen its democracy he has continually advocated for and helped secure the security assistance they need and when there was a hold on the funds he acted to ensure they were released said portman spokeswoman emily benavides at no time during his work advocating for ukraine did the former vice president or former mayor of new york come up rob is the one who helped secure the release of the bipartisan agreed upon money which the president confirmed yesterday the money which had been frozen for weeks was released the day after the portman trump call with 141 million more in state department assistance thrilling ukraine supporters in congress but leaving questions about the delay although the aid package which includes lethal weapons such as javelin anti tank missiles was previously approved by congress the white house unexpectedly ordered defense secretary mark t esper and then national security adviser john r bolton to review the program earlier this year the pentagon determined the package was in the u s national interest so democrats say there has to be more to the story mr trump put a hold on the aid package in early to midsummer with little explanation while in limbo mr trump held his infamous call with the ukrainian tv comedian turned politician in which he asked mr zelensky to look into mr biden and his son hunter who had business ties in ukraine mr trump also queried about the location of a hacked democratic
