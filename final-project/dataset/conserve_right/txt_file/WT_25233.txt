criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots a majority of americans want mass deportations of illegal aliens if congress fails to reach a deal this week that closes loopholes in the country s asylum system that allow mass flows of foreign nationals to pour through the u s mexico border writes breitbart com analyst john binder

recently had a combative interview on cnn and became visibly frustrated after failing to offer a focused answer regarding his beliefs on school busing during an earlier era it was not a memorable moment there s an old adage in politics if you re explaining you re losing and ever since last week s democratic debate biden has been tripping over himself to explain his lackluster performance and generally acting like well a loser advises mark hemingway a writer for realclearinvestigations com cnn s big draw the countdown is on for the next round of democratic debates which arrive three weeks from tuesday at a major arena in detroit to be moderated by dana bash don lemon and jake tapper the network has released a few new details cnn will conduct a live draw to determine which night each

will be broadcast live at 8 p m edt on thursday the debates will also be simulcast on cnn international and stream live online at cnn com and through such providers as apple tv roku and amazon fire the debate will come shortly after robert mueller is expected to testify publicly before the house judiciary and intelligence committees mueller former special counsel for the justice department and former director of the fbi delivered a report to doj after spending nearly two years investigating russian interference in the 2016 election mueller s highly anticipated testimony comes as an increasing number of lawmakers including some 2020 candidates are calling for an impeachment inquiry to begin against president trump the network said polls gone wild one thing to remember is that the actual presidential election is over 500 days away we are witnessing a lot of posturing and wheel spinning but that s typical for this stage in addition polls gauging the horse race between democratic presidential hopefuls are not in harmony with one another few have the same findings they say it s still too early to put much stock in polling of the democratic presidential field that s probably true another reason not to put much stock in these polls is that they are all over the place points out powerline analyst paul mirengoff as an example he cites the findings of five different pollsters gauging the prospects of former vice president joseph r biden plus sens kamala d harris bernard sanders and elizabeth warren how to explain the differing results i can t mr mirengoff notes at this early date we shouldn t put much stock in any of these polls nonetheless i think it s fair to conclude that we re probably looking at a four horse race the likelihood that the democratic nominee won t come from the pack of biden harris warren or sanders seems extremely small my sense for what little it s worth is that sanders s prospects are considerably less favorable than those of the other three he says also noting that former flavor of the week pete buttigieg the mayor of south bend indiana is fading from the field buttigieg and the rest of the trailing field should be viewed as auditioning for the vice presidential nomination amy klobuchar julian castro and cory booker strike me as most likely among this group to win that sweepstakes depending on whether the eventual nominee is looking
