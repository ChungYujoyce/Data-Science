overhaul in decades with white house budget director mick mulvaney then as senators work on a bipartisan deal to fix obamacare sen lamar alexander r tennessee i think as people read the bill they

general xavier becerra who is leading the charge then the president stands side by side with mitch mcconnell in a show of unity after steve bannon declares mcconnell enemy number one trump we aposre probably now i think as far as i aposm concerned closer than ever before perino we aposll discuss the impact on the agenda with the senate majority leader live on fox news sunday and john kelly white house chief of staff so he called four people the other day and expressed his condolences in the best way that he could perino the white house chief of staff weighs in on the president aposs response to the death of four u s soldiers we aposll ask our sunday panel how the issue has become political this week plus so i was the first republican woman press secretary you are the second but you are the first working mother sarah sanders on balancing life at home and at the white house all right now on fox news sunday end videotape perino and hello again from fox news in washington president trump aposs drive to overhaul the nation aposs tax code cleared a major hurdle this week when the senate approved his budget blueprint the house is poised to adopt it next week in an op ed in this morning aposs usa today president trump writes revising our tax code is not just a policy discussion it is a moral one because we are not talking about the government aposs money we are talking about your money your hard work we begin here in washington with the white house budget director mick mulvaney sir welcome back to fox news sunday mick mulvaney white house budget director good morning thank you for having me perino in my first time here and my first guest on the first every fox news sunday mulvaney i aposll try hard not to screw up too bad perino ok me too so you must feel a lot better today than you did a week ago about the chances for tax reform mulvaney very much so we felt good last week but not only did the senate then pass the bill we aposre hearing now that the house may go ahead and either take the senate amendments or move very quickly to accept the senate amendments and we may save as many as 10 or 12 legislative days which is a big deal it sounds like it aposs not much when you only here in the end of october but in the congressional calendars that aposs a long time and it really does buy us some more time and some opportunity to get this done before the end of the year perino well especially because treasury secretary mnuchin promised that the president would have a bill by december do you think that aposs realistic mulvaney absolutely do in fact they got a lot more if the house really does take the senate budget when they come back i think it aposs tuesday this week it absolutely moves the ball a lot further a lot quicker towards an actual law ph perino another thing secretary mnuchin said is that the only thing non negotiable is the corporate tax rate which you all in your proposal would be 20 percent coming down from 35 percent but if you had to negotiate on that number would you mulvaney the two priorities from the very beginning from the president have been that middle taxpayers will pay less and it will be simple for them that aposs number one number two that the corporate tax rate is going to come down we wanted 15 percent the house kept pushing and pushing and pushing we talked about 20 we love to get back down to 15 percent as we continue that negotiation but those two things are sort of the foundation of a tax plan for the president and i don apost think the house really wants to negotiate those very much perino i would agree but there is some possible concern let aposs listen to house freedom caucus chairman mark meadows because he aposs got a little bit concern about the possibility of a fourth bracket for high tax earners let aposs listen begin video clip rep mark meadows r nc freedom caucus chairman i aposm against having a top rate if we aposre going to do that then we need to just admit that at times that having a top rate for those that earned a million dollars or more is maybe a political reality but it doesn apost necessarily boost the economy end video clip perino so in the plan right now there aposs seven brackets the plan will take it to three but in order to do the pay fors there aposs this possibility of a fourth tax bracket mulvaney actually that aposs a fifth rate people forget that we actually have four rates now it aposs zero 12 25 and 35 and there has been some discussion mostly on the hill about adding that top bracket what we aposve just said at the white house is look we aposre agnostic about that it aposs not a big piece for us if the house needs to add it to pass a great tax reform that aposs great if they don apost that aposs great too it aposs not what aposs driving this for the effort of the white house perino the conservatives have long believed as i understand it that taxes and high taxes depress economic growth and investment so i think if it keeps creeping up will it depress what you want to do mulvaney and our opinion of that has not changed i guess what we aposre saying is look we want the very best tax package that can actually pass and if there aposs things the house has to do or the senate has to do to get that last vote or two to get across the finish line that aposs up to them that fifth bracket is not a party ph for the white house we aposre not pushing for it we don apost necessarily even want it but it aposs something that in the greater scheme of things if the house and senate tell us we have to take then we aposll open to it perino so if that happened do you think that senator schumer and warren will complain that the tax plan doesn apost do enough to tax the rich do you think that they could come on board mulvaney no chance in fact i aposve asked a couple of democrats if they aposd ever vote to lower the corporate tax rate they told me no which is just bizarre dana since they aposve supported themselves bills in the past in fact some democrats supported bills that schumer has talked about and ron wyden talked about that actually lowered that corporate tax rate president obama talked about lowering the corporate tax rate it aposs almost as if since it aposs president trump aposs administration and it aposs a republican plan now they aposre against it perino they aposre in just say no mode mulvaney yes perino i do have a question so i grew up in wyoming and colorado that aposs not those are not high tax states mulvaney right perino and i aposve been trying to understand this issue about state and local tax deductions this seems like this could be a big sticking point where it aposs the big revenue raiser that in order to pay for the tax cuts which i know you care about but there aposs about 40 house republicans who represent taxpayers in those high tax states like new york and california and lot of them in new england and they aposre saying that this is a deal breaker for them mulvaney i hope it aposs not because at foundation here one of the things we aposre driving is fairness and if you live in wyoming and i live in new york and we make the same amount of money our house is worth the same amount of money our cars are worth the same amount of money all other things being equal shouldn apost we pay the same amount of federal tax i think it aposs yes the president thinks it aposs yes secretary mnuchin thinks it aposs yes most people think that we should pay the same amount that aposs not the way our tax system works right now right now if you live in wyoming all other things being equal you pay more tax than someone who lives in new york that aposs just not fair and it aposs something we really are hoping to change and we hope the house and the senate can accept that perino but so some are saying though that those taxpayers in those states would end up actually disproportionately paying for the tax cut bill if this stays in there mulvaney yes and that aposs you have to be careful there because one of the reasons it aposs so hard to do tax reform and we haven apost done tax reform in this scale since the 1980s if ever is that you can always sort of go in and look at one provision and say oh this is so bad for this person i can apost vote for it you have to look at it holistically you have to look at the entire impact of the tax plan i heard governor cuomo in new york said this tax plan would raise taxes of every person in new york that aposs just patently false when you look at it writ large for example doubling the standard deduction most people aren apost going to be interested in their state and local taxes deduction inaudible they aposre not going to take perino they won apost have to do mulvaney that aposs exactly right perino ok so thirty six years ago the u s national debt crossed a trillion dollars for the first time today it aposs 20 trillion and i know you came to washington d c because you wanted to combat overspending and you even talked about it actually in january at your confirmation hearing can we just listen to that mulvaney sure perino trip down memory lane begin video clip mulvaney i believe as a matter of principle that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later i also know that fundamental changes are necessary in the way washington spends and taxes if we truly want to help the economy this must include change in our government aposs long term fiscal path which is unsustainable part of that also means taking a hard look at government waste and ending it end video clip perino i know that your principles haven apost changed mulvaney yes perino i fully understand that politics has but have the economics changed mulvaney no all that aposs changed is sort of the politics well what aposs changed is that we sent 54 billion worth of discretionary spending reduction ideas to the house dana i think the house took maybe four or five billion of it i don apost think the senate took any of it it aposs very very hard in this environment to lower spending so what we aposve done is sit back and go ok how do we balance the budget in the 1990s we did not cut our way to balance in the 1990s we sort of restrained the growth of government so that government revenues tax receipts grew faster than expenditures and that aposs what we aposre trying to do we aposre not abandoning fiscal restraint by any measure i would never do that but we aposre sitting there and going ok if we can slow the expenditures but increase the revenues by growing the economy as america gets wealthier the families get wealthier the government actually gets wealthier too that aposs how we balance the budget in the 1990s that aposs how we aposre going to do it again today but we need to tax reform to do it perino if you get the economic if you get the tax reform passed and the resulting economic growth that you project would you try to revisit with president trump your concerns about the growth of entitlement spending mulvaney in fact i had a meeting with the president just the other day we walked over some of the numbers as the deficit came out to the deficit came out last week about what aposs driving the deficit and i actually said look here aposs where it is here aposs where it isn apost and mr president i aposm going to come back to you again and want to talk to you about entitlement spending and he said look i aposm still not going to do it but happy to have a conversation same thing we discussion we had in the spring i promised people i wouldn apost change social security i aposm not going to do it i said that aposs fine but my job is to show what that means and i think that aposs the right way to do it and i think that if we do get this growth dana both 3 percent you can start to see that deficit trimmed down which is what aposs driving everything we do perino are you concerned about the uncertainty in the health care market with the confusion about whether the president could support the bipartisan short term fix of alexander murray that that would hurt your ability to actually hit that 3 percent growth target mulvaney no not at all in fact i aposm surprised now that the democrats are all of a sudden concerned about uncertainty in the health care markets when it aposs been uncertain since the day obamacare passed they aposre concerned now about rates going up when they aposve been going up since the day it was passed so again that aposs the politics of the day i think on the csrs which is thing that the president is look i would be ok with making these payments if i get something for people in exchange if i get something that actually helps people give us more ability on associated health plans give us more ability to sell state lines give us more ability to expand health saving account give us tools that actually help people and we aposll talk about looking at alexander murray perino when the president goes to the hill on tuesday for lunch with the senators what aposs the main message you want them to walk away with mulvaney well tax reform for certain but the one thing that doesn apost get a lot of discussion mostly in the media is the lack of progress on our nominees and we aposre very excited to hear mr mcconnell commit this week to having the senate starting to work on monday and friday and even the occasional weekend and as a house member i sort of laugh when i hear that former house member i think president obama had twice as many of his confirmees in place at this point of his administration as we did this is a republican senate with a republican president we need our people in place perino it seems like the senate has done well confirming judges but the rest of the government does need to be filled mulvaney we got tremendous job on judges but we do need them to start working more again why because the democrats are obstructing it every turn they aposre obstructing people dana who go on to get 80 or 90 votes people who are never contentious in the first place everybody knows they aposre qualified it aposs obstruction for the sake of obstruction and we just need the republicans to push back perino and they probably get good headlines for it back in their own districts mulvaney yes perino all right omb director mick mulvaney thanks for being here mulvaney thanks perino all right joining us now from sacramento is xavier becerra the attorney general of california he is leading a coalition of 18 states and the district of columbia against the trump administration aposs effort to end obamacare payments to insurers it aposs just one of california aposs many lawsuits against the trump administration on everything from health care to immigration to clean energy sir thank you for being with us today xavier becerra d california attorney general thanks dana perino so a federal court had ruled that the payments that actually i was talking about with mick mulvaney the csrs these subsidies for health care payment that they themselves were unlawful because they were never appropriated by the congress so tell me about your lawsuit and how you expect to win it given that information becerra so that decision had been put on hold the obama administration first now the trump administration are in court against that decision and we have now states joined in that effort as well to try to keep not only that decision on hold but permanently on hold and to move forward with the affordable care act because millions of people depend on it some 7 million will probably be affected if the trump administration aposs efforts to kill the cost sharing subsidy that people depend on to afford their deductibles and their copayments and their insurance are taken away perino what is the timeline for your lawsuits you knowing you aposll expect to hear anything back from the courts becerra well we went and asking for the court to give us an emergency ruling to stop what the trump administration did last week or a little bit more than a week ago but it was supposed under the trump administration take effect immediately or under their order and we can apost afford to have that kind of uncertainty there are people who are day to day depending on their health insurance there are someone like rebecca in california modesto california mid 30s she is a quadriplegic she has constant visits to the doctor she right now pays about 15 in copayments for those visits without those copayments being made part of the aca well guess what her payments go up to about 105 every visit someone like that cannot afford to have this kind of uncertainty hanging over her she requires that health care she depends on it perino given all the uncertainty and what we were just talking about going forward would you personally support something like what senator bernie sanders has suggested which would be a medicare for all plan becerra oh absolutely i aposve been a supporter of medicare for all for the 24 years that i was in congress this year as attorney general i would fight for that if we had an opportunity to put that forward in the state of california because i think what we do is we give people that certainty that they aposre going to able to access a doctor or a hospital the worst thing we used to have was situations were young families wouldn apost know if they should take their children to the hospital because it can lead to personal bankruptcy that ended with the affordable care act we can apost go back to those days and so absolutely when you give people access to medicare and talk to seniors who have their medicare who say keep your hands off my medicare i think it would have the same effect for most americans if they knew they could depend on something like medicare for themselves as well perino and we aposll have to call mick mulvaney back to ask him how we aposre going to pay for it let me move on to the fact that you aposre also becerra actually it saves us money dana it saves us a great deal of money and that aposs why we continue to have medicare for seniors perino maybe we can have you back and we aposll have a big debate when it ever actually ripens into an issue let me ask you about the lawsuit that you filed about dreamers and daca i aposm curious that you know the president has asked the congress to come back to him with an actual law instead of relying on the obama executive orders for dreamers so why not wait to see how that turns out before pushing forward on this lawsuit becerra well again if the trump administration weren apost putting people aposs lives at risk their ability to continue to go to school to work to provide for their family then perhaps we could wait but donald trump didn apost wait he decided to repeal the daca program all together and now we have to act because we can apost afford to put people in this kind of limbo so we aposre out there to protect at least in california more than 200 000 young people we aposre fighting really hard to continue to show that they belong in america perino but he aposs also said that he wouldn apost deport them so you know are they being are they fearful for no reason at this point becerra dana if we had that kind of certainty things would be different but we don apost we know of dreamers who have been deported for no reason no criminal history nothing that they particularly did and at the same time you don apost want to put people in limbo this way just the way rebecca doesn apost want to lose her affordable care insurance because someone says well don apost worry we aposll find another way for you do it she can apost afford that because she as a quadriplegic has to know that she can make her doctor visits the same thing with all these dreamers in america who know america as the only home they aposve ever had we can apost afford to put them in limbo either and that aposs why we aposre out there going to fight fight as hard as we can i say that not just as the a g but as a son of immigrants perino can i ask you one last question and it aposs kind of make it quick so there aposs all of these lawsuits that you aposre filing since 2014 the number of californians saying that they support seceding from the union has grown from 20 percent to more than a third and this group cal exit now gathering signatures for a ballot initiative next year in fact steve bannon this week said that california is to president trump what south carolina was to andrew jackson are you comfortable with that sort ballot laying which even if it is not if it aposs unconstitutional would you allow it to be on the ballot becerra well we all get to express ourselves and certain people in california who are frustrated with this administration constantly taking digs and hurting california but i will tell you this california is the economic engine of the united states of america we on our own as a state could be the sixth economic power in the world the u s needs california as much as i believe california needs to be part of the united states we aposll do everything we can to be the leading force for this country rather than be out of it i think we can continue to be the leader in it perino all right thank you mr becerra appreciate you joining us becerra thanks dana perino all right have a good day up next senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on his united front with president trump despite the gridlock blocking much of the president aposs campaign promises commercial break perino as pressure from the president and republican voters builds for a legislative win after the failure of repeal and replace senate republicans scored a win this week by passing a budget deal paving the way to pass tax reform a major republican priority joining us now from louisville is senate majority mitch mcconnell sir thank you for being here today sen mitch mcconnell r ky majority leader good morning perino so the first nine months of the year did not produce the legislative wins the president expected with the passage of the budget bill and now on to tax reform did you get a sense that republicans can sort of taste victory mcconnell well tax reform is important thirty one years ago today ronald reagan signed comprehensive tax reform we intend to accomplish that between now and the end of the year but you know the suggestion that the president hasn apost been able to change a lot of things is simply not true we have the supreme court with neil gorsuch other court nominations coming through new people in the agencies who are dealing with the regulatory rampage of the last eight years the president is making a lot of changes and the senate since it aposs in the personnel business is helping the president accomplish these changes but we intend to achieve tax reform as well perino so health care was hard tax reform apparently sounds like it aposs supposed to be easier i don apost exactly know how that is but i could see that the path especially at 51 votes make sense but i don apost know if you heard mick mulvaney was talking about this possibility that there might be a compromise where an additional tax bracket would be added maybe a so called millionaire aposs tax is that something that you could support mcconnell you know dana i hate to get into the details of this it aposs going to be hashed out in the open in the ways and means committee in the house and the finance committee in the senate i can tell you what the overall goal is middle class tax relief the stopping of job exportation because of our horrible business tax structure in this country to get the country growing again that coupled with the regulatory changes the president aposs already implementing we think give us a chance to achieve at least 3 percent growth there wasn apost a single year of 3 percent growth during the obama years that aposs what we need to get the country growing and going again the details of it such as the one you mentioned are all going to be hashed out in the committees in open process and then we aposll take the bills up on the floor and see what they look like at that point perino ok moving on there aposs alabama senate hopeful roy moore the super pacs that you allied with spent millions to boost incumbent luther strange but if moore is elected on december 12th he could be a really key vote on tax reform so your friend steve bannon he was a major backer of moore has made no secret that you are his enemy number one and that you are the roadblock to the president getting his agenda accomplished listen begin video clip steve bannon former white house chief strategist this revolt is going from alabama to arizona the last couple of days mitch has been saying this big thing hey you got to win winners make policy losers go home hey mitch note to self mitch big luther strange and little bobby corker are both going home these people mitch it aposs 2 0 end video clip perino and even the president didn apost really dispute bannon aposs frustration with the senate republicans begin video clip donald trump president of the united states myself i aposll be honest they are not getting the job done and i can understand where steve bannon is coming from because i aposm not happy about it and a lot of people aren apost happy about it end video clip perino so senator mcconnell is tax reform a must pass and if you get that legislative success is it the antidote to steve bannon aposs agitation against you mcconnell well let me just say with regard to the element that you aposre referring to here they aposve been out there for a number of years they caused us five senate seats in 2010 and 2012 we would have gotten the majority of senators but for the fact that they were able to nominate people who could not win in november in apos14 they were defeated everywhere in apos16 they were defeated everywhere and the difference is we aposve been in majority in 2014 and 2016 two congresses in a row look this is not about personalities this is about achievement and in order to make policy you have to actually win the election the kind of people that are supported by the element that you aposd just been referring are specialists in defeating republican candidates in november and that aposs what these inner party skirmishes about our goal is to nominate people in the primaries next year who can actually win and the people who win will be the ones who enact the president aposs agenda perino so you mentioned that in the rose garden you talked to the president about those four individuals that you could rattle off the top of your head but i was curious about two conservatives that are not actually very good allies of yours who you didn apost initially support in the primaries that would be for example marco rubio and pat toomey so could it be that there are some good gop senators that could emerge from primaries that you maybe wouldn apost anticipate mcconnell actually i supported both of those senators many times we aposre on the same side but the point is to make policy you got to win election and some of these folks that you aposve been quoting as i said are specialists on nominating people who lose that isn apost going to help president trump achieve his agenda he needs a republican senate and a republican house to confirm judges and to pass legislation that are important to him and to the country and that aposs what this is really all about trying to change america from the obama years and take it in a different direction perino when you talk about the judges and i know you must have spoken about that with the president because he talked about it in your press conference with him in the rose garden on tuesday the president aposs coming to have lunch with you and your members and apparently they aposre frustrated not necessarily with judges with the pace of confirmations of other nominees that the administration has put forward and mick mulvaney just said that the president is going to press the senate on that what do you think he aposll say mcconnell yes the democrats have made it hard but they can apost stop them i mean ultimately we aposre going to get all of these nominees they aposve slowed the process down which has been pretty exasperating but they will not be able to win on any of this confirmation we will confirm them all both administration positions and to the judiciary perino do you worry sir that your personal unpopularity with the republicans out in the country is weighing down your possibility to make sure that you can keep the senate next year mcconnell look i aposm not going to be on the ballot on any of the states and i don apost think the candidates who are running need to take a position on me people on those states are interested in what the candidates can do for them and for the country trying to cook up an issue like this is irrelevant it aposs only going to create divisions and make it more difficult for us to win in november but i don apost expect any candidate in america to sort of sign up on how they may vote for the majority leader of the senate a year and a half from now perino so last question for you is on a different topic there aposs a looming issue of possible regulation of the silicon valley giants which have largely grown because of a lack of federal regulation and interference do you think that that could be about to change under president trump and a republican congress mcconnell i don apost know i mean i think all of these areas we need to take a look and i think it aposs in the early stages of trying to figure out what the way forward is perino all right senator mcconnell thank you so much for being here with us this morning always good to speak with you mcconnell ok thank you perino all right up next we will bring in our sunday group to weigh on the path ahead for tax cuts what it could mean for the middle class economy and job commercial break begin video clip trump he was so offended because he was in the room when i made the call and so were other people and the call was a very nice call he was so offended that a woman would be that somebody would be listening to that call he he was he actually couldn apost believe it actually he said to me sir this is not acceptable end video clip perino president trump defending his chief of staff in an interview with fox aposs maria bartiromo saying thee congresswoman aposs attacks on john kelly were quote sickening and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz who aposs now a fox news contributor columnist for the hill juan williams julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and editor and chief of the washington free beacon matthew continetti you know i aposve never i aposve had a chance to be on the panel but to never run the panel so i aposll try to do my best so this is not a controversy that the white house anticipated before the rose garden press conference with mitch mcconnell but as soon as president trump referenced how his predecessors handled outreach to families of the fallen i knew they would have a firestorm on their hands and so the back and forth went on all week and included an appearance by general kelly in the briefing room a gold star father himself and then this from congresswoman fredericka wilson i feel very story for him because he feels such a need to lie on me and i aposm not even his enemy and it didn apost end there president trump also took a stab at wilson saturday on twitter i hope the fake news media keeps talking about whacky congresswoman wilson in that she as a representative is killing the democrat party julie what is the white house thinking this morning julie pace the associated press well this as you said this was not a fight that the white house anticipated but it was one that they were led into day after day by the president himself that this is a president who does not like to admit when he is wrong he doesn apost like to back away from a fight his strategy tends to be to push forward so he aposs really been the one driving this forward every single day you aposve seen john kelly at the podium backing him up white house officials certainly would like to put their attention on things like tax reform which is really probably what the president is going to be judged on this year in terms of whether this year has been a success or not but you saw the president out there again this morning it aposs a fight he feels like he needs to win which is a bit odd because this is this is a fight where i don apost think anybody really comes across looking looking very good right now perino jason as a former member of congress do you think it was inappropriate for the congresswoman to reveal the conversation in the first place jason chaffetz fox news contributor it really is almost a sacred moment you aposre dealing with a family who aposs still coming to grips with the fact that their son or daughter has lost their life and so there aposs got to be some way to raise the bar and just say enough is enough we aposre talking about military we aposre talking about people who have lost their lives they really do need inaudible perino now juan williams fox news political analysis well let me just say though i mean the argument had been that she said something that wasn apost true that she said that the president said your son knew what he signed up for and the idea was oh well fredricka wilson oh this congresswoman from florida just doesn apost like president trump and said this and then president trump seemed to indicate that she had fabricated something then it turns out in fact kelly comes out and says that oh no he did say that maybe the context was a little off but he did say that and then kelly attacks her by saying she took credit for the funding for an fbi office in miramar florida and that wasn apost true so i you know they aposre attacking fredricka wilson in a very aggressive manner but i just think it aposs been unfair and again it strikes me that especially that kelly aposs used to the military and patriotism to cover for trump i think it aposs offensive perino but isn apost that also then i mean the the same accusation could be made matt about fredricka wilson that aposs why i aposm asking like like it aposs unfortunate to me that any of this happened because grief is very personal commanders in chief have to make very tough phone calls because of the decisions that they made on their watch what do you make of all this matthew continetti the washington free beacon who aposs politicizing who right perino right continetti everyone seems to be politicizing different aspects of this incident larger questions involving what were the soldiers doing in niger in the first place williams yes continetti i aposd like to hear an explanation about what exactly the mission was in fact we still don apost know the full details about the ambush and the assault if president bush president trump rather has a two track presidency on the one hand you have the judges the policies the deregulations tax and budget on the other hand you have a showman and the constant fights last week it was bob corker this week it aposs fredricka wilson we don apost know who it will be next week perino don apost forget the nfl continetti always the nfl that an that aposs a long running plot line perino running ph continetti somehow he aposs able to balance the two of them together but we see just this week that they can over one can over easily overshadow the other president trump might want that to happen actually perino well we certainly offer our condolences to the families of the fallen of the u s soldiers and secretary mattis had been on capitol hill giving senator mccain more information jason can i ask you about this possibility that the republicans could get tax reform done so health care was supposed to be so easy chaffetz right perino and now it seems like we all are talking like tax reform aposs going to happen is is there a catch chaffetz well speaker ryan said that they were going to stay through christmas if need be to get tax reform done only to go on an 11 day recess now the house is poised this week to do something i didn apost think they would do which is pass over a ten year period a 47 trillion budget that doesn apost balance and only has one count them one billion dollars that they aposre supposedly going to cut so republicans are swallowing hard on a pillar that aposs supposed to be very important to the fiscal discipline with no cuts and once they get that done they aposre doing it on the promise that they aposre going to get tax reform but they haven apost introduced the bill yet and so here we are at the end of october coming up on it and they haven apost yet introduced the bill i don apost think this is going to be easy if it was easy it was going to be done a long time ago the budget was due in by law on april 15th and now here we are turning the corner heading up towards halloween and they still haven apost got that part done perino matt do you find it strange that conservatives are now talking like deficits don apost matter continetti well we aposve talked like that before in the 1980 aposs right with president reagan who said you know i don apost worry about the deficit it aposs big enough to take care of itself perino yes and so are we back to that continetti the debt of course has increased exponentially under both republican and democratic presidents perino right continetti no one seems to be able to control it for some of those automatic spending reasons that i think that director mulvaney mentioned perino yes they inaudible continetti i will say this though a lot is riding on this tax reform this is because of the failure of obamacare repeal and replace the centerpiece of president trump aposs first year in office if they don apost get it done politics in washington is going to be up ended perino julie what did you think of this idea that they would add a millionaire aposs tax in order to help pay for these taxes pace it aposs fascinating to hear someone like mick mulvaney saying we aposre for agnostic ph about a fourth tax bracket a millionaire aposs tax bracket look it aposs a it aposs a play to try to get some more moderate potentially conservative democrats on board i think that you aposre going to see this internal fight that aposs happening behind the scenes among republicans on the details of this really explode into the open though if you do see a fourth tax bracket pushed through here perino so but juan if they aposve if the republicans add a millionaire aposs tax what would schumer and warren complain about williams oh well still and i i think congressman chaffetz is on to something here it aposs still we don apost have a revenue source or stream that would really offset the cost of the tax cut let me just say overall this was supposedly about tax reform apparently that aposs not the issue now we aposre just onto tax cuts so the argument coming from the democrats is this really is disproportionately beneficial to the very rich you add the fourth bracket but it still does nothing in terms of offsetting things like doing away with state and local deductions perino that aposs a big issue williams that aposs a huge issue how about home mortgage imagine no home mortgage deduction i mean i aposm sure k street perino well that aposs not they aposre not saying that williams well they are making the case and then also less in terms of your retirement contribution so these are things that would squeeze the middle class the middle class is not going to benefit because of the added tax on the rich perino this this state and local deduction tax deduction issue is a big deal if you aposre from a state like me in wyoming you think well that aposs ridiculous why do they get to do that but for people who live around here it aposs a big deal matt continetti that aposs right and what aposs fascinating to me about this fourth bracket issue that you aposve introduced is when you were serving president bush republicans would never do that with president trump though it shows you how the republican party has changed perino uh huh continetti and in fact most of president trump aposs supporters would have no problem at all perino yes continetti with a fourth tax bracket affecting millionaires chaffetz but perino but what chaffetz it aposs inaudible politics and it doesn apost bring along democrats republicans are poised to pass a 47 trillion 10 year budget and didn apost get a single democrat to come along at least do something republican in that budget but they aposre not going to do that and so if you aposre going to give up with fourth bracket what do you get for it it doesn apost sound like the democrats are going to come along perino could they use that fourth bracket to pay for dropping the state and local tax deductions chaffetz it doesn apost pace they they potentially could but i think this issue with the state and local taxes is fascinating because you hear states like california and new york you automatically think democrats a lot of republican representatives williams correct perino a lot there aposs 40 in the northeast alone all right panel it aposs time to take a break we will see you a little later this hour we aposll discuss the president aposs decision to greenlight the release of thousands of secret documents related to jfk aposs assassination it aposs a move that has conspiracy theorists buzzing but first i return to the white house to check in with the second republican woman and first mom to serve as white house press secretary commercial break perino a live look at 1600 pennsylvania avenue here in washington where i had the privilege to serve as press secretary for president george w bush earlier this week i returned to my old stomping ground to sit down with the current press secretary sarah sanders begin videotape perino what is your first news memory and did affect any of your education or career choices sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary the first one that comes to mind would probably be when my dad ran for the u s senate in 1992 i was nine and he lost it was a devastating night for our family and i remember just the impact it certainly gave me a greater appreciation for when you win and versus when you lose perino when he decided to run again did you as a kid did you not want him to sanders you know at that age it seemed fun and fascinating when most kids were going to summer camp i was doing like the arkansas festival circuit and so i thought it was all great and i loved the campaign aspect from a really early age and i was excited for him to be part of that race perino your dad told me that you had a desk like an office when you were four years old sanders i did it was actually in his office so he had the big like credenza and underneath that bottom part i would keep all of my own supplies my you know tape and glue and scissors and make wonderful masterpieces i aposm sure perino i was the first republican woman press secretary you are the second we you are the third woman overall but you are the first working mother to ever have this job in this job we everybody sees you all the time we know that you aposre working 24 7 so how do you balance it all sanders i think one of the biggest things is the moments that i do have with my kids i have to be really present i try to put my phone away and fully focus on the time that i have with them and i try to block out specific time whether it aposs early in the morning i think it aposs probably a blessing i have early rises people always ask what aposs the hardest thing about your job for me it aposs being away from my family perino right sanders the other part is having an incredible partner my husband is supportive and he puts up with all of this and helps keep you know all of us afloat and i couldn apost do it without having him as that support system to get through each day perino in my book i wrote that my favorite piece of advice is that choosing to be loved is not a career limiting decision and was he your boss at some point sanders no i was actually his boss perino you were his boss ok sanders i was his boss perino i think that some people imagine that if they ever want to have this job that it aposs this magical moment and a real cinderella story and the stars come out and there aposs a band and it aposs like everyone is so excited and that certainly was not my experience sanders there was no band i can assure you there was no band perino and for you you didn apost really have any time for a honeymoon it was just hit the ground running sanders yes so it all happened within about a four hour period perino i loved the deputy job sanders it was great perino i found in the deputy position that aposs when you get to know the commander in chief very well in a little bit more of a relaxed setting possibly sanders i think any job in the white house is incredible and i aposve always said if i ever walk into the building and i aposm not in awe of being here and being part of it then i aposve been here too long and it aposs time to go thankfully i still feel a sense of reverence every time i step into the building certainly every time i step into the briefing room and i hope i never lose that perino yes i used to say a little prayer of thanks and gratitude every morning as the marine opened the door sanders i say and i also say a little prayer of god help me every day right before walking into that room perino so recently in the atlantic magazine glenn thrush said he thought the administration aposs apparent tension with the press was overstated would you agree sanders no i know glenn well but you know i think that there aposs always going to be tension between whatever administration is in place at that time with the white house press corps but i do think that there is a heightened tension certainly between this administration and the press you have hold on i allowed you to finish i think you can see that in the coverage i mean i aposve been around press and worked in politics my entire life and i aposve never experienced the level of kind of hostility that i think we see day to day perino yes on the day of the las vegas massacre that was the first day of my new show the daily briefing and so we were covering your briefing and ari fleischer a former press secretary as well was on as my guest and we watched you sanders the memory of those who displayed the ultimate expression of love in the midst of an unimaginable act of hate will never fade perino showing that emotion was important and it aposs not always easy to do at the podium sanders yes you want to i think project strength certainly from an administration standpoint but i think at that moment the country was broken and i felt like it was an appropriate time if ever to show the emotion of that situation but the biggest thing i wanted to do was talk about the spirit of our country and i wanted to make sure to communicate that perino like me you were student body president and you but unlike me you come from a political family do you think you ever see yourself running for office sanders i don apost think so i never like to say perino there aposs an opening sanders i never like to say never because it aposll come back to bite you every time i think i have a perfect plan for my life god tells me otherwise and so i never really envisioned sitting here having this conversation with you perino right sanders not even as far back as you know maybe two years ago and so never say never but i don apost think that aposs part of the master plan for me but again right now it aposs one day at a time and trying to do the best i can end videotape perino our thanks to sarah up next two former presidents from two different parties weigh in on the state of politics today but first sarah and i went outside the west wing for a lightening round including her most embarrassing moments on the job so far begin videotape perino what time do you wake up sanders usually about 5 15 perino on your own or with an alarm sanders with an alarm and usually a child perino what is the last thing you read before bed sanders usually the last e mail work e mails off of the day perino marine one or air force one sanders i think marine one it aposs a little bit more special it aposs a small group so it aposs pretty exciting perino coffee sanders lots perino you aposre most embarrassing moment as white house press secretary so far sanders oh when they had a bring your child to work day i just brought my middle son huck who aposs four now and i had gone into the oval to explain to the president he was going to go out and take a picture with all the kids so i aposm in there walking him through you aposre going to go out you aposre going to take the picture you aposll come back in and i look up and i see the bushes in the rose garden like violently shaking and then i see a little blonde head pop up and then i see my son aposs face peeking into the window of the oval and the president aposs like there aposs a little boy in the bushes and i aposm like yes that aposs perino that would be mine sanders that aposs my son end videotape commercial break begin videotape trump in the aftermath of these terrible storms the american people have done what we do best we came together we helped one another and through it all we remain resilient end video clip perino president trump joining via video message as all five former living u s president stand on one stage raising funds for hurricane relief united for a night at least yet just on thursday in two separate speeches both former presidents bush and obama made remarks largely perceived as against the current white house george w bush former u s president discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts bigotry seems emboldened our politics seems more venerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication barack obama former u s president do you want a politics of division and distraction or do you believe in a better kind of politics one where we work together and listen to each other and move this country forward end video clip perino and we are back now with the panel julie the white house didn apost take the bait watch this begin video clip question does the white house feel it aposs appropriate for past presidents to be critical of the sitting president and and when was the last time president trump spoke to president bush sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary i aposm not sure of the last time they spoke but our understanding is that those comments were not directed towards the president end video clip perino so julie they i thought that was skillful and and and smart what did you think pace i thought it was very smart generally you try to avoid tangling even even someone like trump who as i was talking about before likes to tangle on pretty much any issue you try to avoid tangling with the former occupants of the oval office there is such a small group of people who know what that job is like i do think it was remarkable that both bush and obama in these separate set of remarks came out said fairly similar things expressed concerns about divisions in the country president bush has been so careful about weighing in in politics for almost a decade now and obama has chosen his spots pretty carefully perino yes but matt i have a theory that if president bush had given that same speech about values he has long held if he had given it in october of 2014 that the media would have said that it was against president obama for leaving iraq too soon not having america be the front and leader in the world for dividing america but this time the media tried to drive this wedge between both president trump and and and the other the former presidents continetti i do think president bush aposs remarks were more general than say president obama aposs which were in the midst of a campaign for virginia governor what aposs striking me to the degree that they overlapped the messages i think that feeds into president trump aposs critique of the two party duopoly perino right it did it looked like a like a two frontal attack even though they were president bush aposs remarks were scheduled a year in advance and president obama was in virginia jason steve bannon has said that president bush was the most destructive president in the history of the country but that was in the same speech where he was calling for republican unity so how is that going chaffetz well it aposs pretty hard to rectify those two but we aposve got to be very careful i mean let aposs attack people on policy but let aposs not play into the democratic hands with this division of based on identity and this identity politics it really does scare me and when you turn that fire internally hey that aposs the fastest way to becoming the minority party perino yes well and i think that the all the presidents being together last night and inviting president trump or i think maybe even his suggestion to do a video since he couldn apost be there like just to make all that in one showed a lot about america juan i want to talk to you about president trump he aposs got a big decision whether to release long secret government documents relating to the assassination of president kennedy this is what he tweeted subject to the receipt of further information i will be allowing as president the long blocked and classified jfk files to be opened are you excited about that williams yes i think it aposs interesting to everybody in the country anybody who aposs lived through that period and curious about american history given what president bush said about our politics these days being so open to conspiracy theory fabrication wouldn apost it be something if ted cruz aposs dad really was involved i mean this apparently president trump perino we could find out we could find out williams but here aposs the thing dana so according to a 1992 law regarding the kennedy assassination everything is supposed to be released by thursday the final papers you aposve got about 3 000 files still there and then there are other papers that that have things that have been redacted maybe they would be fully released now and there aposs some resistance on the part of mike pompeo the cia director because apparently these papers involve the activities of cia people cia agents who were looking at lee harvey oswald in mexico city his ties to the cubans to russia and the like and it could be that you have some sources methods of operations revealed maybe even some negligence by cia officials but in terms of real revelation about why lee harvey oswald acted and what happen it doesn apost seem to be there according to historians perino matt do you want to see them released continetti i do it aposs interesting as an historian but look president bush president trump in 2000 said his base were readers of the national enquirer this is a perfect move for his base because the national enquirer is going to love what comes out of these files williams yes conspiracy theories a little better a little better than the than the b
