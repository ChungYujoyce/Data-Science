apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap president donald trump on tuesday wholly misrepresented the u s record on international trade disputes incorrectly accused house democrats of denying him lawyers in impeachment proceedings and dismissed as a mysterious rumor his own statement from months ago about britain s health system here s a look at some of his statements from london where s he is attending a nato meeting trade top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state trump we won in the world trade organization we won seven and a half billion dollars we never used to win before me because before me the united states was a sucker for all of these different organizations remarks with nato secretary general jens stoltenberg the facts he is wildly wrong to state that the u s never won victories in disputes taken to the trade organization before him the u s has always had a high success rate when it pursues cases against other countries at the wto in 2017 trade analyst daniel ikenson of the libertarian cato institute found that the u s won 91 of the cases it took to the geneva based trade monitor as ikenson noted countries bringing complaints to the organization tend to win because they don t bother going to the wto in the first place if they don t have a strong case as for his claim that the u s won 7 5 billion from the wto that s not quite right trump was referring to a wto decision in october siding with the u s on imposing tariffs on 7 5 billion worth of european imports annually the value of the tariffs on those imports is much less than 7 5 billion the wto announcement culminated a 15 year fight over eu subsidies for airbus a fight that began long before trump was in office impeachment trump for the hearings we don t get a lawyer remarks with canadian prime minister justin trudeau the facts trump is wrong about being deprived of an attorney in the house judiciary committee hearings the committee has invited trump and his lawyers to appear if he wishes but so far the white house has refused in a letter sunday to judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler d n y white house counsel pat cipollone declined the invitation for the president s counsel to appear wednesday while trump is at the nato summit insisting that the inquiry violates basic due process rights trump has until friday to decide whether he would take advantage of due process protections afforded to him under house rules adopted in october for hearings next week including the right to request witness testimony and to cross examine the witnesses called by the house cipollone has demanded more information from democrats on how they intended to conduct further hearings before trump would decide whether to participate in those hearings if the house impeaches trump the senate trial will look like a normal trial in some respects with senators as the jury arguments would be heard from each side s legal team for and against trump s removal from office the intelligence committee hearings in contrast were like the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the person under investigation trump on whether acting chief of staff mick mulvaney and secretary of state mike pompeo should testify we don t get any witnesses this is a fix i want them to testify but i want them to testify in the senate where they ll get a fair trial remarks with trudeau the facts he s incorrect that the intelligence committee hearings only brought forward witnesses hand picked by the democratic majority on the panel several were invited at the request of republicans on the committee while trump and his gop allies have limited ability to bring forward witnesses in the judiciary committee the president also says he wouldn t want to send any witnesses until the senate impeachment trial anyway islamic state trump we have a tremendous amount of captured fighters isis fighters over in syria and they re all under lock and key but many are from france many are from germany many are from u k they are mostly from europe remarks with french president emmanuel macron macron there are very large number of fighters isis fighters coming from syria from iraq and the region those from europe are a tiny minority of the overall problem the facts trump is incorrect to say the islamic state fighters who were captured and held by the kurds in syria are mostly from europe of the more than 12 000 is fighters in custody in kurdish areas only 2 500 are from outside the region of the conflict some from europe some from other parts of the world most of the captured fighters about 10 000 are natives of syria or iraq european nations have indeed been reluctant to take detainees who came from europe frustrating trump but such detainees are far fewer than the majority he frequently claims trump on protecting oilfields in syria we have the oil and we can do with the oil what we want remarks with stoltenberg the facts that s not true the oil in syria belongs to syria and the u s can t do anything it wants with it as secretary of state rex tillerson reviewed whether the u s could make money off the oil rich areas and concluded there was no practical way to do so said brett mcgurk trump s former special envoy to the global coalition to defeat the islamic state maybe there are new lawyers now but it was just illegal for an american company to go and seize and exploit these assets mcgurk told a panel on syria held in october by the foundation for defense of democracies stephen vladeck a national security law professor at the university of texas at austin said there is no solid legal argument the trump administration could make if it sought to claim syria s oil while trump has said he will withdraw the bulk of roughly 1 000 american troops from syria he s made clear he will leave some military forces in the country to help secure the oil from any islamic state resurgence the pentagon has said it is committed to sending additional military forces to eastern syria to reinforce control of the oil fields and prevent them from falling back to into the hands of isis or other destabilizing actors britain s health care trump speaking about claims that britain s state funded health care system would be part of future u k u s trade talks i don t even know where that rumor started we have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter we want nothing to do with it remarks with jens stoltenberg the facts he s referring to his own past statements as a rumor asked about the national health service during a visit to britain in june he said when you re dealing in trade everything s on the table so nhs or anything else the service which provides free health care to all britons could in fact be a bargaining chip in u s u k trade talks u s health services firms can already bid for contracts if they have european subsidiaries a future government could increase the amount of private sector involvement or let u s companies bid directly as well the u s could demand during trade talks that britain pay american pharma firms more for drugs medicines became a big issue in negotiations on a revamped north american free trade deal as the u s pushed successfully for tighter restrictions on the development in canada and mexico of generic versions of u s patented drugs leaked documents from preliminary talks between u s and u k negotiators over two years from july 2017 released by the labour party last week said patent issues around nhs access to generic drugs will be a key consideration in talks it s an overstatement to say the national health service as a whole would be up for sale as labour has alleged will happen if prime minister boris johnson s conservatives win the dec 12 election and try to strike a post brexit trade deal with the u s britain would not be selling off the health service as labour asserts because taxpayers would still be footing the bill but it s also improbable to think u s negotiators would want nothing to do with britain s health care market despite
