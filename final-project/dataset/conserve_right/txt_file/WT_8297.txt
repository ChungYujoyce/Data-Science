countered it with a confucius quote a gentleman is open and poised a petty man is unhappy and worried geng elaborated that those who are above board will have their rights guaranteed in china while people with an ulterior motive to engage in illegal activities may have to be extremely cautious the u k s foreign and commonwealth office said it is urgently seeking further information about cheng who has worked for the consulate since december 2017 as an international trade and investment officer for the scottish government neither we nor simon s family have been able to speak to him since detention the office said that is our priority and we continue to raise simon s case repeatedly in china hong kong and london and have sought to make contact with simon himself geng said that cheng s

following rallies by lawyers teachers and medical workers one participant sarah wong said accountants are usually quiet because they are focused on getting the numbers right but they cannot remain silent anymore kenneth leung a lawmaker who represents the accounting industry said that the extradition bill would have affected accountants because many of them have clients in mainland china and travel there the legislation would have allowed suspects to be extradited to the mainland to face trial the profession as a whole needs to come out to express their concerns and grievances he said rebecca sy the cathay dragon union head told a news conference that the hong kong airline had dismissed her without giving a reason but that the firing came after she was pulled from a flight and

participate as a trade union leader the canadian government updated its travel advice for china to warn of stepped up border checks on smartphones following reports that chinese immigration officers
