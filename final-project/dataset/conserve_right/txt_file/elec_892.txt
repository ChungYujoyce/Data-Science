over to the popular side of an issue said david alexrod a democratic strategist who advised president obama s bids for the white house on cnn the great risk though her great liability in this race so

on trade depending on the politics she s been a little more consistent though late compared to other democrats in her shift on same sex marriage in the 2008 campaign she openly opposed it instead offering civil unions as an acceptable compromise of legal protection for same sex couples denied the ability to marry their partners well i prefer to think of it as being very positive about civil unions mrs clinton said in a debate sponsored by the human rights campaign and the gay oriented logo network you know it s a personal position how we get to full equality is the debate we re having and i am absolutely in favor of civil unions with full equality of benefits rights and privileges only after leaving her position as secretary of state and as the supreme court was considering overturning the defense of marriage act that her husband signed into law did mrs clinton change her stance lgbt americans are our colleagues our teachers our soldiers our friends our loved ones and they are full and equal citizens and they deserve the rights of citizenship mrs clinton said in a video with the human rights campaign on march 18 2013 as she was laying the groundwork for her next presidential bid that includes marriage that s why i support marriage for lesbian and gay couples in the 2008 campaign mrs clinton was steadfast in defending her vote to invade iraq a vote mr obama

little lake called lake winola outside of scranton and taught me how to shoot when i was a little girl she said on the campaign trail adding some people now continue to teach their children and their grandchildren it s part of culture it s part of a way of life people enjoy hunting and shooting because it s an important part of who they are not because they are bitter making a play for rural voters in an effort to overcome mr obama s young urban coalition mrs clinton also said blanket federal rules weren t the answer last week however in the wake of another mass shooting mrs clinton vowed to go further than mr obama in taking executive action to limit gun ownership on immigration mrs clinton is also revising her previous stance last debate cycle mrs clinton offered a confusing answer of whether she supported states issuing licenses to illegal immigrants in the oct 2007 debate she was asked whether or not she favored then new york gov eliot spitzer s plan to provide undocumented with state licenses do i think this is the right thing for any governor to do no but i certainly recognize why gov spitzer is trying to do it mrs clinton said during the debate after the debate and after mr spitzer withdrew the proposal because of its unpopularity mrs clinton made the following statement as president i will not support driver s licenses for undocumented people and will press for comprehensive immigration reform that deals with all of the issues around illegal immigration including border security and fixing our broken system but as the power of hispanic voters increases mrs
