thanks for contacting us we ve received your submission opinion by michael fumento submit january 23 2020 8 29pm updated january 24 2020 1 58pm a cnn reporter broadcasts from wuhan china on the recent viral outbreak there is nobody near who could possibly infect him unless the cameraman has guinness book of records coughs and sneezes so why does he insist on wearing a blue surgical mask while talking it s called drama which is badly needed because there appears to be nothing very special about this outbreak of the 2019 ncov or wuhan virus it should actually be called the dvv or d j vu virus because we have been through these hysterias before over and over heterosexual aids ebola repeatedly the h1n1 swine flu that was actually vastly milder than the regular flu and especially severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 once you start debunking mass hysteria over outbreaks it gets easy because the same patterns repeat themselves the best remedy for all epidemic hysteria is perspective how is this new outbreak different and thus potentially more dangerous from other diseases we have dealt with in the past or are dealing with now wuhan is repeatedly labeled deadly but so is every other virus most people know about but especially deadly nearly 600 cases have been confirmed with at least 17 reported deaths an infected american is reportedly doing well it s probably true that the death toll is understated but it s guaranteed the infection number is probably as with say flu the vast majority of those infected have such slight symptoms they don t seek medical attention for that reason a comparison to the us flu death rate is also very difficult as a share of hospitalizations the regular flu death rate is 8 5 percent to 17 percent according to the centers for disease control and prevention considerably higher than for wuhan but counting all estimated illnesses reported and estimated it s much lower what we can say for sure is that wuhan will be a lot worse in china simply because health care there is vastly inferior it appears that like flu wuhan usually kills through often treatable secondary infections well treatable in the west you d be surprised at how many potentially deadly diseases malaria tb americans get that wreak havoc in much of the world but kill essentially none of us it also appears those most likely to die of wuhan virus fit the same profile as flu fatalities people over 65 those with compromised immune systems and those with serious pre existing conditions two of the 17 wuhan dead were 89 year olds with pre existing conditions the youngest was 48 and suffering from diabetes and a stroke contagiousness is highly important of course but so far there is no evidence that wuhan first reported more than three weeks ago is more contagious than influenza or spreads differently those are the important factors everything else is noise and tinfoil hat paranoia we are breathlessly told it s spread from human to human again most of the contagious diseases we think of are spread between humans with some exceptions such as rabies it s inherently bad because it s new we re told so were swine flu and sars chinese health officials warned it could mutate further to either become more deadly or more contagious same was said about the aforementioned outbreaks actually viruses usually mutate to become less deadly to preserve the host body and hence themselves the media are correct in saying the closest comparison here is sars it also was first reported in china and was what s called a coronavirus but while they want you to remember sars as akin to the black death with cries of bring out your dead fact is there was a grand total of only 8 098 cases of whom 774 died then the disease simply disappeared more than 7 000 of those cases and about 650 of the deaths occurred just in mainland china and hong kong the united states had just 75 cases and zero deaths by contrast the cdc estimates about 80 000 americans died of flu two seasons ago so if you want buy a probably worthless surgical mask to play twins with those courageous tv newsmen or you may consider that flu shots are still available michael fumento is an attorney journalist and author and has been reporting on epidemic hysterias since 1986 fumento gmail com read next why would anyone take over after andy byford fled the mta read next why would anyone take over after andy byford fled the mta share selection stay informed with our coronavirus daily update newsletter read latest updates this story has been shared 358 426 times 358 426 this story has been shared 262 314 times 262 314 this story has been shared 176 443 times 176 443 this story has been shared 161 994 times 161 994 2020 nyp holdings inc all rights reserved terms of use privacy notice your ad choices sitemap california privacy rights do not sell my personal information would you like to receive desktop browser notifications about breaking news and other major stories not now yes please
