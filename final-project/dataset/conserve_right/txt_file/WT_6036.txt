newsletter solely into a vehicle for talking about the disease the coronavirus has sickened thousands quarantined millions and sent financial markets reeling all while some cultural critics say the story is overblown it s hard to tell people to put something into context and to calm down when the actions being taken in many cases are very strong or unprecedented said glen nowak director of the grady college center for health and risk communication at the university of georgia but that s what journalists in charge of coverage say they need to do we have been providing a lot of explainers q and a s trying to lay out in clear simple language what the symptoms are and what the disease means for people said jon fahey health and science editor at the ap fear is a natural response when people read about millions of people locked down in china he said yet it s also true that right now the individual risk to people is very small late last week the times vivian wang tried to illustrate some of the complexities in writing about a disease that has struck more than 80 000 people with a death toll approaching 3 000 most people have mild symptoms good fortune that paradoxically can make the

tends to decline in these situations said peter sandman a consultant and expert in risk communication reporters love to sensationalize trivia or rare risks think flesh eating bacteria to give their audience a vicarious thrill sandman said but when risks get serious and widespread media coverage gets sober the words and actions of journalists and other public figures send signals of their own cnn

his family has to remain home for any period of time people could be frightened by that gupta conceded it s not the intent it s in the way that you convey these things it was news last week and also a little scary when it was revealed that a federal health official had checked on the coronavirus readiness of her child s school district donald g mcneil a science reporter at the new york times attracted attention for talking about his own preparedness on the newspaper s podcast the daily i spend a lot of time thinking about whether i m being too alarmist or whether i m not being alarmist
