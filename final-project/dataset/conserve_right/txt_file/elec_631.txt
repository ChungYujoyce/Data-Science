fiorina explained why she s not ready to send 10 000 troops to the middle east just yet during an interview with the fox business network s stuart varney the false choice that obama presents to the american people is if you don t agree with what i am not doing then the only option is tens of thousands of boots on the ground it s simply false she said she criticized the obama administration for not supplying middle east allies with support sooner we ve had a fairly effective bombing campaign over the last couple of days why haven t we been doing that for a year and a half because we ve had

germany 70 years ago today it was a pivot point in western history in which crimes against humanity would be addressed by the victorious side in a war rather than either rough justice at the end of a rope or unaccountability as part of a treaty the america idea was that offenders would be fairly tried before they were sent to the gallows but following proper protocols meant that the accused prisoners would have to be afforded access to clergy but who would sign up to minister to some of the most despicable creatures in history author tim townsend shares the story of a pastor and a priest

comes to theology politicians are pretty dire when it comes to the theology of islam american politicians are the pits good intentions have led many astray since the start of the current war with islamist militants president obama has been one of the prime offenders often expounding on what islam really is and isn t the president took plenty of heat for his head snapping claim last year that the islamic state is not islamic wanting neither to dignify isis as a legitimate power nor to suggest that there is any clash between the islam and the west obama runs in circles the west is not at war with islamists therefore the islamists with which the west is at war must not really be muslims poof the relative merits of an enemy s theology would seem to be no matter for an american president s attention but it has become a gag reflex for democrats when confronted with escalations of the ongoing struggle this has a cousin in the oft heard argument from westerners and non muslims about what moderate muslims ought to do as if muslims were waiting for cues from bill maher on what direction their religion ought to take which brings us to hillary clinton united methodist presumptive democratic nominee and now amateur theologian and sociologist in her speech calling for an escalation of the war against isis clinton explained who muslims are muslims are peaceful and tolerant people

election runoff saturday after a brutal battle for the governor s mansion between democrat john bel edwards and republican sen david vitter edwards seemed to be cruising to the finish line powered a vicious attack ad aimed at vitter s involvement in a 2008 prostitution scandal debates have been a bloodbath with edwards and vitter calling each other liars before a heckling crowd in their final faceoff on tuesday but the focus in the state as elsewhere has turned to current national security concerns after the paris attacks and vitter is seizing on the syrian refugee issue to tie edwards to president obama s isis woes a pac backing vitter is running a chilling ad that points to edwards partnering with obama noting refugees have already been relocated in the state and the risks of a new influx to louisiana come saturday the party hopes the focus on current issues translates into a redo of the outcome in kentucky s gubernatorial race last month where what was predicted to be a close contest turned out to be a resounding victory for republican matt bevin vitter s challenge seems to be substantially greater however there s been a dearth of reliable polling and runoffs pose special challenges on turnout models but a university of new orleans poll taken a week after the oct 24 primary election showed edwards with a 22 point lead early snapshot wsj early voting has jumped significantly in louisiana s race for governor up 58 compared to 2011 giving democrats some reasons for cautious optimism in a race with national implications by any modern political calculus it s the
