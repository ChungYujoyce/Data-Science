is set for direct talks between president trump and north korea s kim jong un insight from cia director mike pompeo this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday march 11 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated john roberts guest host i aposm john roberts in for chris wallace they have traded insults and threats of war now the stage is set for direct talks between president trump and north korea aposs kim jong un begin videotape mike pence vice president of the united states we will continue to apply maximum pressure until north korea abandons its nuclear program once and for all roberts we aposll discuss what aposs bringing both sides to the table for this unprecedented meeting and what it says about the president aposs approach to foreign diplomacy with cia director mike pompeo then president trump leaves wiggle room for allies in his announcement of new tariffs on steel and aluminum donald trump president of the united states it aposs going to be very fair to other countries especially those that treat as well roberts we aposll discuss the impact on jobs and the global economy with massachusetts senator elizabeth warren in her first fox news sunday appearance plus from the departure of gary cohn trump he maybe a globalist but i still like him roberts to the latest on the mueller investigation and the lawsuit from stormy daniels we aposll ask our sunday panel about the state of play in the trump white house all right now on fox news sunday end videotape roberts and hello again from fox news in washington where president trump made bold moves this week on trade and diplomacy with global implications first enacting tariffs on imported steel and aluminum over the objections of many in his own party but leaving the door open for exemptions for some of america aposs closest allies then accepting an invitation to sit down with north korea aposs kim jong un begin videotape roberts it would be the first face to face encounter between the two countries apos leaders and while the talks have the potential to mark a breakthrough in tensions with north korea there are plenty of risks and preconditions before that could happen sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary we are making no concessions and we are not going to move forward until we see concrete and verified action taking place by north korea roberts secretary of state rex tillerson on a weeklong trip to africa appeared caught off guard rex tillerson secretary of state we are a long ways from negotiations i think it aposs we just to need to be very clear eyed and realistic about it president trump has said for some time that he was open to talks and he would willingly meet with kim jong un when conditions were right and the time is right and i think in the president aposs judgment that time has arrived now roberts just a few short months ago insults were flying between the two leaders with kim calling the president a mentally deranged dotard and the president firing back trump north korea best not make any more threats to the united states they will be met with fire and fury rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime he is a sick puppy end videotape roberts no time or place has been set for what would certainly be a historic meeting and of course north korea has a long and rich track record of making promises and then breaking them we aposll discuss at all this hour with democratic senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts and cia director mike pompeo let aposs begin here in washington with director pompeo welcome back to fox news sunday good to see you mike pompeo cia director good morning john good to be with you roberts so between thursday night when the president or the white house made the announcement that he aposd be meeting with kim jong un and on friday afternoon the white house seemed to shift a little bit sarah huckabee sanders saying that we need to see concrete and verifiable actions before meeting takes place the nsc later said she wasn apost putting preconditions on a meeting but should there be preconditions for such a meeting pompeo john i think it aposs important to step back to remember how we got to this place for an awfully long time america whistled past the graveyard while the north korea regime including this particular leader continued to develop their nuclear weapons program this administration came in the president talked about at this campaign and put enormous pressure on the north korean economy and on the north korean leadership that gave us this opportunity where kim jong un now has committed to stopping nuclear testing stopping missile tests allowing exercises to go forward something that has been incredibly contentious in the past and at the same time saying that the denuclearization complete verifiable irreversible denuclearization as a topic for discussion and that aposs when kim jong un said i aposd like to meet with the president the president made the decision it was the right time to begin that conversation roberts so again should there be any preconditions put on a meeting what do you think kim needs to do in order to get that big meeting he aposs been looking for with the u s president pompeo john i just mentioned that aposs what he said he can apost conduct nuclear testing he aposs got to stop the missile testing that he aposs been hard at for the last years he aposs got to continue to allow us to perform our militarily necessary exercises on the peninsula and then he aposs got to make sure that he leaves on the table that discussion for denuclearization these are these are real achievements these are conditions that the north korean regime has never submitted to in exchange for conversations you know john i had a chance this weekend to reread the history the cia history of the negotiations that have taken the place over the last decades i aposll admit i took a couple of hours to watch wichita state basketball but i reread them never before had we had the north koreans in the position where their economy was at such risk and whether leadership was under such pressure that they would begin conversations on the terms that kim jong un has conceded to at this time roberts so what are we willing to give him in exchange for concessions pompeo nothing you mean for the discussion crosstalk roberts are we willing to give a guarantee that we are not going to try to overthrow the regime as secretary of state tillerson said last year are we willing to ease some sanctions what are we willing to do pompeo yes look these discussions will play out over time this first meeting i think is between the president and the leader of north korea the two people who are the decision makers who will ultimately decide what arrangements are acceptable but make no mistake about it while these negotiations are going on there will be no concessions made the activity of this administration to disrupt the north korean economy to put pressure on north korea to galvanize the world in a way that you have countries from the middle east to europe and asia placing sanctions on the north korean regime those will continue and we will see how the talks and the negotiations proceed roberts intelligence experts remind me that the cia does personality profiles of global leaders all the time what can you tell us about kim jong un aposs cia personality profile pompeo yes so we know a fair amount about him we know that he is rational in the sense of the response to stimulus we have seen this we aposve watched this at administration apply pressure and now we aposve watched him come to the negotiating table the cia has an important role as these conversations take place we need to make sure that we can inform the president of the history of deceit of this regime where they have committed to things in the agreed ph framework and that subsequently we need to make sure that we go into this discussion understanding those risks the nature of kim jong un himself he aposs still a very young leader but clearly in charge of his country those are the kinds of things that we can share publicly about him and president trump is now committed to having at least a first conversation roberts so i aposm curious the president aposs tough minded approach to north korea the things he said the things he tweeted about where those informed by your personality profile of kim or did the president just freelance ph on that pompeo well the president had in his mind even during the campaign that north korea was an enormous challenge but i brief the president nearly every day and we have shared with the president every bit of information we have about the country about its economy about its missile systems roberts about what he might react crosstalk pompeo about how kim jong un might react and how north korea might respond how the globe might respond and the president has built an enormous coalition aimed at the singular outcome which is the denuclearization of the peninsula roberts so where do they meet pompeo i don apost know roberts what would what needs to be taken into consideration when discussing where they would meet i mean you wouldn apost i assumed they wouldn apost either meet in north korea or the united states probably not south korea either geneva reykjavik as gorbachev and reagan did pompeo it seems to me john a lot less important about where they meet than the substance of the discussion and i think that aposs different too president trump isn apost doing this for theater he aposs going to solve a problem and so the location of the meeting will determine the exact timing of the meeting the president and the team will figure out but what aposs most important is what aposs discussed and the clarity and the strength and resolve of this president and this administration to achieve the outcomes that america so desperately deserves roberts let aposs move on to russia president vladimir putin did an interview with nbc in the last few days in which he says he could not care less if russians try to hack the u s election because the people who were doing the hacking were not connected to the kremlin no connection to the kremlin what does the cia know about that pompeo that aposs false roberts so tell me what you know pompeo the russians attempted to interfere in the united states election in 2016 they also did so before that there aposs a long history of russian efforts to influence the united states and conduct influence operations against the united states and it was russians who actually engaged in this not somebody from outside of the country or disconnected from russia roberts but when you say russians russians with ties to the kremlin russian with ties to putin aposs regime pompeo yes roberts so do we know if their efforts actually affected the outcome of the election pompeo yes intelligence community has been clear that aposs not our role to discuss that but there aposs not been a single indication that any vote was changed that ballots were tampered with or that there was any outcome determined by the intelligence community the intelligence community has simply said that aposs not our role to make that determination roberts is it fair to say you don apost really know for sure pompeo the intelligence community aposs role is very clear we talk about the things that happened what the russians did what the other actors not just russians have done historically in the united states to try and impact and influence america american leaders that aposs our function we will stick to that roberts all right the president said over and over again last year and in the campaign that there was no collusion with the russians he continues to say that has the cia uncovered any intelligence that would suggest the trump campaign did collude with russia or try to influence the election pompeo john there are multiple investigations taking place cia and white house have cooperated with those investigations i don apost have anything to add to that discussion roberts putin bragged last week that he aposs got two new nuclear weapons with first rate capability one a hypersonic reentry vehicle for an intercontinental ballistic missile the other a nuclear powered cruise missile that has virtually unlimited range is he just blowing smoke or is that true pompeo vladimir putin says lots of things that are without foundation i don apost want to comment precisely on the details i aposll say that there was literally nothing that he said in a speech that surprised the intelligence community or the cia we are following and tracking all of this very closely as are our brothers of the department of defense and americans should rest assured that we have a very good understanding of the russian programs and how to make sure that americans continue to be kept safe from threats from vladimir putin roberts if he has such weapons doesn apost change the game at all i mean russia has got enough nukes that they could probably overwhelm our defenses anyways pompeo each time there aposs an advance in anyone aposs weapon systems russians weapon system chinese weapon systems america is required to make sure that we have defenses that respond to them as technology advances not only the weapon system that he described but cyber weapons as well america has a responsibility and national security team is fully engaged in making sure that we aposre prepared to protect america from those threats from whatever regime that presents them roberts you mentioned china let aposs take a take turn to china the chinese leadership there just recently made a change where xi jinping can stay on past a second term which is supposed to end in 2023 are we headed back to the bad old days of single person leadership the days of mao zedong in china and what are the implications of that pompeo so it aposs the case that xi jinping has created an enormous personal power he has taken many of the levers of power that were from time to time more dispersed but from america aposs perspective this administration has been very clear of pushing back against the chinese threat if you look at the president aposs national security strategy it was very clear that what the chinese are doing whether that aposd be on trade or the theft of intellectual property or their continued advancement in east and south china seas this administration is prepared and engaged in pushing back against the chinese threats so that we can have a good relationship with china in a way that the world desperately needs roberts i want to finish up with one question about the process several business writers caught this and wrote about it peter navarro who is the white house director of trade and industrial policy talking about the president aposs imposition of tariffs the other day say quote my function really is an economist is to try to provide the underlying analytics that confirm his the president aposs intuition and his intuition is always right in these matters the suggestion is that the president makes a decision about something and navarro finds the facts to back it up does that apply to the intelligence community as well pompeo of course not we are doing our level best to speak the truth each and every day when it comes to trade we are most focus on national security piece of that crosstalk pompeo we try to inform the president as best our incredibly capable team at the cia can about the facts and the data the risks the opportunities that are presented the relative cost and we provide those to president trump each and every day in an unvarnished way and the president then makes his decision based on those facts roberts director pompeo thanks for joining us today we aposll see you around the neighborhood pompeo thank you john roberts always good to see you up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss how the latest grand jury testimonies can shape special counsel robert mueller aposs russia probe stay with us commercial break begin video clip mike pence vice president of the united states progress is being made a meeting is being planned but the world should know this north korea should know this all options are on the table end video clip roberts all options on the table vice president mike pence on the president aposs bombshell agreement for a historic face to face meeting with the leader of north korea and it aposs time now for our sunday group jason riley from the wall street journal columnist for the hill juan williams catherine lucey who covers the white house for the associated press yes she shares my sentence and charles hurt the opinion editor for the washington times just kidding it aposs the best job in the world catherine lucey white house reporter the associated press it is laughter roberts let me throw a jump ball up there this meeting with kim jong un is it ever going to happen lucey i think that aposs a good question right now isn apost it i mean there aposs a lot of things we haven apost heard about time place ground rules and the president is clearly signaling you know we saw his rally last night and on twitter that he wants to do it but there aposs a lot of folks out there questioning how is it going to work jason riley the wall street journal this is better than shouting insults over twitter at north korea so crosstalk roberts unless the shouting insults is what got you to this point riley but the question is what are we getting in in return for this what are the concessions that we aposre getting just for the meeting for kim and for north korea the meeting is itself a very very big deal that he can use as propaganda back home i aposm on level with the president of the united states but we don apost want them to be allowed to get away with that we want something in return and it aposs not clear to me what exactly we are getting in return charles hurt opinion editor the washington times i think kind of one of the scarier questions is not just does the meeting occur but what happens after the meeting and if they don apost arrive at something that you know is acceptable to the world and to us where do we go from there is the only option that remains a military one juan williams fox news political analyst so what strikes me here john is that rex tillerson is very transparent and open in saying as our lead diplomat of the world as secretary of state we aposre a long way from negotiations we just agreed to talks to a meeting and it came as a surprise to us says rex tillerson which means that the trump administration wasn apost tapped into the idea oh yes our rhetoric is forcing him to the bargaining table and he is now ready to make a deal that aposs not what happened what happened was very dramatic i think you were there the president sticks his head into the briefing room a big announcement is coming it plays to the idea i think that president trump wants the eyes of the world on him that he aposs going to do something hopefully that his predecessors failed to do and he aposs going to be able to say i did it roberts jason was talking about how we got here senator tim scott of south carolina thinks that the president played this pitch perfect all the way along listen here begin video clip sen tim scott r south carolina here aposs what we saw in january we are seeing the manifestation of it now presidential hubris how do you deal with the north korean bully you aposve got to have hubris and our president is the right person at the right time in the right place end video clip roberts so all of this talk about little rocket man and fire and fury and all that catherine it sounds like it was a strategy borne of hubris crosstalk lucey the white house aposs argument is that both the pressure campaign and the rhetoric got us to this point i think the thing also that we see and we saw this on that very dramatic day that played out on thursday i mean this really speaks to the president aposs belief that he as a negotiator can do things here differently than past presidents and this idea he said in the end his speech at the convention i alone can fix it so his idea that he can take different skills in to this conversation that other people roberts did you have to do it differently because what we aposve done in the past all the way back to 1994 didn apost work williams well true but it aposs also still the case that what we know about the north korean dictator is that he doesn apost keep his word he lies frequently so we don apost know exactly what is going to come of this my concern as an american is the president aposs strategy does the president have a strategy going into this it aposs not clear to me that he does and all this talk about hubris i don apost know i think it was the south korean leader who had the teams marching together at the olympics and said i want to have talks president trump had been saying no let aposs not let aposs just put the sanctions sanctions however i think may have made a difference hurt but i do think you have to give the president credit not only for the sanctions increasing sanctions and putting pressure on china but also for some of the wild talk you know as he choked himself you know negotiating with the madman well that aposs kim jong un aposs problem not his but you know there aposs so much that happens in washington just sort of gets bog down in this analysis paralysis and i do think that sometimes whether it aposs you know cutting regulations or cutting taxes or you know tough talk with a lunatic like this it does sort of break the logjam roberts time is ticking away i want to get another issue while we still got the time the russia investigation manafort pleaded not guilty cory lewandowski testified before the house intelligence committee he called it a quote waste of time adam schiff complained that he refused to answer some questions saturday night live did a skit where the jeff sessions character said i can apost give you collusion where are we going down with this riley well it doesn apost seem to be winding down which is the rhetoric that have been coming out of the white house for sometime oh by thanksgiving oh by new year aposs now we see the white house legal team being beefed up or reports that crosstalk roberts that aposs true it aposs not going to happen is what i aposm told riley ok roberts moments ago my text message told me it aposs not happening laughter riley but it doesn apost look like this investigation is winding down it also doesn apost look like mueller is any closer to proving collusion between russia none of this manafort stuff which has to do with fraud and business ties show this still no evidence of any collusion but the drip drip drip continues of course to be a strain on the administration lucey yes of course i don apost think we know what mueller knows or what he aposs doing right now exactly which just know the little pieces in terms of what he has publicly released and what has been leaked out to the press so i think we aposre a long way from getting a full picture of that investigation but yes the point is right it continues to shadow this white house and continues to frustrate this president roberts the fact juan that mueller it seems to be nibbling on the edges here with you know the financial dealings as opposed to the actual core of the issue which is collusion is that a suggestion that if he hasn apost found it yet and made a charge about that he aposs not going to williams no i think we don apost know the big news this week it aposs hard to remember so much happens in a week in washington but sam nunberg who was at the edge of all this he refused remember he went on every tv channel in america and he said oh i aposm not going to cooperate with the grand jury and then somehow with a threat of jail starting at his face he did at the end of the week but he said he thinks based on the questioning that mueller has something we don apost know at this point roberts we aposve got to wrap speaking of how fast time passes one of my producers said to me the other day gary cohn did he resign last year or two years ago we got to take a break here we aposll get you back in just a little bit when we come back senator elizabeth warren a critic of the administration on this week aposs moves on north korea and trade and what she has planned for her political future commercial break roberts coming up florida aposs passes sweeping gun legislation less than a month after the parkland shooting begin video clip gov rick scott r florida we got legislation passed and enacted that aposs how our government should work i mean you go elect people you expect them to represent you get things done end video clip roberts we aposll ask our sunday panel if congress will follow suit coming up on fox news sunday commercial break roberts she is a rising star in the democratic party known for her progressive ideas and fierce criticism of president donald trump the senior senator from massachusetts is touted as the potential candidate for president in 2020 elizabeth warren joins us now from boston senator welcome finally to fox news sunday good to have you here sen elizabeth warren d massachusetts thank you it aposs good to be here thank you for having me i appreciate the invitation roberts let aposs start first of all about north korea you have been very critical of president trump and his policies on north korea the day after he stood up at the u n and declared that kim jong un was quote little rocket man you said quote trying to bait a unstable dictator who has nuclear weapons is not a strategy that makes america safer would you now acknowledge though after the news that came out late thursday night that the president aposs combination of tough talk and maximum pressure through international sanctions has in fact come close to bringing north korea to the table warren so i am very glad to see the trump administration turn in the direction of diplomacy and the principal reason for that is because there is no military only solution to north korea and this not just what i say this is what our own generals who are experts in the area and responsible for the area say so that means we really do need strong diplomacy here but these are very complex negotiations so i aposm very concerned about the fact that the state department has so many vacancies that much of the staff at the state department has been decimated we have no ambassador right now to south korea the assistant secretary in charge of this area that aposs another vacant post and this is important because these are the people who know the economy who know the language who know the history who know our military needs so i am very concerned that the president may be taking advantage of here i want to see the president succeed it is important for the defense of the united states it is important for the security of the entire world but i aposm worried about going into these negotiations without a strategy and without a strong full state department to back him up roberts senator lindsey graham of south carolina who has found himself on the opposite end of the table of what president trump many times in terms of opinion issued a warning to kim jong un saying if you try to play president trump that aposs going to be the end of you and the end of your regime senator graham doesn apost seem to have any concerns that the president is going to get played here why do you warren well you know one of the things we have to remember is that the kim family dictator after dictator for generations now has been holding for a face to face negotiation with an american president this is the big prize for them just being able to be in the same picture with him and a reason for this is the kims have seen this as an opportunity both to legitimize their dictatorship and to legitimize their nuclear weapons program so my view on this is before you let them have that big prize before you announce that you aposre committed by a time certain to go to that prize what we need to do is make sure that the north korean regime has made real steps toward freezing their nuclear program and steps toward winding down their nuclear program and not just promises but actual verifiable steps that we in the united states can see roberts which we aposre warren they shouldn apost be able to get the prize of meeting with the president unless they aposve taken those kinds of steps roberts which raises the question though how would you senators suggest that that be verified how do you verify something in north korea warren well that aposs the point the north koreans have to be willing to open the door and if they aposre not willing to verify then let aposs go back to the history we have with north korea promise after promise after promise after promise that they have broken if we let them have a prize just based on a bunch of promises knowing that they aposve broken every promise in the past then shame on this administration shame on the united states we have to say you all have to be willing to open up so that we can verify if they aposre not willing to do that then they aposre not willing to take steps roberts let aposs move on to trade the president as you know slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum or restarted the 15 day countdown clock ahead of the announcement you said quote the proposed tariffs take the right approach but they target a narrow section of the economy and put our allies in the same boat as countries like china that cheat constantly on trade all the while the administration ignores the root of the problem now the president started off by exempting canada and mexico at least for the time being also said he aposd be open to other exemptions has he met you half way here warren so i was very glad to see what the president had done look i have been a critic for a long time about u s trade policy my view is that we have negotiated one deal after another that has been great for big multinational corporations and been lousy for american workers lousy for american small businesses often not even good for american consumers so what i aposd like to see us do is rethink our whole trade strategy and i aposm not afraid of using tariffs as part of that trade strategy and i was glad when after i made that statement that the president distinguished our allies from china and said wait a minute we have to do something different here but you can apost do this it aposs just a little tiny piece of the economy or a small piece of the economy it aposs got to be part of an overall trade strategy that puts american workers american small businesses first that aposs what i really want to see roberts is that not what the president is doing warren well he aposs got two industries in front of him he started out with an announcement that was going to apply to everyone our enemies and our friends alike i think what it takes is you got to think about trade in a much broader way it aposs very much about tariffs but it aposs also the negotiations for example have been about things like intellectual property rights and copyrights and access to domestic markets roberts but senator he is talking about all of that let aposs turn to another subject we have minimal time here so let me warren and i hope he does ok roberts let me move to a topic that i know is very much in your wheelhouse warren sure roberts the banking bill some nine years warren yes roberts after the stock market hit a low after the economic collapse the senate is poised to roll back some obama era banking rules with the help of 17 democratic senators let aposs listen to what you said last week on the senate floor about that begin video clip warren in the next few days with broad support among republicans and far too much support among democrats the senate is on the verge of passing a bill that puts american families in danger of that same devastation all over again end video clip roberts one of those 17 democrats supporting that is your colleague from virginia mark warner who said the bill is mostly focused on community banks and credit unions my state aposs lost 30 percent of such institutions that does not help grow the economy particularly in smaller communities the implication here by virtue of your opposition is that you aposre ok with losing community banks and credit unions warren of course not and we have been in agreement for a very long time the democrats on the senate banking committee that we need relief for community banks and if this bill had been about nothing but community banks i think it would sail through with very little opposition but what this bill does is it takes 25 of the 40 largest banks in america banks that collectively received 50 billion in taxpayer bailout and nobody went to jail for any part of it and says let aposs just treat them like community banks the banks that is a quarter of a trillion dollars is not a community bank and you don apost have to believe me on this the congressional budget office has said if this bill goes through the chances that the american taxpayer will be called on to bail out wall street again go up that aposs not where we want to be this is not good for american taxpayers and it aposs not good for american consumers can we just pause for one minute to remember it wasn apost just the stock market that went down millions of people across this country lost their homes millions lost their jobs millions lost their retirement savings we cannot put the american people at risk for this again particularly when the banks all of the banks are making record breaking profits our job in congress is not to stand up for quarter trillion dollar wall street banks our job in congress is to stand up for the american people roberts let aposs look ahead to the 2018 election in 2020 and senator warren this is your first appearance on fox news sunday i aposd like to give you the opportunity right now to declare if you so choose are you going to run for president in 2020 warren i am not running for president in 2020 i have an election right now in 2018 here in massachusetts and i aposm out there talking to folks all across the bay state i just did my 23rd i think it is town hall in weymouth on saturday my 22nd on friday in springfield you know it aposs a chance to be out and talk to people we really have to be in this fight for our democracy as we go forward and it aposs you know it aposs been an incredible privilege to serve the people of massachusetts to go down to washington and to say i aposm not here to serve the rich and the powerful i aposm not here to fight for an american that works better and better for a thinner and thinner slice at the top i aposm here to fight for working families like the kind of family i grew up in roberts well i know that you aposre looking ahead to november as opposed to 2020 but indulge me a moment here if you would there are many people who are saying should you choose to run in 2020 and one of these groups is the berkshire eagle massachusetts newspaper that endorsed you in 2012 that the issue of your ancestry will come up and they aposre suggesting that you put it to rest saying quote elizabeth warren should screw up her courage and take the spit test a dna test a positive test would permanently resolve the issue while possibly shutting down president trump would you be willing to take a dna test to put this issue to rest warren look let aposs start again where you started i aposm not running for president but let me tell you a little bit about my family you know my mom and dad were born and raised out in oklahoma and my daddy was in his teens when he fell in love with my mother she was a beautiful girl who played the piano and he was head over heels in love with her and wanted to marry her and his family was bitterly opposed to that because she was part native american and eventually my parents eloped and they survived the great depression they survived the dust bowl they went through a lot of hard times they raised three boys my older brothers all of whom went off to the military they raised me they knocked around and it was tough but they hung together they hung together for 63 years i know who i am because of what my mother and my father told me what my grandmother and my grandfather told me what all my aunts and uncles told me and my brothers it aposs a part of who i am and no one aposs ever going to take that away roberts senator warren we aposll leave it there thanks so much for joining us today and on behalf of chris wallace please come back warren thank you i aposd love to roberts all right appreciate it up next attorney jeff sessions sues california over its immigration policies and the nra takes aim at florida aposs new gun law in the wake of the parkland school shooting we aposll bring back the panel to weigh in on both coming up next commercial break begin video clip jeff sessions united states attorney general how dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote a radical open borders agenda libby schaaf d oakland mayor my response to the attorney general statements this morning is as follows how dare you vilify members of our community end video clip roberts attorney general jeff sessions and oakland aposs mayor libby schaaf battling it out over the mayor warning her constituents recently of a coming ice raid the trump administration is now suing california over it aposs so called sanctuary laws the president is heading to california next week where all of this is taking place the department of justice claims that it aposs unconstitutional for the sanctuary cities to exist let aposs listen to a little bit more of what jeff sessions said on fox news begin video clip sessions federal law determines immigration policy the state of california is not entitled to block that activity end video clip roberts so is that a case that he can win jason riley the wall street journal i think you can i think is on very solid ground and i aposm someone who supports comprehensive immigration reform but in this case i think the constitution is very clear the supreme court has been very clear california is trying to block state and local officials from and businesses by the way from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement i think sessions is on very very solid ground here juan williams fox news political analyst i don apost think they aposre trying to block anybody from cooperating the counterargument was an interesting one because remember barack obama went after arizona and the courts that as jason indicated that u s federal law is supreme in the area of immigration but what california is doing is appealing to tenth amendment protections that are very interesting because this goes back to arguments in the civil war about state supremacy and say guess what when it comes to the safety of citizens we do have a right to make the case that if we feel that this is endangering that immigrant communities will not talk to law enforcement that will create dangers and we will do that and similarly nonprofits that detain people we have a right to check on them and make sure they are not dangerous environment charles hurt opinion editor the washington times you have local law enforcement agencies accepting federal grants to help enforce these laws or to house illegals that are detained and then they aposre not doing it that aposs a real problem that aposs not just a tenth amendment thing roberts and what about the idea too that the mayor is saying to illegal immigrants in her city the mayor of oakland is saying to illegal immigrants in her city watch it the feds are coming out for you catherine lucey white house reporter the associated press the conflict is escalating on both sides and continuing right as the president is about to head to california for the first time since he was elected so i aposm interested to see this week what he says when he goes there he is expected to visit the prototypes for the border wall he aposs been trying to do and i think it comes to this moment where really the state is in some ways at war with the trump administration williams i think you aposre surprised you aposre interesting in what he has i can tell you what he aposs going to say lucey yes ok laughter williams oh these immigrants these criminal immigrants they aposre killing americans come on you know the rhetoric roberts i have a question what happened to daca williams well i think roberts and i aposm looking at you because the democrats were like we aposve got to get this done williams right but he is the one who of course set the march deadline right remember back in september i believe it was and then said let aposs force the democrats to the table let aposs make a deal he has put forward a deal that the democrats have rejected and now the courts have intervened and said that he cannot unilaterally just do away with daca at the moment but the question is where is the pressure for a deal and the democrats are right now i think counting on the fact that they can embarrass president trump roberts let aposs move ahead to school safety and guns because the white house is announcing a policy later on today fox news has confirmed that it pretty much includes everything the president has been talking about because he didn apost change his rhetoric that whole lot he aposs going to support this is kind of surprising based on what the nra has been saying recently he aposs going to support raising the minimum age to purchase some firearms long guns from 18 to 21 allow some members of school faculty and staff to be armed he supports banning bump stocks he aposs also got support for improved background checks that aposs the fix nics the cornyn murphy bill supports school safety improvements that aposs to stop school violence act and create a task force to study gun violence so it looks like catherine that he aposs willing to go up against the nra on this issue of raising the age lucey yes i think we need to see the full inaudible of this proposal because i think some of it also might be what is done at the federal versus the state level he aposs urging states to do things roberts yes a lot of this could be statement of support lucey yes exactly they aposre going to support but yes i mean he has made statements in recent weeks that the nra isn apost very happy with although he aposs gone back and forth and so it is hard to tell exactly where this is going to end up riley i also think i mean i aposm very aware of a one size fits all policy coming out of washington on many of these issues gun attitudes vary widely across this country from the south to the north the west the east rural areas versus urban areas i do think that local officials should be allowed to set policies that are going to make people in those communities feel better about how we treat guns roberts and local officials did set policy in florida last week governor rick scott signed a school safety bill which puts in some new gun control measures and he blamed the federal politicians for not doing anything listen here begin video clip gov rick scott r florida if you look at federal government nothing seems to happen there here this horrible thing happened it happened three weeks and two days ago we got legislation passed it aposs enacted that aposs how government should work i mean you go elect people you expect them to represent you get things done end video clip roberts charlie washington is really at the moment doing not much should it be left to the states hurt i roberts when you look at the patchwork of gun laws across the country hurt no i do tend to agree with jason on that the states within limits because obviously we aposre talking the constitutional rights and you know if states are going to pass law if they pass laws that infringe upon your constitutional rights then i think federal government should be involved there but i do think it aposs kind of interesting that you know in the first couple of days after the horrible tragedy donald trump got a lot of heat about talking about arming teachers and which is actually if you take a breath step back a lot of people think that aposs not an unreasonable thing for if you are roberts if they have the proper training hurt exactly and even if you wanted to have special training for roberts you agree juan williams i aposm very uncomfortable with it i wish i knew more hurt he aposs uncomfortable with guns williams i am uncomfortable with guns because i live in a city and you know the biggest threats to my life charlie you lived in the district as well one of these thugs driving by with a gun and they aposre fighting and shooting at each other and they hit me or my family but let aposs up my objection i just don apost know enough but i will say that i know the teachers and police think wow to have teachers armed may not be the best solution so i aposm aware of that roberts all right we aposre going to have to leave it there time for a quick break we aposll be right back though because all eyes are on tuesday aposs special house election in western pennsylvania an election both parties view as a chance to show momentum ahead of the november midterms that and how serious is the stormy daniels scandal coming up next commercial break begin video clip donal trump president of the united states i really feel strongly about rick saccone and i know him i feel strongly about him he aposs an incredible guy joe biden former vice president the man i aposm campaigning for today the highest compliment i can give him or anyone else is he reminds me of my son beau biden end video clip roberts president trump and former vice president biden campaigning in pennsylvania this week as republican rick saccone faces off against democrat connor lamb in a special election in the state aposs 18th congressional district a district that technically will not exist come the end of the year so why the high profile visits for that we aposre back with the panel first of all who aposs going to win saccone or lamb and does it matter since it is being redistricted out of existence lucey well it certainly matters i mean i think one thing that aposs important to remember the context is this is a district that trump won by 20 percentage point so should the republicans lose it speaks volumes about democratic enthusiasm going into the midterms williams and that aposs why the rnc has put a million in and other republican outside groups have put i think 8 million so that aposs i think seven times more than the democrats have put in this race because they want to protect president trump here riley even if saccone wins by a small margin i think the democrats will be very very happy with this if they are forced if the republicans have been forced to spend this amount of money in a district that trump won so handily in 2016 i think the democrats will feel very very good about the headwinds they put in the republicans roberts i wonder charlie did the president just when the 18th and pennsylvania with the tariffs hurt i think that is a huge issue that aposs definitely driving things there which is kind of way i sort of wonder along with the fact that he won it by 20 points why i sort of wonder if this isn apost some kind of head fake to kind of make people think oh republicans might lose it but in the end they wind up winning it but regardless of whether they win we know that the democrats are very enthusiastic but watching his performance last night trump aposs performance last night he aposs back on the he aposs in his group again roberts and he revealed his theme for 2020 watch this begin video clip donald trump president of the united states our new slogan when we start running in can you believe it two years from now is going to be keep america great exclamation point keep america great but we can only do that if we back people were going to back our agenda end video clip roberts beginning of 2018 juan he aposs got this slogan for 2020 keep america great what aposs democratic slogan williams i think the democratic slogan at the moment is get trump out of here we aposve had enough enough is enough but i don apost know that that aposs good enough to win crosstalk williams i think democrats have to have a strong message that aposs why the tariffs that we were talking about a moment ago both the democrat and republican in pennsylvania 18 are pro tariffs i think that president trump especially with the energy that he demonstrated last night is still quite the campaigner and his rally still quite the tv show lucey and he wants to be out there we aposre going to see him a lot this is just the beginning roberts he was in fine form last night lucey he was on i mean this is campaign trump i mean this is what we aposve seen he was all over the place he was freewheeling he was joking he was sloganning ph but also he really thinks that the tariffs help them in some of those key midwestern states that carried him to the white house roberts you aposve got marcy kaptur saying good on you mr president hurt and he even came up with a new nickname for connor lamb lamb the sham roberts yes lamb the sham williams oh my gosh come on crosstalk willams this is so childish this is america roberts all right the moment i know you aposve all been waiting for here in the panel at home stormy daniels is this going to stick laughter lucey it certainly picking up steam i think the story has moved into the mainstream we see in the new york times and the washington post writing about it this week she aposs taped an interview with anderson cooper so i think it aposs not going away i don apost exactly know how it aposs going to unfold but it aposs having some staying power riley i will add though that president trump aposs approval rating has been ticking up in recent weeks even as the story has been playing out so again it aposs another issue that his base doesn apost seem to care a lot about they seem to be focused on other things but there are some serious issues here i mean if there was no relationship why were there hush payments i mean this is a very basic roberts but does that amount to a hill of beans i mean clearly she wants to get out from a nondisclosure agreement because she sees a big payday hurt people pay people to not talk about things all the time if not a big deal and there aposs no evidence that there was any campaign funds used for this but back up a second here aposs the problem with the democratic approach to donald trump this guy has been accused of everything under the sun and in a weird way he aposs right about when he said i could stand in fifth avenue and shoot somebody and i wouldn apost lose any supporters he aposs been accused of so many things by so many people that a lot of his supporters are just like i don apost know i don apost know if it aposs true or not i don apost believe it roberts politically juan does this matter williams it matters in terms of whether there was a federal election commission violation that matters because that will drag out the story to get back to your point that will it keep it alive i do think that while we have not seen in the polls any kind of denomination of white evangelical support for the president because of this i think character flaw guess what people have to be intentional hypocritical crosstalk roberts but here aposs a thing at play though i mean whether he did or whether he didn apost have a relationship people wh
