to eric holder to handle the investigation republican lawmakers are increasingly casting doubt on the obama administration apos s claim that recent security leaks were not green lighted by the upper echelons of the president apos s staff pointing to the news stories themselves to argue top advisers were involved in trying to give the president glory since attorney general eric holder announced friday that he apos s assigned two u s attorneys to investigate the leaks president obama and his aides have rejected the notion that the white house engineered any leak of sensitive information for political reasons white house press secretary jay carney on monday called that idea wrong and absurd several major news reports presumably prompted holder apos s announcement most recently the new york times ran separate heavily sourced stories on the u s drone program and the campaign of cyberwarfare against iran the associated press earlier reported on a failed bomb plot by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula based on the sourcing in the stories themselves lawmakers say it apos s obvious at least some of the information came from the administration further house homeland security committee chairman peter king r n y claims it must have come from the white house it was obvious from reading the stories that the administration is trying to give the president glory he told fox news on monday they talk about the white house situation room they talk about the oval office they talk about aides and advisers to the president there apos s nobody else this could have come from descriptions of sources in the two lengthy stories in the times span the gamut but they appeared to be highly placed in the first story which ran may 29 the article on obama apos s involvement in the so killed kill list of drone terror targets was based on interviews with three dozen of obama apos s current and former advisers in the opening of the piece alone the times describes a counterterrorism meeting in january 2010 in the situation room it quotes obama asking about the age of terror suspects according to two officials present other sections of the article quote aides as well as participants in other high level meetings in the second bombshell article this one on cyberattacks against iran the times quotes current and former american european and israeli officials involved in the program as well as outside experts the sourcing pattern appeared to be similar the times in one section quotes members of the president apos s national security team who were in the situation room during a tense meeting it quotes aides and other participants in high level meetings as well as architects of the cyberattack plan top obama campaign adviser david axelrod on sunday acknowledged that there were leaks i can apos t say that there weren apos t leaks there were obvious leaks but they weren apos t from the white house david axelrod said on abc apos s this week he said the president understands that when he commits people to missions that their lives are at stake and the safety of americans are at stake and the last thing that he would countenance or anybody around him would countenance are leaks that would jeopardize the security of americans on these secret missions and the success of those missions he said he apos s confident the probe will not show white house involvement axelrod told cbs news on monday that obama is outraged about the leaks further the author of the article on the cyberwarfare against iran which was adapted from a forthcoming book has defended the reporting david sanger told cnn on sunday that he doubts the leaks were political a key point going forward for holder apos s prosecutors will be the difference between a routine leak and a bona fide security breach a leak by itself is not necessarily a crime though it may be frowned upon by officials in charge the administration though has tried prosecuting leaks in the past under the world war i era espionage act sen john mccain r ariz complained monday about the fact that the drone and cyberattack programs were being discussed at all here are two of our most important ongoing intelligence operations mccain told fox news on monday i don apos t think there apos s any doubt that it came from the administration mccain joined other gop lawmakers in calling for a special counsel to handle the case as opposed to attorneys accountable to holder obama has rejected gop claims on friday he assailed as offensive and wrong the idea that his white house would purposely release
