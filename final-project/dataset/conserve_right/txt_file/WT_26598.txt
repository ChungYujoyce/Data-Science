tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn academics may debate whether president trump has a foreign policy doctrine but conservative activists gathered in suburban maryland this week say there s no question he has a guiding axiom summed up in two of his favorite words america first members of congress have complained about a withdrawal from the world stage and jeered the president for moving to cut u s military engagement in afghanistan and syria but those are exactly the moves many activists at the conservative political action conference were hoping to see i think that trump is more like reagan so his foreign policy is what s good for us said andrew boone a retired teacher who lives in south carolina if our relationship with you is going to help us we re all for it and if it s not goodbye like he did with rocket man this morning referring to the president walking away from negotiations with north korean dictator kim jong un in vietnam top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning mr boone also saw that motivation in mr trump s recent threat to cut off u s aid to guatemala honduras and el salvador amid issues with u s bound migrant caravans we just sat back and handed out checks no more checks and that s what i love about him no more checks mr boone said the democrats are screaming how do we get those countries to take care of their problems i don t know it happens to be honduras s problem our problem is keeping our country safe i don t know what honduras is going to do angel laboo 19 said she doesn t understand why some people are cool to an america first attitude on foreign policy i like his whole idea that we should stick with america and then work with other places secondary said ms laboo a student at bridgewater college in virginia we have to help ourselves before we can help other people the president s critics complain that they can t make heads or tails of his policies suggesting his approach to foreign affairs lacks coherence they question his decisions to engage with leaders of north korea and russia while battling traditional allies in europe and griping about neighbors in the western hemisphere but sen lindsey graham south carolina republican told the crowd at cpac in oxon hill that mr trump has upended a stagnant world order that allowed problems to fester why is rocket man talking to trump when he s never talked to anybody else because he knows trump means business he said using the president s nickname for the north korean dictator why is the taliban at the peace table because we ve been kicking their ass angelo spanodemos 58 said it didn t cost mr trump anything to engage with mr kim at the summit in vietnam this week he said that the sanctions issues were keeping them from moving forward and i guess it s understandable said mr spanodemos who is from long island new york he s not giving anything away i mean if he would have turned around and said all right we re getting rid of all the sanctions to quote unquote make progress i might not agree with that jerry feith a retired irs employee from maryland said he wished president barack obama and former secretary of state john kerry had adopted a similar ready to walk attitude as mr trump when they were crafting the iran nuclear deal my sense is that he will protect the american people no 1 and get involved as much as he thinks is necessary in order to keep us safe mr feith said i think he has an iq like einstein mr feith also said mr trump has made clear he s not afraid to show force when necessary as a jewish person i believe he would have bombed the railroad tracks and the ovens if he was the president instead of fdr because of the type of person he is he said in syria when he bombed them they know he means business you can t bully him but the praise at cpac was not universal ericka williams a 34 year old investor from texas said she s from a military family and she d like to see more concrete moves to back up the president s stated goals of ending useless entanglements i hate to say it i haven t seen much progress other than saying we re going to pull some people out of afghanistan honestly she said there s more navy moving to spain there s more navy going to italy i have a lot of friends out of fort bragg who just got stationed in italy she also said she doesn t know what to make of how mr trump has dealt with russia and vladimir putin do we talk to them do we not is there collusion is there not she said i would definitely love some clarity at least some closure on it it ju
