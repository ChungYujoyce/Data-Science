local journalists the nahid 1 satellite meant to be launched i have no idea about the americans comment about semnan space site and i think it is more appropriate that the respected minister of

final launch preparations for the safir slv launch at semnan launch site one in iran trump wrote identifying the rocket used i wish iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at site

associated press in july that tehran planned three satellite launches this year two for satellites that do remote sensing work and another that handles communications the nahid 1 is reportedly the telecommunication satellite nahid in farsi means venus the satellite which had iran s first foldable solar panels was supposed to be in a low orbit around the earth for some two and a half months the apparent failed rocket launch comes after two failed satellite launches of the payam and doosti in january and february a separate fire at the imam khomeini space center in february also killed three researchers authorities said at the time over the past decade iran has sent several short lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space the u s alleges such satellite launches defy a u n security council resolution calling on iran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons iran which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons maintains its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component tehran also says it hasn t violated the u n resolution as it only called upon tehran not to conduct such tests the tests have taken on new importance to the u s amid the maximalist approach to iran taken by president donald trump s administration tensions have been high between the countries since trump unilaterally withdrew the u s from iran s nuclear deal over a year ago and imposed sanctions including on iran s oil industry iran recently has begun to break the accord itself while trying to push europe to help it sell oil abroad associated press
