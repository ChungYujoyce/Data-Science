time celebrity apprentice contestant rod blagojevich from federal prison in colorado the 62 year old democrat who was once best known and the butt of jokes for his thick meticulously coiffed hair is seven years into a lengthy sentence for extortion bribery and other wide ranging political corruption i thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly trump told reporters aboard air force one this week about blagojevich he added i m thinking about commuting his sentence very strongly trump on thursday took to twitter saying that many people have asked him to look into commuting blagojevich s sentence white house staff is continuing the review of this matter trump tweeted top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender trump s comments aboard air force one on blagojevich s case contained several errors and underplayed the severity of the crimes which included attempting to sell an appointment to the u s senate seat vacated when barack obama won the presidency in 2008 a look at blagojevich s crimes trump s characterization of them and why the president may be taking a special interest in the case q was blagojevich convicted for bragging a trump echoed an assertion blagojevich has made for years that federal prosecutors came after him for mere musings and boastful talk on the phone which unbeknownst to blagojevich at the time in 2008 had been tapped by the fbi speaking to reporters wednesday night trump said blagojevich was behind bars over a phone call where nothing happens he added blagojevich shouldn t have said what he said but it was braggadocio judges and prosecutors rejected such interpretations the majority of illinois residents many who seemed otherwise jaded by the state s long ignominious history of political corruption expressed shock at what blagojevich did his conviction for trying to sell an appointment to obama s senate seat for campaign contributions stood out in part because of blagojevich s excited expletive laden talk captured on wiretaps about how he could parlay his power to name a new senator into campaign donations i ve got this thing and it s f golden he is heard saying and i m just not giving it up for f nothing prosecutors said the crimes went beyond talk with blagojevich dispatching emissaries to press potential donors and to convey the message that they d have to pay to play his other convictions included trying to shake down a chicago children s hospital its ceo patrick magoon testified that blagojevich threatened to cancel an 8 million state pediatric care reimbursement unless magoon paid 25 000 into blagojevich s campaign

enough seven years blagojevich reported to prison in 2012 after which his hair quickly turned white because hair dyes are prohibited behind bars inside the elvis presley fan formed a prison band called the jailhouse rockers his lawyers have said trump was wrong in saying blagojevich was given close to 18 years in prison judge james zagel sentenced blagojevich in 2011 to 14 years in prison the abuse of the office of governor is more damaging than the abuse of any other office except the president s zagel said in sentencing the two term governor when it is the governor who goes bad the judge said the fabric of illinois is torn and disfigured and not easily repaired federal felons must serve at least 85 percent of their sentences meaning blagojevich would be eligible after serving 12 years that would put his release date in 2024 in speaking about how he thought blagojevich s sentence was too long trump also said you have drug dealers that get not even 30 days and they ve killed 25
