 sign in former florida governor fails to identify any genuine conservatives on campaign team manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong jeb bush s latest effort to court evangelical voters boomeranged when a christian radio network boss challenged him for hiring two political aides who support same sex marriage and the former florida governor conceded that he couldn t identify any genuine conservatives in his inner circle the details of mr bush s private phone call in mid april with rich bott whose religious radio network of 100 stations stretches from california to tennessee within potential reach of 51 million listeners were confirmed to the washington times by mr bott and top aides to mr bush it is the latest bellwether of the former florida governor s struggles with certain constituencies inside the republican party s conservative base who are wary of his potential positioning on marriage education immigration and spending heading into his bid for the white house top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots you are not going to die from covid 19 500 doctors tell trump to end the coronavirus shutdown say it will cause more deaths who can you name in your campaign or administration that is a genuine movement conservative mr bott asked during the call you know i don t know who is a movement conservative these days because it s all so mainstream mr bush replied according to mr bott movement conservatives say that has been a problem since ronald reagan made conservatism fashionable in the 1980s almost all republicans since then claim to be conservative even if they can t define the word or don t necessarily like its meaning likewise mr bott said he challenged mr bush for hiring two proponents of same sex marriage inside the political machine that is helping him explore a bid for the republican nomination for president next year when gov bush called me that morning on april 17 i figured he was reaching out to a number evangelical christian leaders across the country mr bott told the times in an interview i expressed appreciation for his and his family s commitment to public service but told him i find it incomprehensible how you could have these people at the top of your campaign and not expect them to influence policies going forward mr bott said gov bush replied i don t ask questions about their sexuality bush spokeswoman kristi campbell did not dispute mr bott s account of the call she said her boss is committed to picking the best individuals for his team he has never discriminated in the past and is not going to start now she said gov bush s position on gay marriage is clear if he goes with a run it will be premised on his agenda not anyone else s gordon sekulow the evangelical senior adviser to mr bush s right to rise pac noted that in south carolina on saturday mr bush had breakfast with nearly 40 pastors and faith leaders and earlier in the week spent time with conservative faith leaders in texas as these conversations continue gov bush is committed to protecting the religious liberty in america and promoting religious freedom abroad mr sekulow said at the conservative political action conference in washington in february sean hannity asked mr bush whether he had changed his position on same sex marriage no i believe in traditional marriage mr bush responded he has not however said he opposes recognition of same sex marriage as a constitutional right mr bush earned high marks from conservatives of all stripes during his gubernatorial terms for his stands on economic and social issues mr bott and other evangelicals praised him for siding with terri schiavo s brother and parents in wanting to prolong her life support in the famous right to life case a decade ago but mr bush s relations with evangelical voters have grown strained since in part because of comments he has made since re entering the private sector that poses a challenge for him given that more than half the voters who choose the republican presidential nominee in state primary elections and caucuses next year are likely to be born again christians based on exit poling of previous election cycles i m ready to rule out anybody who s hiring a bunch of staff members who have a same sex marriage agenda jerry a johnson president of the national religious broadcasters said of the field of republican presidential candidates iowa republican and evangelical activist bob vander plaats said he wouldn t comment on mr bush specifically but that he agreed with mr bott rich is right he said we value three things in candidates character meaning what you say competency knowing how to carry out what you promise and company you reveal who you are by the people you surround yourself with the company you keep if a candidate hires or appoints people who are not like minded with him or her on basic moral issues it raises huge red flags mr vander plaats said mr bott said it s hard to imagine evangelicals being excited about a bush candidacy if he has well known advocates of homosexual marriage leading his campaign mr bush is on record as opposing same sex marriage but hired david kochel to run his campaign organization when it becomes official he also hired tim miller to be the communications director of the campaign when it gets underway presumably later this spring mr kochel and mr miller publicly advocate same sex marriage arguing that it should be guaranteed under the constitution mr bush 62 is five years younger than hillary rodham clinton the top candidate for the democratic nomination who says same sex marriage is a right afforded by the constitution he will be competing with a bevy of contenders out to win evangelical voters affection or at least acceptance mr bush has said he supports traditional marriage but respects those who want to marry people of their own sex what rankles many evangelicals is that mr bush s brother george w bush opposed same sex marriage through two successful gubernatorial campaigns and two successful presidential bids only to have his wife and two daughters acknowledge afterward that they supported same sex marriage the families of john mccain and mitt romney the 2008 and 2012 republican presidential nominees respectively also made post campaign revelations in support of same sex marriage for a party that claims to champion traditional values republicans have afforded major roles to many homosexuals including ken mehlman who was president george w bush s white house political director his 2004 campaign manager and then republican national committee chairman jeb bush s choices of top aides remind religious conservatives of what pastors pews founder david lane calls the deceitfulness of republican leaders and their operatives who claim to be one thing then govern another way saying one thing to be elected and then governing in the opposite way has consequences said mr lane who brings evangelical pastors and social conservative candidates together lies unleash misery on a community the political system is viable only if politicians can on the whole be relied on to produce honest answers to questions and issues evangelicals are concerned that this issue is being forced on business owners ministries christian colleges and seminaries the supreme court is expected to rule by summer on the constitutionality of the definition of marriage as the union of a man and a woman if the court rules there s a constitutional right to same sex marriage then christians in business and ministries will be silenced said mr johnson of the religious broadcasters association more cake makers will be put out of business for refusing to bake for homosexual ceremonies we will see more florists fined and photographers put out of business christian colleges will lose accreditation christian broadcasters are particularly worried we are concerned that the federal communications commission will eventually threaten the broadcast licenses and the irs will threaten the tax status of those who disagree with any government edict on same sex marriage mr johnson said mr lane sees in the apparent drive for rights the creation of wrongs it appears that radical homosexual activists have progressed from their former libertarian position allow us to live our lives in the privacy of our homes he said now they exhibit a totalitarian posture you are going to take part in our weddings or we will destroy and bankrupt you copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view comments click to hide terms of use
