researching immunology at an american university is also reconsidering his options after moving to the u s eight years ago yang has returned home each winter holiday and had his student visa renewed without a hitch this year though yang became one of many chinese citizens caught up in the brutal tussle between beijing and washington over trade and technology when yang applied for a visa in december the state department told him it was being delayed while they investigated his background for ties to the chinese government american officials have in recent years grown alarmed over the alleged theft of u s technology by china casting a cloud of suspicion on chinese citizens like yang who work in the sciences told the check would take four weeks yang changed his flights and prepared to stay longer then in late january the chinese government began locking down whole cities to contain the virus soon after trump announced the u s travel ban yang got his passport back in the mail with no visa american officials told yang s academic adviser that since yang no longer had a visa they could no longer pay his stipend or fund his research with federal grant money hospital surveys

though beijing frequently singles out the united states yang and huang both say they understand why a travel ban could help contain the virus but they say the u s halt on new visas with no deadline extensions or other accommodations is frustrating and unreasonable even more frustrating for huang is the sense that the u s is trying to bar her from coming back i m not being respected i work in the
