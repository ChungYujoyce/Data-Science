how many ballots remain unreal https t co qwtzedqosd this is a pattern of at a minimum incompetence voters deserve better this is not even a partisan thing this is a county that apparently cannot even count votes as well as a county that just got wiped out by a hurricane marcorubio polls closed over 48 hrs ago and broward elections supervisor brenda snipes doesn t know or is refusing to tell us how

there were 695 700 ballots cast on election day at 2 30 pm today the number was up to 707 223 ballots cast on election day and we just learned that the number has increased to 712 840 ballots cast on election day in palm beach county there are 15 000 new votes found since election night so it has been over 48 hours since the polls closed and broward and palm beach counties are still finding and counting ballots and the supervisors brenda snipes and susan bucher booker cannot seem to say how many ballots still exist or where these ballots came from or where they have been palm beach county is also refusing to provide information to the public and they are illegally refusing to allow official party representatives into the ballot counting area and forcing people to stand behind a glass wall with limited visibility and no ability to hear what is going on this is a clear violation of florida law and we have just filed a lawsuit both broward and palm beach counties have failed in their duty to follow florida law which requires that vote by mail and absentee ballots are accounted within 30 minutes of polls closing further palm beach county has failed to update the department of state since 10 19 am yesterday this is in complete violation of florida law which requires updated reports every 45 minutes until results are completely reported tonight i am asking the florida department of law enforcement to investigate this immediately and i am considering every single legal option available no rag tag group of liberal activists or lawyers from d c will be allowed to steal this election from the voters in the state of florida i am proud to be the next senator from the state of florida and look forward to going up there and making washington work for all americans alabama
