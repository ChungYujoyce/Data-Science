hould be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion last week president obama feted communist china s xi jinping the man who hopes to lead his country as it emerges as the world s next superpower mr xi must have been delighted to see press reports that his host is poised to end america s claim to such status at least with respect to the traditional means of measuring it nuclear weaponry according to a story first reported by the associated press mr obama has directed the defense department to come up with plans for reducing the u s nuclear arsenal by as much as 80 percent he evidently is prepared to take such a step unilaterally in order to encourage by our example other nations to join in his long standing ambition to rid the world of nuclear weapons it is unclear whether the topic came up during the various meetings the people s republic of china s vice president had with his white house and other interlocutors even if it did mr xi presumably would not have disclosed a closely held chinese secret how many missiles and warheads have been squirreled away in 3 000 miles of hardened tunnels that make up what has been called the underground great wall of china top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century the obama administration continues to assume that the people s liberation army has only a few hundred nuclear weapons approximately the level to which our commander in chief would like to reduce the american arsenal a radically different estimate was recently provided however in a georgetown university study led by a former pentagon strategic forces analyst professor phillip karber to the fury of arms controllers in and out of the u s government mr karber s team concluded that based on the vast infrastructure china has created to conceal its missiles it may have as many as 3 000 nuclear weapons china is not the only nuclear state or wannabe that is engaged in a feverish buildup last week russia s autocratic vladimir putin unveiled a 770 billion military modernization plan that he says would introduce 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles presumably equipped with state of the art nuclear warheads pakistan north korea and iran are also among those who may wish us ill and are spurning mr obama s exemplary unilateral efforts at nuclear disarmament with the help of such regimes or in response to their threats others in the far and middle east are likely to see the need for their own deterrents that is especially true as confidence in the reliability of america s security guarantees collapses along with its once mighty nuclear umbrella so outlandish so reckless is mr obama s ambition to disarm the united states that 34 members of the house of representatives last week forcefully urged him to reverse course in a letter dated feb 17 and headlined by the chairmen of the house armed services committee and its strategic forces subcommittee rep howard p buck mckeon california republican and rep michael r turner ohio republican these legislators described it as motivated by nothing less than blind ideology they insisted that such blindness not be allowed to drive a matter as important as u s nuclear forces over reality what is particularly vexing to these legislators is that this marks the first time a president has directed specific force levels as part of a review of the nation s nuclear employment strategy they observed that instead such a review should begin and end with one question what levels of u s nuclear forces are necessary to convince our enemies and adversaries that they cannot succeed in an attack on this country or its allies it is not just that mr obama is blindly driving for ideological reasons the numerical evisceration of u s nuclear forces as mr turner pointed out this month in introducing legislation aimed at holding the administration to commitments made during the consideration of the new start treaty in 2010 the administration also is walking away from its promises to modernize what remains of our deterrent over time the practical effect of combining the draconian nuclear cuts mr obama seeks and his failure to arrest and reverse the atrophying of the obsolescing arsenal will leave us functionally disarmed mr obama s true colors are showing his blind ideology is gutting america s deterrent that impulse not newfound budget discipline is the driving force behind his hollowing out of the rest of the u s military too these data points vividly underscore even as they advance the true obama doctrine embolden our enemies undermine our allies diminish our country unless reversed the world will be an infinitely more dangerous place for this nation and other friends of freedom it is an astonishing insight into the president s commitment to fundamentally transforming the united states of america in the worst sense of the phrase that he is willing to take such steps in the midst of his re election campaign imagine what he would do if the last vestiges of restraining accountability are removed in a second term frank j gaffney jr is president of the center for security policy
