california over coronavirus limits on churches dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed we appear to be in a slow motion train wreck with both sides sticking to their positions said william reinsch a trade analyst at the center for strategic and international studies and a former u s trade official as is often the case however the losers will not be the negotiators or presidents but the people beijing s move came after the u s raised duties friday on 200 billion of chinese imports to 25 up from 10 in doing so american officials accused china of backtracking on commitments it made in earlier negotiations the same day trade talks between the two countries broke up without an agreement on twitter trump warned xi that china will be hurt very badly if it doesn t agree to a trade deal trump tweeted that beijing had a great deal almost completed you backed out the rising trade hostilities could damage the economies of both countries the tariff increases already in place have disrupted trade in such american products as soybeans and medical equipment and sent shockwaves through other asian economies that supply chinese factories still the two countries have given themselves something of an escape hatch the higher chinese tariffs don t kick in for 2 weeks the u s increases apply to chinese goods shipped since friday and those shipments will take about three weeks to arrive at u s seaports and become subject to the higher charges also both countries have indicated more talks are likely top white house economic adviser larry kudlow said sunday that china has invited u s trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin to beijing but nothing has been scheduled and trump said monday that he expects to meet chinese president xi jinping in late june at the g 20 summit in osaka japan the president has repeatedly insisted that increased tariffs on chinese goods don t hurt american consumers but kudlow head of the president s national economic council acknowledged over the weekend that u s consumers and businesses will bear some of the costs both sides will pay he told fox news in the u s prices of soybeans targeted by chinese tariffs last year fell monday to a 10 year low on fears of a protracted trade war in a statement american soybean association president davie stevens a soybean farmer from clinton kentucky expressed frustration that the u s has been at the table with china 11 times now and still has not closed the deal what that means for soybean growers is that we re losing losing a valuable market losing stable pricing losing an opportunity to support our families and our communities trump told reporters monday that a new program to relieve u s farmers pain is being devised right now and predicted that they will be very happy the administration last year handed farmers aid worth 11 billion to offset losses from trade conflicts trump seemed to suggest that the aid will make up for or partially cover the 15 billion that he said represented the biggest purchase that china has ever made with our farmers in fact u s farm exports to china approached 26 billion in both 2012 and 2013 and came in at 19 5 billion in 2017 before his trade war began taking a toll on agricultural sales to china the president s allies in congress scrambled to limit the damage to farm country republican sen chuck grassley of iowa said it is time for u s allies to get in the game to push china to the negotiating table china needs to get with it he said you can t move these goalposts like they re moving them and expect to be respected the highest tariffs announced by china will apply to industrial chemicals electronic equipment precision machinery and hundreds of food products beijing is running out of u s imports to penalize because of the lopsided trade balance between the world s two largest economies chinese regulators have instead targeted american companies in china by slowing down the clearing of shipments through customs and the processing of business licenses oxford economics calculated that the higher tariffs will reduce the u s economy by 0 3 in 2020 a loss of 490 per american household similarly forecasters have warned that the u s tariff increases could set back a chinese recovery that had appeared to be gaining traction growth in the world s second largest economy during the january through march period held steady at 6 4 compared with a year earlier supported by higher government spending and bank lending the tensions raise fresh doubts about this recovery path morgan stanley economists said the latest u s duties could knock 0 5 percentage points off annual chinese economic growth and that could widen to 1 percentage point if both sides extend penalties to all of each other s exports economists say that would pull annual growth below 6 raising the risk of politically dangerous job losses china s state media tried to reassure businesses and consumers that the ruling communist party has the means to respond there is nothing to be afraid of said the party newspaper people s daily the u s instigated trade war against china is just a hurdle in china s development process it is no big deal trump has threatened to extend tariffs to the remaining 300 billion or so in chinese tariffs that haven t been targeted yet but told reporters monday i have not made that decision yet the president started raising tariffs last july over complaints china steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology and unfairly subsidizes chinese businesses that are striving to become global leaders in robotics and other technology a stumbling block has been u s insistence on an enforcement mechanism with penalties
