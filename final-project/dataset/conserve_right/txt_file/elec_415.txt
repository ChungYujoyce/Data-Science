campaign blamed his loss in wisconsin s primary tuesday on illegal tactics by chief rival sen ted cruz attempting to dismiss his disappointing finish as the result of dirty tricks but instead earning accusations that he s whining mr trump and his advisers said mr cruz illegally colluded with a political action committee and is a trojan horse for the gop establishment a comment the texas senator waved aside saying it was more proof that mr trump is struggling and voters are tiring of his brash approach to politics donald has no solutions to the problems we re facing mr cruz told reporters wednesday he likes to yell and scream and insult and curse and his statement last night was consistent with that top stories australian researchers see virus design manipulation democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens his post wisconsin accusations are just the latest instance of mr trump excusing a poor performance by saying he was done in by dirty deeds after losing the iowa caucuses mr trump accused the cruz campaign of frightening voters and spreading false rumors that fellow candidate ben carson was quitting the race the combative approach to a loss is yet another departure from standard political practice said rick hasen a political scientist at the university of california irvine school of law i think trump is a terrible whiner mr hasen said he s always making excuses when he loses as opposed to being a gracious loser which i think we ve seen from cruz and clinton and sanders and rubio usually they say i congratulate my opponent on a hard fought race that s a more typical thing that you hear not they cheated it s not fair there are too many people running against me or anything like that mr hasen said the less than gracious approach to losing has so far worked for mr trump but he might have reached its limit said darrell west vice president and director of governance studies at the brookings institution he is entering a new phase of the campaign and so there s a question as to whether all the whining is catching up with him mr west said while still leading in the overall delegate race and in national polling mr trump has stumbled in recent weeks suffering losses in contests in utah and now wisconsin and watching as unfriendly delegates were chosen in louisiana north dakota and colorado at the same time his campaign manager was charged with simple battery after an altercation with a reporter and the candidate himself seemed to buck conservative orthodoxy on abortion and the role of the federal government in education and health care after mr cruz won wisconsin with 48 percent of the vote to mr trump s 35 percent the trump campaign lashed out in a statement late tuesday saying he was a trojan horse being used by the gop establishment to stop the trump train the trump campaign also accused mr cruz of collusion with a political action committee a move that if true would be illegal barry bennett a senior adviser to the trump campaign elaborated on wednesday saying that the violation stemmed from mr cruz attending an event hosted by a pro cruz super pac they set up an event paid for by the super pac and he comes and gives a speech it s total coordination mr bennett said on msnbc they then film it and turn it into commercials i mean it s too cute by half the trusted leadership pac however said it followed all laws and said mr trump s accusations were baseless it is unbecoming for a presidential candidate and his surrogates to continue to make ridiculous accusations said chip roy executive director of the group mr roy s pac isn t the only one to work closely with a candidate this election though what exactly constitutes coordination under federal election commission guidelines is a subject that s been hotly debated the fec has issued guidance that candidates can attend such super pac events but only solicit funds of up to 5 000 at them said paul s ryan deputy executive director of the campaign legal center which has filed complaints against some of the candidates they can t ask for more than five grand mr ryan said but they are permitted to attend speak and be featured guests at super pac fundraising events mr cruz s campaign does not hide its relationship listing on his public schedule when he s attending events sponsored by keep the promise a coalition of pro cruz super pacs even a candidate getting filmed at such an event might not be enough to cross the line said richard skinner a money in politics policy analyst at the sunlight foundation my sense is if it s just footage of a candidate at an event put on by a super pac and it s an event that s available to the public and this candidate had no participation in the shooting of the footage just happened to be there then i think that it would not be ruled to be coordination mr skinner said candidates or potential candidates have figured out other workarounds to the law super pacs supporting ohio gov john kasich former florida gov jeb bush and former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina all shot footage of those candidates for use in broadcast advertising the pacs insisted they didn t cross any lines and in the case of mr kasich and mrs fiorina the groups said they shot their footage before the two announced their candidacies but analysts have said such boundary pushing isn t necessarily in the spirit of what should constitute coordination mr hasen said as it stands there s significant ground super pacs can cover independent of the campaigns themselves without risking dust ups with the law so it d be really kind of a dumb thing to actually coordinate and the campaigns are smart and have very good lawyers that make sure that they don t do things that are blatantly illegal he said copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view
