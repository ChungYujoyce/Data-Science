biggest selling point of his campaign mitt romney after weathering an onslaught of rotating primary challengers over the course of the last year is poised to clinch the republican presidential nomination as early as tuesday in doing so his campaign will complete its shift from knocking off republican rivals one by one to challenging a single democratic opponent president obama and with the obama campaign now pouring airtime and resources into the latest attacks on romney apos s private equity experience the gop candidate is discovering early that one of his biggest advantages in the primaries his war chest isn apos t quite so impressive in the general the latest campaign finance figures from april underscore the financial distance between them at the unofficial start of this contest obama had 115 million on hand romney had 9 2 million the reality of an incumbent apos s particularly this incumbent apos s fundraising power means romney may have to focus more on message and more on his own personal story it apos s a challenging task for somebody who lacks a classic rags to riches tale but romney the family man romney the faithful husband and romney the determined businessman could start to make a bigger appearance as the race turns from a test of party purity to one of personal connections he doesn apos t need to make a hardcore ideological argument but he does need to connect with these people in a way that is lasting and sustained gop pollster adam geller said urging the candidate to tell his story geller said romney needs to do a much better job of connecting with the frustrated middle class and especially america apos s decisive political middle at the same time he has to avoid looking insincere it can apos t be the john kerry eating the cheesesteak moment geller quipped recalling kerry apos s 2003 gaffe of ordering a cheesesteak with swiss which simply isn apos t done romney could wrap up the nomination tuesday evening with the voter rich texas primary based on the associated press tally he needs at least 60 delegates to reach the 1 144 delegate threshold that will earn him the title of nominee texas offers a total of 155 the campaign immediately faces historical headwinds in its bid to unseat an incumbent jimmy carter stands as the only democratic president in the last century to lose his re election bid and an unfriendly electoral vote map by most analyses the democratic candidate starts out with an advantage in that regard the number of electoral votes in solidly democratic states simply is greater than the number in solidly republican states the cook political report which tracks these numbers estimates there are 182 electoral votes in states considered a lock for democrats versus 143 in states considered a lock for republicans the democratic advantage holds when states that lean one way or another are factored in still more than a dozen states are on the table and romney showed during the protracted primary that he apos s at least competitive in several of them the former massachusetts governor in january dominated the florida gop primary he also won albeit by a slim margin in ohio and he emerged on top in the lesser battleground states of arizona michigan new hampshire nevada and wisconsin as well as virginia though his top gop rivals were not on the ballot in that particular contest those states alone are worth 107 electoral votes on the road to 270 though most will be fiercely contested in the fall there apos s not a lot of wiggle room here geller noted but he said aside from the usual swing contests of florida and ohio the race could come down to an otherwise overlooked state light on electoral votes like new hampshire which has just four electoral votes from the looks of the opening round the general election battle will not be a pleasant one the obama campaign despite some dissension in the democratic ranks is pressing ahead with its effort to highlight companies that went under following the involvement of romney apos s former company bain capital obama strategist robert gibbs the former white house press secretary told cbs apos face the nation over the weekend that people have a visceral reaction to mitt romney apos s time at the firm what bain capital never did was focus on job creation that is not what bain capital does it loads up companies with debt it takes money out of those companies and pays those investors he said romney adviser ed gillespie disputed the claim saying there is a correlation between growing a company and job creation as the republican candidate presses ahead and introduces himself to a broader swath of voters he apos ll be challenged to defend his days at bain potentially working in romney apos s favor though is the element of surprise and the potential crossover appeal inherent in whoever he chooses as his vice presidential nominee by contrast polling over the past year has shown americans somewhat tiring of obama apos s no 2 vice president biden the latest gallup survey showed 42 percent view him favorably while 45 percent view him unfavorably polls meanwhile continue to show romney struggling to convince people to vote for him rather than against obama in a fox news poll released may 16 43 percent of those supporting romney said they were doing so because he apos s not obama just 11 percent of obama apos s supporters said they were backing the president because he apos s not romney in that poll obama was leading romney 46 39 percent when you apos re running against an incumbent you necessarily have to get people to vote for you who voted for the incumbent said fox news analyst karl rove former adviser to president george w bush and co founder of conservative group crossroads gps get all the stories
