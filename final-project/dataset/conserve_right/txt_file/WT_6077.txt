apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion is zhao lijian as his twitter handle says the deputy for director general in the information department of the ministry of foreign affairs of china or is he just the latest candidate to enter the race for the democratic presidential nomination last week in response to congress passing a law expressing support for the protesters in hong kong mr zhao tweeted a scathing denunciation of the united states but what was striking was that mr zhao s jabs were not the typical anti u s fare that comes out regularly from beijing s propaganda apparatus he did not denounce u s imperialism or our penchant for meddling abroad as is the usual script for instance in fact mr zhao s critique of the u s was downright well woke top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century man made human rights disasters in us are everywhere the most typical example is humanitarian disaster caused by sudden change in us immigration policy on mexico border thousands of refugees are forcibly separated and tens of thousands of children are held in dirty small rooms mr zhao tweeted in a message that could just have easily come out of a sen elizabeth warren stump speech racial discrimination gun violence violent law enforcement are chronic diseases deeply rooted in us society and there is no hope of solving them in the context of social political polarization in us in the past mr zhao has even offered an outdated withering critique of the nation s capital suggesting that whites avoid the southeast and southwest quadrants of the city news i m certain to the denizens of those rapidly gentrifying parts of the city mr zhao is something of a rarity in the normally staid confines of china s foreign ministry he has used twitter aggressively both in his current role in beijing and at his prior post in islamabad pakistan where he served for about eight years china s foreign ministry must have a vpn that gets around the great firewall given that twitter is blocked for ordinary chinese internet users he once famously got in a twitter spat with susan rice barack obama s former national security adviser much earlier in his career mr zhao served in d c which may help to explain why his notions of life in washington are rather antiquated so perhaps mr zhao is a bit of a loose cannon tweeting what he feels like without considering a broader strategy or perhaps mr zhao s sentiments are representative of a new information strategy being employed by beijing the soviet union constantly denounced the failures of the u s system poverty homelessness and other depredations and to this day north korean television and print media relentlessly hawk bad news from south korea random slip and falls in seoul showers are basically front page news in north korea china s highlighting of america s supposed social ills in other words is not a new tactic for a communist regime even if it hasn t traditionally been beijing s focus when addressing washington beijing though surely realizes it has a major public relations problem on its hands china has grown extremely unpopular in the u s the hong kong bill that sparked its ire passed overwhelmingly and was bipartisan the democrats running for president routinely criticize president trump for just about all of his policies except for his tough approach to beijing polling from pew research shows that the majority of americans view china unfavorably mr zhao s tweets then suggest a new strategy of attempting to appeal to america s political left to breach what is now a firmly bipartisan consensus that beijing is home to an ill behaved and indeed menacing regime the trouble of course is that it would be hard to imagine a regime less woke than beijing accepting mr zhao s critiques of american social injustice as sincere is tantamount to believing a heartfelt denunciation of murder and cannibalism from the likes of jeffrey dahmer ethan epstein is deputy opinion editor of the washington times contact him at emailprotected or on twitter ethane
