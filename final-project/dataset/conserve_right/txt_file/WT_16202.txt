first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds the potential for new avenues of espionage against the u s is among the most obvious repercussions of the pair of data breaches by hackers who are believed to have stolen personnel data on millions of current and former federal employees and contractors officials from the department of homeland security which is in charge of defending civilian government networks from cyberattacks and the office of personnel management which failed to protect its sensitive personnel information from hackers are slated to discuss the loss tuesday in front of the house oversight and government reform committee it may be the single biggest breach of data that our government has ever had jason chaffetz a utah republican who chairs the oversight committee said on the c span newsmakers program over the weekend calling the stolen data the most sensitive information we have in the cyberattack targeting federal personnel records hackers are believed to have obtained the social security numbers birth dates job actions and other private information on every federal employee and millions of former employees and contractors in a second attack which the obama administration acknowledged on friday after downplaying the possibility for days the cyberspies got detailed background information on millions of military intelligence and other personnel who have been investigated for security clearances together the hacks compromised the records of as many as 18 million people applicants for security clearances are required to list drug use criminal convictions mental health issues and the names and addresses of their foreign relatives you re supposed to list every relative outside the u s who

he said would amount to you belong to us and we can make an approach that is designed to make you understand that but the fears don t end with china china s intelligence service could share the information with allies such as north korea or pakistan also experts say many who hack on behalf of the chinese government are allowed to freelance and sell what they steal the friends and family

patching security holes and accelerating their use authentication that goes beyond passwords but critics have likened those steps to closing the proverbial barn door after all the horses have bolted they question why the government is not doing more to encrypt or render in code sensitive data man i can t believe that stuff wasn t encrypted brian kelly chief security officer at rackspace inc of
