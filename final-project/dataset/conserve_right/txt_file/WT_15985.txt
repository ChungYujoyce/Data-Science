the western pacific in 2015 when it conducted an exercise with the malaysian navy and air force the official declined to comment on whether the carl vinson would undertake a freedom of navigation

seven artificial islands during his senate confirmation hearing for secretary of state rex tillerson stirred controversy by comparing china s island building and deployment of military assets to

deploying necessary and appropriate national defense facilities on its own territory he said that china is exercising a right bestowed by international law to sovereign states philippines led asean talks raise concern over china s militarization the philippines led southeast asian nations in expressing concern over china s weapons systems on man made islands in comments criticized by beijing which also abruptly canceled a trade delegation to manila philippine foreign secretary perfecto yasay after hosting counterparts from the 10 member association of southeast nations said they want to prevent the militarization of the south china sea calling it a great concern by moving forward with a long delayed effort to draft rules for avoiding conflict in the disputed waters although saying it favors negotiating a code of conduct with asean in the south china sea beijing has dragged its feet for years apparently avoiding having its hands tied while it built artificial islands with runways and military installations representatives from china and asean will meet in the indonesian resort of bali on monday to discuss the way forward yasay said he was confident a framework agreement could be finalized by mid year on the basis of the fact that everyone including all of the asean member states and china are pushing hard for this but he cautioned that whether in fact china will cooperate we cannot say for now chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told reporters in beijing that yasay s remarks about china s militarization of the islands are baffling and regrettable such comments were only his opinion and do not represent the view of asean as a whole geng said adding they also appeared to contradict agreements reached between presidents xi jinping and rodrigo duterte on improving chinese philippine relations china also canceled a scheduled visit by commerce minister gao hucheng to witness the signing of trade agreements in manila geng said the meeting was postponed due to scheduling reasons president rodrigo duterte said that china may have misunderstood yasay china and the philippines long at loggerheads over who owns the south china sea islands have moved to mend ties since duterte took office last june yasay said after the asean meeting last week that chinese structures already in place on seven man made islands could be removed only by force and this is something that we will not engage ourselves in philippines say xi promised not to build on disputed shoal according to the philippine foreign secretary chinese president xi jinping has promised not to turn the disputed scarborough shoal into another chinese military outpost the fate of scarborough a tiny uninhabited reef that china seized from the philippines in 2012 has been driving the south china disputes a year after chinese vessels took control of the shoal after a tense standoff with philippine vessels the philippines initiated an international arbitration that ruled against china s maritime claims but which beijing refuses to recognize the philippines also has a defense pact with the u s and is counting on washington to step in should china attempt to expand the shoal and build military installations close to manila foreign secretary perfecto yasay said any chinese construction in scarborough shoal would be a very serious provocative act that would undermine the philippine claim to the rich fishing area if they would do that that will really be a game changer yasay said adding that xi told the philippine leader during their meetings in beijing last year that china had no plans to build on scarborough xi also made a promise to former president barack obama not to militarize the islands last september but chinese officials say that placing defensive weapons does not constitute militarization associated press writers matthew pennington in washington jim gomez in manila philippines and christopher bodeen in beijing contributed to th
