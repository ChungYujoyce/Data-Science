apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic recent editorials of statewide and national interest from new york s newspapers the senate has a duty wall street journal top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century dec 23 speaker nancy pelosi continues to withhold the house articles of impeachment from the senate further trivializing a serious constitutional power and process senate republicans seem content to play along while ridiculing her gambit but they should take their own duties more seriously and hold a trial one emerging dodge seems to be that president trump isn t formally impeached until the articles are transmitted to the senate this is absurd the house voted on two articles and passed them with a majority the house broadcast this fact to the country along with more in sorrow than anger claims that they are doing their solemn constitutional duty there s nothing in the constitution that says impeachment requires a formal transmittal of the articles to the senate whether by sedan chair or overnight fedex or that the house must appoint impeachment managers the parchment merely says the house has sole power over impeachment and the senate the sole power to try an impeachment the act of impeachment is the vote the founders also defined impeachment as consisting of two parts the house vote followed by a senate trial they are two stages of the same process the founders gave the first impeachment step to the house knowing it would often be governed by populist and partisan passions they gave the senate control over the trial as a check on the house they knew the senate with its two members per state would represent the different interests of varied states and with staggered elections every six years two thirds of the senate wouldn t face immediate re election after a trial and vote this means the current senate has a responsibility to fulfill its part of the constitution s impeachment duty as a check on the partisan excesses of the pelosi house this isn t merely to give mr trump a chance to defend himself and be acquitted of the house charges the more important obligation is to the separation of powers and to the senate itself by making a fuss of withholding the articles until she hears the senate s specific plans for a trial mrs pelosi is trying to dictate to the senate how to hold a trial but the constitution reserves this power for the senate if she never sends the articles and there is no trial she will have effectively trampled on executive power and senate prerogatives by maligning a president without the chance for acquittal at trial she will be turning impeachment into the equivalent of a censure resolution wrapped in the claim of impeachment this sets an awful precedent making impeachment more likely because a president is unlikely to be removed but also less potent if a president does deserve to be removed from office for real abuses if impeachment without trial becomes common genuinely dangerous presidents will cite that history as a partisan shield current senate rules say a trial isn t triggered until the house appoints impeachment managers who deliver the articles to the senate but those rules were written when senators never anticipated the house would treat impeachment in such a cavalier fashion the constitutional lawyer and our contributor david rivkin argues that in this context the senate rules violate the constitutional duty to hold a trial if democrats refuse to cooperate by providing the two thirds necessary to change the rules republicans should vote to change the rules with a simple majority mr mcconnell could tell mrs pelosi to nominate managers by a certain date or he will appoint lawyers to make the case for the house or he could announce the start of the trial by a certain date and proceed without the house managers if they fail to show up the president s lawyers could make their case and then the senate could vote this carries some political risk but faced with such a choice mrs pelosi is likely to appoint house managers in the end political risks also exist if mr mcconnell continues with his current posture of refusing to hold a trial if mrs pelosi doesn t appoint managers she and the democrats will claim from here to november that republicans were afraid to hold a trial because they know mr trump is guilty for senate republicans their constitutional duty here is also the best politics don t join nancy pelosi in defining impeachment down honor the constitution by holding a trial online https on wsj com 2znrgrd bill s fantasy he can t end street homelessness without confronting addiction and mental illness new york daily news dec 19 who can argue with a mayor promising to end street homelessness as we know it within five years we can because bill de blasio s glossy plan which commits to adding apartments and vague medical supports papers over real reasons why thousands of people sleep on benches and in subway stations and over grates and some of them rant at the heavens and threaten other new yorkers the problems are mental illness and addiction and as long as they remain at the periphery rather than the center of the city s so called solutions people will suffer most of the 60 000 plus homeless new yorkers living in our ever expanding shelter system are there because of too scarce affordable housing or domestic violence but for the roughly 3 600 souls on the street here the problems are both simpler and more complex over decades this state and this country have systematically dismantled psychiatric facilities leaving new york state s 19 5 million people with fewer than 3 000 state psychiatric hospital beds in their absence mentally ill people cycle though hospital emergency rooms shelters and jails a psych ward spilled onto the street with civil libertarians insisting that personal freedom trumps health and safety it s virtually impossible to compel these individuals to get help unless they ve deteriorated so badly they ve become dangerous to themselves or others totally absent from the mayor s optimistic plans this week were results from a 30 day review of how the city takes advantage of kendra s law an underused statute that can compel individuals into treatment and other intensive mental health interventions did we say 30 day review it s 68 days and counting since de blasio ordered one in the wake of the murders of four homeless men by another homeless man the city s sluggishness is a depressing sign of its refusal to get real online https bit ly 34s3mdx governor needs to fill cayuga community college vacancies soon the auburn citizen dec 22 when melina carnicelli steps down from the cayuga community college board of trustees the nine seat board will have two vacancies both of them need gov andrew cuomo to appoint replacements unfortunately as of last week s board meeting college officials are in the dark about when those appointments will be made that needs to change and it needs to change quickly carnicelli s term one of four gubernatorial appointed seats on the ccc board expired in june 2018 the former auburn mayor agreed to continue serving until a replacement was made outreach to the state from the college took place and yet more than a year later there s been no action from the governor and carnicelli understandably can t continue to wait indefinitely so she s given notice that she ll be moving on at the end of this month the other vacancy emerged last summer when board member angela daddabbo stepped down for personal reasons a third vacancy surfaced in recent weeks when county legislator patrick manunik who has represented the county legislature on the board submitted his resignation in conjunction with his imminent retirement as a legislator but unlike the gubernatorial seats the mahunik seat was quickly filled by the county legislature and legislator charlie ripley was sworn in and served at his first trustees meeting on thursday while it s understandable that a governor s appointment may take a little longer to finalize than one from the legislature the delays from the executive branch with respect to these recent ccc vacancies are inexcusable the board can still function with seven people of course but the smaller number increases the possibility of a meeting lacking a quorum required for official actions to take place moreover the college community deserves to have a full board ccc president brian durant put it well last week when discussing why the college will continue try despite the silence from albany to engage the governor in getting these openings filled it always is great to have the full representation covered that s available to us and the more perspectives that we re able to add to the conversation the stronger we are online https bit ly 2zpwl9a safety issues make protests dangerous at centennial circle in glens falls the post star dec 22 if you weren t in downtown glens falls at rush hour tuesday night let s set the scene for you by 5 p m it was dark and the streets all around the city were slick from a daylong snowstorm snow plows continued to make periodic sweeps but traffic was moving fairly well despite the distractions downtown from the roundabout up broad street to church street impeachment fever both for and against was playing out in competing protests with flags and banners being waved and people shouting at each other and once again there were no city rules we implore the glens falls common council to do something this has been going on since last summer and while we understand the wheels of justice can turn slowly they should not stop entirely to their credit the common council did propose some detailed standards for how to deal with these protests earlier this year a public hearing was held to get feedback the city appeared on the verge of adopting standards when the new york civil liberties union stepped in to say it had problems with the proposal to their credit the city agreed to hear them out but it seems to us the nyclu didn t have a firm grasp on the main complaint safety having protests at the roundabout where five busy roads converge in the heart of a small city like glens falls is a hazardous distraction if the nyclu is truly concerned about these protests and what rules will govern them they should have witnessed the snow test after dark tuesday night as distracting as the summer protests were they were at least held in daylight the nyclu might have gotten a better feel for the concerns if it had witnessed protesters on both sides of broad street periodically spilling out onto the snowy road in front of cars and snow plows on hand were just two glens falls police officers to keep the peace we re sure the nyclu has a certain level of expertise on freedom of speech issues but we re not sure what experience they have with pedestrian safety we understand the city doesn t want to be sued by the nyclu we understand that the city wants to be fair and get this right but in the meantime it has to do something to get protests away from the five way intersection it was also clear tuesday night that political passion had not cooled any with the falling snow and with an impeachment trial expected in january there could be more rallies and more confrontations to go with more snow and darker nights we urge the common council to pass a simple resolution that bans any group that gathers from loitering at centennial circle citizens who plan on protesting in glens falls should respect the common council s concerns about safety and adhere to this one simple request it is a beautiful city with many other convenient places for the public to gather as we have said multiple times in the past city park provides a much better venue for people to assemble and air their views while remaining safe one group did start its assembly at the city park tuesday we hope they noticed while they were there the enchanting holiday lights and magical atmosphere all around the park and downtown it is truly spectacular this time of year and much more suited for christmas carols it would have been encouraging if both groups ended the evening that way maybe next time online https bit ly 39a9l0x party paralysis imperils nation plattsburgh press republican dec 21 the house of representatives impeachment vote last week was very bad news for the legacy of president donald trump it also seems as if political party affiliation has trampled individual conscience and thought as the steering wheel of our government all 197 republicans voted against impeachment and all 233 democrats believed equally strongly the other way the issues were too sophisticated and nuanced and the membership too intelligent to lead to that conclusion this is what we as american citizens are stuck with a government seemingly divided by party what are the chances that without party affiliation all of those members would settle into the opinions expressed in those votes abc news had a feature the evening of the vote on a high school classroom in which the teacher explained to the students the issues being debated in the impeachment hearing she invited her pupils to take up the debate they did and with reason replacing hostile stubbornness independence of thought replacing party fawning the topics were discussed some students changed their minds but nobody got angry would america be better off relying on the decisions of those students than on those weathered politicians in the capitol party means everything of the 430 current members of congress zero republicans broke ranks and only two democrats voted against the abuse of power article and three voted against the obstruction of congress charge one independent a former republican voted in favor of trump s impeachment on both counts twenty years ago when former president clinton was impeached or in 1974 when congress was close to impeaching nixon many more members voted with their conscience instead of their party democratic presidential candidate tom steyer has called for term limits as a cure for such party domination this newspaper has long opposed term limits arguing that no other job punishes experience and embraces naivete but now we re wondering and what is perhaps more important to our country s future is this just the beginning of stultifying gridlock will every president henceforth face impeachment because politics calls for it donald trump is the third president impeached will he represent the norm in this regard from now on hopefully america can get past this chapter and move forward in a positive light the aisles in the capitol building are deeper even than the
