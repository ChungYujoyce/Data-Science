reported the former presidential hopeful still has yet to make an endorsement in response to warren s departure the working families party tweeted it has been an honor to be a part of this fight with elizabeth but while her presidential campaign may be over the fight for her vision of big structural change continues sanders is currently lacking in endorsements from other former presidential hopefuls as they several have endorsed former vice presidentjoe biden among those include former new york city mayormichael bloomberg sen amy klobuchar d minn former south bend ind mayorpete buttigieg d and former rep beto o rourke d texas more recently biden garnered support from sen kamala harris d ca and sen cory booker d n j as ijr previously reported sanders is currently trailing biden on the delegate count the michigan primary is slated for tuesday which is crucial as sanders will need to gather more delegates in order to save his presidential bid the candidates are set to vie for a total of 125 michigan delegates california still has about 2 500 11 precincts outstanding this is one week later good job dirty tricks https youtu be t78ff26 v8s so what the dnc and the few remaining d rats will make sure the old marxist doesn t come close to being nominated in july i m sure the fbi and secret service already have the names and addresses of your commie comrades who say milwaukee will be burned to the ground if sanders is not nominated jurek in iowa and weissburger in sc their remarks captured on video proves socialists r complete idiots it s not clear if the working families party was the former socialist workers party swp of which marxist bernie was not only a member but a candidate for an swp office in 1980 where are the congressional votes for bernie s policies where is the preparation of bernie supporters for the likelihood this is not even going to occur in warren s very optimistic prediction of 3 years where is the thought to the consequences if anyone needs to have their feet to the fire it is bernie agreed we are screwed if king donald the loser is allowed to continue his incompetence corruption and fascism we are screwed those on the bright welcome it so don t look to them for any help or solace if biden wins we are screwed too because who knows how far his corruption and incompetence will go he promised to do nothing if the american voter does not wake up and choose better politicians we are screwed for at least another generation and we the people can not afford what is coming only those socialist communist marxist fascist supporters would make such an uninformed biased and asinine comment as would be expected from those like you in the hate america mob wake up pat attention to the facts and this president s growing record of accomplishments in short put brain in gear or apply for one if needed for an initial installation before engaging mouth save america from the fascists vote for trump and straight republican down ballot socialists are future communist murderers in training save america from the fascists confused james the projectionist if you don t want a fascist in power then don t vote for your dear leader as you can see below i will not be voting for a fascist outnow refusefascism org well then thank you for voting for president trump s second term as it presently stands it s trump 84 commie bernie 13 with 2 saying neither which is a vote for trump i just knew the american people were smarter than electing an old communist sympathizer and fascist dictator like bolshevik bernie i just knew the american people were smarter confused james the projectionist you are confused confused james the projectionist voting for the current fascist in the white house is not smart the 2016 results proved that voters will pay a terrible price if we elect either biden or dear leader they will be different prices but the end result will be very painful we are screwed comments are closed
