the north korean problem if this continues to happen the president stated on dec 28 release of the classified internal document is unusual since china s communist system imposes strict secrecy on all

construction and high level military science and technology the weaponry will include more advanced mid and short range ballistic missiles cluster munitions etc the document said your department should at the same time seriously warn the korean authority not to overdo things on the nuclear issue the document said currently there is no issue for our country to forcefully ask korea to immediately and completely give up its nuclear weapons instead we ask korea to maintain restraint and after some years when the conditions are ripe to apply gradual reforms and eventually meet the requirement of denuclearization on the korean peninsula punitive measures the document then directs the liaison department to warn that if north korea insists on acting rashly further punitive measures will be imposed on senior north korean leaders and their family members the directive lists requirements for the liaison department to pursue including informing the north koreans of china s determination to protect the korean government on behalf of the central committee of cpc liaison officials also were tasked with informing the north koreans of promises of support and aid in exchange for pyongyang making substantial compromises on its nuclear issues according to the current deployment of world forces and the geographic position of the korean peninsula to prevent the collapse of the korean government and the possible direct military confrontation with western hostile forces led by the united states on the korean peninsula caused by these issues our country russia and other countries will have to resort to all the effective measures such as diplomatic mediation and military diversion to firmly ensure the peace and stability on the korean peninsula and to prevent chaos and war which is also the common position held firmly by our country russia and others the report said the document states that if the u s rushes to war against north korea the conflict would have a huge impact on the political and economic state of the region and the world at such a time the security of japan and south korea can be hardly taken care of especially the security of seoul the document said also our country russia and others will absolutely not look on the chaotic situation on the korean peninsula without taking any action the document states that china believes that theoretically western powers will not use military force to overthrow the kim regime to solve the nuclear issue however international provocations by korea via repeatedly conducting nuclear tests has imposed huge international pressure on our country that is continuously accumulating and becoming unbearably heavy the document says stern warning and assurances the deal outlined in the document to be communicated to pyongyang includes a stern warning combined with related assurances to korea at the same time that is currently north korea will not have to immediately give up its nuclear weapons that so long as korea promises not to continue conducting new nuclear tests and immediately puts those promises into action our country will immediately increase economic trade and military assistance to korea and will add or continue providing the following benefits the report states the first item then lists greatly increasing trade with north korea to keep the government operating and to raise the living standard of north koreans as for products under international sanctions such as crude oil products except for the related products clearly defined as related to nuclear tests under the condition of fully ensuring domestic demand of korea we will only make a symbolic handling or punishment the communist party document said past document leaks have included party documents on decision making related to the 1989 military crackdown on unarmed protesters in beijing s tiananmen square published in the 2001 book the tiananmen papers a more recent disclosure in october was the release of an internal communist party document authorizing the ministry of state security china s civilian spy service to dispatch 27 intelligence officers to the united states to crush hostile forces that document was made public by exiled chinese businessman turned dissident guo wengui orville schell a china specialist who worked on the tiananmen papers said he could not authenticate the document but said it has an air of veracity the language in chinese is spot on party speak and the logic of the argument would appear to be congruent with the current line and what is happening said mr schell director of the center on u s china relations at the asia society in new york andrew nathan a professor at columbia university also could not authenticate the document but said it looks genuine the typeface layout header seal vocabulary and diction are all those of an official inner party document said mr nathan who also worked on the tiananmen papers mr nathan said the document appeared to be a directive for international liaison department director mr song s mission to pyongyang two months later the chinese language version uses some terms that reveal china s contempt for north korea such as the term ruling authorities for the kim regime something mr nathan said strikes an unfriendly tone former state department intelligence official john tkacik a china affairs specialist said the document appears genuine and if confirmed as authentic would represent a bombshell disclosure mr tkacik said the document may be evidence that china has no real commitment to pressuring north korea to give up nuclear weapons and indeed sees north korean nuclear arms as an additional strategic threat to the united states one that china can claim no influence over reading between the lines it is clear that china views north korea as giving it leverage with the u s so long as the u s believes that china is doing all it can do mr tkacik said former u s ambassador to the united nations john r bolton said if the document is authentic it reveals china s policy to be completely cynical and utterly detached from its publicly stated position the white house would have to react accordingly he added trump criticizes past n korea policies trump last week tweeted a video showing then president bill clinton praising the 1994 agreed framework that mr clinton said at the time would freeze and ultimately dismantle the north korean nuclear program the video also included a clip of mr trump on nbc s meet the press from 1999 urging action then to stop the north korean nuclear program in its early stages mr trump told the new york times after last week s tweet that he was disappointed to learn china is secretly shipping oil to north korea oil is going into north korea so i m not happy about it he said adding that he has been soft on china for its unfair trade practices and technology theft in hopes of getting support to end the crisis with pyongyang china has a tremendous power over north korea far greater than anyone knows mr trump said dec 28 if they don t help us with north korea then i do what i ve always said i want to do the president added china can help us much more and they have to help us much more we have a nuclear menace out there which is no good for china and it s not good for russia it s no good for anybody the trump administration has been signaling for months it is prepared to use military force against north korea to rid the country of nuclear arms and missile delivery systems north korea conducted several long range missile tests in 2017 that u s officials have said indicate rapid progress toward building a missile capable of targeting the united states with a nuclear warhead defense secretary james mattis said dec 29 that he has drawn up military options for operations against north korea i don t speculate as you know about future operations by our forces mr mattis told reporters but with three u n security council resolutions in a row unanimously adopted each one has put significantly more pressure on the north korean regime for its provocations for its outlaw activities i think you will see increased pressure asked if the united states is closer to war with north korea mr mattis said you know i provide military options right now this is a clearly a diplomatically led effort with a lot of international diplomatic support it s got a lot of economic buttressing so it s not like it s just words it s real activities buffer zone the party directive states that china regards north korea as a strategic buffer zone needed to fend off hostile western forces ideologically north korea also is important to china in promoting its vision of socialism with chinese characteristics led by our party and north korea is seen as irreplaceable according to the document the party regards the continuity of the korean government as one of its unwavering goals this issue is about the peace and stability of the korean peninsula and the fundamental interests of our party our country and all chinese people the document concludes adding that the department should quickly coordinate with the foreign and commerce
