d for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic xi jinping anointed last month as china s new leader was an impressionable 9 year old in 1962 when his father a prominent revolutionary and vice premier fell out of favor with mao zedong six years later as his father languished in prison mr xi was among the millions of intellectual youth who were banished from urban areas to the countryside during mao s cultural revolution which sought to enforce communism across china he was sent to liangjiahe a remote village in china s impoverished northwestern province of shaanxi where he worked as an agricultural laborer top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time he spent six years there cutting hay reaping wheat and shepherding in the daytime and then reading books in the dim light of a kerosene lamp while enduring the harassment of fleas at night according to mr xi s official biography published in china s state media recalling those days mr xi would later tell a chinese magazine i ate a lot more bitterness than most people born in beijing in 1953 mr xi is a princeling a term given to children of high ranking communist party officials for most of his life mr xi has had to battle the negative perceptions associated with princelings whose political success is seen by many chinese as a consequence of their elite parentage rather than their own talent or hard work a survivor mr xi was openly critical of the cultural revolution but did not shun the communist party instead mr xi chose to survive by becoming redder than red as an acquaintance of his said according to a leaked u s embassy cable this is a man who knows how to make friends both in the party and outside the party said yang jianli president of initiatives for china a u s based organization dedicated to advancing peaceful democratic change in china on nov 15 mr xi was confirmed to lead china for the next decade when he was named secretary general of the communist party of china mr xi stands in stark contrast to the man he has succeeded hu jintao you feel relaxed when you talk to him he is approachable he is not a bureaucrat said chi wang president of the u s china policy foundation who has met mr xi a few times including in washington earlier this year after mao died in 1976 mr xi s father was rehabilitated and appointed party secretary of guangdong province where he oversaw economic reforms his father s connections helped secure him a spot in the elite tsinghua university and later a job as personal secretary to geng biao who was defense minister at the time mr xi rose through the party ranks in china s eastern fujian province where he became governor in 2000 seven years later he assumed the role of communist party secretary in shanghai after his predecessor was ousted in a corruption scandal unknown factor barely six months into his new job mr xi was elevated to the politburo standing committee china s top political body in a sign that he was expected to succeed mr hu in october 2010 he was appointed vice chairman of the central military commission removing any doubts about his imminent rise to the very top we know a lot about xi jinping but little is known about which direction he is going to take said mr yang he has no political achievement whatsoever he has no good record but he also has no bad record few expect mr xi to be a different leader in substance from his predecessors he is party chief of the political system he is bound by very very strong interests said mr yang one of the reasons mr xi will find it hard to make his own mark is that the communist party s seven member politburo standing committee takes major policy decisions by consensus there is really very little evidence that xi himself is going to be a major innovator that he is going to try and shake things up or change things he has benefited from the system and there is not much evidence that he would want to rock the boat said dean cheng of the heritage foundation s asian studies center mr xi is expected to focus early in his tenure on tackling china s rampant corruption and turning around a slowing economy corruption in china is out of control said mr wang of the u s china policy foundation he should take care of the home front first before focusing on foreign policy he added cheng li of the brookings institution said the new chinese leadership will continue to push for much bolder economic reform now there is good opportunity for them to prove they are capable economic administrators mr li said at brookings forum recently prickly assertive the u s china relationship will continue to be dominated by chinese concerns over the u s s asia pivot despite assurances from the obama administration the new policy initiative is widely viewed in china as an attempt to check its rise globally on a visit to washington in february mr xi met with president obama vice president joseph r biden secretary of state hillary rodham clinton and defense secretary leon e panetta the chinese are going to be more prickly more assertive when it comes to territory and other issues of nationalism said mr cheng of the heritage foundation so for u s policy what we re looking at is a very great likelihood that we are going to wind up with a china that is going to be more assertive toward u s allies more aggressive in some ways mr xi has a more emotional bond with the united states than mr hu unlike mr hu who first traveled to the u s in 2002 mr xi has visited the u s many times he first came as part of an agricultural delegation in 1985 and stayed with a family in muscatine iowa mr xi has a daughter who is studying at harvard university his u s experience should have given him some understanding of america that is important said mr wang few expect mr xi to present a softer image when it comes to human rights mr yang who took part in the 1989 pro democracy protests is pessimistic about the chances of an improvement in china s human rights record human rights have taken a backseat in the u s china relationship so in that sense mr xi does not have to make any gestures of human rights improvement in order to maintain or improve the relat
