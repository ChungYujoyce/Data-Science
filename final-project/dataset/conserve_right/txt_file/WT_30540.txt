president trump unlike past american presidents is showing up and putting elbow grease into the effort to strike peace in a conflict now 7 decades old he s going to be very creative mr kim 49 said as he strolled through the busy myeongdong neighborhood saturday about 24 hours before mr trump proved his point by becoming the first sitting president to step into north korea while visiting the demilitarized zone see also exclusive trump s unconventional diplomacy opens doors pompeo says the dmz is a reminder that the three year military conflict between the north backed by china and the soviet union and the south backed by the u s ended with an armistice in 1953 instead of a peace treaty and thus is still formally ongoing after three previous administrations spent time trying to manage north korea s nuclear ambitions mr trump took office with a concerted push for direct dialogue with north korean leader kim jong un the move earned mr trump kudos on the streets of seoul over the weekend even if the locals most of whom spoke to the washington times through an interpreter say his manner can be off putting at times see also trump becomes first sitting u s president to enter north korea not bad 15 year old lee sang min said when asked to appraise mr trump i think he s very brave and he has a lot of confidence when he speaks kwak moon hee 69 said she thinks mr trump should win reelection some people say that trump is too stubborn and too strong but i personally think he s trustworthy and i like him she said explaining that past american leaders were too pessimistic or passive on korean issues trump is actually the first one among u s presidents who is very actively involved in korean peninsula issues and from a korean citizen s perspective i think it s something we

last year said they support a peace agreement to replace the 1953 armistice according to real meter a polling firm unification of north and south is a thornier issue many south koreans say it is a worthy goal though perhaps one that future generations should pursue given the burdens of assimilating one of the world s richest and most technologically advanced countries and one of its poorest it would mean opening up their country to a dysfunctional totalitarian state and having to absorb people from north korea into a south korea where good jobs are hard to find said scott seaman a director for asia at the eurasia group for most young south koreans north korea is not a factor in their lives even though it presents a security threat he said older people might have memories of the war relatives in the north and nostalgia for one korea in contrast young people are busy building their lives trying to build their careers and start families north korea is like the moon to them shin beomchul an analyst on inter korean relations at the asan institute a nonpartisan think tank in seoul said younger people are aware of the german case in which the 1990s unification of democratic west germany and communist east germany created years of economic drag mr kim the south korean businessman who spoke to the times would know he has been living in germany for nine years as a senior researcher for the korea institute of science and technology in europe though he was back in seoul for a two month business stay they re still suffering from reunification he said of his adopted home

since assuming the presidency in 2017 there were signs of progress last year when north korea participated in the winter olympics in the southern city of pyeongchang and mr moon and mr kim held a series of symbolic summits including a pair at the joint security area of the dmz mr kim s sister kim yo jong has also helped soften mr kim s image in the south she is considered attractive and has made her mark with high profile appearances at the olympics and at the singapore and hanoi summits between mr kim and mr trump more recently she visited mr moon at the demilitarized zone to pay

appear to be threatening on tv either my image has softened but it s not that i totally trust him ms lee said it gives me the impression we can actually talk to him others say there is no reason to trust either side jung bo kyung 67 said the u s uses its role in the korean war as an excuse to wield influence on the peninsula while playing asian allies off each other mr kim he said needs his
