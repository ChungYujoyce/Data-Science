apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic public fatigue with the possible impeachment of president trump is growing multiple polls have suggested that many americans are either not interested in the democratic party s impeachment push or don t approve of it but there could also be some collateral damage clinical forensic psychologist john huber warns that an endless impeachment cycle could take a toll on the nation as voters witness a process which could prove faulty on a very high level if president trump is impeached i think the average american will continue to have mistrust in our government most americans are upset with the amount of time and energy our politicians have put into this circus the impeachment actually began the day after the 2016 election with democrats stating that they would impeach president trump mr huber tells inside the beltway now they have moved forward with the impeachment process without president trump being allowed to present his own witnesses or legal representation the witnesses the opposition has presented have not been able to present actual testimony only hearsay testimony the opposition is moving forward with articles of impeachment that are not substantiated middle america is sick of this charade he says top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state the hearings have already created a negative effect on the collective mental state of americans and the results of this effect will probably surprise everyone in november 2020 don t be surprised if we have massive turnover on both sides of the aisle many americans are tired of the childlike reactions of our political leaders who are willing to ignore running the country to bring down a sitting president because they appear to just not like him notes mr huber who is also chairman of mainstream mental health a texas based nonprofit the volatile impeachment frenzy is driven he says by fast paced social media and the fight or flight response in simple terms this hard wired human reaction occurs when people face a threat and either fight back or run continued questionable behavior of political leaders on both sides of the aisle is an additional factor then it gets complicated compounded with a social media news cycle of about 15 to 20 minutes and algorithms on these social media apps that filter out comments that do not reflect the beliefs of the end user and we get a sort of pseudo group think this group think creates an inability to tolerate opposing points of view the lack of tolerance then stimulates the fight or flight mechanism once stimulated the fight or flight responses become all emotion and limited if any rational thought is given this allows the response to go unchecked resulting in immediate aggression and feelings of hate and vitriol mr huber says an unintended by product no wonder americans are feeling weary antsy disinterested and or melancholy about the burden of ongoing impeachment activities every day the democrats continue to focus all of their energy and all of our attention here in the media on impeachment they re also sending a signal to voters that s pretty clear we don t care what you think fox news host tucker
