r persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic taiwan urgently needs newer model f 16 jet fighters to bolster its air defenses and overall security because of growing missile and aircraft threats from china taiwan s deputy defense minister said wednesday andrew yang deputy minister for policy also said in an interview with the washington times that the island s military is interested in buying more advanced f 35 jets in the future we have about 90 f 5s as part of our air defense aircraft and obviously it is urgently in need of replacement mr yang said at the end of a four day u s visit to attend a defense industry conference that is the foundation for the proposal to acquire the f 16 c d model to replace the aging f 5 fleet top stories

stay at home orders anymore u s arms sales to taiwan are based on a 1979 law that calls for the united states to supply defensive weapons to the island this came after diplomatic recognition was shifted to beijing china however has reacted harshly to recent weapons deals cutting off military exchanges in 2008 and again in january after congress was notified of the latest 6 5 billion taiwan arms package the obama administration according to u s officials has held up its decision on the sale of 66 new f 16s worth an estimated 3 1 billion to avoid further upsetting defense ties with china they are to resume with a meeting of u s and chinese officials this week in hawaii pentagon spokesman mark ballesteros declined to comment on the pending arms sales except to say that we continue to evaluate taiwan s defense needs mr yang said other weapons purchases already in the pipeline from earlier arms sales include patriot anti missile systems black hawk troop transport helicopters and apache attack helicopters the missile defenses are needed to counter a growing threat from chinese ballistic and cruise missiles now deployed by the hundreds in positions within reach of taiwan mr yang said of course missiles are the primary threat for us he said that s the reason why we want to acquire the anti missile systems and long range radar early warning systems chinese missiles currently are targeted against air force bases and major military assets which is another reason the f 16s are needed to bolster overall defenses protecting our military capability is vitally important so that we can still have the capability to conduct counterattacks as china is going to use their air force to try and control the airspace over taiwan area in order to conduct amphibious attacks followed by those missile operations mr yang said mr yang said a pentagon study of taiwan s air defense needs is nearly complete and that different u s agencies will then weigh in on whether to approve the f 16 sale the request for the jets is rational and justifiable and should be granted he said mr yang said taiwan s military also plans to ask for u s equipment to upgrade 146 older f 16s purchased in the 1990s the f 16 a b model has been operational for nearly 20 years so it is also aging and in need of upgrade as well he said it also rational and justifiable to actually upgrade those we are going to be asking for that and the u s government has been notified that this will be another request proposed from our side however the 66 new f 16s are an urgent need and very much a crucial element for our follow up defense transformation as well mr yang said of the request for new f 16s that we are not putting all the apples in one basket but this is one of the big apples in the basket so we want to see that the request will be fulfilled the sooner the better china has not renounced plans to use force to retake the island which broke with the mainland during the civil war of the 1940s when nationalist forces fled the communists to taiwan mr yang said one likely scenario in any conflict with china would be an amphibious assault which is why strengthening air power is so important we are acquiring the black hawks to enhance our troop mobility and also acquiring the apache gunships to conduct counterattacks over the amphibious landing operations he said noting that other military modernization are part of what he called early defense china currently has between 1 200 and 1 400 missiles cruise and ballistic near taiwan and beijing has been adding and upgrading the weapons with more accurate systems he said china s growing precision strike capabilities over their targets in taiwan are a major concern for us he said mark stokes a retired air force colonel and former pentagon policymaker for asia said selling new f 16s is needed a follow on sale of additional f 16s is a measured and appropriate response to the pla s people s liberation army increasingly ambitious force modernization program and consistent with u s legal obligations under the taiwan relations act he said john tkacik a former state department asia specialist said recent tensions between china and japan over disputed islands have changed some views within the obama administration on beijing s direction obama s top asia policy people are now coming around to the realization that japan is an absolutely essential ally in organizing our democratic partners in asia if we hope to balance china s rise he said that has also brought an entirely new rethink of where taiwan is going taiwan is geographically and strategically key to japan s defenses in the western pacific and taiwan s significant territorial presence in the south china sea means that it is a key player there whether we or the southeast asians like it or not he said mr tkacik said the bush administration refused to acknowledge major shortfalls in taiwan s defense including the fact that f 5s were so old they were crashing regularly i think a modernization of taiwan s existing f 16 fleet is a step in the right direction but it doesn t answer taiwan s main problem that over half of its fighters can t fight in any kind of showdown with china he said mr tkacik noted that the f 16 sale also would create thousands
