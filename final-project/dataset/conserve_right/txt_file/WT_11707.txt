s china relations and worrying global financial markets meng wanzhou the chief financial officer of telecommunications giant huawei and daughter of its founder was detained at the request of the u s during a layover at the vancouver airport last saturday the same day that presidents donald trump and xi jinping of china agreed over dinner to a 90 day ceasefire in a trade dispute that threatens to

hold and whether the world s two biggest economies can resolve the complicated issues that divide them i think it will have a distinctively negative effect on the u s china talks said philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and an economic adviser in president george w bush s white house there s the humiliating way this happened right before the dinner with xi unaware very hard to save face on this one and we may see chinese retaliation which will embitter relations canadian prosecutor john gibb carsley said in a court hearing friday that a warrant had been issued for meng s arrest in new york aug 22 he said meng arrested en route to mexico from hong kong was aware of the investigation and had been avoiding the united states for months even though her

and skycom were separate when in fact skycom was huawei meng has contended that huawei sold skycom in 2009 in urging the court to reject meng s bail request gibb carsley said the huawei executive had vast resources and a strong incentive to bolt she s facing fraud charges in the united states that could put her in prison for 30 years meng s lawyer david martin argued that it would be unfair to
