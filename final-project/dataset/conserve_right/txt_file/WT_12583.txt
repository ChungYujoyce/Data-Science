apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinion old friend and columnist joseph alsop once told me of arriving in china with a clanking sword he had hassled across the pacific given him by his cousin fdr along with an instant inside the beltway navy commission president roosevelt sent him immediately after pearl harbor to chongqing as a political adviser to gen claire lee chennault and his volunteer flying tigers assiduously building his brief joe got horrendous details from the chinese nationalist refugee capital s best informed correspondent about the outrageous corruption of generalissimo chiang kai shek s kuomintang when joe asked our mutual friend why he wasn t writing it for his newspaper the old china hand smiled knowingly and said nobody tells on china america s romance and conflict with china are as old as the republic yale s original endowment reputedly came from a cargo of indian opium shipped to china coolies helped build the transcontinental railroads then got expelled or denied citizenship long before multiculturalism even american cities in the boonies had their chinese restaurants for those old enough to remember a chinese hand wash laundry was a landmark in every neighborhood top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots but exotic legend often obscured mundane reality most of america s china academics were for decades apologists for mao zedong s atrocities vilifying their few critical colleagues who dared to speak up some alas without confession much less apology still hold high places in american asian nongovernmental organizations even now it takes a certain temerity to publish tomes about mao s secret famines a hong kong friend recalls only 3 1 2 million here were trying desperately to get food packets to mainland relatives now history repeats itself as stories begin to proliferate about the coming chinese economic crisis a minority of us have watched stupefied over the years as writer after writer and economist after economist without caveat spelled out the glories of the chinese model hold up you mean there hasn t been incredible chinese economic development yes of course there has and no one who has lived with the chinese entrepreneurial spirit wherever it flowered among overseas chinese or in taiwan or recalls the prosperity of china s pre world war ii s coastal cities even under japanese assault was surprised when that spirit took off again after maximum leader deng xiaoping opened the floodgates to foreign capital and technology but those shanghai office towers across the river in pudong were already standing empty a decade ago not that you would know from any contemporary reporting as prime minister zhu rongji publicly pleaded with provincial bureaucrats to stop fabricating figures because it made it impossible for him to know what was going on only a year ago provincial gross domestic product figures didn t jibe with the national totals but never mind our academics and most of the financial media kept right on grinding out incredible gobbledygook about economics with chinese characteristics how china s gdp growth made it no 2 in the world despite subsistence living standards for the majority of its people how chinese growth would save the world etc now even the financial times among the loudest and most indiscriminate propagandists for china straight line projections has taken a deep breath predicting coming problems perhaps even disaster the chinese boom has depended on export markets that are now drying up in the u s and europe it has relied on unlimited infrastructure expansion but government stimulus is leading to inflation virtually zero rural investment and protectionist trading practices are driving up food prices where most chinese live banks newly created debt dumps are being used for loans to party favorites so there just might be a credit problem the government is shifting to subsidized housing still beyond the reach of wage earners to deflate a real estate bubble the only place hot money could go with government planned investment oh yes and it s now clear chinese growth isn t going to save the world economy in fact some commodity dependent economies are going to be in little trouble hello but there is always room for new wishful thinking beijing will use its depreciating dollar hoard already backing local currency to expand the money stock as measured by meaningless m2 and m3 western econometrics or it will try to buy western equities scaring the wits out of security minded politicians or get at technologies such as natural gas shale fracking to reduce its growing reliance on imported energy and of course chinese planners somehow will manage a soft landing after almost every disaster natural or man made there is the inevitable cry why didn t we see this coming it was so obvious sol sanders a veteran international correspondent writes weekly on the intersection of politics business and economics he can be
