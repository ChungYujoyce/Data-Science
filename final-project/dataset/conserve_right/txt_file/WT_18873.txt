apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic san francisco ap andy zhang walked over to the driving range as just another teenager wanting an autograph from his favorite players instead he had the gallery at the olympic club asking for his signature welcome to the u s open kid all of 14 years old and preparing to start the ninth grade zhang is believed to be the youngest player in championship

before his practice round tuesday morning with masters champion bubba watson and aaron baddeley was another story zhang was so giddy that his caddie chris gold had to calm him down i was like chris can i go out on the range and ask for autographs zhang asked he said no today you re giving out the autographs after shedding some early nerves on the unleveled lake course zhang settled into a grove and even outdrove his more accomplished counterparts on occasion by the end of the round his smile behind those big braces of course lit up the gallery and had everyone from tiger woods to rory mcilroy wondering the same question who is this kid when i was 14 i was getting prepared to play in my club championship not the u s open said mcilroy who set the tournament scoring record at 16 under 268 last year at congressional so i m not sure i could give him any words of wisdom zhang s journey already has taken him around the planet he was born in shandong china and started playing tournaments in the united states at age 10 when he won his division in the junior world championship at torrey pines zhang took a trip with a friend to the david leadbetter golf academy in the orlando area shortly after and moved there four years ago without knowing a word of english zhang taught himself the language it was kind of funny because he would go to school and he would say hello and goodbye and that s it leadbetter instructor andrew park said by phone from florida the following day he would say a b c eventually we couldn t keep him quiet his english was so good the evolution of
