americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time trump raised hopes for the latest talks by striking a surprisingly conciliatory tone toward china which he has long accused of predatory business practices that robbed american jobs and swelled washington s trade deficit with beijing trump offered a lifeline to zte a chinese telecom company that is fighting for survival after being hit with sanctions this month by the u s commerce department trump tweeted sunday that he was working with president xi jinping to put zte back in business fast and save tens of thousands of chinese jobs a stance that drew an immediate outcry from many republicans and democrats alike trump had campaigned for the presidency on a vow to strike a much tougher trade stance than his recent predecessors who he argued had agreed to deals that gave an unfair advantage to america s competitors the president has pointed to the u s trade deficit 566 billion last year as a sign of economic weakness caused by disastrous agreements and abusive behavior by china and other countries he has proposed tariffs on 50 billion in chinese imports

about 1 billion in fines commerce last month accused zte of violating the agreement and blocked the company from importing american components for seven years the department said zte had misled regulators instead of disciplining all employees involved in the sanctions violations commerce asserted zte had paid some of them full bonuses and then lied about it the two countries are reportedly

exports it might also hurt his republican party in the november congressional elections he s worried about the midterms and the impact of his trade policy on farmers perry said still trump s zte tweet drew fire on capitol hill from some democrats and republicans it s the wrong time to cut a deal and this would be a terrible deal said republican sen marco rubio of florida rubio said china won t play by the rules he said the trump administration has been given an historic opportunity to place the u s s relationship with china in proper balance he said one misstep could blow the whole thing apart and doom generations of americans to living in a world not one with a powerful china one with a dominant china and a declining america if they win this battle on zte the world will notice and the message it will send is that when push comes to shove this administration is no different than the others rubio said senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york lambasted trump for going easy on
