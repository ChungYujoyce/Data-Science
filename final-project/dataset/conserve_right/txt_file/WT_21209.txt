balloon of mr trump s head on a diapered baby s body near the lincoln memorial though the group said some of the details of where and when were being worked out we see it as an image of trump s behavior which is as we all know unpredictable and prone to tantrums about things that are really really dangerous code pink co director ariel gold told reporters upon filing the permit request it s a way of saying we really need an adult in the white house mr trump originally sought to hold a military parade with tanks and other vehicles in washington for veterans day but the pentagon balked and

thousands of t shirts emblazoned with the uss john s mccain the warship named in part after the late senator from arizona who often clashed with mr trump the group said it has raised enough money to distribute at least 5 000 t shirts on the mall and hopes for veterans ultimately to hand out 10 000 shirts the ship is also named for mccain s father and grandfather both of whom were navy admirals when the president looks out at the crowd on the mall the group said we want him to see a crowd filled with americans wearing uss john s mccain t shirts because the 4th is about honoring the idea of a country bigger than oneself and generations of mccains showed that through military service and sacrifice during mr trump s visit to japan in may news stories surfaced that the white house had ordered navy officials to move the uss john s mccain out of view from the site of the president s address to soldiers and sailors at a navy base mr trump said he didn t know about it and the white house later
