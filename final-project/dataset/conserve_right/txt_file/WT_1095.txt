 administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic democrats clamoring for more witnesses at president trump s impeachment trial are concealing one of those questioned in the house investigation president trump s defense team says rep adam b schiff california democrat and other impeachment managers repeatedly talk about the 17 witnesses interviewed during the house s secretive depositions but they do not mention an 18th witness michael atkinson the intelligence community s inspector general who has firsthand knowledge of the origins of the whistleblower complaint that led to the impeachment members of the house permanent select committee on intelligence who conducted the interview are barred from disclosing details but republicans on the committee said the testimony should be heard at the president s impeachment trial in the senate see also senate gop unmoved by dems impeachment message not changing our opinion the reason it hasn t been released is it s not helpful to adam schiff it is not helpful to the whistleblower said rep john ratcliffe texas republican who took part in the october interview with mr atkinson it raises credibility issues about both of them the potentially exculpatory evidence for mr trump has remained classified and is not part of the record for the impeachment trial because it remains classified only members of the intelligence committee have seen it and mr trump s legal team is denied a copy see also trump says democrats impeachment arguments loaded with lies at start of trial mr trump is on trial for two articles of impeachment abuse of power for asking ukraine to investigate former vice president joseph r biden one of mr trump s potential opponents in november and obstruction of congress for not cooperating with the house impeachment inquiry the president acknowledged that he wanted ukraine to look into any corruption involving mr biden and into allegations that the country meddled in u s elections in 2016 he said both are legitimate investigations after two days of hearing the impeachment case senate republicans appear poised to acquit mr trump of the charges house democrats approved on a party line vote dec 18 mr atkinson s briefing for house lawmakers covered the origins of the whistleblower complaint that led to the two articles of impeachment mr trump s supporters charge that the whistleblower was part of a scheme to take down the president and that the complaint was coordinated by mr schiff chairman of the intelligence committee and the lead house impeachment manager prosecuting the case mr schiff denies he had contact with the whistleblower but it was later revealed that his staff met with the whistleblower before the complaint was filed with mr atkinson the whistleblower is said to be a cia analyst assigned to the white house who has ties to the democratic party and mr biden mr atkinson met with mr schiff and his committee in october to discuss the whistleblower complaint in detail house and senate members were first briefed about the complaint when news of the whistleblower became public in september but the closed door committee session remains a focus of house republicans with knowledge of the interview mr ratcliffe said they have demanded the release of a transcript of the interview especially because mr atkinson identified other fact witnesses it addresses the issue about contacts between schiff his staff and the whistleblower and what the inspector general knows about that so those are material facts that should be talked about but adam schiff has prevented that mr ratcliffe told the washington times an official on mr schiff s committee staff said the briefing with mr atkinson was not conducted with the other two committees involved in the impeachment investigation the foreign affairs and oversight and reform committees and therefore did not qualify as a deposition contrary to what has been said the official said the chairman does not have the ability unilaterally to classify or declassify an intelligence committee transcript mr ratcliffe said that whatever mr schiff wants to call it a deposition or a transcribed interview the information is important for the american people to see his testimony was noticed three days after the impeachment inquiry was announced there is a 179 page transcript of questions and the ig s answers under oath same as with the impeachment inquiry interviews and depositions mr ratcliffe said it is unclear whether any part of the transcribed interview has been shared with members of the senate permanent select committee on intelligence a spokeswoman for the committee said she will not discuss committee materials during a break in the trial sen joni ernst iowa republican said house democrats should have submitted the transcript we should be allowed to take a look at that but again they have stated numerous times in their brief they had overwhelming evidence it would be so clear to everyone and i haven t seen that yet she said on their second day of arguments house impeachment managers hammered at the president s defense that the investigations requested of ukraine were legitimate the investigations they said were intended only to benefit mr trump s reelection bid by wounding mr biden and countering the perception that mr trump s 2016 election was illegitimate key to that argument is mr biden s public boasting that as vice president he threatened to block 1 billion in loan guarantees unless ukrainian leaders fired the country s chief prosecutor the prosecutor viktor shokin had looked into corruption at ukrainian energy company burisma holdings where hunter biden landed a 50 000 a month job on the board of directors while his father led obama administration efforts in kyiv mr biden s muscling of ukraine to fire the country s chief prosecutor was obama administration policy not a bid to protect his son the house impeachment managers argued rep sylvia r garcia a texas democrat on the prosecution team said mr shokin s successor was more likely to investigate burisma it would actually increase chances of a burisma investigation she said impeachment managers also characterized mr trump s belief in ukrainian interference as a debunked conspiracy theory prompted by russia to obscure its own interference in u s elections that s what donald trump wanted investigated or announced this completely bogus kremlin pushed conspiracy theory mr schiff told the senate mr trump s defenders though cite kyiv s public opposition to mr trump during the campaign and cooperation with the democratic national committee in conducting opposition research dnc contractor alexandra chalupa has acknowledged working with the ukrainian embassy in washington to dig up dirt on mr trump and his campaign manager paul manafort the episode was detailed last year by politico republicans repeatedly mentioned ms chalupa during two weeks of public hearings on impeachment that were conducted by the house permanent select committee on intelligence senate minority leader charles e schumer
