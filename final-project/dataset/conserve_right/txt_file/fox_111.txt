be in its final form and may be updated dana perino anchor i aposm dana perino in for chris wallace president trump doubles down on his citizenship question for the 2020 census and says ice raids are coming begin videotape donald trump president they will be starting fairly soon but i don apost call them raids perino and defends the state of border facilities trump i aposve seen some of those places and they are run beautifully perino as tensions over immigration reach a flash point rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y these women were being told by cbp officers to drink out of the toilet rep joaquin castro d tx we saw that the system was still broken that people aposs human rights are still being abused perino we aposll discuss the conditions at the border and a showdown over the census trump we are working on a lot of things including an executive order perino with ken cuccinelli acting director of u s citizenship and immigration services then crowd we want joe perino the 2020 candidates hit the trail for the fourth of july we aposll talk exclusively with colorado senator michael bennet about his run for the white house and trump we aposll see what happens with iran iran has to be very very careful perino president trump warns iran aposs leaders that their nuclear threats could come back to bite them we aposll ask our sunday panel about the president aposs iran strategy all right now on fox news sunday end videotape perino and hello again from fox news in washington president trump says he aposs mulling his options including an executive order to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census last week the supreme court blocked the question at least temporarily and now mr trump says he aposs working with the justice department to find a legal way forward joining us here in washington ken cuccinelli acting director of u s citizenship and immigration services the agency in charge of determining who can immigrate to the u s legally great to have you here ken cuccinelli u s citizenship and immigration services good to be with you dana perino good to see you again so last tuesday the commerce secretary wilbur ross says we are going to forgo the citizenship question on the census and the next morning president says not so fast and he tweets this basically saying that was fake news we are absolutely moving forward as we must because of the importance of the answer to this question and then on friday he was asked about it again and he said this begin video clip trump you need it for congress for redistricting you need it for appropriations where are the funds going how many people are there are they citizens are they not citizen you need it for many reasons end video clip perino so i have a question do you think that there will be a citizenship question on the 2020 census cuccinelli i do think so i think the president has expressed determination he aposs noticed the supreme court didn apost say this can apost be asked they said they didn apost appreciate the process by which it came for with the first time so the president is determined to fix that and to have it roll forward in the 2020 census perino do you think what you think about people who say well it doesn apost the founding fathers said its people not citizens that you have to count do you worry at all i know you aposre obviously a lawyer for a long time constitutionally how do you feel about that cuccinelli yes i don apost i don apost have a problem with that at all i think that if you look at what we aposve asked over the years including of course the citizenship question famously asked many many times through our history we ask a lot of other information as well and in addition to just getting the raw number of souls in the country we find out a lot of other information that aposs useful for governance perino when the president says you need it for congress for redistricting is that a legal concern because one of the questions has been what was the motivations for one wanting the question in the first place cuccinelli well and i think the answer is there are many reasons he listed a few there starting with the one you mentioned but it isn apost it isn apost the only one there are lots of reasons for my agency distribution of work can be considered i mean there aposs all sorts of other things crosstalk perino yes i was going to ask you do you think the citizenship question would help you and what you do at your new job cuccinelli right now we are redistricting our workload among our district offices and our regional offices to a level that workload and as it shifts around the country we shift and knowing where that work is coming from is helpful perino let me ask about the other thing about two weeks ago president trump had referenced the possibility of some raids for people who are here illegally so that our government would say ok guys you aposve got to go back cuccinelli right perino that was called off and he and the speaker spoke they said let aposs try to get the supplemental money done cuccinelli right perino that got done but now the president is saying they are expected soon i know that there are some groups that have been trying to help people who are here illegally to be able to not be found by our government cuccinelli i think that aposs called harboring yes perino i wanted to ask you about that and can raids be successful if people know that they are coming cuccinelli well first of all if people know that they aposre coming that aposs a threat to officer safety but realize there aposs about a million approximately a million people in this country who already have removal orders they aposve been all the way through an extremely generous due process pipeline had removal orders perino they don apost leave cuccinelli they don apost leave perino uh huh cuccinelli that are still awaiting removal by ice and the president commented i don apost call these raids i would agree with him this is just what ice is supposed to do the fact that we aposve fallen to the point where we aposre talking about it like it aposs news tells you how far that we have fallen in the enforcement side i mean it is the most violated federal court order in america perino i know they talked about possibly giving a find to people who have overstated their after the order and it could go up to 500 000 i mean i aposm assuming the trump administration doesn apost expect to ever see any of that money cuccinelli well we can collect it from who we could i aposm sure but for a lot of these folks they aposve been evading the law for so long you aposd expect them to evade that sort of collection as well perino when the congress comes back this week the house democrats are going to have some hearings and they want to focus this week on conditions at the border here is how the i g at the department of homeland security described the thing they have to call for here the basically that children at three of the five border patrol facilities that we visited had no access to showers at these facilities children have limited access to a change of clothes border patrol had few spare close and no longer facilities but you went to see it for yourself cuccinelli right perino and you talked about given the conditions right cuccinelli right perino i think we have that here as well you said given the conditions and the circumstances that the situation you thought was pretty good cuccinelli i do i mean recall that this is a pipeline border patrol is at the front of the pipeline if you can apost move people to the pipeline if the next stage of the pipeline is full and ice is the next stage of the pipeline and their detention beds are not only full they aposre overfull i went to one of their facilities at el paso it has about 950 people in a facility for 800 it was being run well it was run safely and so forth but once you aposre over those capacity points you encounter problems perino what happens then if they keep coming we still have to take them cuccinelli right if they keep coming people in the house come down and complain about them keep coming while not helping fix the problem it aposs the height of hypocrisy it just keeps happening crosstalk perino do you think that it aposs critical to get the asylum law changed in order to stop that flow cuccinelli it is it is perino and if that aposs the case would you consider recommending that the administration try to have the asylum law changes attached to must pass legislation coming up in september cuccinelli absolutely i looked at the house calendar before they go to the beach in august and head off for their vacations they have nothing except hearings on this subject they just want to politicize it they don apost want to actually solve the problem dana you mentioned a solution which would be some basic changes for instance to asylum the incredible fear standard to stop the trafficking of children things we should all be able to agree on and yet they are not going to consider that before they head out and then undoubtedly will come back and complain more about the numbers at the border because that aposs what aposs happening you can complain about conditions conditions are driven by those numbers so ultimately they aposre complaining about the numbers that they aposre attracting here perino i just wanted to you are responsible for implementing the law and also taking care of the people that are there so i sort of think that if there aposs legislation that has to be passed like the debt ceiling for example cuccinelli right perino attach that to them do you think you could get democratic support for that cuccinelli we could i mean that aposs a hard one to predict because there aposs so many elements that go into any bill like that or any legislative strategy like that but certainly on the administration side i can apost imagine we would take any of those options off the table perino you basically did says you were at a citizenship ceremony cuccinelli yes several of them actually perino i mean just curious when you see that and it aposs very motivating cuccinelli it is it aposs very crosstalk perino tell me a little bit more about that cuccinelli yes first of all for people who haven apost been to one it aposs worth going to it is a very moving experience every time these are people who have gone through our legal process they aposve been legally present here for a number of years at least five years and gone through the tests and the interview and so forth to become american citizens and committed and probably the most extensive oath that anyone takes related to the federal government to their new country and renouncing and abjuring all prior allegiance perino how many people per year is america letting in right now cuccinelli well last year we were in the range of 850 000 and that was the most in five years and this fiscal year we will pass that so you know people who come after the president and this administration say you know you don apost like immigrants well we are letting more people become citizens than has happened in years so perino i don apost think people realize that indeed cuccinelli no they don apost perino i also wanted to ask you about this so if we could pull up this tweet from dr russell moore this is from a couple weeks ago and he tweeted this he said the reports for conditions of migrant children at the border should shock all of our consciences those created in the image of god should be treated with dignity and compassion especially seeking those refuge from violence back home we can do better than this now he took some criticism for that from michael jerry falwell jr but i know you aposre a man of deep faith and for people who are at church on sunday thinking about these things they want rule of law cuccinelli that aposs right perino but they also have this concern cuccinelli that aposs right perino especially about the children and how were supposed to treat the meek cuccinelli that aposs right and it aposs worth remembering that this massive influx of fraudulent asylum claims are swamping the people who truly fit that category the people who are persecuted for political or religious regions or other reasons those people are being swamped and they are caught in a backlog caused by an enormous number of false claims and those false claims are coming because the congress refuses especially the house refuses to take the steps necessary to fix these loopholes that you can drive a truck through and once someone is just in that clogged pipeline they can get a work permit after 150 days that aposs the attraction perino in the meantime we do have these children have to be taken care of cuccinelli that aposs right and i will say the supplemental did ease that pressure substantially it went from 2 500 kids who were in really inappropriate facilities for children not designed for that purpose down to a fraction of that number it aposs improved dramatically cuccinelli yes they can apost take care of themselves that aposs for sure cuccinelli right well in el paso i saw border patrol agents taking care of these kids in space not designed for children and they were doing the best they could perino and they aposre doing their best right all right ken thank you so much for being here we appreciate it cuccinelli good to be with you dana perino and we are going to keep an eye on next week aposs developments we aposll you get up to speed on that up next iran announces plans to breach the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal on sunday in response to u s sanctions we aposre going to bring in our sunday group to discuss the rising tensions between tehran and washington commercial break begin video clip ocasio cortez they put them in rooms with no running water and these women were being told by cbp officers to drink out of the toilet they were drinking water out of the toilet brian hastings cbp chief of law enforcement we don apost treat people that way we provide fresh water we provide food we provide sanitary items as well as items for bathing and personal hygiene end video clip perino a week of explosive claims about conditions on the u s mexico border put the trump administration on the defensive and it aposs time now for our sunday group charles hurt of the washington times and author of the new book still winning charles lane from the washington post kristen soltis anderson of the washington examiner and josh kraushaar he aposs politics editor at national journal it aposs great to have you all here charlie can i start with you i want to show you what representative hoyer house majority leader put out the agenda for july for the house democrats it was this week one national defense authorization act week two increasing the minimum wage by 15 an hour and week three legislation to bring down health care costs and i aposm wondering if you feel like they aposre kind of missing the moment to press the administration while you know kind of peddling ph while rome burns charlie hurt the washington times yes you know donald trump was not just sort of a wake up call for the republican party he should have been a wake up call for the democratic party as well this issue of immigration is not something that democrats sort of like because they are politicizing it they like to make it sound gets some sort of fringe right wing issue it aposs not it aposs an issue that their base cares about as well it aposs democrats and republicans if it a crisis at the border and if you care about you know humanitarian crisis you would think it would sort of get together and try to figure out a way to do something about it but instead they are sort of playing from this old playbook perino it felt very old this week we are going to do this i know you have to plan ahead a little bit but it did feel like that was a little bit off key josh i want to ask about the immigration debate affecting the house and the senate leaders who won the democratic side they would like to keep the house and it would like to try to win back the senate with this immigration debate are they where they are going to miss the opportunity to do that josh kraushaar national journal well here aposs the dirty little secret about the politics of immigration it aposs the democrats that are divided on capitol hill about immigration you saw on the a lot of the moderates supporting leadership but many of the progressives like ocasio cortez criticizing their own party and you see this in the debate over immigration obama aposs former dhs secretary jeh johnson criticized his own party aposs presidential candidates for essentially supporting open borders on that debate stage this past week this is you know trump is not popular on immigration only about 40 percent of the country agrees with his views and with his policies but the democrats are in a very tough pickle because their views are even more extreme and the public is really resisting them perino and kristen i wonder about the credibility issue right so for many months they said it wasn apost a crisis and now it is obviously a crisis i think everybody can agree on that is that going to hurt the democrats apos chances of keeping the house because they won those 31 districts that help speaker pelosi become speaker again those were moderate districts kristen soltis anderson echelon insights they are moderate districts i think most of what we are talking about the midterms that was a lot about health care an issue that republicans i think still are really struggling on but on immigration that aposs an issue where the president back in january was saying there aposs a crisis of the border and democrats democratic voters only a quarter at the time said that they believed there was a crisis of the border now when you ask americans is there a crisis of the border you have seven in ten overall and that cuts across party lines who say yes so the fact of the matter is the president was saying back in january there aposs a crisis down there people are divided nowadays over with a crisis is is it that too many people are coming or is it that those who come are being treated well but the language that something big is happening down there we need more resources to address it that aposs something the president has been saying for a long time and i think that aposs why you have not seen these horrifying image from the border having political consequence for the president at this point perino chuck if i could switch gears just for a moment because we woke up today to announce foreign policy news it always happens on the weekend of course iran announcing it will increase its uranium enrichment to an unspecified level beyond the terms of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers what do you think the administration aposs options are now on that charles lane contributor well i think for the time being the administration is going to sort of stay put with the stepped up sanctions regime that has driven iran to this step because really the action is over in europe this is an attempt by iran to put pressure on the europeans so that europe will create an alternative economic channel through which they can market their oil you know their oil has been cut off almost 100 percent not 100 percent but more the majority of their oil exports cut off by these stepped up sanctions by the trump administration and iran is really in a squeeze so what they aposve essentially done here is they said ok we are going to enrich and we are giving europe 60 days or so to work this out with us so i guess the next step for the administration is to go to work on europe and try to prevent them from siding with iran but we are seeing here is iran is pushing on the fractious relationship that exists between the trump administration and the european allies and see if they can exploit that so we aposll see trump has had a lot of not so nice things to say about the europeans he seems to take every opportunity perino he did have a pretty good meeting at the g20 and i wonder if this action charlie actually pushes europe by iran saying this and pushing too hard that they will put europe back into president trump aposs camp because they don apost want them to have a nuclear weapon hurt no they don apost and honestly this action reminds me of how bad the deal was to begin with because of course at the end once the sunset clause is kicked in on this deal this is exactly what iran could have done at the end of the deal and what we have seen since the deal was struck they aposve done nothing to curtail their support of terrorist activities around the world they aposve done nothing to stop fomenting violence around the middle east and so you know clearly the other way wasn apost working in the stepped up sanctions is at least putting enormous pressure on the regime lane and now there a people on the hill republican senators already calling for the snapback sanctions to go into effect the ones that were support sort of guarantee at the end of the day iranian compliance perino right so jump ahead and get that done so iran making some news today and we aposll see with the administration decides to do this week they aposve already asked the united nations to take a look at the atomic review but again the united nations might not have the teeth that are necessary in this situation al right panel we are going to take a quick break but we aposre going to come back just a little bit later we appreciate you being here up next as democratic front runner joe biden deals from a follow up from the first primary debate could it create opportunities for other moderates in the race one of those rivals colorado senator michael bennet he joins us next commercial break perino coming up democrats divided on the future of health care begin video clip sen michael bennet d colo presidential candidate when senator sanders says that canada is single payer there are 35 million people in canada there are 330 million people in the united states end video clip perino we aposll ask 2020 presidential candidate michael bennet about his plan next on fox news sunday commercial break perino he was one of the last to enter the democratic presidential primary throwing his hat into the ring only two months ago but he managed to get in jabs at bernie sanders and joe biden on the debate stage joining me now from denver colorado senator and 2020 democratic candidate michael bennet it aposs a pleasure to have you here sir bennet thank you dana for having me perino this morning abc news put out a new poll that the president will probably be really happy to see his approval numbers up to 47 percent if you look year over year last year it was only 42 percent of april 2019 now up to 47 percent i aposm sorry april 2019 just three months ago the economy as well doing very well 3 7 percent unemployment rate 224 000 jobs added and i wonder as you look at this as a 2020 candidate that wants to run against him what was your economic message be that things aren apost as good as people think they are bennet well i aposd say first of all that we are in the tenth year of an economic recovery that started in 2009 we aposd have job increases for that entire period of time it aposs a record and i will grant that the president hasn apost screwed it up in the first two and a half years that he aposs been president he inherited an economy that he described as the worst economy in american history it aposs hard to believe in two and a half years he aposs made it so dramatically better and of course when you look at the trends they are the same but they were in 2009 as they are today the point about whether the economy is working for most people i think that is a valid point colorado has one of the strongest economies on this planet yet most of the people that i meet can apost afford some combination of housing health care higher education or early childhood education they can apost afford a middle class life and the families that i knew when i was superintendent of denver public schools increasingly can apost see themselves can apost no matter how hard they work can apost seem to get their families out of poverty so there are two economies in this country the wealthiest americans for the last 40 years have done really well and everybody else has done pretty poorly at least based on our historical norms that aposs not something you can i aposm donald trump for i said the same thing when president obama was president perino so then bennet but we have to address it perino ok so how would you do that bennet well i think first of all we need an economy that when there aposs economic growth it grows for everybody i think the way of achieving that is by increasing our investments in infrastructure and education and r d we are spending 35 percent less than our parents and grandparents spent on us while we aposre racking up 20 trillion going to 30 trillion of debt so we aposre saying to the next generation not only will we not invest in you we are going to make you pay back this debt that we aposre not going to pay back i think we should reverse the trump tax cuts and give working people in this country real tax relief which they desperately need and they did not get perino but what did you what did you think that when people see the economy as it is now regardless of the trends from the past ten years but into a half years since the tax cuts and since the president has been in office the economy has done much better so if the reelection effort for president trump turns on the economy how do you get people to realize that you would make it better for them bennet first of all i don apost think is been much better dana it aposs been it aposs been what it was it aposs been fine it aposs been good and it aposs improved so it has improved just as an improved from 2009 when barack obama took over what we don apost need it in my view i think it is a president that is so at war with american tradition we don apost need a president who doesn apost believe in the rule of law we don apost need a president who doesn apost believe in freedom of the press we don apost need a president who doesn apost believe in the independence of the judiciary we don apost need a president who believes he is above the law that he can do by executive order what congress doesn apost do i mean the list of things is so long what amazes me is the stuff that he does whether it aposs coddling a dictator in north korea or laughing with putin about russia aposs attacks on our democracy that stuff that if barack obama did one of it he would have been indicted 24 hours a day on fox news and president trump is applauded i happen to think he is way outside of the mainstream of conventional american political thought whether it aposs democratic or republican and that if we are going to have any hope of not being the first generation of americans to leave less opportunity not more to our kids and our grandkids if we aposre going to have any hope of restoring america aposs role in the world he needs to be a one term president dana perino anchor so if i could just press bennet whether the economy is doing well or it aposs not doing well perino if i could just press if i could just press you on two things well i won apost press you on on on the on the freedom of the press like he gets frustrated with the press but he hasn apost tried to prevent them from being able to do their jobs but on the rule of law where you think that he is not for the rule of law bennet i think first of all on the freedom of the press the fact that he hasn apost dealt with the fact that saudi arabia killed a journalist and and he said what a serious thing it would be if it turned out it was true that mbs was behind it and our intelligence agencies said it aposs behind it and he does nothing except go there and coddle mbs that is an illustration of what american values are i think he aposs tried to intimidate the press here in the united states i think he aposs been above the rule of law on the wall you know he declared an emergency to build his wall his 6 billion wall perino but the institutions bennet which by the way dana mexico was supposed to pay for it and while we spent seven months consuming the american people aposs time over his 6 billion wall china was building fiber optic cable 3 500 miles from connecting africa to latin america to china so they can perino no i get that bennet they they can increase their surveillance there ph but what are we doing here perino well let me let me ask you about then let me ask you about immigration because you were the only one of the i think one of two people that did not raise you hand in the debate that msnbc hosted asking about decriminalizing the border i mean clearly you think that there is a problem on the border and that border security is really important and let me read to you from jeh johnson who aposs the former dhs secretary for president obama and he said this about the democrats he said that is tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders that is unworkable unwise and does not have the support of a majority of american people or the congress do you feel like the democratic party has gone so far left that people look at president trump aposs position as being much more reasonable bennet two two points here two points here one barack obama was able to enforce that law without separating children from their parents at the border something that has has has has received the kind perino but that wasn apost but they did have to do that if they came over at they did have to do that bennet i aposm sorry perino well they did have to separate families and and bennet no the did the the obama administration didn apost do it and and that aposs why the trump administration has received condemnation on this point from republican and democratic members of congress and the other point i aposd make is i was part of the gang of eight that wrote the immigration bill in 2013 that passed the senate with 68 votes it was a bipartisan bill donald trump has said nothing nothing good about it he aposs only said bad things about it that bill had 46 billion of border security in it his 6 billion for his his ineffective wall is a joke compared to what we had we had 21st century technology you could see every inch of the border perino ok so when what as president how would you as president then how would you get congress to actually pass something bennet i would put something in front of congress that aposs actually popular with the american people donald trump could not get his wall through a republican majority house and senate and now of course he can apost get it through a divided house and senate i would bring back the gang of eight bill updated for for the three years that have gone by and i would add to it work that we need to do on the refugee crisis on the border the president is acting like we are some weak pathetic country we have the ability to treat human beings humanly we have the ability to lead our hemisphere in a discussion about how to deal with this refugee crisis perino well bennet and what refuges we aposre going to take perino given bennet and what refuges others are going to take and we have the we have the responsibility to secure our border and to do what needs to be done internally perino but do you think that the president is not saying that i mean he is saying specifically job number one is to secure the border bennet i think he aposs saying it i think perino would you support bennet i i perino the changes in the asylum law that he is suggesting bennet i think that he aposs saying it i think he aposs not doing it i he goes down there and stands next to what he calls steel slats that were built during the obama administration or at the beginning of the trump administration we perino but let aposs focus on the asylum law for a moment like would you support the changes there bennet i haven apost seen a proposal so i i can apost give you an answer on that i do believe that we need to lead a discussion in the hemisphere about how to deal humanely with other human beings in this country we as i said earlier we are a strong and powerful country we are supposed to lead humanity not make our border into a symbol of nativist hostility perino all right bennet that should be an embarrassment for everybody our the symbol of this country as the statue of liberty not donald trump aposs pathetic attempt to build a wall which he aposs been unable to do because he can apost even get republicans to support it perino and he hasn apost been talking about the wall for a while he aposs asking the congress to actually help him pass the asylum law because he thinks that aposs a problem but let me move on to iran because you aposre on the senate intelligence committee bennet yes perino we have this word today that iran is saying we aposre going to blow right past those limits that were on us what would you do as president at this point bennet i i i would perino would you try to rejoin the original deal bennet i well i aposd try to make it a better deal but i that it was good that we had a deal donald trump you know i i will stipulate to you dana that everything that well not everything that he says i will stipulate that iran is conducting all kinds of malevolent acts in in the region which are dangerous for us and dangerous for the israelis and that they need to be stopped but when donald trump became president iran was no longer two to three years from breaking out to a nuclear weapon or two to three months from breaking out to a nuclear weapon which is where they were when i voted for the iran deal they were more than a year from being able to broke out break out to a nuclear weapon based on our intel perino right bennet based on what the israelis said now they aposre now they aposre enriching again so this idea that somehow we aposre more safe if iran is conducting its malevolent conventional acts in the region and they aposre able to backstop it with a threat of a nuclear weapon doesn apost make any sense and now the administration is saying our goal is to get iran a year away from breaking out that aposs where we were perino well not where they are now is where they would be would have been at the end of that deal but let aposs i do we aposve spent a lot of time bennet that aposs true that that perino talking about president trump bennet that aposs true dana but that is not that is not where they would have been if the deal had stayed in place if the deal had stayed in place perino well bennet they would be a year from being able to break out from a nuclear weapon perino oh i see ok bennet then perino let aposs talk about you we aposve spent too much time talking about donald trump bennet ok perino let aposs talk about you you are in a primary fight against a couple dozen other democrats you have fundraising numbers at about that are a little bit lower than others because as we all know you got in the race a little bit late because you successfully fought back against prostate cancer for which we aposre all grateful that you were able to do that bennet thank you thank you perino and so but i aposm wondering you aposre heading into this the possibility i don apost know if it aposs confirmed yet if you aposre on that second debate is there some way that you can break away to to really make a difference so that you could be up there in maybe the top five bennet i i hope so i think that the american people for all the reasons that i said need a president that aposs actually going to conform to our values as a country and i think we need among other things somebody who aposs going to tell the truth to the american people we have incredible challenges that we face dana we aposve had 40 years of no economic mobility for the most of the american people we aposve got a public education system perino but you do have the highest level of african american and latino employment that we aposve had in the country now i mean is that worth something bennet it aposs everybody that aposs got a job is worth something but we have the the greatest income inequality that we aposve seen since 1928 the wealth gap between african american and latino families is much greater than it was even before we went into the great perino and do you think that aposs an education issue as a former bennet even before we went into perino as a former education minister do you think that education is the issue bennet i think partly it i i do i i think a big part of it is that our education system is reinforcing the income inequality we have rather than liberating people from it the best protector of the quality of somebody aposs education is the income that their parents made that is completely un american in my view but it is where we find ourselves which is why i think rather than debating whether we should have had busing 50 years ago we should be having a debate about what we aposre doing to transform america aposs schools for the 21st century so that everybody whether they aposre born into poverty or not has a shot at the american dream that aposs no longer true perino well since you since you brought up busing let me just ask you one thing you know i i i went to denver public schools you were the superintendent there bennet yes yes i know perino denver was the first city that had that tried to integrate the schools through busing i know that i was in the fourth grade when i had to be bused 25 miles across the city i know you aposre talk you don apost think we should be talking about that but your opponents in the democratic primary joe biden and kamala harris brought this back up and now there aposs a question a last one to you do you think that busing should be something on the table again bennet i think that i i i think that if if districts want to do it they should be able to do it if they want but i don apost think there aposs a district in the country that aposs going to want to do it people don apost want to cross town to get a high quality school they want a high quality school in their in where they live and that aposs what we have to try to do that aposs what we aposve tried to do in denver frank in there was a study that came out from stanford university last week that said that kids in denver are growing so much faster than kids around this state it aposs as if we aposve added 60 days to each school year in denver perino that might bennet it aposs possible to make a difference perino yes well that might get some some other school administrators to look into denver indeed bennet i hope i hope perino senator bennet thank you i know that you love being in colorado bennet dana thank you for having me and come back to the denver public schools i aposll walk you around perino all right thank you bennet thank you perino up next president trump called his july 4th event a military salute while critics called it a campaign rally our panel weighs in and joe biden and kamala harris take their debate stage battle onto the campaign trail that aposs up next commercial break perino democratic hopefuls for president spent the holiday week making their case for the nomination in early voting states and the party aposs frontrunner remains on defense peter doocy reports begin videotape peter doocy reporter ph voice over there are so many democrats running for president there could be one standing right behind you and you might not notice crowd we want joe doocy joe biden brought confidence to iowa where he dismissed democrats who were down on his debate debut joe biden d presidential candidate i aposm still way ahead sen kamala harris d calif presidential candidate it was hurtful doocy but he admitted he was not expecting to be challenged about his civil rights record at the first debate biden i was prepared for them to come after me but i wasn apost prepared for the person coming at me the way she came at me doocy kamala harris who called him out is surprised biden was caught flat footed since stories quoting his comment about civility with segregationist billed front pages for days harris if he and his team weren apost prepared for for the topic i i don apost know what to say about that doocy harris isn apost just targeting biden her primary arrival she aposs starting to single out president trump harris i will tell you we have a predator living in the white house doocy while pete buttigieg is trying to take the opposite approach mayor pete buttigieg d ind presidential candidate the last we aposre talking about this president the more likely we are to win doocy the president headlined an event none of the democratic primary candidates could compete with thursday aposs salute to america and back in iowa joe biden believes he aposs in the best spot to challenge trump biden if you notice i aposm the guy everybody aposs talking about end video clip doocy so biden is basically adhering to the old adage there aposs no such thing as bad press because despite some unflattering headlines recently nobody has passed him in national polls dana perino peter doocy reporting from the campaign trail peter thank you and we aposre back now with the panel we love having you back here so josh you saw the interview with michael bennet he was fired up this morning had his wheaties there in colorado if you look at the numbers from the since the first democratic debates i think we have the realclearpolitics average biden kamala harris sanders warren buttigieg those are your top five if biden aposs he aposs still in the lead but he aposs come down a bit is there a moderate lane at all for somebody like michael bennet and if there is a moderate lane does that lane run out of road josh kraushaar national journal so biden has clearly lost momentum since the first debate but he aposs still dominating among the people who identify themselves as moderate and the big question is if biden struggles at the second debate the third debate will there be room for someone like bennet i think senator amy klobuchar from minnesota also has an opportunity to to be that candidate but look there is a case for electability democrats say despite their their move to the left they want someone who is electable and i was struck by by the new washington post poll joe biden has a 28 point lead among against trump among moderates every other leading democratic candidate in that liberal lane is is pretty much tied statistically perino right kraushaar the there aposs going to be a point where democrats need to find someone who aposs electable and given the trend that the democrats the warrens the kamala harris in the field they aposre moving to the left there aposs going to be an electability worry coming up perino chuck kamala harris was the undisputed winner of the debate we have her fundraising numb for q2 it wasn apost you know it was kind of paltry not paltry but it aposs 12 million compared to the others that wasn apost as much as she would like is there a way for her to capitalize on her debate performance to try to get some momentum charles lane the washington post i think she aposs done it i think she aposs we aposre all talking about her perino true lane she aposs the flavor of the month now in the democratic field and with great power comes great responsibility she is going to have to do a couple of things i think to sharpen up her now that she aposs getting a hearing she aposs going to have to sharpen up her message and i think that starts with health care she has kind of been on both sides of that medicare for all get rid of private insurance thing if i were you know in her position i might think about making a speech with my health care plan you know what kamala harris calls for on health care because that aposs a vulnerability for her perino yes because after every time she talks about health care the next day they aposre having to re explain what she meant and what she didn apost mean that it does get confusing charlie can you listen to this sound from joe biden in south carolina yesterday begin video clip biden i aposm sorry for any of the pain or misconception that i may have caused anybody end video clip perino so this is in regards to his comments about segregationists and having worked with them when he was a young staffer or a young senator perino he told cory booker he wasn apost going to apologize and then now he aposs apologizing charles hurt the washington times yes well and this of course is why joe biden has been running for president for basically 45 years since he got here and he aposs never made it and the only way he made it into the near the white house was because barack obama needed him at that moment as vice president i do think and i think josh is right i think that that you know the more democrats despise the person they aposre trying to beat the more electability will become an issue maybe very late in the race remember in 2004 where you had the bumper stickers that said dated dean married kerry perino yes hurt everybody loved howard dean and then he kind of went a little crazy and democrats freaked out because they didn apost care who they got they just wanted somebody who was going to beat george w bush perino you still see people up on capitol hill with those bumper stickers on the car hurt yes perino they don apost take them off kristen president trump had this fourth of july celebration and democrats prematurely overreacted do they continue to play right into his hand kristen soltis anderson echelon insights i think when it comes to something like the fourth of july rally they they sort of take the wrong approach in how to criticize the president for saying that you know we shouldn apost be having military there et cetera et cetera i think that stuff was completely overblown as we saw he sort of stuck to the strip his speech was was not really a campaign speech i think of democrats were savvier they would point out that you know this was an event that was paid for with with tax dollars and yet you had sort of special donors getting special seats that you had you know footage from the rally sort of being used for campaign purposes we aposre not supposed to use tax dollars for campaign purposes that there are sort of swampy things going on that were adjacent to this you know a great sort of salute to america if democrats were smart rather than doing things like saying we shouldn apost have the flag on the back of shoes they would be pointing out things like we shouldn apost be using tax dollars to support campaigns perino josh the republican national committee in the trump campaign announced that they aposve already raised 105 million this year is that this is just going to be a juggernaut are they well positioned do you think for re election incumbents usually do win re election are they sufficiently resourced but also they sufficiently concerned that something else could happen kraushaar so that aposs the biggest difference between 2016 and 2020 trump is not going to have a financial problem he aposs going to have plenty of money he aposs going to have be able to outrace and outspend the democratic opposition and you know i think that democratic fundraising has been pretty underwhelming joe biden raised about 22 million which is ok but it aposs much less than hillary clinton did at the same point in 2016 kamala harris who many people think has a lot of upside potential only raised under 12 million despite that strong debate performance so fundraising is a challenge for the democrats and trump is going to have a big financial advantage perino so in the middle of the summer what do you think what do you look for in the next three weeks before the next debate lane well i aposm i aposm looking for as i said before to see how kamala harris kind of straightens out her message a little bit capitalizes on the progress she made against biden and i aposm also looking to see how biden recovers and i must say this apology he issued i aposm not sure how that helps him because he had just finished saying a little while earlier i aposm not going to apologize for anything perino he wasn apost going to apologize yes lane so again that kind of wishy washy ness set in just one quick point on the money one reason democrats are underwhelming on the fundraising they aposre running against the rich all of them have plans to tax the rich and and they aposre getting tougher on wall street and stuff that used to be where all the money came from for democratic candidates and i think those people are nervous perino what do you look for in the next three weeks hurt i think the most important thing is whether biden does straighten out and figure out how how to run a campaign and and if not not who it is that sort of picks up that mantle because the rest of the field i think is just going full town crazy perino and kristen you and your sweet puppy wally ph what do you look for anderson i think i aposm going to be looking for the fact that many democrats i think are going to start taking the gloves off perino yes anderson they aposre going to look at who aposs benefited in those debates kamala harris by going after joe biden to a lesser extent castro sort of you know taking a position that aposs very far out on the extreme on immigration but nonetheless sort of generating buzz becoming the candidate from texas if you will in the race with with apologies to beto o aposrourke perino oh poor beto o aposrourke anderson poor beto o aposrourke so i think democrats are going to realize the inaudible benefit from taking inaudible perino do you know what i think is interesting none of us have mentioned bernie sanders and i think it aposs so interesting that like he aposs still pulling like he aposs in the top five but no one is talking about him but i did get to mention him all right panel thank you so much we will see you next sunday up next the last surviving world war ii marine to receive the medal of honor on his latest mission commercial break perino finally this fourth of july weekend the world war ii medal of honor recipient who found a unique and lasting way to honor the families of his fallen fellow marines chris wallace has our power player of the week begin videotape hershel woody williams medal of honor recipient i know we aposre classified as a hero very often but i keep saying i aposm not the hero the heroes didn apost get home chris wallace anchor voice over meet hershel woody williams the only marine from world war ii to receive the medal of honor who is still living i had the good fortune to meet woody at a town hall at the naval academy this fall where he told the brigade of midshipmen about fighting in the battle of iwo jima wallace on camera do you feel any sense of fear in that moment williams i aposve always said if you aposre being shot at and you have no fear there something wrong with you unidentified male the iwo jima invasion brought on one of the bitterest of battles wallace voice over over four hours under heavy enemy fire he took out a network of japanese pill boxes with a flamethrower to clear the way for the infantry wallace on camera aren apost they spraying bullets at you williams oh yes yes absolutely they aposre trying their best to get me why they didn apost get me i have no answer except i was he wasn apost ready for me i guess wallace voice over president truman gave woody the nation aposs highest military honor for valor but that aposs where this story begins not ends woody spent 33 years working at the va securing benefits for veterans and their families and in 2010 he started a foundation to honor gold star families who have lost a loved one in battle williams we aposve gotten memorials for veterans all over this country and in most community but do we have anything that pays tribute to those families who sacrificed one of their own no we don apost wallace the williams foundation has helped communities put up 44 monuments to those families across the country with plans to build them in all 50 states williams these monuments gather these gold star families together and they become friends for the very first time many of them will say to me i thought i was alone now they aposre together unidentified male it aposs about the gold star families and those survivors that they have somewhere they can go and remember the name of their loved one williams i get tired but then the cause is so great i can apost refuse to do it wallace woody is now 95 years old but he aposs on the road 200 days a year and folks are giving him new honors he flipped the coin at the super bowl and the navy launched a ship named for him williams it was like a dream that you never had but then all of a sudden here it is a really that you never thought could possibly happen in your lifetime wallace but woody williams has one final mission in world war i mothers with a son in the service would put a flag with a blue star in the window and if the son should be killed in action they would paste a gold star over the blue williams i aposd like to see it today i aposd like to see these one of these on every home that has somebody serving in our armed forces i think it would do something for their community i really do and then this of course would say to those people in that community that family gave more than any of us end videotape perino the foundation plans to br
