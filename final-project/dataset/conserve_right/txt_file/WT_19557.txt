coronavirus limits on churches cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties in his briefing mr steele went beyond his dossier to lodge additional collusion charges against paul manafort mr trump s campaign manager during that summer mr mueller s final report delivered on march 22 said there was no conspiracy by trump aides to help either russian computer hacking or social media trolling against mrs clinton the conclusion destroyed mr steele s core conspiracy charges against the president the state department session illustrated the wide access mr steele gained to peddle his charges within the obama administration as he was handled by the clinton opposition research firm fusion gps in addition to the state department mr steele met with more than a half dozen journalists and had direct lines of communication to the justice department and the fbi the fbi used the dossier to obtain at least one yearlong wiretap on trump campaign volunteer carter page and to brief the obama white house among his outside the dossier charges is the alfa bank computer story mr steele told ms kavalec that manafort operated a secret communications link to alfa russia s largest commercial bank it marked the first time mr steele is known to have pushed the alfa trump conspiracy which has been promoted by liberal news sites but debunked by cybersecurity specialists alfa s oligarch owners led by petr aven are confidants of russian president vladimir putin mr aven a billionaire economist and author who circulates freely in western society has sued mr steele for defamation in washington because the dossier claimed he paid cash bribes said the kavalec memo peter sic aven of alfa bank has been the conduit for secret communications between the kremlin and manafort messages are encrypted via tor software and run between a hidden server managed by alfa bank the memo states that mr steele has written a separate paper on the supposed server the fbi investigated the server conspiracy theory the mueller report contains a section on mr aven no server is mentioned the report said mr aven knew no one in the trump campaign including manafort he attempted to contact the presidential transition team through a middleman to discuss sanctions against russia but never succeeded the report said the cyberdata fueling the alfa speculation actually came from a marketing spam server in pennsylvania according to cyber investigators fusion gps and its co founder glenn r simpson have pushed the server theory for months the effort succeeded in having articles published in slate com right before the nov 8 election and in the new yorker last year in another new charge mr steele told ms kavalec that manafort owes 100 million to russians manafort s supporters say there is no such debt and the mueller report cleared him of election conspiracy manafort was convicted of bank and tax fraud related to his political consulting business in ukraine mr steele made another charge to ms kavalec he alleged that mr page the volunteer wiretapped by the fbi was involved in a platform debate on ukraine at the republican national convention one delegate wanted candidate trump to commit to lethal defense weapons for the russian invaded country a compromise was reached new language committed mr trump to all appropriate assistance to ukraine s armed forces trump aides say mr page wasn t involved in the compromise the mueller report provides a ukraine platform timeline and mr page isn t mentioned the kavalec memo says mr steele began his trump investigation in june at the behest of an institution he declined to identify that had been hacked that would mean mr steele knew from the start that he was working for the democratic party which announced in mid june that russian military intelligence units had penetrated its computers mr steele wanted his allegations to become public before the nov 8 election he told ms kavalec the kavalec memo repeats some of mr steele s dossier charges such as claims of a secret videotaping by russian intelligence of mr trump with prostitutes in a moscow hotel room the mueller report suggested that no such video exists mr steele also repeated his allegation that manafort was a campaign go between with the kremlin mr mueller found no evidence manafort s attorney said his client had no contacts with the russian government ms kavalec s written notes suggest that mr steele told her he had briefed the news media the notes say nyt wp have mr steele in fact had met with reporters in september from the new york times and the washington post the kavalec memos were obtained by the conservative group citizens united through open records litigation and were first reported by the hill newspaper whether ms kavalec provided her typed and handwritten memos to the fbi would be significant later in october the fbi won court approval to place a foreign intelligence surveillance act wiretap on mr page the authority meant the fbi could read his text messages and emails as well as listen to his phone calls agents also could go back to the time he was a campaign volunteer and visited moscow to deliver a commencement speech mr steele alleged that mr page met with two putin cronies there and discussed bribes for sanctions relief mr page denies this after a year of spying on mr page the fbi filed no charges against him the fbi s fisa application relied heavily on the steele dossier the fbi presented as corroboration a september article in yahoo news that recounted exact details on mr page that were in the dossier the fbi told the federal judge that the yahoo news story didn t come from mr steele because he told agents he had not spoken to reporters it is now known that statement isn t factual mr steele was the yahoo news source did the fbi before preparing its warrant application receive the kavalec handwritten notes that mentioned two newspapers the issue is the subject of
