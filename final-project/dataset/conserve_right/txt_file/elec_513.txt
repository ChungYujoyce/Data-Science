sanders is looking a lot like john kasich these days and no not because of their hand gestures in the final round of super sloppy double dare that was the gop nominating process kasich argued that he should be the nominee because he handily beat hillary clinton in hypothetical head to head matchups while now presumptive nominee donald trump consistently lagged now sanders who is as kasich was out of the running for the nomination is asking his party to throw over the frontrunner for the sake of general election viability and there s data to back him up in this week s fox news poll and the most recent nyt cbs news poll sanders outperforms clinton against trump and it had been true for kasich too but it doesn t really matter first any democrat without her enormous negative ratings would match up better with trump than clinton does throw martin o malley or even an imaginary candidate insofar as those are different concepts in a poll and you might see a similar result and that s because those candidates haven t been the target of millions of dollars in attack ads or even garnered much in the way of media scrutiny these are not just hypothetical matchups they are in many ways hypothetical candidates head to head matchup polls in primaries can be useful if you re talking about frontrunners and or candidates who have been substantially defined in the minds of voters then there s the question of how the process shapes the product competing for your party s nomination definitely can damage your reputation lordy day it can but there is also a payoff at the end of the line as the party swings in behind its man or woman so it s not just that sanders head to head matchups with trump aren t reflective of the general election reality neither are clinton s the current trump bump is real the nyt cbs news poll tells the tale eight in 10 republicans said that the party should unite behind him despite their disagreements and in his battle with clinton trump is getting the same post victory boost his predecessor mitt romney got four years ago after a primary season of unrivaled acrimony the realities of the binary choice of the general election are setting in the big question now is what clinton s bounce will look like it will certainly be there eighty percent of democrats in the poll said that party unity was essential to victory and 83 percent said clinton could do that for republicans just 63 percent said unity was essential to victory and just 64 percent believed trump could deliver on that task that discrepancy helps explain trump s deficit in this survey what we must wait to see is how big a boost clinton will get perhaps less than trump considering that her party is already more united we also can t know whether the surge in partisan loyalty we see for trump today will last or if the party s underlying fracture will reassert itself the answers to both sets of questions will depend on how well clinton and trump traverse the eight weeks
