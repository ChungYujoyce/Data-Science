slathering pork in chemicals to make it look and smell like costlier cuts of beef i never knew you could make fake beef said wu who described being shocked and disgusted by the revelation i suddenly felt i needed to do something to create a platform so consumers could know about this kind of thing the result of wu s epiphany a year ago is the cheeky and informative food scandal database throw it

food safety problems and a new willingness among ordinary people to take the matter into their own hands driven partly by the government s foot dragging on food safety such grassroots activism is unusual in a country where citizen action is discouraged and often dangerous after reading about the fake beef problem a year ago wu 26 dashed off an online appeal seeking help for the new project his exuberance clear from the 17 exclamation points in his may 11 2011 blog title that ended with a rallying cry come on we can change something a few dozen volunteers now help wu maintain the site which

shared across a patchwork of agencies and offices including ministries of health and agriculture meaning problems frequently fall through the cracks the government has shown itself so incapable that chinese premier wen jiabao was again this week promising more action wen called for greater public involvement in food safety and even said whistle blowers should be rewarded but such whistle blowing

concern about the prosecution and harassment of china s food safety advocates citing the case of zhao lianhai a beijing writer who was sentenced to 2 1 2 years in jail for inciting social disorder

sprayed with formaldehyde he had the very clear impression that friends and family around him had gone from feeling really depressed and angry about the food safety situation to feeling terrified and anxious yang said she said the executive who came up with the idea wasn t available for an interview and declined to identify him by name kingsoft hopes the app can wake up people s consciousness to the need to fight for food safety yang said adding that the company is now working on an android version while shining an unflattering spotlight on china s food problems both the kingsoft app and wu s site rely on government sanctioned reports from state run media a more daring approach would be to do fully independent testing or reporting on food but attempts to do that have been shut down wu the
