college in pennsylvania said the imbroglio over the christianity today editorial suggested mr trump has lost some support among evangelicals however those who do back him have counteracted the trend by coming out strongly for him he said any loss of support appears to be centered on young evangelicals and importantly about 20 of evangelicals are non white and they do not support him but overall he remains in good shape mr madonna said tony perkins president of the family research council a christian conservative nonprofit in washington told the washington times that younger people tend not to vote he also believes minority groups such as african americans and hispanics will be drawn to mr trump in 2020 because the democratic party s platform has become too extreme hitting back florida democrats on friday argued mr trump s new coalition is built on a faulty foundation and more about the pursuit of power than advancing the gospel it was my deep belief that president trump and those candidates that supported him were really guilty of co opting faith and the faith communities for their own political advantages and were not representative in their policies or their values of what faith is all about said chris king recounting his unsuccessful run in 2018 as the democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in florida mr king and faith leaders faulted mr trump for his personal behavior his cruel immigration policies crude comments about haitian immigrants and efforts to dismantle the 2010 health care law i think he shows a disdain for believers all across the country who want to see a president who is genuinely authentically trying to live out the values of the gospel mr king said doug pagitt a pastor and executive director of vote common good an organization seeking to peel away christian support from mr trump said friday the president held his florida event because he is desperate he knows he needs every last vote if he wants a shot at reelection he said he said for trump backers the bible verse about gaining the world yet forfeiting their souls is coming into focus for them we are not asking republicans to stop being republican mr pagitt said we are simply asking faith voters not to vote for this republican while discussing recent violence against jewish americans and a fatal shooting at a church in texas mr trump also suggested that three members of the so called squad of freshman democratic lawmakers were anti semitic these people hate israel mr trump said they hate jewish people i won t name them i won t bring up the name of omar tlaib aoc i won t bring that name up won t bring it up i will not bring it up but where do these people come from he was referring to reps ilhan omar of minnesota rashida tlaib of michigan and alexand
