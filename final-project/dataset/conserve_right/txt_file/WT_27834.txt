tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn a major regime shake up by north korean leader kim jong un in the eight weeks since his failed summit with president trump has set u s officials on edge amid uncertainty over whether high level personnel changes in pyongyang will help or damage the stalled nuclear talks with the prospect of a third trump kim summit hanging in the balance u s officials are scrambling to make sense of mr kim s apparent sidelining of top adviser kim yong chol a 73 year old hard liner and former intelligence chief disliked by the trump administration in favor of a much younger and lesser known regime apparatchik named jang kum chol american and south korean sources said that while mr jang s name was rarely mentioned by north korea s state controlled media until two weeks ago he has been an influential behind the scenes player for years with a reputation for favoring diplomacy over hard line confrontation top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century in his late 50s mr jang comes from an elite north korean family and has spent his entire career working within the ruling korean workers party united front department ufd a powerful intelligence arm of the regime that has long overseen relations with south korea and increasingly with the united states the sources said he is believed to have been elevated to replace kim yong chol as head of the ufd although it is not clear whether that means mr kim who once threatened to turn south korea into a hell of fires and is accused of masterminding a major 2014 cyberattack against the united states is being punished by kim jong un or pushed into a more background role either way analysts say mr jang s promotion can be read in a variety of ways at a time of maximum uncertainty in u s north korean diplomacy outside observers may not be familiar with jang but he is well known within the power structure in pyongyang having spent his career in the ufd said robert collins a senior adviser to the committee for human rights in north korea who has lived in south korea more than four decades and is considered an authority on the regime in pyongyang jang also has a reputation there as a negotiator who is really the opposite of kim yong chol who is renowned for being an extreme hard nose in negotiations longtime north korea analyst paik haksoon president of the sejong institute a leading think tank in south korea went further asserting that mr jang s sudden rise coupled with the elevation last month of longtime nuclear negotiator and diplomat choe son hui to the position of first vice foreign minister was clearly meant by kim jong un to send a message the north koreans are playing politics by changing the players involved in the negotiations by moving jang and choe to positions of more prominence they are sending a signal to the americans and to south korea that north korean negotiators may be more engaging diplomatically than kim yong chol has been mr paik said this is not a concession by north korea he added but more of an overture to say that on a personal attitudinal level with regard to their personal negotiating styles they could be more diplomatic but how they translate into tangible changes in the nuclear negotiations remains to be seen detail man sources familiar with intelligence on mr jang said he is a graduate of kim il sung university and is detail oriented and flexible despite having only limited experience in diplomatic talks he once served in north korea s asia pacific committee a key front organization of the ufd and was for a time in charge of civilian exchanges between north and south korea having headed pyongyang s national reconciliation committee he also participated in an official sports diplomacy visit to south korea in 2002 at the pusan asian games and in 2006 north south military talks as well as at least one meeting with a south korean political leader in 2007 the sources said mr paik cautions against reading mr jang s elevation as an indication that kim yong chol has been totally removed from the north s nuclear negotiations team kim yong chol may still be very much involved just from the background he said jang s attitude may be more diplomatic we don t know exactly whether he will replace kim yong chol when it comes to dealing with the united states kim yong chol was central to the drama that unfolded in late february at the hanoi summit which was abruptly cut short after president trump and kim jong un failed to strike a far reaching deal to end the north s nuclear and missile programs mr trump said he had to walk away because the north koreans demanded sweeping sanctions relief in exchange for only a limited commitment to destroy part of their nuclear arsenal a characterization pyongyang later challenged the state department declined this week to comment on the shake up in pyongyang however stephen biegun u s special representative for north korea expressed optimism in a statement provided to the washington times on the prospect of momentum in talks the united states remains ready to engage in constructive discussions with north korea said mr biegun downplaying the setback in vietnam in working level discussions in hanoi extended talks gave us the opportunity to exchange detailed positions and narrow the gap on a number of issues between the united states and north korea but the subsequent regime shake up has left many scratching their heads and questioning whether kim jong un feels exposed and vulnerable at home given the failure to obtain economic relief during his trip to hanoi some analysts are wary that mr biegun s working level north korean counterpart kim hyok chol another key player in the hanoi summit may have been demoted or worse as part of the personnel changes in pyongyang north korean state media reports have made no mention of kim hyok chol of late north korean outlets have also dropped any reference to another key working level negotiator kim song hye triggering speculation that the two may have been purged as punishment for how the hanoi summit played out focus on kim some analysts caution against banking too much on new movement from pyongyang s personnel changes the individual officials beneath kim jong un are less important than oftentimes people trying to do kremlinology on the north korean regime make them out to be said former cia korea deputy division chief bruce klingner a fellow at the heritage foundation the main thing to focus on is just what is north korea s position regardless of who is sitting across the negotiating table mr klingner said kim jong un he noted cast a negative shadow on future talks in a mid april speech setting a deadline for the trump administration to make a bold decision to change its stance by the end of this year if it hopes to strike a deal we don t like and we are not interested in the united states way of dialogue mr kim said in which it tries to unilaterally push through its demands we don t welcome and we have no intention of repeating the kind of summit meeting like the one held in hanoi while pyongyang has carefully refrained from attacking mr trump north korean officials have shown no restraint in attacking his advisers the north korean foreign ministry last month accused secretary of state mike pompeo of talking nonsense and demanded that he be removed from the u s negotiating team newly anointed first vice foreign minister choe son hui doubled down on the message this week by saying the u s will face undesired consequences if it does not change its stance on denuclearization north korea s state media reported the signs are not that good for a diplomatic resolution of the north korean nuclear problem mr klingner said overemphasizing the personnel changes i think kind of loses the bigger picture kim jong un is calling the shots he is the decider so in a way any other official is just the mouthpiece david maxwell a retired army special forces colonel and a north korea analyst at the foundation for defense of democracies said it s unclear whether the regime shake up is cause for optimism obviously it s game of thrones north korea style and we have to try to read the tea leaves he said but pyongyang is so opaque that we just don t know for sure what
