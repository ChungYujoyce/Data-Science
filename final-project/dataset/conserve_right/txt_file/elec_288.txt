sanders apologized to hillary clinton and his own supporters saturday night for a breach of her campaign s valuable voter data seeking to put the controversy to rest in a debate that quickly moved on to national security concerns and americans heightened fear of terrorism clinton the democratic front runner who kept an eye on the general election was also sharply critical of donald trump s plan to ban muslims from entering the united states calling the leader of the gop race the islamic state s best recruiter mr trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people said clinton the former secretary of state top stories postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots 500 doctors tell trump to end the coronavirus shutdown say it will cause more deaths clinton and sanders her closest challenger entered saturday night s debate in the midst of one of their fiercest fights about the campaign itself rather than a national or international issue clinton s campaign accused sanders team of stealing information used to target voters and anticipate what issues might motivate them in response to the breach the democratic national committee temporarily cut off sanders team s access to its own data a move the vermont senator said saturday was an egregious act still sanders said his staff had acted improperly this is not the type of campaign that we run he said sanders campaign fired a worker involved in the breach but also used the controversy to raise money sending an email to supporters that said the national party had placed its thumb on the scales in support of hillary clinton s campaign clinton quickly accepted the apology saturday night saying we should move on because i don t think the american people are interested in this the debate the third for democrats was expected to have low viewership given that it was scheduled on the last weekend before christmas when many americans have turned their attention to the holidays it came as clinton had solidified her standing atop the field shaking off a rocky start and the controversy about her use of private email at the state department clinton and sanders were joined on stage by former maryland gov martin o malley who has struggled to be a factor in the race o malley was aggressive in seeking to play a role in the debate repeatedly talking over moderators and accusing his rivals of having outdated views on foreign policy clinton also defied moderators efforts to cut her off leading sanders to call out now this is getting to be fun while there was broad agreement among the democratic contenders that the u s should not launch a ground war to defeat the islamic state they differed in the tactics they would take and whether the nation should seek regime change in syria where is has a stronghold clinton recommended more direct action than her competitors calling for a no fly zone over part of syria and insisting that the u s must seek to remove syrian president bashar assad from power if the united states does not lead there is not another leader there is a vacuum she said sanders disagreed saying the u s should first seek to defeat the islamic state calling assad a secondary issue that should be dealt with over the course of years yeah regime change is easy getting rid of dictators is easy but you have to think about what happens the day after he said all three candidates stressed working more closely with muslim american communities to tackle radicalism at home a sharp difference from the rhetoric of some republican candidates returning to her focus on trump clinton said if you re going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of isis you don t want to alienate the very countries you need to be part of the coalition sanders sought to stand out on foreign policy by noting that he voted against the 2003 invasion of iraq an unpopular war clinton supported he said he does not support any unilateral military action but rather a coalition in which the u s works hand in hand with muslim nations to fight the radical militant group saturday s debate was the first for democrats since the shooting in san bernardino california where 14 people were killed by a married couple that authorities say had been radicalized the incident as well as earlier attacks in paris pushed national security to the forefront of the 2016 white house race the foreign policy focus has blunted sanders momentum in the democratic race the senator has deeply loyal supporters who are drawn to his economic and inequality focused campaign but he s far less comfortable discussing foreign policy issues sanders sought to refocus on his core message of leveling the economy playing field for middle class americans casting himself as an enemy of wall street and big financial institutions asked whether corporate america would love a sanders presidency he said simply no i think they won t sanders and o malley have suggested clinton is too cozy with wall street and is running a campaign funded by wealthy executives charges she has rejected when asked by moderators whether corporate america should love her she quipped everybody should copyright 2020 the washington times llc click to read more and view comments click to hide terms of use privacy policy manage newsletters
