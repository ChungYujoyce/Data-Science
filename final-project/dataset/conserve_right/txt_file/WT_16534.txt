apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic chinese carrier pressure the obama administration has given in to pressure from china and will not send the aircraft carrier strike group led by the uss george washington to the yellow sea for upcoming naval exercises the move followed protests from beijing that a warship group in that area would pose a threat to china the carrier however will take part in exercises beginning this weekend on the eastern side of the korean peninsula in the sea of japan a location that was not opposed by china top stories gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning officially pentagon spokesmen insist the decision on the yellow sea has not yet been made but defense officials close to the issue told inside the ring the decision not to send the carrier to the next phase of the maneuvers which are intended as a saber rattling message to north korea is already set as a result the officials said the failure to send the carrier will be viewed by china as a sign of u s weakness and will undermine u s efforts to maintain freedom of navigation in the western pacific near china chinese government and military spokesmen in recent days announced that any dispatch of a carrier to waters near its territory would be a threat to china chinese maj gen zhu chenghu told state run media july 19 that the yellow sea is a sensitive area he said sending the aircraft carrier strike group there would be a threat because its combat attack radius would cover all of china and its reconnaissance reach would penetrate deep inside the country if the united states truly wants to take into account the overall interests of the sino u s relationship then it must on no account send its uss washington to the yellow sea gen zhu said plans for the large scale u s south korean naval and aircraft exercises irked beijing which sided with pyongyang in the dispute over the sinking of the south korean ship cheonan which killed 46 sailors chinese military officials have said publicly that they doubt the findings of the probe linking the torpedo attack to north korea adm mike mullen chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told reporters traveling with him in asia on tuesday that he understands china s concerns the yellow sea specifically is an international body of water and the united states always reserves the right to operate in those in international waters and certainly i hear what the chinese are saying with respect to that he said but in fact we have exercised in the yellow sea for a long time and i fully expect that we ll do so in the future however defense secretary robert m gates and pentagon spokesman geoff morrell sidestepped questions about whether the george washington would take part in the upcoming yellow sea war games mr morrell said only the first part of the joint u s south korea exercises were announced follow on exercises are still under development and the dates locations and assets to be deployed have not been determined yet he told inside the ring but i can assure you we will be training in both the sea of japan and the yellow sea as we have done many times before mr morrell said he would not discuss any particular ship but stated we reserve the right to operate in any and all international waters we cede nothing in terms of freedom of navigation michael pillsbury a former pentagon official and specialist on chinese military affairs said a decision not to send the carrier to the yellow sea exercises would reflect a two decade old misguided u s policy that incorrectly sought to reassure chinese paranoid views about u s intentions the many dissenters who claim this approach will not work have always been overruled mr pillsbury said the dilemma has been to find a metric that will reveal whether this long term strategy has been effective or whether we are causing the chinese to assess us to be a declining power that does not dare challenge china anymore the decision about whether and when to deploy a carrier to the west of the korean peninsula should be driven primarily by the requirement to assure our ally and deter north korea against further provocations said stephen yates an asian affairs specialist and former white house national security official in the bush administration alleged chinese sensitivities should not be a factor mr yates said no rational chinese leader can assert that the carrier strike group is a platform from which to intimidate much less attack china and the signal of retreat most surely deepens the danger of future provocations from the north he said a white house national security council spokesman referred questions about the carrier to the pentagon however a senior administration official told the nelson report newsletter where comes this obsession with sending a show of force carrier message to the chinese in a case that doesn t involve them the official said the chinese picked up false rumors from the media we were going to have a particular kind of exercise they stupidly reacted publicly so now we have to compound the felony by taking a foolish step that was falsely rumored lest we be seen as weak no thanks deploying a carrier is a serious business this is not asked about chinese opposition to the war games on tuesday adm robert willard commander of the u s pacific command told reporters in seoul that he was not worried china might protest the naval exercises by extending its suspension of military to military exchanges with the pentagon no i m not concerned he said if i have a concern vis a vis china it s that china exert itself to influence pyongyang to see that incidents like cheonan don t occur in the future they clearly have a very strong relationship with north korea and we would like very much to see them exert the influence to see that a cheonan never happens again china recently held a series of naval exercises in the yellow sea that involved the use of new high speed wave piercing catamarans equipped with anti ship missiles u s military officials said the fast patrol boats could be used in swarming attacks against u s aircraft carriers and other warships asked about chinese opposition to the war games mr gates said earlier on tuesday during a visit to a u s military base in south korea that these exercises are off the coast of korea not off the coast of china we have conducted them in both the west and east seas and so there s nothing provocative about them at all he said china suspended its military ties to the pentagon to protest u s arms sales to taiwan in may beijing blocked mr gates from visiting china nuke funding debate senate republicans are continuing to demand that the obama administration fully fund a much needed nuclear weapons modernization program beginning with fiscal 2011 by making sure that all 624 million requested by the administration will be appropriated concern among republicans increased following the house appropriations energy and water subcommittee cut 99 million from an additional 624 million for modernization in the overall 7 billion nuclear weapons budget a fully funded nuclear weapons modernization program is a prerequisite for republicans to support ratification of the new start agreement now being debated in the senate administration officials are asserting that the 99 million cut by the house panel is insignificant because the agency was able to find in places not yet specified an additional 80 million for the energy department s national nuclear security administration making the additional funds total around 606 million but republicans say the found funds are a sleight of hand since the 2010 nuclear arms budget was at least 40 million short of needed funds sen john mccain arizona republican and ranking member of the senate armed services committee on tuesday pressed james miller the principal undersecretary of defense for policy about the house cut during a committee hearing mr miller said the administration continues to support its request for the full 624 million he declined to say whether president obama would veto the appropriations bill if the cut is not restored the senate version of the bill has the full 624 million funding request the house subcommittee in the past has taken anti nuclear weapons positions notably killing all funding for the reliable replacement warhead in 2008 last week the three directors of the nation s nuclear weapons laboratories questioned in a senate hearing on start whether the obama administration which favors the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons is committed to the expensive modernization noting that most of the major funding increases are scheduled for after mr obama s first term ends pelosi versus cia house speaker nancy pelosi is feuding with
