apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap the decision to wear a mask in public is becoming a political statement a moment to pick sides in a brewing culture war over containing the coronavirus while not yet as loaded as a make america great again hat the mask is increasingly a visual shorthand for the debate pitting those willing to follow health officials guidance and cover their faces against those who feel it violates their freedom or buys into a threat they think is overblown that resistance is fueled by some of the same people who object to other virus restrictions the push back has been stoked by president donald trump he didn t wear a mask during an appearance at a facility making them and some other republicans who have flouted rules and questioned the value of masks it s a development that has worried experts as americans are increasingly returning to public spaces top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time there s such a strong culture of individualism that even if it s going to help protect them people don t want the government telling them what to do said linsey marr a virginia tech engineering professor with experience in airborne transmission of viruses inconclusive science and shifting federal guidance have muddied the political debate health officials initially said wearing masks was unnecessary especially amid a shortage of protective materials but last month the centers for disease control and prevention began recommending wearing cloth masks in crowded public situations to prevent transmitting the virus whether americans are embracing the change may depend on their political party while most other protective measures like social distancing get broad bipartisan support democrats are more likely than republicans to say they re wearing a mask when leaving home 76 to 59 according to a recent poll by the associated press norc center for public affairs research the split is clear across several demographics that lean democratic people with college degrees are more likely than those without to wear masks when leaving home 78 to 63 african americans are more likely than either white people or

went without a mask in the senate paul already contracted the virus and believes he is no longer contagious that was a long way from new york gov andrew cuomo s moral argument for masks days earlier

arizona factory tuesday he later said he briefly wore a mask backstage but took it off because facility personnel told him he didn t need it but trump has been mask averse for weeks within minutes of the cdc announcing its updated mask recommendations he said i don t think that i m going to be doing it trump has told advisers that he believes wearing one would send the wrong message according to one administration and two campaign officials not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations the president said doing so would make it seem like he is preoccupied with health instead of focused on reopening the nation s economy which his aides believe is the key to his reelection chances moreover trump who is known to be especially cognizant of his appearance on television has also told confidants that he fears he would look ridiculous in a mask and the image would appear in negative ads it s a vanity thing i guess with him house speaker nancy pelosi said of trump on msnbc you d

leader kevin mccarthy said thursday that he himself wears a mask when near others but said of trump the president has his doctor around him all the time and makes sure what he does is correct meanwhile trump s reelection campaign has ordered red trump branded masks and is considering giving them away at events or in return for donations but some advisers are concerned the president will
