national review transgender student s bathroom access case returns to court apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound trump s grotesque tweets sessions says trump s anger over russiagate recusal is not all unjustified but stands by decision brexit architect cummings defends decision to travel amid lockdown try this thought experiment envision the coronavirus also known as covid 19 as a living breathing enemy which of course is exactly what it is but imagine for a moment that we are in real war with a cognizant thinking and clever enemy whose sole reason to live is to hurt maim or kill as many of us as it can covid 19 may not have jets tanks or nukes like our past enemies but its arsenal numbers cunning and willpower are said to be formidable to win its war against americans covid 19 must infect and sicken lots of americans each day if it cannot infect enough victims to multiply and sustain a hungry army of viruses covid 19 will soon sputter and die it will get trapped in just a few hosts among an otherwise victorious and healthy nation of about 330 million nature has given covid 19 some weapons that its defeated cousins the h1n1 swine flu and the mers and sars viruses lacked it is more clever by being less lethal and a little tougher in its ability to live outside a host viral resiliency ensures that it rarely turns into a suicide bomber by dying with a terminally sick host and that it does not perish so quickly when orphaned in the air and on surfaces jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist https cdn

streaminganalytics jwplayer jwp publisherid 23390304 labelmapping labelmapping the coronavirus has allies it infiltrates our defenses by using our own weapons against us our dirty hands the habitual touching of the face and indiscreet sneezing and coughing poor personal and public hygiene gives the virus some sustenance and camouflage to win defined as sickening or killing thousands of us covid 19 counts on our laxity it hates careful individuals who block its invasion into the eyes nose and mouth remember unlike our past human enemies covid 19 is invisible to the naked eye even more so than the most stealthy terrorists or underground enemy agents it does not leave a smell it cannot be heard it certainly cannot be touched we know covid 19 only by the damage it does to us even after it has left leaving its trail of fever fatigue congestion and labored breathing covid 19 also relies on ignorance of its complexity and sophistication it assumes that our experts will not learn how this new virus originated how it spreads and how it sickens or kills so the virus hopes that we cannot effectively quarantine the sick or at least not before a pandemic spreads in desperation the enemy virus hopes that even if our researchers can quickly infiltrate the covid 19 master borg and learn its deepest secrets we will still be unable to treat it with medicines or prevent it with vaccines or at least not before it becomes a plague of biblical proportions to a popular culture that laps up creepy zombie movies the virus certainly knows how to use its greatest weapons fright and panic as of early this week the relatively lightweight bug had killed fewer than 30 americans but we seem to be acting as if it has already killed 200 000 of us if covid 19 can create fear that we will end up like the grotesque monsters on television perhaps we its enemy will go on hoarding binges that result in shortages of masks gloves and supplies for the health providers who need them most or if the virus can scare us enough that we cease working and interacting our canceled out economy will grind to a halt or maybe the coronavirus can cleverly keep hopping on jets between countries and states sowing dissension as nations blame one other for its creation and contagion and politicians seek to destroy each other rather than band together to kill the virus covid 19 counts on globalization as it sneaks onto jets and ships in a few hours it can find a new home and new hosts to terrify even thousands of miles away it is a vengeful enemy it knows we have killed off or rendered impotent most of its fellow viruses its cousin the flu has not since 1918 translated its annual tactical wins into a strategic pandemic victory viruses and anti human microbes have not had a major win in america in decades perhaps not since polio used to terrorize cripple and kill thousands of americans annually covid 19 believes our progress confidence and sophistication are not our strengths but rather our greatest weakness as our vanity and assumed invulnerability render us ripe for panic the battle is upon us but if we stay calm and rational we can easily defeat the enemy whose reputation is likely far scarier than its reality 2020 tribune content agency llc get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
