coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots it is not known from the cable whether the shipment of maraging steel a high strength metal used in centrifuges and missile components was transferred to iran however the company involved was indicted in new york three months later and court papers in that case indicate the steel and other banned goods were sold to iran the cable provides new details on china s role as a supplier of materials for iran s nuclear program an earlier state department cable revealed that china helped north korea ship goods to iran through chinese airports what this shows is that china has been a consistent problem in u s efforts to tighten the noose around iran s nuclear program said gary milhollin head of the wisconsin project on nuclear arms control chinese companies have been a conduit for goods going to iran a cia report to congress last year said chinese companies both state owned and private continued in 2009 to sell weapons of mass destruction goods to iran china also covertly sold to pakistan in 1996 specialty ring magnets that u s officials later determined were used in the core of that country s nuclear weapons program specifically its centrifuges that spin uranium gas into highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons the jan 14 2009 cable was partially censored by the anti secrecy website wikileaks which released it friday however the identities of the sellers and buyers involved in the 25 ton deal for maraging steel were disclosed in an april 2009 indictment by new york city s district attorney of a chinese metallurgical production company called limmt and its owner li fangwei the cable stated that u s intelligence agencies had learned of an iranian agent linked to iran s defense industries organization dio who was making arrangements with a chinese entity to purchase maraging steel the steel was to be partially machined in order to disguise it as mechanical parts in order to evade chinese customs officials the cable said noting that the export was controlled by the nuclear suppliers group an international organization that seeks to limit exports of products that can be used in nuclear weapons development the cable said u s embassy officials were ordered to supply details of the planned sale to chinese officials and urge them to thoroughly investigate the transfer and the entities involved and share the results the iranians involved were linked to iran s dio that was sanctioned under u n security council resolutions unscr the cable said that u s officials were to tell the chinese that given iran s continuing nuclear and missile related activities now is not the time for business as usual with iran in diplomatic talking points the cable disclosed that the chinese sale includes about 25 metric tons of maraging steel and that an invoice identified the shipment as maraging steel rods with a diameter of 38 1 mm and 450 2 millimeters long the specifications also listed the grade of the steel and said it would be packed in seaworthy standard wooden boxes the price of the shipment was 75 55 per kilogram and 50 percent of the payment was to be made by wire transfer in advance with the remaining 50 percent by cash at delivery to be paid after the cargo has been received and the quality and quantity confirmed the cable said the delivery was to be made 80 to 140 days from the first payment and shipped from any chinese port we believe that other deals are also being discussed between these parties possibly involving other forms of maraging steel the cable said although the solid maraging steel rods described previously are not explicitly controlled on international agreement lists the circumstances surrounding this case i e deceptive practices involving a proscribed entity and prospects for further deals between the parties suggest that the transfer of this material would be inconsistent with china s obligations under unscr 1737 the cable said the cable said the proliferation related activities of the chinese company were discussed with china s government on a number of occasions and that the company could be sanctioned under u s law for these activities the indictment stated that a front company of limmt called sc dalian industry trade co sold iran 25 tons of maraging steel the buyer was
