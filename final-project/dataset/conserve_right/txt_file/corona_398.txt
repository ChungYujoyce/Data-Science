the traditional holy week starts tomorrow with palm sunday and across the country many churches are shuttered most voluntarily but some by decree of the government that s certainly a debate to be had once the crisis is past but in the meantime churches have watched as their sunday gift collection plates have disappeared with nothing to replace them this has led to a financial crisis for many churches that depend almost solely on donations from worshippers for their survival there s no government bailout in the offing either the archdiocese of newark new jersey set up an onlinegofundmedonation page where anyone can contribute to specific parishes or to a more general parishes in need fund our parishes face increased risk of financial shortfalls due to coronavirus covid 19 pandemic and its effects on everyday life said cardinal joseph w tobin in a statement on the page it s a fact of financial life for these churches that holy week brings in a large amount in donations much of which goes to fund important charity work priests and clergy tend their flocks giving food to hungry families paying the occasional monthly rent for others and a thousand other uses that those donations allow it s a concern for our pastors in our churches because the celebrations of holy week bring together a great number of people said bishop robert casey of the archdiocese of chicago it s a homecoming time for us but it s also a very important fundraising time that allows us to continue with our mission and our ministries and so this holy week will be especially worrisome for our parishes other critical needs met by the donations include payroll for church employees and third party employee contracts including maintenance workers and cleaning staff the last thing we want to do is lay off anyone or furlough especially during this time said father paul vigil of st timothy s catholic church in los angeles he echoes the wishes of the archdiocese of los angeles which said it is encouraging parishes and schools to avoid furloughs and layoffs it is also calling on parishioners to support extending unemployment benefits to church workers which in many states do not have access to state unemployment insurance money is tight all around and asking parishioners to dig deep in tough economic times has always been hard when families barely have enough to put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads as much as they may love the church they just can t give what they might normally give the churches will survive they ve survived depressions wars and now a pandemic presents the latest challenge the historic goodness and generosity of the american people will see them through there are still enough devout believers to continue what they see as god s work on earth copyright 2020 pjmedia com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
