apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion talk radio rock star michael savage in an opinion piece tied the current impeachment crusade against president donald trump to biblical truths about the persecution and crucifixion of jesus christ to the jews of yesteryear versus the jews of today and to the prosecution of an innocent by the romans and pontius pilate to modern time deep state evils it s a most brilliant comparison read the gospels see for yourself that s matthew mark luke and john for you secularists and pagans and scoffers of the world by the way in his piece will impeachment cause a rise of anti semitism in the country savage wrote there is vile anti semitism surrounding the impeachment proceeding and it is being riled up by anti semites in this country because of the jewish names affiliated with it schiff nadler zelensky goldman the list goes on but this is not about the jewish people it is not about religion but politics and the like minded groups working in unison top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century right in unison in cohesion in an enemy of my enemy is my friend sort of way savage then correctly pegs the beginning of trump s troubles with the intelligence community on his campaign season promises to expose the behind scenes globalists and elitists working against america s interests for his honesty he wrote the deep state actors will stop at nothing to undermine and overthrow president trump russia collusion russia conflict of interest russia obstruction of justice ukraine quid pro quo ukraine bribery and in between all resist resist resist summers of resistance protests in the streets impeach impeach impeach the common denominator of all these trump takedown tries they re rooted in deep state findings and yes that s findings in quotation marks for all the intelligence and law enforcement communities shock and awe tips and warnings and investigations into this president the ultimate conclusion has been a big fat nothingburger many have noted how the attacks on trump are similar to the salem witch trials and mccarthyism savage wrote but it bears a resemblance to another historical event the crucifixion of jesus he s absolutely correct and no he s not comparing trump to jesus he s simply looking at past events and seeing history repeat in his own words trump and jesus were both falsely accused by those in power and turned over to a deep state to do their will in the days of jesus it was the sanhedrin a special class of jewish leaders the law of the land akin to today s supreme court savage said who accused jesus of violating law by performing a healing on the sabbath the day of rest the sanhedrin also condemned jesus for threatening to destroy the jewish temple sorcery exorcising people by the power of demons and claiming to be both the messiah and the son of god jesus in other words upset the ruling class in rome to include the elite jewish groups and the roman leaders savage noted so the sanhedrin not all but only some tried and condemned jesus in private chambers in behind doors discussions could we reason that their actions were similar to adam schiff s star chamber where only a few were allowed to attend savage wrote indeed we could and then he added this but we must not forget who first pushed for impeachment nancy pelosi a non jew who was using jews to do her dirty work hmm that s interesting but wait there s more the romans were the deep state of the time savage wrote pontius pilate found no basis for this crucifixion much like bob mueller found no collusion but the deep state wanted their blood pilate offered the crowd the chance to spare jesus or the thief barabbas but the blood thirsty crowd yelled give us barabbas thus the romans took jesus spit on him beat him cut him put a crown of thorns on his head and he endured it the romans hung him to a cross where he died and only then did people recognize they had killed an innocent man the tie in to today s impeachment charade and to trump the democrats and the deep state want to crucify trump without a shred of evidence savage wrote this is history repeating itself biblical stories do have a way of coming alive and here s where things get especially ridiculous savage said they continue to malign him even calling trump an anti semite how could he be an anti semite his son in law is an orthodox jew whose grandfather and grandmother defied the nazis in poland trump s own daughter converted to judaism and his grandchildren are jewish and yet the media and the media s partners in the democratic party continue to paint trump as an anti semite savage wrote history always repeats so too the ways and means of evil and in the end that should be a comfort at least to those who know the bible read the bible and believe the bible after all the crucifixion of christ wasn t so much an end as a beginning likewise the fight for truth the fight for america first the battle against entrenched globalists and elitists in u s politics these thingsdon t have to end with trump s presidency what trump has revealed what trump has riled what trump has begun all that can be just the starting point
