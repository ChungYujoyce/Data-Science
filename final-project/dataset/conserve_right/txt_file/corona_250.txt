travel local movement business activity and work could prove to be worse than the disease that may already be true because politicians have been acting as if only one side of this ledger matters economists are predicting that the official response to the pandemic could lead to a downturn as bad as or worse than the great recession of 2008 09 which cost americans an estimated 22 trillion it is hard to see how a loss of that magnitude can be rationally justified when government agencies evaluate health or safety regulations they routinely consider not only the number of deaths they might prevent but the cost of doing so that makes sense because finite resources spent to reduce one kind of risk depending on the payoff might better be spent or invested elsewhere possibly in ways that would save more lives a rough calculation based on the value of a statistical life vsl that the environmental protection agency uses to assess proposed regulations suggests that the cost of covid 19 deaths in the worst case scenario sketched by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc which assumes that containment and suppression efforts are largely ineffective would be huge on the order of 13 6 trillion but if the economic projections are right the cost of aggressive covid 19 control measures will be substantially higher that comparison assumes government intervention will be completely successful at preventing those deaths which is certainly not true and it uses a vsl that is arguably excessive in this case since covid 19 fatalities are concentrated among the elderly meaning fewer years of life lost on average furthermore there are sound reasons to think that the worst case scenario which imagines 214 million infections 65 percent of the population and 1 7 million deaths is unrealistic the true case fatality rate cfr for covid 19 although probably higher than the cfr for the seasonal flu about 0 1 percent is likely to be much lower than the rates suggested by the official numbers which include only confirmed cases since covid 19 symptoms are typically mild to nonexistent the actual number of infections is bound to be much higher taking that denominator problem into account assistant secretary for health brett giroir says the best estimates now for the overall mortality rate for covid 19 are somewhere between 0 1 percent and 1 percent based on data from the cruise ship diamond princess john ioannidis an epidemiologist and biostatistician at stanford university calculates that reasonable estimates for the case fatality ratio in the general u s population vary from 0 05 to 1 the cdc s projection implies a covid 19 cfr of 0 8 percent near the high end of those ranges and the scenario implausibly assumes that voluntary measures to curtail the spread of covid 19 such as avoiding crowds limiting social interactions and paying extra attention to hygiene have no impact on transmission there is a great deal of uncertainty about these projections and public officials may think they are erring on the side of caution but that is true only if you ignore the potentially devastating impact of disrupting economic transactions shutting down businesses and depriving millions of people of their livelihoods ioannidis worries that if the cfr for covid 19 is much lower than many people fear locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational david katz founding director of the yale griffin prevention research center favors a more carefully targeted approach that focuses on protecting the people who face the greatest risk saying he is deeply concerned that the social economic and public health consequences of this near total meltdown of normal life will be long lasting and calamitous possibly graver than the direct toll of the virus itself in settling on an appropriate response to covid 19 there are no easy answers but wise policy starts by recognizing

quote for this hey keep going to restaurants go buy new houses ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner we want you to keep spending because gdp growth is what counts he never said that oh it s you this is what he really said shame on you bill gates predicted a virus catastrophe in 2015 we are not ready for the next epidemic said gates in 2015 he mentioned the details about ebola and stated that the problem was not that system did not work well enough but the problem was we did not have any system at all in the ted talk titled the next outbreak we re not ready bill gates predicted that the next outbreak would be more devastating than ebola the failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than ebola gates cited the fact that ebola did not reach many urban cities or else the results would have been greater next time we might not be so lucky covid 19 has barely begun and has already hit major urban centers worldwide so will be worse than ebola president trump deserves praise for reversing two months of delays and denials it s a democrat hoax it will magically disappear and similar bullshit vice president pence a former governor and the leader of the federal response to the coronavirus urged americans on monday to respect state and local restrictions that are in many cases tougher than those imposed by the trump administration we made it clear to the governors that this president and this administration this is what he actually said there really is no middle ground and it s very tough to say to people hey keep going to restaurants go buy new houses and ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner we want you to keep spending because there s maybe a politician who thinks gdp growth is all that counts bill gates https www marketwatch com story bill gates on trump call for quick end to lockdown its tough to tell people keep going to restaurants go buy new houses ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner 2020 03 24 that s a partial excerpt in context gates rebuked trump s proposed opening of the economy and your source lied your source cited linked to its source vox mediasite recode cited below in context the title and subtitle alone rebuke jfree you may not know that in cases like this it s always best to check the original source because your source lied using partial paragraph omitting the key words original source my emphasis added bill gates says we can t restart the economy soon and simply ignore that pile of bodies in the corner gates rebuked the proposal of leaders like donald trump mar 24 bill gates rebuked proposals floated over the last two days by leaders like donald trump to reopen the global economy despite the covid 19 coronavirus outbreak saying that this approach would be very irresponsible gates did not mention trump by name your source omitted the paragraph ending gates point in bold below there really is no middle ground and it s very tough to say to people hey keep going to restaurants go buy new houses ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner we want you to keep spending because there s maybe a politician who thinks gdp growth is all that counts gates said in an interview with ted tuesday it s very irresponsible for somebody to suggest that we can have the best of both worlds not to politicians the economic effect of this is really dramatic nothing like this has ever happened to the economy in our lifetimes gates said but bringing the economy back that s more of a reversible thing than bringing people back to life so we re going to take the pain in the economic dimension huge pain in order to minimize the pain in the diseases and death dimension the bill and melinda gates foundation has put up 100 million for programs to fund testing and science around the pandemic and he has begun using his public profile too to shape the coronavirus conversation the phony quote looks like a typical distortion by a very partisan player to manipulate trump supporters it might be worth noting that when bill gates talks here about taking the pain in the economic dimension he is most assuredly not talking about himself he ll be fine he just wants all you other little people to take the pain yeah microsoft profits and stock price won t be affected at all he ll be fine he just wants all you other little people to take the pain that s the key point to this entire issue the people making the choices to lock everything down don t generally live paycheck to paycheck own small businesses or live in efficiency apartments they have access to exercise equipment spare freezers to store extra food assistants to wait in line for toilet paper and can wait this out as long as they need the people making the choices to lock everything down don t generally live paycheck to paycheck they re professional scientists who know what they re doing which means qualified for the job and a president who was elected to perform the job the scientists have finally convinced trump that his original nationwide re opening would be catastrophic in the virus hot spots like new york plus many governors would simply ignore him which they were elected to do trump said so himself at the press conference yesterday that a single one size fits all policy would be wrong there are very wide differences in how the virus has affected different states or large sections within large states further new york is so bad that the administration also asked everyone who has left new york recently to self quarantine for 14 days who would you have making these critical life saving decisions who would you have making these critical life saving decisions i honestly don t know brother i don t think that there is a good answer and certainly not from a peon like me but there s something that tickles my hackles with your appeal to the wisdom of top men and technocrats or are you just messing around with us this is hihn you re talking to he s insane i mean that in a clinical sense p s eric doesn t know what technocrat is either unless he thinks trump is a technocrat for the uninformed a technocracy is a government run by technocrats not advised by them that is why eric would prefer an auto mechanic as a dentist and refuse to hire an accountant as a bookkeeper but there s something that tickles my hackles with your appeal to the wisdom of top men and technocrats or are you just messing around with us 1 get back to me when an auto mechanic is your dentist lol 2 you say you have no clue who should be making these life saving decisions then reverse yourself and claim to be an expert on the same thing you re clueless about and that is why i ll seek a professional over you every time 1 get back to me when an auto mechanic is your dentist lol get back to me when public policy is a science and not implemented by idiots who won a popularity contest or appointed by said idiots 2 you say you have no clue who should be making these life saving decisions then reverse yourself and claim to be an expert on the same thing you re clueless about where did i claim to be an expert on anything christ you are a piece of work hihn where did i claim to be an expert on anything lol your wacky statement that the nation s top medical experts should not be trusted never saying who can be trusted which is why you must assume that a dentist cannot be trusted to deal with your teeth possibly caused by your ignorance of what top men means http urbandictionary com define php term top 20men people who gets things done obviously not you which may explain your contempt for your betters or perhaps wildly irrational all of these obviously also apply to whoever brags about being a shitlord shitlord is a pejorative often used on the internet against those who are perceived as racist sexist homophobic fat shaming or otherwise prejudicial and a sock invented by one who has been banned and all his comments deleted to get around the ban get back to me when public policy is a science and not implemented by idiots who won a popularity contest or appointed by said idiots we agree trump is an idiot but what are you you say dr fauci is an idiot who was appointed and retained because he won multiple popularity contests under six presidents for over 30 years dr fauci was appointed director of niaid in 1984 he oversees an extensive research portfolio of basic and applied research to prevent diagnose and treat established infectious diseases such as hiv aids respiratory infections diarrheal diseases tuberculosis and malaria as well as emerging diseases such as ebola and zika niaid also supports research on transplantation and immune related illnesses including autoimmune disorders asthma and allergies the niaid budget for fiscal year 2020 is an estimated 5 9 billion dr fauci has advised six presidents on hiv aids and many other domestic and global health issues he was one of the principal architects of the president s emergency plan for aids relief pepfar a program that has saved millions of lives throughout the developing world but you say he won a popularity contest i d ask your qualifications but we can all assume your answer i don t need no steeeenking qualifacations but there s something that tickles my hackles with your appeal to the wisdom of top men and technocrats or were you just messing around with us how large is your paper route you say its already hit major urban centers as if that s some sort of end stage for this when in fact a virus like this hits the densest populations first its not really comparable to ebola in this respect as the transmission methods are very different you say its already hit major urban centers as if that s some sort of end stage for this read it again next from source gates cited the fact that ebola did not reach many urban cities or else the results would have been greater next time we might not be so lucky me covid 19 has barely begun and has already hit major urban centers worldwide so will be worse than ebola see it now when in fact a virus like this hits the densest populations first that s his point and mine ebola never hit major urban centers corvid 19 began in one metro seattle where gates happens to live and microsoft hq and over half our cases are in new york city its not really comparable to ebola in this respect as the transmission methods are very different how is that even remotely relevant when there are far fewer people to infect corvid 19 began in one metro seattle and here i thought it all began in wuhan china we re talking the united states explicitly all the pessimists like to bandy about thousands dying per day let s bandy about an economy so shot to shit that gdp drops to half its current level unemployment rate of 50 how many people do you think would die from that hell yes the economy matters that s where government gets its taxes from if you care about nothing else it s what allows people the luxury of 3d printing respirators or turning entire factories over to making masks without a functioning economy you wouldn t have nearly as many doctors hospitals or medical equipment fucking maroons seem to think saying if it saves even one life justifies killing millions from a trashed economy you idjuts don t have a clue what you are talking about you don t get it do you the virus ain t going away just cuz you want gdp to keep growing i m pretty sure the virus doesn t even care which derp wins in 2020 we screwed up by failing to act early re this virus specifically and by a ton of other ways in which we have failed over the decades now we re gonna pay either we keep the total serious case load below the number of ventilators icu s and run probably a 0 8 1 4 fatality rate for those infected social adjustment wise this is the option that requires the massive stuff that is being mandated by govt or we don t keep it below that and we run a 4 11 fatality rate overall for those infected this pretty much requires no action at all that s it the number of infected will have to be roughly idk 60 or 70 of the population maybe before it slows down to below r0 that s the two options with i suppose a third one to go back and forth between the two if you think gdp is gonna keep growing in either of those scenarios you re a complete twit you are ignorant beyond belief if you think medicine of any sort can protect against a pandemic without a functioning economy you are a statist of the most deluded sort p s i just posted a detailed explanation of what you re missing the long one below other comments may get in the middle the biggest was a major change yesterday they ll be opening portions of the country where that curve jfree described is downward keep tight restrictions on the worst states and areas tighter on the very worst which got italy s curve headed downward after 793 deaths in one day from 1 5 our population that s 4 000 in one day here and we just doubled in a single day a nationwide opening is now dead the administration just advised anyone who visited nyc to self quarantine for 14 days ya think trump will open new york in two weeks governor cuomo would refuse you are ignorant beyond belief if you think medicine of any sort can protect against a pandemic without a functioning economy and you are still utterly clueless as to what is happening you are not even trying to understand the thing itself just lashing out blindly at someone who says things you don t want to hear you think i am a statist i m not in office i am an anonymous commenter on a thread i m not imposing anything on you nor bluntly are you remotely worth that effort outside my family concerns this pandemic is nothing more than the supreme intellectual exercise and learning experience of all a chance to see how every society on earth deals with the same fast moving threat at the same time those that succeed relatively in this will succeed in future when it recedes those that don t wont who said you are imposing anything on me where did you dig up that strawman go ahead imagine your perfect healthy world devoid of any money to pay for its medical miracles because the economy has crashed only socialists think prices are meaningless and resources grow on trees because that s what money is in the end representation of resources when your dream world has a crashed economy because you ve locked it down and put half the people out of work half the resources won t be produced and the lack of symmetry means half of what you do produce won t be half delivered whatever i think it s perfectly relevant to be concerned with the economic costs of economic shutdown over a few months it is very likely more people will die of the disease if we do less to contain it it is very likely to overwhelm hospitals in the process of people dying this will take months but eventually most people will have it and hence immunity to the current strain or we can try to stop it spreading for months incur the economic losses and when we get there we could still have a virus that is stubbornly persisting do we then shut down the economy for another three months and go for round two at stopping the invisible man from moving around or do we accept we can t stop this thing without a vaccine and prioritize that while going back to work at what point do we admit we can t quarantine an invisible adversary without essentially nullifying freedom and keep the economy running at what point do we admit we can t quarantine an invisible adversary without essentially nullifying freedom and keep the economy running well since we have the option to run a lower fatality rate unlike the third world my guess is we will choose to run the higher fatality rate when we choose to accept those higher fatalities as acceptable and base notions of what the economy will be on that higher fatality rate right now the people advocating getting the economy going are essentially denying there is any fatality rate of significance so they are useless in advocating for anything unless the fatality rate here has absolutely no relationship to what it has shown in every place including here so far with this virus to date every society on earth deals with the same fast moving threat at the same time so predator has arrived if so easy answer call up alien neither did any of the scourges our ancestors endured but guess what they kept working they didn t sit at home until polio was no longer a threat the virus is not going away no matter how long you stay inside you can t have a society where nobody produces that is far worse than the virus itself also its been around since november so neither did any of the scourges our ancestors endured but guess what they kept working how large were their gatherings how many died the virus is not going away no matter how long you stay inside not the purpose at all you won t get infected you won t infect others the real purpose is to slow the new infections america s just doubled in a single day in hot areas hospitals are already overwhelmed with severe shortages in masks ventilators even the protective gear needed by doctors and nurses 1 this is 25 times more deadly than swine flu and more contagious 2 we must stay within the capacity of our already overloaded hospitals example new york city is converting its main convention center into a 1 000 bed hospital and needs tens of thousands of masks 3 until a vaccine has been developed and tested 4 last week we were on a curve to hit 4 000 deaths in one day within 2 weeks what happens if your way leads to 10 000 deaths in one day and the curve is still going upward we get 20 000 you can t have a society where nobody produces if anyone proposes that let us know the latest remedy looks like a phased re opening of the economy starting with iirc 10 or so safe states keeping restrictions on other states until the bend the curve downward tighter restrictions on the very worst places new york city now has over half america s infections they re now doing deep research on those safe areas to make sure there are no minor glitches this is all too new to have good data the first death was 26 days go people who have recently left new york are estimated to cause 40 of all new us infections this is recent but are you aware the trump administration now asks everyone who left new york recently to self quarantine for 14 days 1 this is 25 times more deadly than swine flu and more contagious you really need to stop with this the numbers you use don t say what you think they say and we do not yet know the actual cfr for covid 19 even the cfr for seasonal flu or h1n1 is based on statistical modeling rather than direct measurement and we haven t done that statistical modeling for covid 19 yet so we don t have numbers that we can legitimately compare clearly you have no idea what this is about or how to use relevant data i know you ve seen the relevant data i posted because you made the same comment the only valid way to compare two communicable diseases is to compare their daily progress day by day as you ve seen and forgotten those data are based on the first 16 days of each disease as you ve also seen this is how corvid and swine flu compare each 16 days from their first death just data not the full summary the cdc had confirmed 75 covid 19 deaths through last monday by contrast 16 days after the first swine flu death there were only three h1n1 deaths reported to the cdc 75 3 covid 19 is 25 times more deadly than swine flu the cdc estimates about 12 000 americans ended up dying from swine flu between april 2009 and april 2010 12 000 x 25 300 000 graphic comparison charts at the source swine flu didn t go away many people don t realize it s now part of the seasonal flu and covered by the annual flu vaccine covid 19 is completely new is hitting on top of the seasonal flu has no vaccine and clearly warrants the stronger response because nobody is immune the challenge with covid 19 is we are all eligible to get sick and spread the disease all at the same time no ynh is correct the baseline that reporter chose for comparison 2009 2010 h1n1 has a mortality rate of 0 02 per the cdc and that low mortality rate makes it easy to naively assert that covid 19 is far worse than it actually is there was a lot of initial fear about h1n1 because it appeared to be much more deadly than it actually was the primary basis for that early assessment was the high death rate in the area of mexico where it was first reported but that was actually rooted in poverty and lack of resources in that area worse the reporter and you obviously has no understanding of basic statistical reasoning nor epidemiology feel free to challenge this point by proffering the reporter s qualifications in those areas he makes the fundamental mistake which hans rosling called the straight line error you can read all about it in chapter 3 of his book factfulness considering the broader situation you should also read chapter 4 from what i ve seen of all your posts regardless of topic you would dearly benefit from reading the entire book twice before ever posting again on anything here or anywhere else the who is even being careful not to refer to the current ratio of deaths to known infections as a mortality rate why because they understand epidemiology and the valid statistical methodologies that reporter from wwl tv clearly does not oh and why an online article by some local tv station reporter who has no relevant qualifications why that source instead of the cdc or who sure new orleans is a large tv market but local news tends to be quite good at covering local issues yet tends to be lacking when it comes to national global issues perhaps because you found something that you can link as a source which regardless of its folly supports your views and desired narrative while also appearing credible to the mathematically unsophisticated good show sir if you ever tire of posting here there s undoubtedly a russian troll farm with a well paying job tailor made for you you are drunk on fear i ll be on the edge of my seat waiting to see whether i receive a smirk or a sneer don t disappoint me the baseline that reporter chose for comparison 2009 2010 h1n1 has a mortality rate of 0 02 per the cdc the baseline is per the cdc i have a source you have nothing so for some reason a similar reply in another article was marked as awaiting moderation that post seems to be stuck in limbo so i ll copy that reply here as two responses under the assumption that it had too many urls first though i ll address your terse reply the baseline is per the cdc the mortality rate i quoted is per the cdc but they are not using 2009 2010 h1n1 as a baseline for comparing covid 19 for the purposes of developing recommendations for policy makers and the public if you can prove otherwise please provide a link to a credible source ideally from the cdc or who i have a source you have nothing your source is a local reporter with a case of dunning kruger effect my sources were in the prior post but since it is stuck i ll re post it split across three responses here s the first part the wwl tv article you linked is almost as useful as a junkyard yugo primarily the author reaches an unsupportable conclusion on the basis of a facile analysis in short simplistically comparing the spread of the two diseases in the way that he does is invalid but you shouldn t take my word for it instead note how the who is unwilling to assess covid 19 by such direct and simplistic comparisons with 2009 h1n1 https www reuters com article uk factcheck h1n1 totally chill partly false claim covid 19 and h1n1 numbers compared the public was totally chill during the h1n1 pandemic of 2009 2010 while covid 19 is causing mass hysteria iduskbn2172ht see next response for the relevant quoted paragraphs with expanded urls sigh that one s awaiting moderation too perhaps forever at the prior url it s the last two paragraphs before the verdict section at the end which address the matter of the who being unwilling for good reasons to declare the preliminary numbers for the ration of deaths to cases as a mortality rate hey reason maybe you should beg koch to buy you a message board that s better than something i would have written as an undergrad comp sci project oh and why an online article by some local tv station reporter who has no relevant qualifications why that source instead of the cdc or who both are named sources near the very top smirk data from the world health organization and u s centers for disease control and prevention to track the increase of h1n1 swine flu in 2009 from the day of the first death april 28th 2009 compared with the rise of covid 19 since the first u s coronavirus death was reported in washington on feb 29 statistical genius but less than a 6th grade reading level both are named sources near the very top smirk you capacity for disingenuous assertions knows no limits how convenient that you omitted the wwl tv used which makes the relevant quote wwl tv used data from the world health organization and u s centers for disease control and prevention to track the increase of h1n1 swine flu in 2009 from the day of the first death april 28th 2009 compared with the rise of covid 19 since the first u s coronavirus death was reported in washington on feb 29 so the reporter made that statistically absurd comparison not the cdc or who if you re looking to toss the 6th grade reading level taunt at someone try starting with the man in the mirror except that s not it is it no it isn t it s your own pathetic dishonesty which you have displayed here for all to plainly see statistical genius those are your words not mine i made no such claim about myself i merely pointed out the foolish statistical error of one reporter your only source for your fear mongering i also pointed out your naive credulousness though that s an undeservedly favorable interpretation of your utterly transparent motivations since you apparently could not understand the prior simple request for a better source perhaps because you would have lost in the first round of that old tv show are you smarter than a fifth grader let me try to reword it for you with greater clarity and precision produce a reputable source ideally from the cdc or who which definitively asserts the same conclusion as your vaunted reporter reached based on the same simplistic comparison of the same brief period of data i apologize for not finding a way to express that using only monosyllabic words but you obviously have internet access so do avail yourself of dictionary com as needed caught red handed both are named sources near the very top smirk you capacity for disingenuous assertions knows no limits how convenient that you omitted the wwl tv used named sources so the reporter made that statistically absurd comparison what s your source snort caught red handed yes you were caught red handed omitting wwl tv used from your quote an omission which intentionally misrepresents the facts of the matter thanks for finally showing just a little bit of honesty but you ve got a lot more work to do on yourself in that area named sources named sources which don t prove what you misrepresent them as proving and you know it and now so does anyone with the endurance to follow this sub thread for future reference the all caps and bold text do not make your poor source more correct or authoritative what s your source snort your source is invalid and you know it in response you expect me to provide a source to all of the statistically invalid conclusions which the cdc and who didn t publish i have the feeling you failed introduction to the philosophy of logic in college given that you ve just revealed that you don t understand the general problem of proving a negative since i and of course by definition every person cannot prove a general negative the closest i could get to that is via the link i already provided which you of course failed to acknowledge or perhaps even read https www reuters com article uk factcheck h1n1 totally chill partly false claim covid 19 and h1n1 numbers compared the public was totally chill during the h1n1 pandemic of 2009 2010 while covid 19 is causing mass hysteria iduskbn2172ht this time i ll put the relevant paragraphs here without the expanded urls in the hope that this post won t go into moderation limbo calculating mortality rates during a disease epidemic is difficult in part because the numbers of deaths and patients constantly change that s why world health organization who officials who said last week that 3 4 of the people worldwide confirmed as having been infected with the new coronavirus had died were careful not to describe that as a mortality rate or death rate here in 2013 reuters reported here that at least one in five people worldwide were infected with swine flu during the first year of the 2009 2010 h1n1 pandemic according to an international research group at the time but the death rate was just 0 02 percent updated daily the latest figures on covid 19 cases and deaths in the u s can be found on the cdc website here that specific excerpt careful not to describe that as a mortality rate or death rate is where you have unequivocally lost this debate but you knew that already didn t you because if you didn t already know that your 25 times as deadly statement is hokum you would have kept using such an alarming figure in subsequent posts to other articles but you ve stopped doing that haven t you anyone can see that by simply looking for your posts in later covid 19 articles all the pointless bold text makes them easy to spot so i m sure they ll be thankful to you for that which just shows that you already know you ve lost oh and purely for your edification those three dots i placed at the beginning and end of that excerpt i pulled from the larger quote are called ellipses plural singular ellipsis that s how people quote properly when they re not trying to disingenuously misrepresent the words of others you should try it sometime even if just for a change of pace finally a snort this time does your sneer hurt is you smirker worn out i can only assume you ve removed or covered all the mirrors and other reflective surfaces in your home on the off chance that you might unintentionally see yourself for what you really are to borrow an old game show quote you are the weakest link goodbye yhl hand just ignore him it s hihn he s an insane gibbering idiot he just attacks everyone no matter what just ignore him it s hihn he s an insane gibbering idiot he just attacks everyone no matter what i couldn t have said it any better myself garbage in garbage out the only reliable data is so minuscule as to be lumped in with the rest of the garbage data meanwhile common sense says if the infection rate keeps doubling we will all be dead in a month anyway so you ve got that wrong common sense also says that if you destroy the economy in a quest for perfection you will have destroyed the village in order to save it guess what they kept working actually no they didn t these are exactly the times when the militia was mustered and mobilized into action when the times called for action as a community directed towards a common threat yes they kept working but no they did not keep doing what they had previously done and whatever resources they had on hand and had prepared for ahead of time and had trained ahead of time for well that s what could for better or worse be mobilized we are in lockdown or whatever because we no longer have that it s too late to train anybody we didn t stockpile the sorts of resources that could do anything absent that getting together to mill around makes things worse like mustering on the pier with a bunch of spoons to watch an incoming tsunami caught with our pants down we chose to abdicate our governance to others the strain of libertarianism here has proven stunningly corrosive to the very idea of that that we used to have this is where we are i know most people here pretend to worship history but have no interest in history as it was it s just a different cudgel to beat up others you oppose now not a way to learn how our ancestors actually dealt with threats i m certain here no one here even ran across how different places dealt with the plague in black death times when studying the medieval or yellow fever cholera etc at other time very few have any experience whatsoever of modern epidemics in the third world since of course those only happen in shitholes until 2 weeks ago i am 100 certain few here realized the spanish and other foreigners invaded in 1918 and brought flu an oblivious complacent people unpleasant topics are unpleasant let s ignore them instead the strain of libertarianism here has proven stunningly corrosive to the very idea of that that we used to have thar strain is called anti government now dominant as opposed to the original dominant stain pro liberty pro people advancing individual liberty always limits or reduces government slashing government as the first priority can reduce liberty by enacting the opposite of free market outcomes as they mostly do today like slashing medicaid instead of transitioning back to the free market outcome which was universal coverage progressives began shouting health care should be a right not depending on charity that s where it began now it s a right but medicaid eligibles are the highest uninsured rate in america many doctors refuse medicare because it pays so little medicaid pays 25 30 less so many inner cities have no doctors at all they d have only medicaid sorry you triggered me idk that certainly appears to be true let s bandy about an economy so shot to shit that gdp drops to half its current level unemployment rate of 50 how many people do you think would die from that a teeny tiny fraction how do you assume they would die we just doubled our cases in a single day even nyc doubles every three days nyc has over 50 of the us total last thursday our slope was to 4 000 deaths in one day by month end 1 person infects 2 2 infect 4 4 infect 8 that s the curve that must be flattened or it continues at an escalating pace what happens to the economy at 10 000 deaths in one day when the curve has not flattened we go to 20 000 fucking maroons seem to think saying if it saves even one life justifies killing millions from a trashed economy you idjuts don t have a clue what you are talking about they are idjuts but you say corvid will kill only one person all the pessimists like to bandy about thousands dying per day no simple math italy had 793 deaths in one day from 1 5 our population that s 4 000 per day in our population and we just doubled our cases in one day plus italy forced their curve downward with very strict lockdowns and trump wants to do the exact opposite but he s already backed off per tuesday s press conference finally influenced by the health professionals he s ignored at a meeting that day dr fauci now has the influence we need for now trump now says we can open portions of the country then fauci stepped up and explained it all many parts of the country have low incidence and can be reopened opening other parts nyc would cause a catastrophe fauci says they are already doing deeper data studies for the safe areas and they have a lot of time before easter he feels for example a state may have low infections but recently escalating on a steep curve that s a no because of the 14 days with no symptoms bet your life that several governors would refuse to open up new york for sure leading to months of lawsuits and no opening bottom line trump has again made a commitment that s impossible to fulfill complete opening and again backed off that is the option you may have missed open the economy gradually in steps likely stiffer restrictions in the worst area to bend the curve downward open additional states or areas as they become safe a continuing process trump himself said one nationwide plan would be wrong note the administration now advises anyone who visited nyc to self quarantine 14 days which is the stiffer stance i mentioned he gets it jfree stuff your panic flag up your ass stick first do you have a pay pal account in the event if you have you can include an extra 1800 every week to your pay check working on the internet three hours every day check this site read more it is hard to see how a loss of that magnitude can be rationally justified it s 25 times more deadly than coronavirus and sure to be far worse than even ebola see gates talk above u s cases just doubled in a single day if our curve continues we ll have a 4 000 death day by month end what happens if we hit 10 000 deaths per day major stock market crash tens of millions afraid to go out same end as a national lockdown but far more deaths jacob needs to see both sides of this it s been virtually guaranteed that trump will screw it up but he backtracked heavily on tuesday and claims to be listening to people who know what they re talking about because this is not the democrat hoax he originally claimed it will not magically disappear and spinning wind turbines do not cause cancer dr fauci said with trump at his side that portions of the country could be restored which is where trump caved obviously not new york low infection rates in many states and parts of large states which are now targeted for deeper study fauci seems back in charge perhaps because lindsey graham tore apart trump s original claim to open the entire country what is your prediction how long we must stay home point is i don t know and even the strictest i know of england has reasons to go out groceries and health care the most obvious fauci knows where but says they re doing deeper research so no quirks in the background this guy is professional depends on your location safe to say that new york city or state will be the last to open up nyc has over half the us cases look for cuomo to do what britain s pm johnson did there are explicit reasons to be outside your home enforced by the police broader than i d have guesses violations will get a misdemeanor and fine i d like to take a stab at the question what is your prediction how long we must stay home the question is an excellent one here is my take the 15 day self isolation period ends march 30th i believe that it will be renewed for an additional 15 days and i think that is the smart move why because we have several disparate outbreaks in the very early stages where we can dramatically influence the course of events specifically i am speaking of louisiana there will be others that crop up this week we have north of 350k observations and much more is coming online this week testing data is coming in from 12k private labs and hospitals then we can get down to zip code and this matters a lot we will also have a much better handle on incidence by zip code my intuition is that by the end of passover april 16 the us will start opening up a lot and many of the home bound restrictions will be lifted bottom line prepare to stay homebound through april 15th i described that they ve already announced that large sections of the county will open before easter the safer states and large in state regions yesterday fauci described deeper research in those areas presumably to find any subtle glitches assume the state must have low infection and a low curve since the overriding goal is to flatten the curve in hot areas we ll likely see tighter restrictions italy finally reversed their rapid climb 793 deaths in one day by enforcing shutdowns with police england began with a list of permitted activities with violations a misdemeanor and fine governors are free to ignore whatever trump wants to open which is likely why he s abandoned a nationwide opening he first announced along with the insistence of fauci and others that time period has little to do with the virus that s all about the governance that we abdicated except via the couple minutes every few years electing them deciding what we will tolerate at the margins i suppose its about some people with mild cases recovering and no longer being infectious but the of the population that applies to at this point is near irrelevant maybe 0 2 of people at max more likely a lot less than 0 1 that ain t a herd immunity that will do shit assuming your real question is how long do we have to sit around and or socially adjust while other people deal with the actual virus assuming that we want to keep fatalities low answer is until there is a vaccine in mass production or until the virus infects the 60 or 70 or 80 of the population that we hope creates some herd immunity none of that is remotely part of the public discussion and we have chosen utter passivity in our governance where our only civil function is to get pissed or answer polls re our feelz opinions so we will most likely get released in 15 or 30 days and hey presto the virus will start back up and blow into higher fatality range the bright side of that high fatality range is that this could all be over in about 2 or 3 months course that many bodies creates consequences in the aftermath one of which can get really ugly in the absence of social cohesion going into it and sure enough derps still don t even see the thing itself as the same thing much less agree on how to approach a solution answer is until there is a vaccine in mass production or until the virus infects the 60 or 70 or 80 of the population that we hope creates some herd immunity or until there is an effective treatment that reduces the severity of those critically affected great 10 million people die and we have herd immunity although if they still have to be hospitalized i supposeit won t really change much unless it reduces hospitalization time right and if we use even a three day doubling time the entire population of the country will be dead by mid june see how that doesn t make any sense see how that doesn t make any sense the facts are in con veeeeeen yent so you sneer at them what makes no sense is to ignore reality the entire population of the country will be dead by mid june infected and you don t understand how it works very little of america is yet a hot spot but much of it is headed there new york is so bad that the trump administration now asks everyone who has left new york recently to self quarantine for 14 days no offense intended but how many people have asked for your expertise in quantum physics no you said based on our curve we would have a 4000 death day by month end now i m not sure which month you refer to but i will assume april since march is almost done using 100 deaths as a starting point and three day doubling time you would hit 4k daily deaths with 10k cumulative around day 16 or 17 and again another couple months and we would all be dead obviously the latter case will not hold why would the former new york has a lot going on no doubt i don t disagree with your point that saying everyone everywhere should handle things the same way on april 12 or any date regardless of their local situation isn t the realistic path i agree that the nyc area in particular will probably be handled differently for a longer time than most anywhere else but right now we are told to expect that situation to develop everywhere and i just don t see any rationale for that nyc is far and away the most extreme case in the nation in terms of population density number of domestic and international travelers etc they account for almost half the cases and over 2 3 of the deaths in the country and even at that a few hundred deaths in a city of 9 million is nothing let s not pretend that the same scenario is likely to play out across the nation big dense cities maybe those of us who chose not to live or work in those environments should not be punished for their problems for my part i am laissez faire to my core with most things in life doing nothing is always an option and usually the best one worry about yourself and your loved ones and let everyone else worry about theirs in the way they see fit control freaks and micromanagers are the worst again it s the infections bold in the original which double every three days in new york for my part i am laissez faire to my core not when you invent some right to walk around infecting and killing innocent people who will then each infect two others now four who will infect eight others etc etc well since you have all the facts on this new and unknown virus will you please share them with the powers that be so they can come up with a coordinated plan as far as i ve been able to tell the facts are unknown at this point although there have been many observations presented as facts and said facts are all over the place the one i m most interested in is immunity i listened to a virus expert just this morning say that it is not clear that there will be immunity beyond the short term for people who ve had this virus much like the other coronavirus it stems from the immunity is usually quite short lived in the former but much longer in the later which is why we get colds over and over in our life but the flu only when it is a different viral strain again it is mostly an unknown which means trying to support arguments with facts that are not yet known is a fools errand well since you have all the facts on this new and unknown virus will you please share them with the powers that be so they can come up with a coordinated plan i got the facts from the powers that be again it is mostly an unknown which means trying to support arguments with facts that are not yet known is a fools errand umm the facts are known by the powers that be which is where i get them per your own words those fact are not yet known by you when this is over it will be a matter of fact the government s incoherent reaction to this mess will be the most damaging element not just the closures and orders to stay at home but the absurd political battle over a relief bill and the grotesque mutilation of that bill for political reasons this sort of horseshit is how a republic dies et tu brute the government screwed this up a long time ago certificate of need laws the fda occupational licensing etc all contributed to the slow response much more than anything the government could have done once the crisis was here this goverment was screwed up already hope can change the president who can make fast response with any crisis there are times you are damned if you do and damned if you don t this is one of them for trump for you and for me there is no right answer this be true this is one where i m very interested to see the results of how it s handled state by state and we ll have the statistics to back it all up within about a year do states with a hands off approach come out with a higher death rate but better economies do states that have implemented harsh lock downs have their economies crushed stay tuned several commenters here have squawked that the bug isn t as bad as the flu since we often have 100 deaths per day from the flu take note yesterday we had over 200 deaths from the bug and we have just begun to die as the medical pros have predicted the virus is starting to overwhelm healthcare capacity what say you now direct more resources to the hot spots like ny where lots of people that traveled in china came through or back to if the rest of us would fucking follow the cdc recommendations on hand washing disinfecting frequently touched surfaces staying isolated if sick and staying away from the elderly and other high risk people we could get much of the economy back in operation if the rest of us would fucking follow the cdc recommendations on hand washing is this something like following speed limits on the highway understand i m not saying something is good or bad or frankly that i prefer one way or the other things just are what they are people start getting back to normal and the virus will start right back up on its full exponential growth that is the fact china is getting back to work and their numbers which i know are suspect are no longer scary guess we ll see if they regret getting back to work they shut down the entire country for about a month in part to stop the spread and even more so to transport tens of thousands of medical staff and presumably ventilators to hubei hubei is planned to be opening up in early april so eleven weeks under lockdown both of which were magnitudes more intrusive than ours can ever be in addition hubei built eleven hospitals in about a month and converted pretty much all public facilities into isolation beds they started those lockdowns when they had roughly 400 confirmed cases in hubei and roughly 100 confirmed elsewhere in china they will certainly have another wave and most chinese probably even in wuhan are still not immune and never exposed but it is almost certain that they completed the first wave we are not remotely in that situation nor is there a chance in hell of what has already happened in china happening here to control it here it really does look more like a decision of whether we are going to have two separate waves or whether we re just going to kind of smoosh them into one wave whether we like it or not and that wave will probably involve their other major metropolises of shanghai and beijing they put everyone on quarantine very quickly in those places to knock down infection which helped stop the spread but which also means that those people won t have immunities to the disease so they re going to be susceptible to the second round of infections and that second wave could be much worse than the first because their economy is already weakened so protecting people from infection is bad because the won t have immunity from the second round of the virus because there will still be no vaccine also bad to protect them from that which would leave them helpless against a third round keep repeating til hell freezes over and we know tens of millions of americans have a god given right to risk death because immunity is more important than life itself as you state so brilliantly translation if it s effective reject it if it s far more effective than trump s month plus of delays trump is more important than thousands of lives just ask him thanks for sharing the cdc s implausibly assumes that voluntary measures to curtail the spread of covid 19 such as avoiding crowds limiting social interactions and paying extra attention to hygiene have no impact on transmission curious isn t it why isn t the cdc and others like bill gates telling us the number of cases prevented and lives to be saved by implementing these draconian measures could it be that nobody really knows whether these measures will be successful or is it as i have read some medical professionals candidly suggest that the number of cases and deaths will not be reduced at all and that the purpose of these draconian restrictions is simply to defer the number of new cases and deaths over a longer period of time to reduce the burden on the health system i wonder if americans will tolerate having both a devastated gdp and a pile of bodies in the corner medical professionals seem confident that it spreads like the flu from human contact primarily and from droplets from coughing etc airborne transmission has been mentioned too but that is likely overstated the op ed in today s wsj by two doctors professors of medicine from stanford is interesting they suggest that it s likely that current estimates about the coronavirus fatality rate may be too high by orders of magnitude could it be that nobody really knows whether these measures will be successful or is it funny thing is every country on the planet is running this experiment as we speak and the experiment is moving fast enough so there will be no valid data that we will be able to look back on and learn from and change our behavior much in the first wave this is merely the proving ground of who does this shit right and who doesn t and who can make the first steps towards the massive learning doing rampup that needs to happen before second wave yup it s all test bed no control group and i hope we learn some lessons from this quick because if history is any guide it s only a matter of time before the second wave hits as well and the second waves of pandemics can often be far worse that said they had some promising news about the vaccine efforts they ve looked at the genetic profile for coronavirus and said it s relatively stable so a vaccine they develop should maintain a high efficacy for awhile and the former kansas governor a physician is involved in the hydroxychloroquine testing and said the results so far are very promising they ve been open about it it s flattening the curve one can argue it buys time to try and get in front of it but if immunity proves to be not the 100 many posters here seem to believe then we re all screwed sooner or later here s an expert s explanation of immunity coronaviruses and variations in mutation that can go either way https www statnews com 2020 02 04 two scenarios if new coronavirus isnt contained we have no control over the mutations but we can hope for the best wow a rare well written reason article giving president trump credit has hell frozen over yes hell froze over for unreason writers yesterday they announced in effect that individual safe states will be opened by easter if current research bears out why isn t the cdc and others like bill gates telling us the number of cases prevented and lives to be saved by implementing these draconian measures they are and have been all along arguing for stricter measures gates just blasted trump s original re opening as irresponsible elsewhere like italy they finally got a downward curve when they made it mandatory with police enforcement so impressive that england just began with a list of legal reasons to be outside the home with violations a misdemeanor and fine fuck you hihn stay off my threads actually i ll retract that you offered a coherent and valid argument thank you for that as long as you re doing that and not the standard gibberish i m cool with you commenting maybe they adjusted his meds seriously if so i m glad to see it and i hope it sticks and i mean that sincerely i m cool with you commenting why should i care why should anyone care this is an open discussion forum that s why it says reply at the bottom left if you simply cannot tolerate that well buh bye you re the one who threw a raging hissy fit fuck you hihn stay off my threads over a comment you then admitted you d never read inventing a power you don t have a few of us are saying something even a little bit positive about you you don t owe anyone a thank you but it would be nice if you didn t shit on it either how does shitlord say something a little bit positive about someone must be his only comment in the thread duh maybe they adjusted his meds seriously seriously smirk trump has since fallen back on a nationwide re opening even says a nationwide one size fits all policy is wrong finally listening to the experts he s helpless to stop governors from doing whatever they want many would have simply ignored his original re opening which is their job opening hot areas now like new york would be catastrophic new york is so toxic that over half of recent infections have been people who recently left new york note that the administration now asks everyone who recently left new york to self quarantine for 14 days that is a significant reversal also we ll see loosening in the safer states and more tightening in the hot states look for police enforcement if needed which is what it took to reverse the trend in hot spots like italy i agree with your points on the hot areas as well as the likely loosening in safer states thanks but i just reported what i m 99 sure are dr fauci s points his explanation from the lectern was simple enough for junior high kids he s helpless to stop governors from doing whatever they want many would have simply ignored his original re opening which is their job it is and it s a valid approach because frankly not every state is going to be facing the same circumstances that new york or washington is the governors have to be able to tailor their approach to local conditions but i do think most of them will generally follow the president s lead because they understand the same thing he does you can t shut down the entire u s economy just because some people might die from coronavirus it will collapse society we re already looking at a 2q unemployment rate of 30 and a 50 drop in gdp because of the shutdowns and countries collapse under those conditions and governors who have to answer to voters too aren t going to want to see their states fall apart even jay inslee who hates the president and is a hardcore partisan understood this point and has tried to balance the risks with keeping prosperity in his state going he only put down restrictions when the idiots in seattle who wouldn t self quarantine gave him no other choice it is and it s a valid approach because frankly not every state is going to be facing the same circumstances that new york or washington is so we agree that trump was way out of line as stated by dr fauci and lindsey graham among others opening hot areas now like new york would be catastrophic new york is so toxic that over half of recent infections have been people who recently left new york note that the administration now asks everyone who recently left new york to self quarantine for 14 days that is a significant reversal also the problem is that once they realize this virus has broken quarantine from a hot zone it s usually when someone gets sick outside that zone meaning they were spreading it for up to two weeks before they saw a doctor and the virus is already likely established in the new place i don t think this virus was containable once it got out of china and arguably wasn t containable in china its inherent characteristics defeat basic containment protocols so the question then becomes about how you deal with the problem once containment is no longer a viable option which to my mind means focusing all testing and most treatment on the high risk population groups and stressing self isolation for them as an individual responsibility and for most of the rest of the population focusing on a timeline when they can consider themselves sufficiently healthy to get back to work which to my mind means focusing all testing and most treatment on the high risk population groups most who say that seem unaware that the under 50s will continue infecting people this morning i read that the original ratios by age were from china we re running about 40 infections under 50 who are far less likely to die but far more likely to infect others lesser or no symptoms recall that testing is not just to find who s infected it s also to find who should self quarantine to avoid infecting others like ted cruz and rand paul did paul too late this is recent but a growing number of countries are now using law enforcement a list of legal reasons to leave home violations are a misdemeanor and a fine that is what reversed the curve in italy just after that day with 793 deaths i saw they had declined 3 days in a row england only just started restrictions but began with legal enforcement of a list if many others replicate italy s success that could become the norm i m aware that the under 60s the high risk groups start at 60 not 50 will continue to be carriers but there are a lot more of them than there are people in the high risk groups and the reality is that the disease is already established it can t be contained in part because it inherently defies containment and it survives a long time and spreads asymptomatically and if you try to protect everyone you end up protecting nobody the isolation efforts need to focus on the high risk individuals while the lower risk people build up something like a herd immunity and that immunity is going to be important because i m willing to bet that china has another massive outbreak before long their quarantines were put in place before their population centers got hit and now that those are being lifted all it takes is another outbreak to start in shanghai or beijing and they re right back where they were months ago we don t want that second go around we want this to be the only serious iteration and the next outbreaks to be less virulent and hopefully we end up having a vaccine or effective treatment regimen in place by then the isolation efforts need to focus on the high risk individuals while the lower risk people build up something like a herd immunity herd immunity requires a high percentage of the populace not just your subherd be individually immune for covid 19 the herd immunity threshold ranges 29 74 which are of course estimates the only ways to get individually immune are vaccine or the disease both over a year away it s now quite obvious that you ve abused my trust my giving you the benefit of doubt of much doubt it s now certain that you ve been inventing whatever you need at the moment buh bye recall that testing is not just to find who s infected it s also to find who should self quarantine to avoid infecting others like ted cruz and rand paul did paul too late the problem is that ship has sailed quarantine has already been blown and the problem is not with testing people it s in getting those tests processed at labs and back to people the turnaround where i m at is two weeks by the time the people getting tested get their results their bout with the disease for the most part has already passed and the result is worthless to them even worse their result helped bog down the system so that someone who needs a result fast may not be able to get it in time because of the bottleneck at the lab i don t think this virus was containable once it got out of china and arguably wasn t containable in china it s close now even italy has finally reversed its curve from upward to downward having had more deaths than the much larger china shortly after a record setting 723 deaths in a singles day the success of italy now sees countries following their tactic law enforcement even england economic contraction will probably not kill too many people in the united states but if the rich countries stop buying from poor countries and stop giving them anything poor people in the poor countries will die i think it ll kill more than you think financial ruin is what a lot of people face when they lose their jobs and businesses then you re talking spikes in alcoholism drug addiction depression divorce suicide not to mention the time it takes for new businesses to start up to replace the ones that failed which means a lag in that 30 unemployment rate dropping back down it s not just a matter of everyone got a vacation for two weeks and then you get plugged back into your job on a shutdown of this scale real damage gets done to a lot of people even in wealthy countries from events like this are we not yet at the stage where reporters start reporting on hospital admissions that is the metric that counts frustratingly very few articles even delve into their local hospitals perhaps that will come but it would seem like now is a good time to prepare the public with baselines so that we can have a realistic grasp on what hospital stats mean yes that would be nice to see right now we only really have the data points from the two extremes how many infected which can mean no symptoms to critical condition and how many die worldometers does have by country data for serious or critical cases which puts the us at 1175 but that statistic has not always been accurate on that site to the point where they removed it from the individual us page because we are told that the real danger here is overwhelming the hospitals that s the reason we are supposedly doing all this social distancing nonsense not to keep people from getting it but to keep them from getting it now part of determining how we restore some sense of sanity to the country is real data from various types of communities in the us about how overall infection rates translate to hospitalizations because if the chicken littles are being honest they should agree that we should actually be targeting an infection rate for each state county community based on symptomatic infection rate population demography hospital capacity and hospitalization rates using the hospital capacity will result in deaths theory we should want this to work through populations as fast as possible but as slow as necessary we don t want zero infections part of determining how we restore some sense of sanity to the country is real data from various types of communities in the us that data is useless beyond the professionals who need and use it you ve labeled social distance as nonsense despite none of the data you also say is necessary for you new york is converting a convention center into a 1 000 bed hospital what s relevant is that trump wanted to reopen all of america thankfully now abandoned when everything is already in short supply and the pace of new infections is still escalating us total infections just doubled in a single day short version when we already have critical shortages of critical care beds masks ventilators even the protective gear needed by our doctor and nurses do we need stats to know that increasing the rate of new infections would severely worsen what is already a near tragedy it is nonsense because even a virus with a 10 fatality rate isn t worth taking the actions we are doing much less this whether a thousand people die or a million it is what it is that s life not too many generations ago they dealt with stuff like this every few years at least and they didn t cry and hide in their houses like bitches why are people so comfortable with being scared and weak i just don t get that it s a disgrace to human civilization and all those that went through so much to get us this far to react like this the simple fact is the vast majority of us and vast vast majority of healthy productive people are going to be just fine the data is necessary to try and bring some rational thought into the discussion rather than shut it all down i m sure nyc hospitals are swamped right now my local hospital there are probably tumbleweeds rolling down the hallways because no one is allowed to use it for anything in preparation for a wave that will probably never come in our small relatively rural area so when our betters say you need to live like rats until we tell you different based on a few worst case scenarios around the world they damn well owe us every stitch of data they have supporting that position so we can make our voices heard and tell them when this needs to end because in case you have forgotten the government works for us ultimately it is our value judgement what is worthwhile and what isn t and any data that better informs that judgement is owed to us here here yes i m in a suburb of a large metropolitan area if you want me to state indoors while watching my multi generational family business collapse as all the family owned businesses i interact with every day also collapse you better have the numbers to back it up not just we think this might happen 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 he s not entirely wrong or irresponsible for wanting to open america because he s look at it from the position of tradeoffs as he said america was never designed to be a place that you just shut down the way we have we do that there are going to be severe consequences many far worse than the virus itself he s pushing people to reopen the country because while the coronavirus is a problem societal collapse is a far bigger problem and that s potentially what we face with a shutdown economy authoritarian states can get away with that because they don t care what happens to their people we can t he s been talked out of re opening america even now says that was the wrong way to go it will start with only the safest of states other states added as they get their curve flattened or reserved whatever fauci s metrics are once that becomes the environment expect to see stricter restrictions in the worst hot spots perhaps enforced by police as the most successful countries are doing it converted italy s worst in the world into a declining curve england was so impressed that they began with law enforcement a list of legal reasons to be away from home with violations a misdemeanor and fine he was saying differently as of yesterday and i don t think he s going to back off of it nor should he the reality is that setting an end date is important because it gives people hope and a target to focus on absent that it s just a crisis with no end in sight before easter gives them a goal to work towards where they can focus on staying afloat that is a huge deal with the economy in the toilet half of gdp gone and facing a 30 unemployment rate the epidemic is bad giving the american people nothing to pin their hopes on in these circumstances is orders of magnitude worse because it will collapse society he was saying differently as of yesterday not at the press conference and i don t think he s going to back off of it nor should he is that a medical judgment or a political one he s already started not just the rollback to saf states only the administration now asks everyone who has left new york recently to self quarantine for 14 days that s a major ramp up of his 15 day plan do you really believe he d then release ny from his current guidelines two weeks later when lately about 40 of all new cases in the country are from people who d recently left new york florida s governor ron desantis now requires mandatory 2 week confinement for air passengers from new york also from nj and ct https www politico com states new jersey story 2020 03 23 florida demands quarantine for air passengers from new york new jersey 1268762 it s over the nationwide re opening political suicide when he s already in so deep nationwide would sharply increase infections and death from again ignoring his top medical professionals it s not even how many infected it s how many confirmed cases we know that the former number is larger than the latter both because this virus results in a lot of people having only mild symptoms or no symptoms and because of limits on the number of tests and we need to be realistic on the latter point south korea leads the world in testing and cumulatively it has tested only about 350k people through march 25 out of a population of just over 50 million https www statista com statistics 1095848 south korea confirmed and suspected coronavirus cases we don t know how many infected we know how many confirmed cases we know that the former number is larger than the latter but we don t know by how much we know that it s 25x more deadly than swine flu on the most accurate metric how many people died after the same number of days for each from the first death 100 accurate covid s first death was less than a month ago so the most recent published result in 16 days covid 75 deaths swine flu 3 for the first few months that could be mostly because covid spreads faster still a sign that we aren t doing nearly enough are we not yet at the stage where reporters start reporting on hospital admissions they re reporting far more relevant info stats are not newsworthy and would sail over most americans heads at the moment what s relevant is that hospitals in hot spots are overwhelmed which tells us why trump s original nationwide re opening has been abandoned total us infections doubled in a single day hot spots have severe shortages of hospital beds masks ventilators even the protective gear needed by doctors and nurses which is far more relevant than stats re opening those areas like new york would sharply increase the rate of new infections and be catastrophic nyc is rushing the conversion of a convention center into a 1 000 bed hospital for most folks i ll suggest that s far more relevant than admissions the consequences of too little hospital capacity especially when the curve is going upward so rapidly in hot spots total us infections doubled in a single day source they certainly didn t yesterday right saturday to sunday they basically doubled but that is an outlier and i assume had more to do with testing and processing than actual new cases saturday was a drop from friday the past few days have been a basically linear increase now 3 4 5 data points don t tell us much either way at this point a big spike today similar numbers tomorrow etc make that linear trend turn exponential pretty quick but it s not fair to say that doubling on a day to day basis is the case right now they probably didn t literally double considering the incubation period heightened awareness increases in testing availability etc it could just be that a bunch of new cases were counted in one day which is separate from actual infection numbers as there are so many asymptomatic infectees so that jump may be an accounting anomaly or not they certainly didn t double we have maybe a week left of what is merely an increase in detection in some states some aren t yet in that mode once we get there we ll likely be able to interpolate the case data from early on in jan feb to now add the relatively known asymptomatic and undetectably mild cases and have an idea of how fast the epidemic is growing from that estimated line would have been better to have done this six weeks ago but it is what it is so we are where we are right i guess i should have said that identified cases only doubled vs infections and yes a large amount what we have seen thus far is directly tied to how many tests have been administered and processed and i m not completely sure when that period will be over and we are actually seeing rates that correlate to new infections although the proportion of tests administered coming back positive might help give an idea as well which in wi has been pretty small 5 3 positive so far new york is doubling every three days over two cycles iirc when governor cuomo announced it i believe that s nyc that s doubling not new york overall which makes sense because you re talking a confined geographic region with very little ability to separate the high risk groups from carriers and it s important to remember as well as under pressure noted that it s a doubling of identified cases not a doubling of actual infections the infections were already there they just realized it as they did more widespread testing thanks by new york i meant the city i should go back to using nyc heavily urban populations with prominent air travel hubs and sea ports will absolutely experience a much more rapid infection rate than almost all other areas wa has the same problem in the seattle area but not the rest of the state but no other such hubs so not valid check la which is far more relevant than seattle and the curve is still nearly vertical which means the rate of increase is still expanding that s why the first priority is flattening the curve are we not yet at the stage where reporters start reporting on hospital admissions that is the metric that counts frustratingly very few articles even delve into their local hospitals i agree 100 with this re data even with hospital admissions there is about an 8 day lag after symptoms start and then another lag to icu and then to fatalities and then another lag to recoveries said two lags then freeing space for hospitals co is providing reasonable data italy is providing excellent data except it s all in that meatball language here s a twitter feed from an er doctor in nyc day before yesterday dr craig spencer it s tough for media though that s the really depressing side of the story at a certain point media is clearly in the way and obstructive and since we are utterly unprepared it s too late to change anything it s like showing a train wreck in slow motion over and over and over whew that can get ugly and depressing the media isn t reporting yet on local hospitals because it would really screw with the narrative hospitals are desolate and staff are being laid off due to states make it illegal to perform elective surgeries in a month or two the hospitals may be overflowing right now some hospitals are close to shutting down what state do you live in you can look at the jhu sick map and see which counties have 20 30 infections or less and which counties are swamped most of american medical facilities are not swamped most of american medical facilities are not swamped has anyone said or implied otherwise indeed many of those states are suspending laws licensing or whatever so their doctors and nurses can go help in other states which is the biggest news story on this the lack of staff in the hotspots also why trump has backed away from a nationwide re opening most counties don t have much more than 1 icu bed or 1 ventilator many none rural areas are also older and sicker so 1 icu patient swamped there is not going to be a 50 mile ambulance ride to the nearby city for treatment nor are many of the more relevant specialists for this and many specialists are going to be useless going to be making their rounds in rural areas for heavily scheduled stuff there will be no scheduled anything in hospitals for a long time and why is it that you conservatives are simply incapable of looking ahead even one week do you drive like this too what state do you live in my guess is confusion elective surgeries are cut back in hospitals that are overwhelmed or close to focus more staff and resources on corvid and it s hospitals which are deferring electives beds are very tight at many i read one story where patients are on mattresses on the floor many in hallways they are only collecting the scariest data and are stopping you from getting your own data at this point i m thinking it s on purpose this economy is not going to nuke itself when the manufactured smoke clears we re going to find the costs of the manufactured crisis far out weighed the costs of the disease i am making 10 000 dollar at home own laptop just do work online 4 to 6 hour proparly so i make my family happy and u can do read more trump is america s broken clock don t ignore the 1338 minutes a day of trump being wildly wrong to cheer for the 2 he is almost right and this is not even one of the times that he is almost right efforts to directly fight the pandemic or to adapt to it if the as is likely becomes endemic are cost saving efforts versus letting it crash rampantly across america maybe in multiple like or worse than the 1918 flu the real cost and a completely wasteful and avoidable one is the idiotic trumpulus package now idiotic efforts i am so glad trump is president over hillary 1 000 001 reasons he is better hillary wouldn t have ignored medical experts for months only now deferring to them actually no other nationally prominent politician would do such a thing how many months were lost because of it s a democrat hoax it will magically go away etc when we have a virus which is 25x more deadly than obama s swine flu such delays allow the pace to escalate far more than it should have more people die needlessly poor hihn sock troll how many months were lost because of it s a democrat hoax it will magically go away name another national level politician who would ignore his own experts on a nationwide re opening only to later reverse back to them again following a meeting that day when we have a virus which is 25x more deadly than obama s swine flu such delays allow the pace to escalate far more than it should have people die needlessly since you were so totally wrong why does it matter who called you out even if i am a sock troll p s attention loveconstitution1789 beep beep beep trump did not announce his 15 day lockdown until march 16th only ten freaking days ago have you been following this at all any of it might that be because he said it was a democrat hoax and would just go away on its own magically and you swallowed it i am so glad trump is president over hillary 1 000 001 reasons he is better tell that to those who died so needlessly and their loved ones because of your psychopathic hatred of lefties party over country over even human life powerful new ad powerful new ad the dc swamp creatures are only concerned with saving their own asses not yours this entire farce has been perpetrated by the extreme left and who in order to destroy capitalism world wide and stop trump from being re elected the leftist dems know they cannot win with any of the shithead candidates they have trotted out in public take your pick destruction by fake panic or destruction by a marxist administration by after the 2020 election we is doomed in any event 1000 we are not doomed otherwise lefties would not be trying this hard they would simply bide their time like they used to do and use incrementalism to add socialist policies bit by bit there is an urgency to their desperation it s almost as if they know that their power is fading not just slowing down but fading imagine such desperation that you propagandize hysteria to destroy the largest economy in the world and many americans take two weeks off and then the economy comes back even stronger than before nothing you do works or destruction by a virus with no political interests it s well proven that lc1789 places party over country above even human life proven by his own words https reason com 2020 03 25 trump is right to worry about the cost of aggressive covid 19 control measures comment 8183344 sad trump is a malignant narcissist all he cares about his how a declining economy will hurt his reelection chances in the fall so you have no real point or anything useful to add to the discussion the ravings of a tds sufferer who will be bitching their heads off when the food rationing starts in the fall if farmers aren t able to do their work today it won t be the people in farm flyover country that will go hungry if the blanket restrictions aren t rationalized it will be you morons in the cities who don t have a clue about how the rest of the world works that will be city people dealing with rationing wow who knew that farmers farm in groups of 10 or more thank you they routinely consider not only the number of deaths they might prevent but the cost of doing so on what planet the standard line is if it saves one life or any life is priceless that s how we got the health care mess we ve ended up with believing that costs vs life don t matter it s also why people are living longer but not necessarily better we ve extended the length of life but not the quality no one wants to admit other than insurance actuaries that every life has a price i feel that the season probably controls the severity of this covid 19 virus and that this warming trend shall only improve conditions for human life in short order c 60 days speculation the virus may soon fizzle out with these protective measures under continued application social distancing quarantine procedures voluntary delay of congregation basis warming weather means the virus must bend to circumstances that may be contrary to its origin bats also hibernate at point where they had to clear batangas s own taal doubtless resulting in one majorly expensive hangover since they would had been sleeping for about three months more had taal not erupted until spring begins its severity may well had been a matter of surprise and chill the unforseen unexpected china shares being in the northern hemisphere their winter is our winter the virus appears to had been spawned by eating of migratory bats and contact therewith that emigrated en masse due to loss of their home sheltered in volcanic cone and previously empty lava vents of the philippines these bats brought their hard won transition with them in every biological manner only to be devoured by capital opportunity there in the land of all out communism b medical science rather hasn t explained covid 19 performance in warm weather conditions except to suggest that warming weather won t be of any benefit to the virus what were going on at this very moment were the very example of qualitative vigilant response if the 2 trillion can be refunded partly if necessary then i think the article suggests the figures of rational conclusion the latest possible epicenter just had a mass of new infections new orleans warm and humid quite true not warm dry but wet mushy wonder why they have to bury bodies in upright cases there above ground 81 said the country should continue social distancing initiatives including shelter at home orders despite the impact to the economy reuters the march 26 27 opinion poll released friday also showed that the public is much more likely to heed the advice of doctors and local government officials than president donald trump the president took a hardline approach earlier this month when he urged people to gather only in small groups later he appeared to change course telling reporters that he would like businesses to reopen by easter on april 12 the poll showed that most americans do not want that eighty one percent said the country should continue social distancing initiatives including shelter at home orders despite the impact to the

republicans 66 said they would follow the instructions of medical doctors 64 said they would follow the advice of the cdc 51 said they would follow the advice from their state s governor 46 would follow healthcare directions from local police only 31 are very likely to follow president trump s recommendations and advice safe to ignore the raging deniers here eh trump has now boxed himself into
