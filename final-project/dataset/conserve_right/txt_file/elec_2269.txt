national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions culturally elizabeth warren is a lot more like donald trump than you might think hold on i know going by their personal lives their demeanors and their ideological agendas they re apples and oranges but apples and oranges actually have a lot in common they re both fruits they re round and they grow on trees the most relevant difference boils down to a matter of taste and that s what i am getting at one of the best things about partisanship is how it sharpens our skepticism about the other side when trump gives a speech liberals are like contestants on jeopardy eager to hit the buzzer the moment they hear anything that pings their radar for hypocrisy deceit hyperbole etc but the downside of partisanship is that it blinds us to the fakery of our own side when the same liberals listen to someone like warren the buzzer gathers dust in the 2000s for instance saturday night live rarely let a week go by without skewering george w bush when barack obama was president snl ignored him almost entirely save as an excuse to mock the people who didn t like him if i had to describe obama as a comedy project i would say it s like being a rock climber looking up at a thousand foot high face of solid obsidian polished and oiled jim downey the snl go to guy for political humor once said there s not a single thing to grab onto certainly not a flaw or hook that you can caricature bush then like trump now was an easy target for snl writers and for writers at elite media outlets generally warren however is the opposite which might explain why snl s most recent cold open was nearly a campaign ad for warren jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist

america great again does with his and it s remarkably similar to trump s i alone can fix it it tickles the intellectual erogenous zones of a certain type of progressive wildly overrepresented in the upper echelons of the meritocracy it screams we have all the answers and we know what to do technocratic liberalism isn t just an ideological worldview dating back to walter lippmann s 1914 drift and mastery it s a cultural orientation if you can t see it it s probably because you re part of it fish don t know they re wet after all the media loves to point out the craziness and impossibility of many of trump s promises he said fixing health care would be so easy he vowed to eliminate the deficit in eight years it s up nearly 50 percent since he took office he was going to ban muslims and make mexico pay for the wall whether his supporters believed him or not they liked what these promises said about his priorities don t take him literally we were advised just take him seriously warren has played precisely the same game promising a slew of absurdities from an illegal fracking ban to an unconstitutional wealth tax to a dead on arrival green new deal the problem for warren is that you can t say don t take her literally the whole appeal of her shtick and it is a shtick even if she believes it is that she does her homework she s no reality tv star making it up as she goes she has a plan because she has to stay on brand warren felt compelled to explain how she d implement single payer health care without raising taxes on the middle class it s a disaster she d nationalize health care eliminating private insurance plans sorry union voters and cutting funding to hospitals she d genie blink comprehensive immigration reform into existence the total cost 52 trillion over a decade including 20 trillion in new federal spending all to pretend she wouldn t raise taxes on the middle class she would she just hides it now our best health policy wonks are weighing in it s an interesting discussion but it has as much bearing on real life as a debate among leading military strategists over the best way for the klingons to finally conquer the romulan empire but let s say using a lot of policy jargon and accounting gimmickry wins warren the nomination and the presidency what then it s axiomatic that she will fail to achieve what cannot be achieved will she admit that she overpromised or will the apple lady follow the playbook of the orange man and blame a rigged system and shadowy evil actors working to deny us our heart s desires the latter is likely given that such rhetoric is another thing she has in common with trump 2019 tribune content agency llc get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020
