much to do wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the nation aposs capital seems headed for a major logjam this week as president trump tries to put points on the board before he reaches 100 days in office next saturday the president is talking about getting a bill through the house to repeal and replace obamacare and he says he will unveil a plan for massive tax cuts but lawmakers returning from a two week break face a more urgent deadline keeping the government open in a moment we ll speak with white house budget director mick mulvaney but first let aposs bring in kristin fisher at the white house with a look at the presidents look for a big win ahead of that symbolic 100 day mark kristin kristin fisher fox news correspondent chris there aposs really only two paths for president trump to score a big legislative win before his first 100 days are up he can either get funding for his border wall included in the spending bill or he can convince house republicans to vote on the revised plan to replace obamacare the problem is democrats say funding for the border wall is a deal breaker and house speaker paul ryan says he doesn apost have the votes or the time to pass health care reform by friday in a conference call with house republicans yesterday speaker ryan said his top priority this week is avoiding a government shutdown negotiations now hinge on if president trump will insist that the spending bill include 1 billion down payment on a border wall when asked on friday if you would sign the bill without it president trump said i don apost know yet people want the border wall my base definitely wants the border wall but his homeland security secretary who toured the border last week told cnn this morning that he believes the president will not sign a bill that doesn apost include funding for his most famous campaign promise begin video clip john kelly secretary of homeland security it goes without saying that the president has been pretty straightforward about his desire and the need for a border wall so i would suspect he will do the right thing for sure i suspect he will be insistent on the funding end video clip fisher and president trump is now adding tax reform to next week s to do list treasury officials are racing to finalize his plans for massive tax cuts in time for wednesday aposs announcement a deadline that is self imposed by president trump chris wallace kristin fisher reporting from the white house kristin thanks for that now let aposs bring in the director of the office of management and budget mick mulvaney welcome to fox news sunday mick mulvaney director office of management and budget thanks and good morning wallace president trump has talked about a number of items that he would like to see in this government funding bill which are so important that he aposs willing to see the government shutdown if he doesn apost get them mulvaney i don apost think anybody is trying to get to a shutdown shutdown is not a desired end it s not a tool it aposs not something that we want to have we want our priorities funded and one of the biggest priorities during the campaign was border security keeping americans safe and part of that was a border wall and we don apost understand why the democrats are so wholeheartedly against it they voted for it in 2006 then senator obama voted for it senator schumer voted for senator clinton voted for it so i don apost understand why democrats apply in politics just because donald trump is in office wallace i want to ask you a direct question sir mulvaney sure wallace will he sign a government funding bill that does not include funding for the border wall mulvaney yes and i think you saw his answer in your lead in which is we don apost know yet we are asking for our priorities and importantly we are offering to give democrats some of their priorities as well they made it very clear that they want these cost sharing reduction payments as part of obamacare we don apost like those very much but we have offered to open the discussions to give the democrats something they want in order to get something we want wallace ok well let me pick up on that because on friday you did offer democrats a trade funding for the border wall in return for continuing subsidies the subsidies that already exist continuing subsidies to insurance companies to help pay for lower income people who get health insurance here you are begin video clip mulvaney we d offer them 1 of csr payments for 1 of wall payments right now that aposs the offer we ve given to our democratic colleagues end video clip wallace democrats say that is a nonstarter and what you are in effect doing with that trade is that you are holding hostage health insurance for millions of lower income americans mulvaney actually what i would say is that they are holding hostage national security again something they aposve supported in the recent past when president obama was in the senate so we don apost understand why this is breaking down like this and we are worried chris that this is sending a message that this is going to be the next four years that neil gorsuch was not just a one off thing the democrats will oppose everything this president wants to do which is stunning to us especially when we are offering them something they want in return wallace but some people wonder director how much leverage do you have i mean if what you re saying is give us what we want and if you don apost we re going to cut off funding that would provide health insurance for millions of lower income americans are you are you willing to take that political hit mulvaney we are trying to get a border wall to protect millions of low income americans against folks who aren apost supposed to be here so it s a national security crosstalk wallace but are you willing to cut off the funding mulvaney we are willing to talk about the things that we want and things that they want that aposs how washington is supposed to work and used to work on up until the recent past wallace your agency has told federal departments as you have to do the office of management and budget has told the government to prepare for a shutdown you have to get ready for it what would stop what services that all of us have would end if we have a shutdown next saturday mulvaney it aposs hypothetical again you re right we have to have that phone call on friday it aposs the law even if we believe that appropriations and spending will be passed next seven days but you aposve seen these things before what they re called nonessential services would shut down all the essential services would continue social security checks would still go out medicare payments would still be funded wallace but what mulvaney government national defense would still take place but again no one i don apost think anybody foresees or expects or wants a shutdown next week wallace but you are holding open i don apost want to press it too hard but you were holding up on the possibility if you don t get funding for the border wall i mean i don apost understand mulvaney yes wallace the president is saying look this is as you say this is where we re going to set the marker for the next four years can he backed down on the border wall given the fact that you have set this up mulvaney sure let me put it to you this way i aposd like you and i met you a couple times i m not going to negotiate with you on national television on sunday we ll negotiate with the democrats and the negotiations are not finished yet we think we aposve given them a reasonable set of choices things that they want in exchange for what we want that aposs how it aposs supposed to work and for some reason we think this democratic obstruction is not working wallace let aposs talk about the president aposs 100th date which coincidentally would also happen on saturday the day you might get a shutdown on friday the president tweeted this no matter how much i accomplished during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days and there has been a lot including supreme court media will kill but it s mr trump who has been talking since the transition about the 100 day marker here is just a sample begin video clips trump today i would like to provide the american people with an update on the white house transition and our policy plans for the first 100 days now i got it done in the first 100 days that s even nice i don apost think that there is a presidential period of time in the first 100 days where anybody s done nearly what we aposve been able to do end video clips wallace is that why the president is in such a rush to get the obamacare repeal and replace we will talk about that in a moment past this week to unveil his big tax cut because he wants to have more to show for his first 100 days mulvaney you look at that week what it says is regardless of what we would do it would still be downplayed by the media some media not all i think he s right about that what i think folks don apost realize is that we ve signed more legislation into law in the first 100 days than anybody in the last 50 years we put up more executive orders than any previous administration in the last 50 years and importantly these are not creating laws most of these are laws regulations getting rid of other laws regulations getting rid of other regulations we re reducing the role of government in your life during the first 100 days and we are doing so on truly historic basis you add justice gorsuch no president has ever had a supreme court justice confirmed in 100 days we re talking about historic accomplishments by this administration in the first 100 days but all anybody wants to talk about is health care wallace well i m going to talk about something other than health care because the president shocked most of washington on friday when he is going to unveil his tax plan on wednesday take a look begin video clip trump we ll be having a big announcement on wednesday having to do with tax reform the process has begun long ago but it really formally begins on wednesday so go to it end video clip wallace i m trying to get more of the sense of this will be announced the size of the tax cut will he announce whether or not he aposs going to play for it or how he will pay for it will it be revenue neutral or will it add to the debt mulvaney i think what you re going to see on wednesday is some specific governing principles some guidance also some indication of what the rates are going to be i don apost think you re going to see something and i don t think anybody expects us to rollout bill language on wednesday in fact we don apost want to do that so what you re going to see on wednesday is for the first time is here s what our principles are here are some of the ideas that we like some of the ideas we don apost like and we can talk about that more if you want to here are some of the rates we re talking about crosstalk wallace so he s going to say whether or not it s going to be revenue neutral or whether it s going to add to the debt mulvaney i don t think we ve decided that part yet keep in mind we have it s a balancing act in that chris you can either have a small tax cut that s permanent or a large tax cut that is short term i don apost think we decided that but you ll know more on wednesday wallace and you said the other day you don apost think you aposll see a real plan specifics meet on the bone until june mulvaney i think that s still probably fair again we want to start working and have already started working with the committee aposs in the house and the senate as we try and build some momentum for this tax plan wallace let aposs turn to repeal and replace health care you say the thing that everybody wants to talk about mulvaney yes wallace all you have is this one piece of paper it is an outline there is no legislation there is no legislative language yet in terms of what this new 2 0 health care will be there s not congressional budget office score of what it will cost or how it will affect whether more or fewer people will have health insurance house speaker ryan had a conference call with members yesterday and he said look our top our sole priority this week to keep the government funded health care is going to have to wait are you ok with that mulvaney a couple of different things we ve got a lot more than just that piece of paper there is bill language in fact we know i believe that the senate budget committee which is helping us write this language delivered some language to the house last night detailed and keep in mind these are all tweaks to the bill that was taken up about four discussed four weeks ago which it does in exist in bill form and was scored by the cbo so i don apost think it aposs entirely fair to say that all we have is that piece of paper regarding whether or not it gets done this week i think what you saw mr ryan say is if they have the votes this week they ll vote this week and that s what we expect wallace yes but the flip side of it is he said look our top priority is getting the government funded and he really didn apost talk in any length at all about health care it sounded very much like he aposs going to let that slip into the following week or later mulvaney well and we ve also heard rumors of the house and senate might stay until saturday which would be great and allow things to get done this week we don apost think there aposs any structural reason that the house and the senate cannot do both things in a week if we can have an agreement by the end of the day on keeping the government open that can be done this week and if the house at least can get its folks its ducks in a row to vote this week on health care they can do that as well wallace you say get an agreement on keeping the government funded today why are they mulvaney negotiations going on as we sit here and speak wallace and is there some reason to think that this question of health care funding and return for the border wall mulvaney that offer has been on the table for a couple of weeks we understand that the house democrat leadership now wants to get involved which is fine that aposs part of the government as well they were looking at some of the proposals last night so just because you and i are sitting here on i sat in the office all day saturday and did this so the negotiations are ongoing and there s no reason we can t have an agreement there as early as today wallace finally tens of thousands of people held a march for science in cities across the country you can see the crowds were really quite striking and one of the things they are protesting our big budget cuts that the president is proposing the administration wants a 20 percent cut almost 6 billion for the national institutes of health a 31 percent cut for the environmental protection agency question can you guarantee those folks those tens of thousands of people who were marching that those cuts will have no effect on medical research or on protection of the air and water we have mulvaney yes the air that you breathe and the air that my triplets will breathe and my kids drink is going to be just as clean even with those reductions when we looked at those we targeted those agencies amongst others for things of duplication of process things that the government mission creep for example the epa is doing stuff that it aposs not supposed to do what we d make sure is the epa will have enough money to perform its core function wallace and you re saying and you are saying that the 6 billion that you aposre taking out of nih or want to take out of the nih that s going to have no impact on medical research mulvaney it will certainly have some impact on medical researchers but we don apost think it will materially impact the quality of research that s coming out wallace and if they say or people environmentalists say you aposre wrong mulvaney my guess is a lot of people are going to say we are wrong but step back and talk about we did on the project we reprioritize and what we said is that defending the nation including securing the southern border is the primary function of this government it should be a priority of this government under this administration and funding for the national institute of health needs to take a backseat for that wallace finally i m going to give you 30 seconds to call out your one of your kids did something great last yesterday you aposve missed it because you re working so what was it mulvaney and it broke my heart my 17 year old son james had a walk off grand slam home run last night to win his baseball game at indian land south carolina pretty proud dad and thanks for letting me say something about it wallace director thank you mulvaney thank you wallace thanks very much for talking to us we ll try to keep up with everything you aposre doing this week it s going to be busy coming up a growing list of gop lawmakers are putting some distance between themselves and president trump we ll republican senator james lankford why he aposs adding his name to that list commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway at oklahoma city where they marked 22 years since the bombing of the alfred p murrah federal building republican lawmakers are facing tough crowds at town halls back home during their two week recess and some have distanced themselves from president trump joining us now from oklahoma city senator james lankford who this week called on the president to release his tax returns senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen james lankford r oklahoma glad to be with you chris wallace let aposs start big picture you were not a fan of this president during the campaign although you did support him how do you think he aposs done in his first 100 days lankford he s tried to lay out a lot of his agenda and tried to be able to get as much as he can legislatively i heard mick mulvaney earlier talk about the regulatory issues we ve actually done more congressional review acts than any other time any presidency in that we aposve done about 15 of those there was one total over the decades in the past and getting neil gorsuch on board in the supreme court is incredibly significant obviously there are some fumbles out of the gate with trying to deal with the executive order on immigration and trying to get the language right and pulling it back and trying to go back again some of those things and some other statements they aposre getting their feet on the ground i think personally the biggest issue that got us to get their staff together there still a lot of undersecretary they re going to be able to nominate and be able to put in place so we can get those finished up and getting the team together wallace you made some news this week after the white house really basically made it clear the president doesn apost intend to ever release his tax returns take a look at that begin video clip jonathan karl abc news is it time to say once and for all the president is never going to release his tax returns sean spicer white house press secretary we ll have to get back to you on that end video clip wallace you said the president should keep his promise and release his returns why does that matter especially at a time as beginning this week you the government is going to begin to consider tax reform lankford right i just don apost have an issue with anyone in the campaign time saying yes i m going to do it i promise to do that will take care of that will go through an audit to then say the american people expect you to fulfill your word and to be able to do that i don apost see that as an issue now the president has legally done everything he aposs required to do with the financial disclosures and i do not in any way think that congress should in any way think the congress should step in and compel that with some piece of legislation i just think the president should be able to keep his word and be able to move on this will be a distraction through his presidency all the way through that he can settle it wallace you think it aposs important that he do it if you re going to talk about changing loopholes deductions lowering rates that people see how that would affect the president lankford no i really don apost i think the bigger issue is he said he was going to do it during the campaign time period he has the power to be able to do that and he should go ahead and follow through on that it s nothing more than trying to be able to say follow through in what you said you were going to do and so the american people can just move on wallace you were also skeptical this week about the obamacare repeal and replace bill that the president and house republicans are trying to push through the house this week here you are at a town hall meeting in broken arrow oklahoma this week begin vide clip lankford the bill they put out initially the part of the reason it failed is they cover twice as many people with half as much dollars so people on the lower end did not have enough subsidies to be able to cover them anymore that aposs a problem end video clip wallace senator what s your concern with what is being discussed now and what do you think about this push and director mulvaney didn apost back off it today to try to get this to the house this week before the first 100 days lankford no i think it aposs a terrific idea to get it through the house during the first 100 days if that aposs possible to be able to get finish we can move it over to the senate we can take a look at it and try to get it done and then get it to the president aposs desk that would be terrific my biggest issue of several issue as of several issues is how do we deal with the cost increases for those folks that are right now 400 percent of property and up they have dramatic cost increases in my state in oklahoma on the individual markets the rates went up last year 76 percent for those individuals in the individual market in addition to that we have one insurance carrier in the state so president obama aposs promise of an exchange that brought competition has obviously failed and trying to bring rates down has failed dramatically in my state so we ve got to be able to deal with the cost aspects and we would also have got to deal with the safety net when the original house plan came out it expanded the subsidies from 400 percent of poverty to 850 percent of poverty but cut down the amount significantly so basically people at 800 percent of poverty that have no subsidies now would get new subsidies but those folks on the lower end would get much less that aposs not reasonable to me to say if we re going to have it let aposs keep it at the same amount that the affordable care act had and by all means let aposs not double the amount of subsidies that are going to the number of people that are out there let aposs keep it to where it was at least at that spot to be able to fulfill that promise that those that are on it now and have coverage now would still continue to have that protection days ahead but not expanded wallace given your concern about the safety net what aposs your reaction to director mulvaney that the administration using as a bargaining chip these cost saving reductions the idea that subsidies that help get insurance coverage for the lower income people lankford so they re in the process of budget negotiations obviously they are trying to put everything out there they want to be able to put out in the white house it aposs part of the give and the take of the entire budget process my biggest frustration chris is that right at this point again period we aposve since the budget act was passed in 1974 there s been four times since 1974 we ve actually gotten it done correctly and on time as the law was written now as you know well there aposs no president aposs budget that s ever been signed into law so the things that the president aposs budget out there become the baseline for the argument but they don t actually become law but we have a real issue in the process of budgeting and how we do it we are never going to get another product until we fix the process there aposs a group of us in the senate that have been pushing hard to change the way we do budgeting so we can actually get this done right and not have these cliffs all the time wallace let aposs talk about what seems to be a greater willingness among some republicans in congress yourself included to criticize this president there are a dozen of you who have said the president should keep his promise and release his tax returns there are some republican senators and congressmen in border states who are really questioning whether or not you need a full border wall and i want to play for you senator joni ernst in a town hall meeting this week in iowa here she is begin video clip sen joni ernst r iowa with the trip to florida i do wish that would spend more time in washington d c that aposs what we have the white house for end video clip wallace senator what aposs going on with this increased willingness of republican members of congress including yourself to criticize this president lankford i think quite frankly it s what republican said we will do a few years ago when people challenge us and said if you had someone in the white house of your own party would you hold them into account the same way that you aposre holding president obama account you aposre finding out that aposs actually true that republicans are consistent to go both ways in this now listen in the town hall meetings that i ve had in the last two weeks and i ve had 16 of them in the town hall meetings that i ve had in the last weeks i ve heard some of the same arguments just with an opposite now people are saying they demand to see trump aposs tax returns three years ago these people were saying they demand to see president obama s birth certificate three years ago people are saying president obama s traveling all the time playing golf and he s played more golf than any president in history now i have progressive constituents saying that president trump is out there traveling and how much are his costs on it so the same type of arguments are coming up back and forth but i think what you aposre finding is republicans are being consistent they are playing it straight to say if there aposs an issue let aposs raise the issue regardless of who s in the white house and be able to help solve the issues that we got so i don apost see that is inconsistent for us wallace there are new polls out today particularly one in the washington post that show that this president at this point in 100 days in has the lowest approval rating of any post war president when you combine that with a very tightly contested special elections in red states like kansas and georgia yes the republicans well they won in kansas and in georgia there s going to be a runoff do you worry at all about the 2018 midterms and republican prospects lankford i think it aposs very early to worry about the 2018 prospects i think there s a long way to go i do think we ll get health care done in the next couple of months we have to again with the rates going up so dramatically we ve got to be able to deal with that i do think we ll get tax reform done i do think we ll deal with budget issues we have to deal with half a trillion dollars of overspending just this year you start to actually get a lot of these things done i think the american people can say it aposs messy it aposs noisy the language wasn apost always artful in the process the tweets at 1 00 a m aren t always my favorite but we are actually getting things done we are making progress the american people were extremely frustrated i think the international community was frustrated that the previous and administration was seemed to be sitting still and seemed at the gridlocked not getting anything done if we can prove we can get things done i think the american people will say great at least we aposre getting things done and we re moving wallace a couple of questions i m going to ask you to put on your other hat as a member of the senate intelligence committee as you know an american citizen was taken prisoner today in pyongyang in north korea and coincidentally you had been talking to the administration about trying to set up a new policy for how to deal with americans who were detained by the north koreans any suggestions as to what they should do lankford i have actually that is our third american that s currently being held by the north koreans right now so it aposs not just an issue about how do we deal with the issue of north koreans but trying to get a policy in place for all people that are either prisoners of conscience or just americans period we don apost have a clear policy across the entire federal government about how we handle america prisoners what the process will be on the ground region to region so it aposs kind of an ad hoc process as we go through it i do think we need a clear policy and that we need to put up again the clear statement from america that it seemed to be president obama took down that we wouldn apost negotiate for people that were being held prisoner by another country especially a state sponsored of terrorism so we ve got to be able to have those guidelines back out there again and again north korea again for no reason is holding another american trying to have some sort of bargaining chip and they show what an irrational international player they really are wallace finally and i got less than one minute left as a member of the senate intelligence are we any closer to getting an answer on whether there was any collusion between russia and the trump campaign on election and whether or not there was any improper surveillance by the obama administration of mr trump and his associates lankford chris we are closer every day on that we go through a lot of documents we go through interviews we are going through all the process but we are doing it quiet i heard many people say the senate intelligence committee just started we actually started more than five months ago in this process we aposre just working quiet through things that are like this we are handling sensitive documents and source documents that were not going to get out but we are continuing on that we have multiple meetings and lots of research every single week so yes we are moving closer but we are doing it the right way and we are going to go with the facts go that will be the consistent part of it for us because at the end of it we ve got to put out a report the american people are going to look at and trust wallace senator lankford thank you thanks for joining us this sunday lankford thank you wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss washington aposs traffic jam this week plus what would you like to ask the panel about president trump aposs first 100 days just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up president trump accuses iran of skirting the landmark nuclear deal with world powers begin video clip trump iran has not lived up to the spirit of the agreement and they have to do that end video clip wallace will ask our sunday panel about the administration aposs soft tone on foreign policy coming up on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip trump we aposll see what happens no particular rush but we aposll will see what happens but health care is coming along well government is coming along really well a lot of good things are happening thank you folks crosstalk unidentified reporter you re going to get a health care vote next week trump don t know it doesn apost matter if it aposs next week next week doesn apost matter end video clip wallace president trump on friday denying he aposs trying to jam through legislation before the symbolic 100 day mark which he aposll reach next saturday and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove charles lane at the washington post peter baker who covers the white house for the new york times and from the wall street journal kimberley strassel karl how much emphasis did bush 43 and all of you put on racking up victories in your first 100 days and how do you think president trump has done in his first 100 days karl rove former bush white house advisor we put very little effort into it i mean this is a completely phony measure it aposs derived from franklin delano roosevelt wallace right rove he he was inaugurated six weeks later on march 4th he had 60 members of the senate 35 republicans versus him he had 322 democrats to 109 republicans and the country was in the middle of a depression crosstalk wallace i want to point out you did not know i was going to ask that question rove yes well look it is not this is completely phony and i agree with the president it aposs ridiculous having said that we re at 100 days and we aposre going to have to measure and he aposs got a number of successes cabinet supreme court nomination you heard it from lankford 13 congressional regulatory act bill signed two more on the way of him veterans apos choice bill getting limited choice to veterans in getting their health care his actions on jobs for carrier and ford twenty four executive orders some pretty good meetings with foreign leaders but look some big some big setbacks the executive the travel ban executive order a mess now fixed but a mess obamacare repeal and replace failed to get it done and that aposs difficult to do but pressed it early i think the issue though is expectations the president has dismissed the 100 days but too often he has said well we aposre going to get it done because it aposs easier we aposre going to get it done because it aposs quick or it aposs going to happen now and this town doesn apost work that way you may be able to cut a real estate deal that way but you can apost govern the country that way wallace we ask you for questions for the panel and on the issue of the president aposs first 100 days glenn english sent this on facebook why is the republican congress still one of his president trump aposs biggest obstacles when they currently the majority peter how do you answer glenn and why hasn apost the president been able to do a better job of keeping his own troops on capitol hill and why peter baker the new york times well there are two things first of all just because you control congress doesn apost necessarily mean it aposs going to be easy look at president obama aposs first year when he did health care it took him a full year and he had an even stronger majority than president trump in the senate for instance secondly this is a player who isn apost really a republican standard bearer you know he is in some ways a first independent president we aposve had in the sense that he sometimes fight with his own party as much as he does with the other party so he doesn apost have that base of long standing support and allies and credibility among his own they are more willing to fight among themselves and with him as you just showed with your interview with senator lankford then he might want and he hasn apost necessarily worked to cultivate that so i think basically that doesn apost mean he aposs not going to get there it aposs only 100 days most big legislation if you look at presidents in the 50 or 60 years it didn apost happen in the first 100 and i think the first 100 days was not necessarily a good measure of what a presidency would turn out to be if you look at george w bus aposs first 100 days that would not have been a measure of what his presidency would be over eight years you wouldn apost have understood what would become the most important elements so i think it is sort of a ridiculous standard but it is one that he set he himself repeated as you showed on your clips used the 100 day marker until he got close to it and obviously felt a little annoyed by it wallace kim let aposs talk about the logjams that aposs coming up this week first of all government funding that has to get done or we have a shutdown next saturday you aposve heard mick mulvaney they are continuing to push to try to get something done on obamacare repeal and replace and now suddenly kind of a shock they aposve announced that he aposs going to have at least some outline of his principles on tax reform is this all about trying to put something for us to talk about the first 100 days and how do you think it aposs going to shake out kimberley strassel the wall street journal no i think the important thing here is the 100 day mark doesn apost matter but there are other deadlines that do matter all the way back in the fault they came up with a budget revolution that was going to expire at the end of april they have to get that done they aposve also decided to do health care if they get it done through this budget reconciliation process they passed that reconciliation that aposs going to inspire soon the authority to do it under that so they aposve got to hit these deadlines look i think one thing that people don apost realize is we aposre witnessing a return to the way politics used to be done we are so used to eight years and having a president that said i aposm going to issue a regulation and it will just happen that way and now you aposve got all these republicans it aposs a very diverse coalition they aposre negotiating they aposre going back and forth and you know you member it makes me think of the 1986 reagan tax reform people said that that bill was dead about 12 times until it wasn apost dead and it got passed so there aposs going to be a lot it can be a slow process and times but this is how you get bills and they get better along the way and you get to consensus wallace for all of you out there who are getting really tired of our talking about the 100 days i want to point out that candidate trump during the campaign issued a contract with the american voters let aposs put it up on the screen and in this he talked about all of the things he said he was going to get done in the first 100 days some of it he has done more of it he hasn apost chuck how do you how do you score what the president has done so far and what still needs to be done for that charles lane the washington post well you know to kim aposs point this is a guy who very often used the word quickly remember that in the campaign how he would say this or that is going to get done and it aposs going to get done quickly we aposre going to defeat isis quickly we aposre going to fix health care quickly he presented himself as somebody who had these extraordinary capabilities to transcend all this normal politics that has now come to bear so to the extent that people are judging them harshly on the first 100 days i would say it aposs the expectation that he himself created i just want to emphasize one point that we aposve gone over a little bit here which is a real problem in these 100 days which is staffing up this administration they are way behind on that job they do not have the political appointees confirmed not even very many of them nominated i think we were talking before this only about 10 percent have even been rove 95 out of 970 lane have even been nominated and you know he can apost get anything done to the extent he wants to get it done unless he has the personnel in place to do it wallace i aposve got less than a minute left in this segment karl i want to ask if you have 10 minutes but you aposve got to summarize it for less than a minute 10 minutes in the oval office with the president what was your advice be for him for the next 100 days rove lower the expectation stop saying as chuck said quickly and easily second of all stop tweeting i was in front of a group this week 90 percent of whom voted for trump i was asked a similar question what you think he should do differently i said stop tweeting the entire crowd began spontaneously started to apply they want him to be president and they want to be successful third put small process in there you need to have one of the reasons they aposre behind on appointments there is no organized process that regularly shows up in that office where they say mr president we agreed that we would come to you today with these recommendations and we got them ready so the policy and personnel he needs more process wallace all right we have to take a break here up next president trump puts north korea and now iran on notice we will discuss a big change in foreign policy from this president when we come right back commercial break begin video clip mike pence vice president of the united states the united states of america will always seek peace but under president trump the shield stands guard and the sword stands ready end video clip wallace vice president mike pence on his tour through asia issuing another stern warning to north korea about his weapons program and we aposre back now with the panel kim how do you assess the president aposs foreign policy foreign policy so far especially when it comes to north korea strassel yes i mean i think we aposve learned two things there was a lot of fear when he was out on the trail that he aposs an isolationist president absolutely not and in fact what we aposre seeing is a president who rejects the obama philosophy that this is a paradigm in which you either have to go in and put troops on the ground and that aposs the only way to deal with a hot spot versus we do nothing so this is a president again you know take out a syrian air base drop a giant bomb in afghanistan and engage with a lot of diplomacy in sticks and carrots so that aposs one thing that we aposve learned is that he aposs going to take action the other one i think is if there aposs any sort of a trump doctrine and it would be a stretch to go that far but this is a transactional president much in the same way he does things domestically he wants to make a deal you see this is how he is working in the global sphere as well too linking priorities of countries with national security so we saw that with china saying well maybe i won apost name you a currency manipulator if you do something about north korea and i think that aposs how we re going to see him go moving forward wallace there was also an interesting developer this week when it came to iran the state department had to certify that iran is complying with the nuclear deal but then there was a lot of tough talk from top administration officials indicating they re going to take a tougher line on iran here they are begin video clip rex tillerson secretary of state it is another example of buying off a power who has nuclear ambitions we buy them off for a short period of time and then someone has to deal with it later mattis everywhere you look if there aposs trouble in the region you find iran end video clip wallace peter is that just rhetoric or do your sources indicate to you the president really intends to crack down take sanctions against iran outside of the nuclear deal for things like their support from terror baker yes i think first of all it aposs interesting why did they do that this week because of the fact as you mentioned the deadline for certifying whether or not iran was in compliance with the deal they have no evidence at this point to suggest that they aposre not even though obviously everybody is suspicious and so they had to make that certification they didn apost want that to be the message they didn apost want the message the headline to be you know trump says iran is doing fine so they had to come out and say look we understand iran is doing terrible things when it comes to terrorism coming and destabilizing the region when it comes to its missile program and we re going to take action i don apost think there aposs anything imminent that you can look at but they re going to look at sanctions they aposre going to look at other ways of trying to you know hem in or contain iran as it will i think part of the goal is in some ways it kind of provoke iran so if the deal goes away it will be iran aposs fault not the united states apos fault so that europeans wouldn apost vault away from you know an american ally wallace meanwhile today in france today they are holding the first round of a presidential election in the wake of that terror attack on the melenchon in paris this week president trump tweeted friday the people of france will not take much more of this it will have a big effect on the presidential election and he aposs made little secret of the fact that he favors marine le pen head of the far right anti immigrant national front party but karl if le pen were to actually win wouldn apost that have a dramatic effect on europe and the european union rove certainly and in fact if three of the candidates win it will have a dramatic effect we have le pen on the far right we have melenchon on the far left both saying out of nato restructure the european union you have three candidates the republican francois fillon saying fillon saying we think we ought to have a better relationship with putin so this is they have a two stage election so we aposre going to have the first round two people will be selected by tomorrow and then on may 7th we aposll have two that are going to run off right now in all of the matchups marine le pen if she gets into the runoff which she aposs likely to do loses to all the other candidates the woman that she is closest to is fillon who aposs plagued by a scandal but there is a populism sweeping through france with more ferocity than it swept through american politics last year wallace charles we should point out that if nobody gets through and it aposs unlikely they get 50 percent of the vote today they have a runoff on may 7th two weeks from now what aposs at stake in this selection in effect why should we care in terms of the impact it aposs going to have on u s and our relationship with the world lake there aposs a lot of reasons to care i mean starting with the fact that a victory for le pen or melenchon would be a real shock to global markets because each of them as people have indicated are very skeptical about the whole euro and the european union it would be a real unsettling of expectations economically but more importantly the entire security architecture of the western world depends on a stable france in alliance with the rest of the european union and as karl pointed out this extraordinary upsurge of populism in such a major country would create all kinds of unpredictable circumstances and you know i think what we are also learning here is that europe has postponed solving its problems a long time now and france is exhibit a of that they have 10 percent unemployment they have chronic terrorism they can apost seem to get their arms around either of those problems year after year after year and finally the political bill is starting to come due for that europe may dodge this bullet in fact i would if i had to bet i aposd say they will this time but it may be they get a second chance after this one it will be their last second chance and everybody in the whole world should be very concerned that that situation becomes unstable wallace so peter if chuck is right and we have to consider that possibility that he is actually right laughter baker it happens yes laughter wallace and it aposs certainly out there why would president trump if this endangers our national security in terms of nato and endangers europe why is president trump in effect supporting le pen baker obviously he doesn apost see it that way he sees her as a you know like minded avatar of populist unhappiness with the system smash the system and if she wins then in his view it aposs a reaffirmation of the political forces that brought him to power remember he aposs feeling very insecure about his election that aposs why you still see them talking a lot about how many electoral votes he won and so forth what he aposs looking there for i think is for some sort of popular expression of disenchantment that will ratify what he aposs doing here wallace well i just want to say i asked to cover the primary from paris but wiser heads prevailed all right panel see you next sunday up next jane goodall on her decades long work with chimpanzees and her continuing mission to save the planet commercial break wallace a look at monterey bay california where the aquarium there held its own march for science with several of its african penguins there aposs an old saying never meet your heroes the thinking is they will invariably disappoint you well i got to meet one of my heroes recently and she was even more impressive than i imagined here aposs a special power player of the week begin videotape dr jane goodall activist and primatologist i aposm away from home about 300 days a year and that aposs you know all over the world wallace jane goodall is 83 now but she is still on a mission raising awareness and money to protect the planet and the animals who live here goodall one of the greatest rewards i have is the number of people around the world who say thank you jane you taught me that because you did it i can do it too wallace on camera why are you still keeping up such a schedule goodall because we humans the most intellectual beings who have ever walked the planet are very bitterly destroying our only home how is that possible wallace voice over it was 1961 goodall then 26 set out for the gumby animal preserve in what is now tanzania she was trying to find the link between man and ape goodall exciting moment when i first saw a chimpanzee eating meat wallace observing chimpanzees in the jungle by herself she discovered a number of links that chimps can show compassion or wage war but most important the way they used twigs to hunt for termites goodall a chimpanzee when he stripped leaves off of ex wife is actually modifying a natural object to suited to a specific purpose wallace on camera why was that such an important discovery goodall because science thought at that time that humans and only humans used and made tools we were defined as man the toolmaker unidentified male read through the possible redefinition of the word man wallace in 1965 national geographic did a film about goodall aposs work that created a sensation goodall it was kind of beauty and the beast i mean the whole thing wasn apost really about the science it was about this young woman going out into the jungle i became the geographic cover girl wallace on camera the fact that you were such a striking girl didn apost hurt either did it goodall it didn apost hurt at all laughter wallace voice over as goodall bonded with a chimpanzee she even learned their language goodall if i aposm greeting you dominant male because males are dominant and i would be wallace and if you are laughing that aposs a laugh goodall yes that as if i aposm being tickled wallace goodall ended her career as a field biologist 30 years ago but she set up the goodall institute to continue research on chimps as well as roots to turn young people and 98 countries into conservation activists and she returns to gumby for a few days twice a year goodall it aposs not really enough but at least i get out into the forest and i need that to reinvigorate my spirit wallace time is something goodall thinks about now goodall i don apost know how long i have i don apost know how far it is to the end but the end that the older you get the nearer you get to that end i aposve still got so much to do wallace when i said thank you this astonishing woman had one more surprise showing me how the chimps would do it goodall i wouldn t have held up my head and he would have patted it like that wallace on camera like that goodall yes wallace and that would be a nice thank you wallace thank you end videotape wallace go
