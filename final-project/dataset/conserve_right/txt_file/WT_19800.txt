apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump was so eager to drop his first veto on congress that within the first 24 hours his campaign sent out three separate fundraising appeals to supporters bragging about the move and asking them to donate to show their support mr trump wasted no time issuing his veto just a day after the senate voted to halt his border emergency declaration the white house even held a rare veto ceremony to give the president a big stage he said congress had the freedom to try to stop him but he had the duty to counter it with the veto he then took his case straight to voters saying the clash over border security and his marquee campaign promise of building a wall along the u s mexico border will define the two parties heading into 2020 top stories

liberals in the senate chose politics i chose you mr trump said in a campaign fundraising email over the weekend touting his official wall defense fund the border wall emergency as a policy is underwater in the polls even the president s favorite pollster rasmussen reports has found 50 percent opposed and just 44 percent in favor of the emergency declaration but mr trump has signaled that he is not worried about the general public in his fundraising appeals he said he asked american patriots the people that matter about the wall and more than 93 percent said they backed his veto that was apparently a reference to a previous trump campaign email soliciting his supporters views the president s veto is not the last word on the matter house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat said her chamber will vote next week to try to overturn the veto democrats have an uphill battle though in the vote to pass the resolution late last month the house didn t come close to mustering the two thirds vote needed to surmount the veto democrats best hope for swaying republicans is to make the issue local by pointing to projects that could be delayed or canceled if their funding is siphoned away for the wall to that end they have been trying to pry loose from the pentagon a list of projects that could be on the delay list senate democrats thought they had an agreement to get the list last week but acting defense secretary patrick m shanahan didn t deliver on his promise on sunday acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney cast doubt on the prospects for such a list i

has chosen to trample all over the constitution we democrats in the senate will never stop defending our country from an overreaching president a number of activist groups have sued asking the courts to rule the emergency declaration either illegal or unconstitutional but attorney general william p barr who was in the oval office for the veto said mr trump is on firm legal footing what you ve done from a legal standpoint is solidly grounded in law he said vice president mike pence said the president was checking off his campaign promise you re keeping your word by vetoing this legislation he told mr trump often a veto is something a president uses reluctantly and signs it out of sight mr trump though reveled in it once it became clear that the senate wouldn t be able to keep enough republicans on board to block the measure veto he said in his first tweet minutes after the senate s vote hosting a veto ceremony is also rare though not unheard of president obama held a ceremony to
