emerged late last year by imposing travel controls and shutting down public events china has suffered about three fourths of the world s 106 000 coronavirus infections and most of its nearly 3 600 deaths there was chaos and confusion in the hours before conte signed the decree as word leaked to the news media about the planned quarantine students at the university of padua in northern italy who had been out at bars on a saturday night saw the rumors on their cellphones and rushed back to their apartments to grab their belongings and head to the train station hundreds of passengers some wearing face masks and rubber gloves crammed onto the last local train leaving padua at 11 30 p m anxious students wrapped scarves around their heads shared sanitizing gel and sat on their suitcases

clear the move echoed china s lockdown of some 60 million people in central hubei province in late january which is now in its sixth week china s harsh travel restrictions came too late to prevent infected people from seeding outbreaks elsewhere but the world health organization has credited the lockdown with slowing the spread of the virus and buying the world time to handle the outbreak with
