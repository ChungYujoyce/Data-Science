apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump said monday that his hard nosed trade negotiations won some concessions from china and not the trade war his critics had predicted scoring what he crowed was another victory for his american first agenda more tough trade bargaining is still to come between the world s two biggest economies but wall street rallied on the rough outlines of a u s china deal sending the dow jones industrial average soaring above 25 000 points for the first time since march the investors were not necessarily reacting to mr trump s rhetoric said randy frederick vice president of trading and derivatives at the schwab center for financial research top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots most investors i talk to know that almost anything trump says will ultimately either not happen or it will happen to a lesser degree so i m not sure they all bought into the idea of the tariffs to begin with he said most realize that is his negotiating method unorthodox perhaps but potentially successful in the long run he acknowledged initial apprehension about tariffs but noted that s p 500 had already rebounded more than 3 percent in the past two weeks without a china breakthrough still mr trump rubbed democrats faces in the promising developments singling out his nemesis senate minority leader charles e schumer of new york i ask senator chuck schumer why didn t president obama the democrats do something about trade with china including theft of intellectual property etc tweeted mr trump they did nothing with that being said chuck i have long agreed on this issue fair trade plus with china will happen the framework announced over the weekend included china agreeing to significantly increase imports of u s goods and services to decrease america s 375 billion trade deficit with china a top demand by mr trump china also agreed in principle to move toward a more level playing field in trade relations and to address the country s theft or forced transfer of intellectual property from american firms doing business in china the u s agreed to possibly ease sanctions on zte corp the second largest manufacturer of phones in chia that could go belly up and put 70 000 employees out of work because of the sanctions in response to a personal request from chinese president xi jinping mr trump ordered a review of the zte case following two days of talks with a chinese delegation in washington treasury secretary steven t mnuchin said the agreement had put on hold a trade war and the threat of tariffs on a 150 billion worth of chinese goods china pulled back from retaliating with tariffs on about 50 billion worth of american goods commerce secretary wilbur ross will have to hammer out the details specifically about increasing exports of agriculture and energy products to china at the next round of talks in beijing if china doesn t live up to the agreed framework mr ross said the u s will pull the trigger on tariffs and trade sanctions known as section 301 of the trade act of 1974 the section 301 is a cocked pistol that s ready to be fired whenever it needs to be fired he said on fox business network s
