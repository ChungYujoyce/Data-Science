lurch that could ruin their chances of retaking the white house rahm emanuel now stepping down after two terms as mayor of chicago knows something about winning elections he was a key white house operative for bill clinton and chief of staff for barack obama it was rahm as chairman of the democratic campaign committee who engineered the party apos s takeover of the house in 2006 and is known for his hardball brand of politics with all the subtlety of his frequent f bombs if mayor emanuel believes the democrats are in danger of self destructing as he argues in a piece for the atlantic his

anti semitic comments and you apos ve got a party with a problem president trump went way overboard in saying the democrats have become an anti jewish party and telling donors that the democrats hate jewish people given that perhaps three quarters of jews vote democratic but he was seizing on an opening at the south by southwest conference alexandria ocasio cortez offered the standard left wing
