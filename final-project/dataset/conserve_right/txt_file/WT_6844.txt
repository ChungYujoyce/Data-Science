touch on the issue lightly without any highlights the guidelines state it is permissible to turn the political incident into an economic incident to a certain degree however ultimately it will be defined as a criminal incident the propaganda organs include official and unofficial news outlets such as the party s people s daily newspaper and all offshoots and the multiple state run television channels of china central television the propaganda order calls for minimizing the total number of protesters who turn out and downplaying the wide popular support in hong kong for the protests a recent protest was estimated by non chinese media to include around 1 7 million people showing that weeks of protests against chinese rule show no signs of abating another propaganda theme has been to overemphasize support for the hong kong government and its police forces which have been turned out in large numbers to suppress the protests china also wants to classify various social groups in distinct categories those not protesting as a silent majority and the protesters as young ignorant and manipulated they are tools used by enemy western forces the guidelines say the propaganda directive also calls for labeling the protesters as terrorists a theme already widely reported in recent weeks by official chinese media media are directed to highlight western flags used in protests

defense intelligence agency this week warned that china s military is seeking to use data and information in future warfare gen ashely speaking at a dia conference in tampa florida said the outlines of china s information warfare are contained in a recent defense white paper published by the chinese government the chinese understand that the ability to leverage data is part of what it means to be a great power the three star general said and information is how china plans to dominate in the future he said that is their strategy to get behind decision advantage decision advantage is the intelligence buzz phrase for providing the best intelligence at the fastest speed to assist war fighters and other leaders the july white paper china s national defense in the new era emphasizes the building of a high tech military through informationization china s word for advanced war fighting techniques war is evolving in form towards informationized warfare and intelligent warfare is on the horizon the paper said china is seeking to implement a new round of technological and industrial revolution for its military that includes the application of cutting edge technologies like artificial intelligence quantum information big data cloud computing and the internet of things there is a prevailing trend to develop long range precision intelligent stealthy or unmanned weaponry and equipment the paper says adding that the chinese military needs to rapidly advance in the area of high technology and information based warfare the goal is to create an intelligent military retired army gen raymond a thomas former commander of the special operations command said the u s military is working to address china s asymmetric military strategy gen thomas said during a security conference in colorado last month that as recently as three years ago u s national policy specifically declared china not an adversary in relatively short time we ve flipped this to china seems pretty adversarial it s been baked into our national security strategy now our national defense strategy he said the united states he added is aggressively competing with china economically and the military is keeping a close watch on china s buildup as well china s strategic initiatives are more coherent than those of the united states they have a very coherent approach to campaign design a futuristic goal and that s probably the cause of most of the anxiety gen thomas said they re moving out very coherently and with two huge advantages resourcing gads of money and a data advantage right now that we can t even imagine they are hoarding data and getting reps on data to a level that is unimaginable even to some of our major companies chinese nuclear firms sanctioned the commerce department s bureau of industry and security has imposed sanctions on four chinese nuclear companies for diverting american technology to beijing s nuclear buildup the legal notice suggests that u s origin nuclear reactor technology and material have been used to build up chinese nuclear forces which are part of a major rapid expansion the bureau stated in a federal register notice aug 14 that the four nuclear entities were added to the blacklist of foreign companies that must first obtain an export license before acquiring u s goods and that the license requirement will be based on a presumption of denial the notice said the companies pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the united states the companies were the china general nuclear power group china general nuclear power corp cgnpc china nuclear power technology research institute co ltd and suzhou nuclear power research institute co ltd the four firms were engaged in or enabled efforts to acquire u s nuclear technology and material for diversion to military uses in china in 2017 an american born in taiwan szuhsiung ho was sentenced to two years in prison for his role in setting up a group of american nuclear experts who helped china develop nuclear materials court papers in the case identified the cgnpc beijing s largest nuclear

floating nuclear power reactors in the disputed south china sea china has built some 3 200 acres of islands and last year deployed anti aircraft and anti ship missiles on the islands along with electronic jamming gear the crackdown on chinese nuclear firms is in sharp contrast to obama administration policies that sought to facilitate deals between u s nuclear power companies and chinese firms during the obama administration secretary of state hillary clinton backed a bid by general electric to export nuclear technology to china in exchange for promises that china would not steal or transfer the technology under the terms of a 2003 agreement on nuclear technology cooperation china agreed not to divert u s know how a hong kong company corad technology ltd was also sanctioned for
