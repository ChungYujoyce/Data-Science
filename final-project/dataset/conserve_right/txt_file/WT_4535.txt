aid schiff adds is that what americans should now expect from their president 10 18 a m house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff says the questions at the heart of the impeachment inquiry are simple but also terrible to consider he says the matter boils down to whether president donald trump sought to condition a white house visit or military aid on ukraine s willingness to open an investigation into democratic rival joe biden and if he did is that abuse of power incompatible with the office of the presidency schiff says the answers to those questions will affect not only the future of the trump administration but also of the presidency itself and what kind of behavior the american public can expect from the commander in chief schiff spoke wednesday in opening the first

claims of russian interference in the 2016 u s presidential election which he described as having little relation to reality the kremlin has shrugged off special counsel robert mueller s exposure of russian interference in the vote mueller found there wasn t enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between trump s campaign and russia but mueller charged 12 russian military intelligence officers
