apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic china s stealth jet the pentagon is scrambling to explain what appears to be an intelligence failure after internet photos made public recently showed a faster than estimated advance of china s new fifth generation warplane u s intelligence estimates previously concluded the jet dubbed the j 20 will not be deployed until 2020 top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning vice adm david dorsett director of naval intelligence told a group of defense reporters on wednesday that the new chinese fighter program was not a surprise but the speed at which they are making progress we underestimated across a broad array of weapons systems they are making progress the three star admiral said progress on the j 20 is among several other chinese military developments that u s intelligence agencies have been accused of missing over the past decade others include the failure to detect a new class of chinese submarine called the yuan and shortcomings related to beijing s long range cruise missiles and a new anti ship ballistic missile pentagon spokesman marine col dave lapan confirmed to inside the ring that recent photos of a new chinese jet show taxiing tests on a prototype aircraft apparently photographed by people who saw it pass by this is evidence that a fifth generation fighter program is proceeding col lapan said however progress appears to be uneven open source reports show that china has been seeking jet engines for its fourth generation fighter from russia indicating that they are still encountering some difficulties in working toward fifth generation capabilities he said the faster development of the j 20 was first discussed by chinese gen he weirong deputy commander of the chinese air force last year he predicted deployment as earlier as 2017 the jet is expected to rival the u s f 22 superfighter whose production was canceled by defense secretary robert m gates after 187 jets were built in scrapping the f 22 mr gates stated publicly that one reason for his decision was that the chinese would not deploy a comparable jet until 2020 thus more f 35 jets would be built instead of the more capable f 22 richard fisher a military analyst with the international assessment and strategy center who was among the first to spot the j 20 photos months ago said the aircraft is manufactured by the chengdu aircraft co chengdu s goal is to beat the f 22 and then build their own f 35 when the 18 ton thrust engine is ready it is a full challenge to the u s strategy for air power mr fisher said both the george w bush and obama administrations are to blame for not continuing production of the f 22 which is needed if there is ever a conflict with china over taiwan he said absent a better combat aircraft this constitutes one of the most serious u s intelligence and leadership failures since the end of the cold war mr fisher said mr fisher said the images of the jet reveal that china is advancing rapidly toward fielding a credible and competitive fifth generation fighter the photos show a large fighter with radar evading stealth features an advanced electronically scanned array aesa radar and supercruise the ability to fly at supersonic speed for long distances using less fuel he said with refueling this fighter can carry the fight out to guam mr fisher said as for the pentagon s claim that the chinese are having problems developing an advanced engine for the jet mr fisher said china is ground testing a new more powerful jet engine and as a result could deploy the new jet by 2017 if the united states wishes to remain an asian power capable of deterring chinese aggression or preventing future generations from becoming victims of china s dictates it is essential that an improved version of the f 22 be put into crash development as well as putting a sixth generation fighter into formal development mr fisher said russian missile defense russia s military is working to deploy an impenetrable missile defense shield by 2020 according to gen nikolai makarov chief of the russian armed forces staff gen makarov was quoted in russian news reports monday as saying the state will have an umbrella over it which will defend it against ballistic missile attacks against medium range missiles air based cruise missiles sea based cruise missiles and ground based cruise missiles including missiles flying at extremely low altitudes at any time and in any situation of course this is a long process that requires a significant financial investment but the foundation for this system will be established as early as 2011 he said the general s statement raises questions about the testimony last year by defense secretary robert m gates who told congress while lobbying for the ratification of the new strategic arms reduction treaty that the russians hate missile defenses based on their constant opposition to u s defenses and efforts to limit u s defenses in the arms treaty based on gen makarov s comments what the russians really hate are u s missile defenses because they could be expanded to counter moscow s missiles gates quest defense secretary robert m gates is being offered a visit to china s great wall during his much anticipated visit to the middle kingdom set to begin next week that pro china officials in the obama administration hope will jump start stalled military exchanges trip planners in the pentagon and beijing are working on the itinerary for the visit which is expected to be the first clear reflection of whether china s military the bastion of anti u s sentiment within the communist leadership is willing to sign on to u s efforts to build trust the test will be whether the people s liberation army pla generals who have refused to allow u s leaders to visit sensitive military sites in the past will give mr gates more access than past secretaries in 2005 defense secretary donald rumsfeld was the first to visit the headquarters building of the second artillery corps the strategic missile forces in 2005 that was hailed as a breakthrough even though no missile sites or warhead storage facilities were included if mr gates goes to the great wall and is denied access to a never before seen pla base the visit will likely be dismissed by critics as an example of military tourism that s what happened back in the late 1990s when then defense secretary william s cohen was shown an aging missile defense facilities in what officials at the time said was a propaganda effort by the chinese to show the united states how backward their military was all the better reason the united states should lift the embargo on military sales and loosen advanced technology controls so far no u s military or defense leader has been allowed to visit the real chinese pentagon a vast underground command center known as the western hills near beijing china s military has prohibited all u s military personal from the site although there have been reports that russian military visitors have seen it mysterious murder the fbi has joined newark del police in probing the mysterious murder of john jack wheeler iii a former pentagon official and west point graduate who was among a group of advocates in washington leading the fight in recent years over how the u s government should conduct computer based cyberwarfare baltimore fbi spokesman rich wolf confirmed the bureau s assistance but declined to disclose details about the aid right now we re treating this as a homicide mr wolf said by telephone mr wheeler 66 was found murdered dec 31 in a landfill near wilmington investigators said his body had been left in a trash bin in newark del investigators are said to be looking into several theories for the motive behind the killing including a legal dispute with a neighbor or a robbery mr wheeler held a security clearance and had worked as a contractor for the mclean office of the mitre corp a defense contractor mitre spokeswoman jennifer shearman said mr wheeler worked on outreach activities aimed at promoting discussions among government industry and academia on cyberdefense topics mr wheeler who was known as a fierce political infighter in recent years helped set up a blue ribbon panel of experts to study the issue of cyberwarfare mr wheeler sided with the u s military and defense advocates who want cyberwarfare to be dominated by military warriors rather than intelligence officials who have sought to make cyberwarfare more oriented toward gathering intelligence and conducting espionage the dispute over the military versus intelligence orientation of cyberwarfare and the legal authorities for each currently has slowed the u s government s cyberwarfare efforts mr wheeler was an army veteran of the vietnam war and helped set up the vietnam veterans memorial on the mall america was blessed to have a few great captains in the army air corps who were visionaries on the use of air power before world war ii said edward timperlake a technology security official at the pentagon during the george w bush administration and a friend of mr wheeler s jack wheeler will go down as one of our great captains on fighting in cyberbattle space he said jack knew the value of being prepared for offensive combat and he was driving home that lifetime lesson he learned over fo
