the world s daily crude oil production most of that output goes to asia at 5 7 million barrels of crude oil a day the saudi disruption would be the greatest on record for world markets according to figures from the paris based international energy agency it just edges out the 5 6 million barrels a day disruption around the time of iran s 1979 islamic revolution according to the iea saudi arabia has pledged that its stockpiles would keep global markets supplied as it rushes to repair damage at the abqaiq facility and its khurais oil field trump said the u s had reason to believe it knows who was behind the attack his secretary of state had blamed iran the previous day he assured his twitter followers that we are locked and loaded depending on verification and were waiting to hear from the saudis as to who they believe was behind the attack and under what terms we would proceed the tweets followed a national security council meeting at the white house that included vice president mike pence secretary of state mike pompeo and defense secretary mark esper a u s official said all options including a military response were on the table but said no decisions had been made sunday the official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations trump s locked and loaded comment mirrors similar remarks he made following iran shooting down a u s military surveillance drone in june however the president said he pulled back from retaliating against iran at the last minute u s officials also offered highly detailed satellite photos of the saudi sites that show damage suggesting the attack came from the north where iran or iraq are rather than from yemen to the south iraq s prime minister has denied the attack came from his country where iranian backed shiite rebels operate iraqi premier adel abdel mahdi said he received a call monday from pompeo without elaborating iranian foreign ministry spokesman abbas mousavi on sunday dismissed the u s allegations as blind and futile comments the americans adopted the maximum pressure policy against iran which due to its failure is leaning toward maximum lies mousavi said on monday mousavi dismissed as mere speculation media reports about a possible meeting between trump and iranian president hassan rouhani on the sidelines of the u n general assembly later in september the u s has said it will remain open for talks with iran but mousavi said a trump rouhani meeting was not on the agenda the u s satellite photos appear to show the attack on abqaiq may have struck the most sensitive part of the facility its stabilization area the washington based center for strategic and international studies has said the area includes storage tanks and processing and compressor trains which greatly increases the likelihood of a strike successfully disrupting or destroying its operations stabilization means processing so called sour crude oil into sweet crude that allows it to be transported onto transshipment points on the persian gulf and the red sea or to refineries for local production the attack damaged five to seven spheroids and five out of ten stabilization towers said fernando ferreira the director of geopolitical risk at the washington based rapidan energy group five or so stabilization towers appear to be destroyed and will have to be rebuilt this will take many months ferreira said the sophisticated attack now seems likely to reduce abqaiq s 7 million barrels of crude oil a day capacity for an indefinite period measured in months saudi aramco did not respond to
