friday on abc s good morning america presumptive republican nominee donald trump fielded questions from co host george stephanopoulos about his releasing his tax returns to the public during that interview stephanopoulos insisted trump could release those taxes despite being audited by the internal revenue service trump argued there was a double standard when it came to his tax returns and democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton s emails however as stephanopoulos continued to press trump on the issue trump fired back by pointing out stephanopoulos prior relationship with the bill and hillary clinton and noted it was something he didn t reveal partial transcript as follows stephanopoulos let s talk about your tax return under new pressure from the clinton campaign secretary clinton talking about that the last couple of days i just have a bottom line question for you yes or no do you believe voters have a right to see your tax returns before they make a final decision trump i don t think they do but i do say this i will really gladly give them not going to learn anything but it s under routine audit when the audit ends i ll present them that should be before the election i hope it s before the election but when the audit ends i ve had even journalists say that no nobody should give until audits are over and have had journalists say that so i think if there s no i sort of have to laugh when clinton says it mrs clinton said i should give my tax what about all the emails or missing goldman sachs speeches when is she going to give that very great hypocrite but as far as i m concerned i want to give it as soon as possible as soon as the audit every year i have wealthy friends that never get audited stephanopoulos as you know the audit is no excuse the irs has made it very clear an audit is not a bar to public release it is entirely your choice president nixon released his tax returns even though he was under audit and when you were seeking a casino license in pennsylvania and new jersey you released the returns to the state officials even though you were under audit trump i am under audit now and as soon as the audit ends i ll release my returns if you look at many others many others feel the same way and almost every lawyer will tell you the same thing when you re under audit you finish the audit before you release i have no problem and it should be and i hope it s before the election stephanopoulos but sir if you were willing trump by the way people will learn nothing i put in financials 100 pages worth of financials that show that i built a company that s worth more than 10 billion it shows cash it shows cash flows returns but nevertheless when the audit is complete i will release i have no problem with it stephanopoulos a couple of follow ups to that if you are willing to release your tax returns to get a casino license why shouldn t voters see them before they make you commander in chief trump well because at the time it didn t make a ny if you take a look at the picture that we sent you with a tax returns probably ten feet high when you stack them on top and lengthy and complex i built a massive business and want to make sure that everything is perfect it a routine audit and get through it first and that s what i ll do there have been many presidents that have not shown their tax returns stephanopoulos actually every single nominee before 1976 trump before 1976 people didn t do it it used to be a secret thing i don t want it to be secret but i do want the audit to get finished stephanopoulos before that richard nixon released his returns as i said but to get to your point on the one hand you show that stack and on the other hand you say people can t learn anything they can actually learn quite a lot they can learn your sources of income they can learn whether you have any foreign sources of income or any swiss bank accounts or other offshore accounts do you trump i tell you right now i do not i do not have swiss bank accounts i don t have offshore i really have a very very clean company and believe me if i didn t it would have been reported by 200 groups because there s nobody that has more reporting or more scrutiny than i have i have given my financials they re extraordinary and we would have read if they weren t but believe me when i release my financial george and sent them down to federal elections there was a feeding frenzy by the media and they reported wow that is a great company and i have built a great great company and by the way when you look at numbers when you look at incomes when you look at all of the things or most of the things you talked about that s reported on the financials stephanopoulos it s not reported on the financials what they don t know also is your tax rate they don t show whether you paid a low trump i try very hard to pay as little tax as possible and have said that for the last two years i fight very hard because this country wastes our money they take our tax money and throw it down the drain they spend 4 trillion in the middle east and we can t fix a road or a bridge and i fight very hard i consider it an expense because frankly our country doesn t know what they re doing with our money or tax money and that s part of the problem so i fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible stephanopoulos what is your tax rate trump it s none of your business you ll see it when i release but i fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible stephanopoulos you know we ve talked about this several times over the last several years i first asked about it in 2011 you said you would release your tax returns then thinking of running for president when president obama releases his birth certificate he did then you said you would release your tax returns when secretary clinton releases her emails she has turned over all emails in her possession trump there s plenty of missing i read yesterday that there were a lot of emails missing i know you re a good friends of hers and i know you worked for her but you didn t reveal it but you know she did not turn over her emails there are a lot of emails missing stephanopoulos there were emails from her staffers missing she turned over trump there are emails missing all over the place the whole thing is a scam there are emails missing all over the place stephanopoulos you said then that you were just going through all of the returns and you will release them now you re throwing up the audit trump i never said that at all i said i will release them upon the completion of the audit like anybody else i was interviewed last night or the other night by greta van susteren who is a lawyer she said i happen to agree with you until then you shouldn t release them follow jeff poor on twitter jeff poor clipspoliticsabcdonald trumpgeorge stephanopoulosgood morning americahillary clinton please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
