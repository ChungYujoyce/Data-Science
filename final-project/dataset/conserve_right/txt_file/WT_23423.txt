ether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion we fell in love president donald trump referring to north korean dictator kim jong un after singapore summit june 2018 all accidental wars are inadvertent and unintended but not vice versa top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties herman kahn on escalation 1965 in the still growing strategic threat from north korea president trump and his pertinent advisers must learn to make certain vital distinctions to begin nuclear war risks posed by inadvertence or accident should be differentiated from the specific conflict hazards of a deliberately initiated nuclear war moreover when the u s president considers the complex configurations of any unintentional nuclear war his primary focus should be upon the expected stability of pyongyang s command control and intelligence procedures this would be unrelated to being in love with kim jong un ultimately any presidential focus on north korea would require detail in extraordinary circumstances should kim jong un s command control intelligence processes display 1 unacceptably high risks of mechanical electrical computer failure 2 indecipherable pre delegations of nuclear launch authority and or 3 unpredictable unreliable launch on warning procedures a rational american president could experience a need to preempt here the probable costs to the united states and its affected allies could be more or less overwhelming what might actually be expected after a trump ordered preemption against north korea when all significant factors are taken into account pyongyang would expectedly target american military forces in the region and or certain high value south korean armaments and personnel plainly this is not the expectation of a us president avowedly in love with his north korean counterpart there is more in all plausible scenarios each side would have to pay close attention to the anticipated wishes of russia and china in this connection does president trump reasonably believe that china would plan to support him in any still upcoming nuclear crisis with north korea at a minimum mr trump s ongoing and potentially catastrophic trade war with china would suggest a starkly negative reply if donald trump s initial defensive first strike against north korea were less than massive a rational adversary in pyongyang would likely take steps to ensure that its own selected reprisal was limited but if the president s rational attack upon north korea were launched against an irrational enemy leadership the response from pyongyang could then be an all out retaliation by any sensible measure whether directed at u s forces or at u s allies in the region this sort of response could inflict very grave harms even if nuclear brinksmanship in northeast asia should be played by fully rational adversaries the rapidly accumulating momentum of events could demand that each contestant strive for escalation dominance significantly it is in the unpracticed dynamics of any such explosive rivalry that the prospect of an asian armageddon scenario could pass into reality this fearful outcome could be the result of an incremental escalation by one or both players or of any sudden quantum leap in risk taking destructiveness the only predictable element of this sobering narrative is the narrative s boundless unpredictability even under the most favorable assumptions of enemy rationality all relevant decision makers would have to concern themselves with dense or confused communications miscalculations errors in information unauthorized uses of strategic weapons mechanical electrical or computer malfunctions and even various poorly recognized applications of cyber defense or cyber war one final distinction now needs to be made concerning inadvertent nuclear war and accidental nuclear war by definition an accidental nuclear war would be inadvertent reciprocally however an inadvertent nuclear war need not be accidental instead it could be the unwitting result of assorted adversarial misjudgments or miscalculations in such end of the line circumstances being in love with one s adversary would offer mr trump no palpable advantages louis rene beres is emeritus professor of international law at purdue university he is the author of 12 books including most recently surviving amid chaos israel s nuclear strategy rowman littlef
