you joining us now here in washington marc short chief of staff to the vice president marc welcome back to fox news sunday marc short chief of staff to the vice president mike pence thanks for having me back chris wallace u s intelligence says that the russians are interfering again in our presidential election this time trying to help president trump and bernie sanders here aposs how those two men reacted this week begin video clip sen bernie sanders i vt presidential candidate what i say to mr putin if elected president trust me you are not going to be interfering in american elections donald trump president of the united states i see these phonies these the do nothing democrats they said today that putin wants to be sure that trump gets elected here we go again end video clip wallace while sanders targeted putin why did the president go after democrats short chris i think that there aposs not intelligence that said that the russians are trying to help donald trump win election we know that foreign governments have been trying to interfere in elections to try to sow chaos they aposve been doing that for many years and it aposs not just limited to russia but there aposs not intelligence that suggests that they aposre trying to help trump when this administration has sanctioned russia more than any administration since ronald reagan and it seems that the democrats are going to nominate somebody in bernie sanders who honeymooned in the soviet union and still seems to prefer marxism over capitalism it aposs hard to see why they aposd be accusing donald trump over bernie sanders this administration has been consistent in sanctioning russia for interference and this administration is the one that actually in 2018 make sure there was not corruption in the midterm elections wallace there is a consistent story and i know that that aposs the white house argument that there is no there is no intelligence saying this but there is a consistent story that came out this week and we aposve heard it from members of the committee the intelligence committee we aposve heard it from members of the intelligence community we parted from people in your own white house that is that shelby pierson who is the intelligence community aposs election securities czar told congress that the russians are trying to help donald trump the specific words she used are developed a preference for president trump the president aposs reaction was to call in her boss acting dni chief joe maguire who spent 40 years first as a navy seal and then in counterintelligence to fire him and replace him with ambassador richard grenell a trump partisan who has almost no intelligence experience you aposre saying none of this happened short let me correct you on several fronts chris first of all i think it aposs disconcerting that the briefing that you mentioned was a classified briefing in the house that aposs one of the president aposs concerns is that adam schiff aposs committee continues to leak selective information wallace i know but you can apost say it didn apost happen and then say they leaked it short yes i am saying to them because i am saying what happened as far as the briefing the same briefing the president get on election security we aposve able to outline what we aposve done measures we aposve worked with 1 100 municipalities to secure election results and the intelligence community not giving us information that they aposre trying to help reelect donald trump crosstalk wallace i just want to be clear on this you aposre denying wait a second you aposre denying that shelby pierson who aposs the election security czar you aposre denying that under questioning from democrats she gave any indication that the russian efforts to meddle in election was because they have found a preference for president trump you aposre flatly denying that short that was a classified briefing i aposm not going to comment specifically on what she said in that crosstalk wallace well you did no wait a minute you did just classify it and said there aposs no intelligence short i aposm telling you the briefing of the president received that i aposve that i was a party to and that aposs not information that came out of the briefing the president got on election security chris wallace but you aposre not denying you aposre not denying that that was part of the briefing that she gave to the committee crosstalk short i aposm telling you that whatever briefing whatever briefing she gave to the committee was supposed to be classified and once again adam schiff aposs committee is selectively leaking out information and often distorting information it aposs our belief they aposve done it many times wallace i don apost understand you aposre saying it aposs not true and they leaked it short no chris this is pretty consistent and i think pretty clear what i aposm telling you is that is that was a classified briefing that shouldn apost have been discussed the briefing the president received the intelligence community has not told us that russia is trying to reelect crosstalk wallace so why was joe maguire why was her boss called in short he was not called in he was part of the same briefing chris it aposs more bad information he was part of the same briefing he was not called in crosstalk wallace and did the president not begin to question it because he had gotten reports excuse me is it not true that the president questioned joe maguire very pointedly because he had gotten reports that the house briefing which had happened just before that members of the republican committee said this is what shelby pierson said short there aposs a lot of bad information here again the president did question because he said why did they get a briefing i did but at the same time the administration has great respect for admiral maguire he aposs a patriot who served our administration and has served our country admirably the president is looking for another place to have him continue to serve inside the trump administration wallace if you have such respect for joe maguire why was he not only let me finish the question why was he not only fired but told to clear out by 9 00 the next morning short chris it aposs not firing his position is supposed to be completed by march 12th he aposs not going to be re nominated he in fact when this position came on was reluctant to serve in this role so the administration has been looking for somebody consistently ric grenell is now going to serve at temporary capacity the president aposs announced he aposs going to look to have a more permanent replacement wallace does maguire told to clear out your office the next day short i don apost know if maguire is told or not i have not heard that wallace retired admiral bill mcraven former head of u s special operations command the man who oversaw the raid that killed osama bin laden wrote this in the washington post this weekend he aposs known maguire for 40 years in this administration good men and women don apost last long joe was dismissed for doing his job overseeing the dissemination of intelligence to elected officials who needed that information to do their jobs are you saying that bill mcraven just made the story up out of whole cloth short with all due respect to mcraven he doesn apost know he doesn apost know he wasn apost there i aposm telling you i was there for the briefing there aposs not the way this media has reported is some sort of hostile encounter the president of course was saying why did the house get everything before i did wallace well nobody is objecting to that crosstalk wallace the question is whether or not the president had been told because house members had heard it by republicans hey this is what the briefest is from dni said short chris wallace you were in the briefing let me just ask that question did the president have information from the dni that he was disturbed about in terms of what the house have been told short no wallace didn apost happen short no i mean i want to be clear as well that the briefing with the president is in a classified environment too chris i aposm not giving ph details about what was said and what wasn apost said but as far as the question about is there information that says that russia is trying to elect donald trump that is false information as far as the briefing that we aposve received wallace but you don apost know about the house briefing short i of course not wallace and no well no member of the house told the president short well the members of the house have had separate conversations with president but it aposs clear that adam schiff aposs committee decided to leak to the press once again to try to continue to foment the same sort of russian hoax they aposve been doing for three years chris wallace one of the president aposs friends roger stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for lying to congress for obstruction and for witness tampering here was the president aposs reaction begin video clip trump i aposd love to see roger exonerated and i aposd love to see it happen because i personally think he was sweet treated very unfairly end video clip wallace so here aposs the question stone was convicted specifically for lying about the fact that he in fact was trying to get information from wikileaks about what they were going to do with the thousands of hacked democratic emails why does the president and there was a treasure trove of evidence that indicated he had lied about the fact that he was trying to find out from wikileaks what they were going to do with the emails why does the president think he should be exonerated short i you know it aposs possible he will get exonerated chris i have i have no interest crosstalk wallace well i aposm asking you the president why does he think he should be short i have no interest of being character witness for roger stone i don apost know roger stone i think that lying to federal investigators he should be prosecuted for and that aposs what the department of justice did but i think the president aposs frustration is you see a department of justice that comes out with the original sentencing guidelines four years beyond what they aposre supposed to be for sentencing guidelines for his offenses and yet when you see people like andy mccabe who also lied to federal investigators referred for investigation what they get is a lucrative contract at cnn that doesn apost seem to be equitable justice and i think that aposs what the president aposs primary frustration is wallace but he aposs not saying he got sentence for too long incidentally he didn apost get the 7 to 9 years he got three and a half years roughly short correct wallace here aposs what the president own attorney general william barr said begin video clip william barr attorney general i think it was established he was convicted of obstructing congress and witness tampering and i thought that was a righteous prosecution and i was happy that he was convicted end video clip wallace and the judge in the case amy berman jackson said this about stone he was not prosecuted as some have complained for standing up for the president he was prosecuted for covering up for the president so when the president talks about wanting to see roger stone get off to be exonerated and even raises the possibility that he might pardon him is that because roger stone protected him in the mueller investigation short i don apost think so chris i think the president again is frustrated in seeing what he thinks is an inequitable system of the justice i think what he aposs seen is that the roger stone investigation was born out of the mueller report where they started from the reality is that the mueller report we aposve seen did not show russia collusion we aposve seen in our minds ph crosstalk wallace but you have the attorney general saying it was a righteous prosecution short i understand and i just share with you that i think it should be prosecuted as well i think that people who lied to congress should be prosecuted chris and so but i think that aposs what aposs unfair in the system is that those who also were trying to prevent this president from being elected inside their position at department of justice lied about it leaked information the inspector general refers them for prosecution and what they get is a lucrative contract to tv network how is that equitable justice wallace well i mean i suppose one of the arguments would be just because one guy gets off doesn apost mean the other person should short and i aposve said multiple times on your network that he should have been prosecuted wallace ok short and so we aposll see what happens with the second round and also wallace last question last question it appears it appears and obviously a lot could happen that bernie sanders well it doesn apost appear he aposs the clear front runner for the nomination how does the white house feel about the possibility of a trump sanders presidential campaign this fall short we would look forward to that i think it would show a stark contrast between a president who aposs had on employment rates of 3 5 percent created 7 million jobs versus a candidate who i think continues to embrace socialism i think that aposs a stark contrast the american people to choose from but to be clear i think the president is also comfortable with any democrats in the field because he knows the record he is running on is a tremendous record of economic growth and national security and so we we welcome any those opponents wallace marc thank you thanks for your time please come back always good to talk with you sir short chris thanks for having me wallace when we come back we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss president trump aposs reaction to more russian meddling in our election and the sentencing of his long time advisor roger stone commercial break begin video clip trump they aposre trying to start a rumor it aposs disinformation that aposs the only thing they aposre good at they aposre not good at anything else they get nothing done do nothing democrats end video clip wallace president trump dismissing word of more russian meddling in our elections as another case of his democratic enemies making up stories and it aposs time now for our sunday group senator mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff josh holmes fox news political analyst juan williams former democratic congresswoman jane harman and fox news correspondent gillian turner who served on the national security council for presidents bush 43 and obama well josh i aposm a little confused here because basically what you heard marc short say is it didn apost happen there aposs no intelligence but then he said well in fact i don apost know what happened in the house committee which is where the leak apparently came and it does seem a little odd that joe maguire who was in good standing as the acting dni is fired and then is told to clear the next morning if the president wasn apost upset josh holmes former chief of staff to senator mitch mcconnell well the first thing is i think it aposs important to know the facts with maguire and when he was scheduled to be cycled out i aposm not sure that the timeline there maybe it got moved up i don apost think this is a single incidence for why he was fired but look in terms of the president aposs reaction we have spent the last three years making unfounded allegations about russian collusion about his campaign in 2016 about his efforts ever since we endured a mueller report we aposve endured countless hearings i don apost think we should be the least bit surprised and the president has a lot of anxiety about a classified briefing coming out once again in the same fashion that we aposve seen over three years to allege that somehow russia has chosen him as their favorite candidate and sure enough and a day later we find out russia is also concluded that bernie sanders is a favorite candidate remember tulsi gabbard was a favorite candidate i think this is an example of incredibly dangerous and reckless reporting i think our intelligence community would be well served to focus on trying to stop the threat rather than cover this as if it aposs a horse race crosstalk wallace are you saying reporting by the media or reporting by the intelligence community holmes both i think that the media aposs coverage and sourcing this over three years not just this incident has been very quick to jump into conclusions about what russia is trying to do i think very clearly what russia is trying to do is undermine confidence of american elections and it aposs hard to see how they could be more successful than this exact crosstalk wallace i want to pick up on your main point here congresswoman harman you were the top democrat on the house intelligence committee can you understand the president aposs concern regardless of what the truth is of what the members of the house intelligence committee were told can you understand the president aposs concern that this information was brought of all committees to house intelligence run by the president aposs nemesis adam schiff and that it leaks within 24 hours jane harman wilson center director well the leaks are terrible yes i can understand that concern but that committee was blown up long ago sadly devin nunes is a very partisan ranking member wallace we should point out he was the former republican chairman before the house took control in 2019 harman that aposs correct that aposs correct back in the day when i was ranking member and pete hoekstra who i gather may be a candidate for the new dni and i would support that i think he is wallace all right let aposs move on to this topic ph harman right i support that anyway on this story yes it aposs appalling that it leaked however the underlying information is important to grasp bob mueller aposs report said that the russians are already meddling in the 2020 election and whether or not they aposre taking sides they are sowing chaos and as reported by david sanger in the new york times today and that is enough to concern me that we are not going to have a fair election wallace all right let aposs turn to another big story which is a little bit clearer to understand and that is the sentencing of roger stone attorney general barr says that the president aposs constant commentary through public statements or through tweets is making it impossible for him to do his job but that didn apost stop mr trump this week take a look begin video clip trump i want to see it play out to its fullest because roger has a very good chance of exoneration in my opinion fbi is phenomenal i love the people in the fbi but the people at the top were dirty cops end video clip wallace gillian is it that you think the president doesn apost take bill barr aposs warning seriously you aposre making my job impossible or that he just doesn apost care what barr said gillian turner fox news correspondent well if we look at what happened this week barr asked the president to stop waiting in the president responded with a tweets farm so i think that tells you a lot about the state of the relationship whether that is indifference for his thumbing his nose at bill barr i don apost know i will say though on the bigger issue of the barr trump relationship bubbling up this week i think the people that have been criticizing bill barr as a trump loyalist some kind of a maga guy are wrong and are really missing the point here the point is that bill barr had his own agenda his own motives independently of president trump literally for decades i remember reading stuff that barr wrote as an undergraduate in college in support of executive power and barr saw with president trump this opportunity to push his agenda of expanded presidential power forward i think the second he aposs not able to do that or he sees he is not going to be able to do that he aposs going to jump ship wallace i want to pick up on exactly that point with you juan how much pressure does this put on bill barr now if you go public and you say this kind of commentary by the president makes it impossible for me to do my job and then there aposs a leak and one assumes it probably came from the justice department that barr has considered not now doing but has considered resigning in the president ignores all of that how much pressure does that put on bill barr to put up or shut up juan williams fox news political analyst well there is pressure on barr to either act or don apost act you can apost be the boy that cried wolf but at the same time my impression is that bill barr is fine i think even as the possibility as this idea of the resignation was put out there as cover because of the damage that president trump and bill barr have done not only to the department of justice but done to the department down to the justice system in this country in terms of its great ability with federal prosecutors federal judges this week thinking of having an emergency meeting about this i think barr has never been an independent actor of justice in fact i think he aposs willing demonstrated a willingness to protect president trump and protect president trump aposs friends and not only that go after the fbi and going after his own inspector general crosstalk williams when inspector general said it was a problem crosstalk turner i was just going to say the why why is it the attorney general defending the president is it something unique to president is it political williams yes it is turner i argue no i argue that he sees president trump as his vehicle crosstalk williams i think richard nixon had john mitchell i think donald trump has bill barr bill barr is going crosstalk williams let me finish here he aposs going into the roger stone case he aposs going into the michael flynn case he aposs now consulting with rudy giuliani about collecting dirt on joe biden this is this damages to our justice system crosstalk wallace go ahead congresswoman harman gillian may be right that these have been his views since infancy but he is destroying his legacy and i think there will be a mass resignation on his watch by career justice people who think he has totally politicized the department i think either has to toe the line the white house line or get out and free advice for me i aposve never met the man get out while you still have some honor wallace josh wait a second josh holmes i couldn apost more forcefully disagree with juan on this i think if all bill barr did was defend the trump administration it would be hard to see how we aposre having this panel right now clearly there has been a disagreement over a number of high profile things and for those of us who follow this closely i think that bill barr has done more to try to regain the integrity of the justice department and frankly whether you look at the store partisan lens or not the way that they handled the aftermath of the 2016 election the investigations that led up to the prosecution of president trump aposs entire team was horrible damage crosstalk wallace let me ask you this because we are running out of time in this segment you would agree though that barr having sent these two shots across the bow the white house and basically said stop interfering because you are undercutting my position you aposre undercutting the independence of justice and the president continuing to comment does put barr in a tough spot doesn apost it holmes well it certainly a tough spot when any time your boss and you are having a disagreement over something wallace i try to avoid that laughter holmes i aposve never had one myself but i think in the end is justice being administered here and that aposs where barr is focused and as long as that is happening wallace simple question is he going to resign or not holmes no i don apost think so wallace all right finally an answer panel we have to take a break we aposll see you a little later in the program when we come back billionaire tom steyer joins us to discuss how he aposs going to challenge joe biden and bernie sanders in next saturday aposs primary in south carolina commercial break wallace coming up tom steyer doubles down on the south carolina primary hoping he aposll score his first win in the democratic race begin video clip tom steyer d presidential candidate we have the biggest group of people doing door to door grassroots work of any campaign in south carolina end video clip wallace we aposll ask him what a strong showing there would mean for his chances on super tuesday commercial break chris wallace fox news host while the other democratic candidates have spread themselves thin in the early contest billionaire tom steyer has invested heavily in south carolina and he aposs running strong in the key primary there next saturday after the results came in from nevada last night i spoke with steyer about his plans for the palmetto state mr steyer you spent more time in nevada than any other candidate you spent more money in nevada than all the other candidates combined you said you had to finish first or second but as we sit here right now you aposre running a distant fifth you have made a an equally big commitment in south carolina and there it does seem to be paying off for you let me put up the numbers there according to the realclearpolitics average of recent polls you were in third place behind biden and sanders but ahead of buttigieg and warren how do you explain that and don apost you have to finish in the top three in south carolina tom steyer d presidential candidate i think i do for sure but chris i think i have done best with black people i have done best with latinos i think that when we get to the diverse democratic electorate when we get to the diversity that is america and the democratic party i do a lot better so south carolina happens to be a place that has a pretty high concentration of african americans and that those happen to be people that i talk to a lot and have a lot of have a long history of working with and therefore those that aposs a population where i do really well and so i think that that explains a lot of what aposs going on in south carolina and really what aposs going on in nevada as well wallace now one thing that you aposve done in south carolina is you have put members of the black legislative caucus on your payroll you aposve put members of the democratic black caucus on your payroll and the former head of the charleston county democratic party says in effect you aposre paying some people off to support you steyer look people are doing work as organizers on our campaign and we aposre paying them the naacp came out and described what people are criticize us as making racist remarks chris actually what we aposre doing i aposm a grassroots organizer from way back i started one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the united states nextgen america and what we aposve found is if you want to organize in a community you have to work with people from the community and that aposs exactly what we aposre doing in south carolina wallace so how do you explain the fact that you aposre doing better and you say that you have a particular connection with african americans how come steyer well i think one thing is i aposm very willing to talk about race chris you know i believe that there is a substantial racial subtext in virtually every policy area in the united states and the example i usually use is climate where i aposm a long term climate hawk but i aposve always started from the standpoint of environmental justice i aposve always started in the communities where it aposs unsafe to breathe because you aposll get asthma and unsafe to drink the tap water because you aposll get sick and those tend to be overwhelmingly black and brown communities i aposm the only person running for president who is openly consistently for reparations for slavery i aposm someone who believes in talking about the underlying issues and trying to come up with answers to them so that we can resolve them together and move forward wallace ok let aposs unpack some of that steyer ok wallace you are one of the people talking about reparations for slavery do you really believe that a hundred more than 150 years after emancipation that is a good use of tax money steyer chris i don apost think that the that the discrimination and the legalized injustice stopped in 1865 in fact i think what i aposm talking about wallace no but didn apost it could it have stopped in 1900 or 1950 or 2000 steyer no wallace i mean i guess the question is how long does reparations go on steyer well how how long did injustice go on i mean what i want to do is have a formal commission on race on the first day of my presidency and go through the history of the last 400 plus years to talk about together to understand what happened where it went exactly how we got here and to repair the damage that was done i think there aposs an implication in what you aposre saying that in fact you know we aposre never going to deal with this this is something in the past and so we should just draw a line on today and move forward and i think that aposs unrealistic honestly wallace well steyer i think that that is in fact wallace no i don apost i aposm not really making that argument i guess i aposm making the argument or or raising the question is probably the better way to put it that you know there at a certain point i remember when sandra day o aposconnor was talking about affirmative action she said at some point we have to believe that that whatever reparations she didn apost use that word have been made you know that affirmative action should end and if you aposre talking about 400 years of slavery and now you aposre saying 400 years of reparations an awful lot of people i think would have trouble agreeing with that steyer but what i aposm really saying chris is this let aposs go through telling the story of the last 400 years to see how we got here so that we can decide together how to make repairs and the example that you used of sandra day o aposconnor she said at some point we should be able to move on it but what she aposs saying implicitly is at some point but she aposs not saying let aposs let aposs go through and figure out what happened and figure out what to do she aposs saying at some point it just has to disappear into the past i think that aposs unrealistic wallace ok steyer i think that in fact talking about race in terms of environmental justice is entirely appropriate because something happened that led us to here wallace ok i want to get to i want to get to two more subjects with you steyer ok wallace you also talk about raising the minimum wage it currently stands at 7 25 an hour bernie sanders wants to raise it to 15 but you aposre calling for 22 an hour the non partisan congressional budget office says your plan would would certainly lift earnings for millions of people but it would also cost millions of people their job steyer well let me say this if we go back to 1980 chris and look at the minimum wage and just inflation adjust it so there aposs no increase it aposs just the same wage in 2020 dollars ok then the minimum wage would not be 7 25 it would be 11 that was that aposs no raise in the minimum wage in terms of buying power just the same minimum wage if you then looked at the increased productivity of american workers between 1980 and now and split it the way it aposs traditionally been split between employers and working people in america that would get you to the 22 i aposm not saying let aposs go to 22 i aposm saying that aposs the fair number that that aposs the number that actually you derive just by looking and seeing what american workers deserve from 1980 wallace ok and we aposve got i aposve got about a minute steyer obviously we aposre not going to do a jump but in fact that that is an a description of how unjust the income inequality is wallace i aposve got about a minute left so i need i need a quick answer on this from you mr steyer steyer ok chris go for it wallace you you made your billions of dollars from hedge funds and you aposre now you aposve talked a lot even in this interview about environmental justice you aposre a major proponent of climate change but before you left your hedge fund in 2012 you invested heavily in coal mines and coal fire power plants and i guess the question is the they are now now you aposve left the company but they are going to emit tons of pollution millions of tons of pollution for years to come why did you do that steyer chris i did exactly what i aposm asking americans to do you grew up in a fossil fuel economy so did i at some point long before 2012 i assure you i came to the conclusion that there was a huge unintended side effect of fossil fuel and the government wasn apost dealing with it and i started to work on it over a decade ago i divested personally from all this stuff wallace right steyer and that aposs why i left my company that aposs why i have because i felt like something is happening here that the government aposs not dealing with and what i aposm asking the government to do and what i aposm asking american citizens to do is to make the same transition that i made over 10 years ago which is to say gosh no one got on a school bus or drove to work or turned on a light in order to cause climate change but it aposs doing it so we need to move to clean energy right now it aposs a crisis and i aposve been working on this for over a decade very successfully wallace mr steyer i look forward to continuing steyer mr wallace wallace i look forward you can call me chris to continuing the conversation with you steyer you can call me tom wallace and safe travels on the campaign trail sir steyer thank you sir wallace up next we aposll bring back our sunday group to discuss the state of play in the democratic race now that bernie sanders has put together a string of victories plus what would you like to ask the panel about what sanders apos rise means

anybody i don apost want to get them nervous we are going to win the democratic primary in texas pete buttigieg d presidential candidate before we rush to nominate senator sanders let us take a sober look at what is at stake joe biden d presidential candidate the press is ready to declare people dead quickly but we aposre alive and we aposre coming back and we aposre going to win end video clip wallace some of the reaction last night from the winter and from other candidates after the results came in from the nevada caucuses and we aposre back now with the panel all right congresswoman harman is bernie sanders now the clear frontrunner for the democratic nomination and as a more centrist democrat how much does that concern you jane harman former congresswoman d ca he clearly did very well in three small primaries there aposs one more next weekend let aposs see about that i think joe biden is still in the lead and then comes super tuesday can apost it aposs you know it aposs a whole week from now so i can apost even imagine how it aposs going to come out yet but as a centrist democrat you aposre right i think the democrats won apost win unless the ticket reflects the center and the passionate left and how to get to that between now and july which is the democratic convention is a little tricky it aposs very crowded in the middle and there are two people on the left so it aposs got to sort out but i surely think if the center is left out that is not a winning strategy wallace well i know but you aposre talking that seems to be well they need a more centrist running mate are you saying bernie sanders at the top of the ticket are you comfortable with that and not ideologically but politically harman it aposs it aposs not my call wallace i understand that harman and i had a non partisan think tank but i think that a combination of people who represent the center and get the center to vote and also let aposs remind ourselves that young people who are passionate for sanders turn out and under 20 percent numbers in general elections so i think this is still very uncertain and i hope that wise heads whoever they may be sort this out in a way that that helps democrats i have to say that as a democrat wallace yes we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of what impact a bernie sanders apos rise is having on democrats we got this on twitter from air boss which position does the dnc value more defeating trump or defeating sanders and if sanders is the candidate what effect will his leading the ticket have down ballot josh as somebody who worked for mitch mcconnell who aposs very concerned about republicans forgetting the white house winning holding onto the senate taking over the house how do you answer air boss josh holmes former chief of staff to sen mitch mcconnell well to the first part i think up until now the dnc has had a lot more success in defeating sanders than they have trump obviously they were successful in 2016 but i think it aposs getting late early to paraphrase yogi berra i think these are not insignificant primaries and caucuses that we just went the any candidate who is winning iowa new hampshire nevada storming in with an incredible amount of momentum into south carolina in a state that joe biden who was the prohibitive frontrunner for most of the year has to win and probably has to win convincingly just to stay in the race i think they aposve got a big problem i no question that the establishment democrats at this point are concerned about a sanders coalition because the house majority and many of the sort of hopefuls that are trying to get to a senate majority build what what they aposre trying to do politically around the suburbs in this in this country it is very difficult to make the argument to suburban america amidst a booming economy that what you ought to do for these people who actually the economy has been working for is restructure your economy and make sure that we aposve got a more socialist view of america that aposs a tough tough argument the one hedge i have four republicans on all this is let aposs not assume that this is not going to be an incredibly formidable coalition from bernie sanders he is an authentic movement candidate what that means is his people are coming out no matter what wallace and we saw the power of that with donald trump all right let aposs move to the new face on the debate stage this week and that aposs mayor mike bloomberg who i think almost everybody would agree had a rough night this week in las vegas not the first person to have a rough night in las vegas especially when it came to charges of sexual harassment and those nondisclosure agreements that his company did with some women take a look begin video clip michael bloomberg d presidential candidate we have a very few nondisclosure agreements sen elizabeth warren d ma presidential candidate how many is that bloomberg let me finish warren how many is that bloomberg none of them accused me of due anything other than maybe they didn apost like a joke i told end video clip wallace gillian bloomberg announced you aposre busy shaking her head so let me get the question out and then you can shake your head bloomberg announced i guess it was on friday that he is going to release the three women who with whom there were nondisclosure agreements specifically about him he aposs going to release them from the ndas is that going to be enough to make this go away gillian turner fox news correspondent i guess releasing three women from ndas is better than releasing no women from ndas but this issue of these discriminatory essentially gag orders against women is far from over for the democrats it aposs far from over for as an issue for corporate america frankly for bloomberg quickly on the debate stage this week the bigger issue the much bigger issue was really his lack of experience and the the reality that showed through which is that no matter how much cash you have there aposs no substitute for what the other candidates have which is a year of being out there in the arena you know rolling up their sleeves delivering their message 100 a thousand times doing interviews bloomberg aposs lack of being in the arena over the last year is really what showed through wallace juan let me pick up on that can the mayor he aposs he aposs lucky in the sense that there is another debate tuesday night now in south carolina can he come back if he does much better in that debate and if so how does he do better juan williams fox news political analyst well first of all obviously he can come back he aposs going to has the debate tuesday night then there aposs super tuesday so if he does well in the debate tuesday night if he wins delegates on super tuesday he aposs back and don apost forget he aposs got that bottomless pocket and so he keeps running ads and the ads are pretty effective people like the ads that aposs what he aposs doing as well as he is wallace but you can apost have this disconnect between the ads and the reality of the guy on the stage williams true but i think that it aposs not as damaging as the pundits have said so far i think it would be foolish to count out mike bloomberg i mean to me he aposs positioning wallace so what aposs the key what does he need to do in the debate williams well in the debate obviously he needs to prepare i think that would be good prepare and understand that whereas people may not challenge him in his company or in his public life because he aposs mike bloomberg they aposre going to elizabeth warren had a great debate challenging him and she stood out now let me just say he aposs positioning himself in the middle to be the centrist alternative to sanders if biden fades if biden doesn apost do well biden by the way is still doing pretty good it seems to be he aposs the best against trump and his position to win in south carolina but if he doesn apost do it bloomberg is right there and it could become a sanders bloomberg race wallace congresswoman harman i aposm the only one here i think who aposs run for public office you got to take a punch a you aposve got to own your past williams right harman and i think that bloomberg is a very capable man who has a few things in his past including these ndas so does trump by the way that he aposs got to own and i don apost think he aposll get away with this wallace well wait let aposs get into that because there are obvious vulnerabilities that came out this last week one is the nondisclosure agreements with women over the workplace at bloomberg another one is stop and frisk when you say own it i mean harman he stepped up to stop and frisk and said that knowing now what he does that was an ill advised policy or the way it was implemented was ill advised i kind of agree with that for sure and on the other one you know having a locker room workplace is not acceptable and i think women will demand to know more about that then he has yet revealed turner chris he aposs also dead wrong when he said during the debate that the objection is to jokes he made in the workplace i mean that was more damaging than anything else he could have said on this issue because it shows just how off target he is how he doesn apost grasp this issue and isn apost taking it seriously wallace see i harman i think that was the inaudible i don apost agree with that wallace let me just let me just bring in josh for the last 30 seconds here my reaction is yes you i you aposve got to say what you aposve got to say but then i would pivot and start attacking the other guys holmes yes he didn apost have a message to do that i mean basically you try to sort of absorb the hit deflect it and come back with something that is your message your sort of true authentic pitch his true authentic pitch is he aposs basically a manager who aposs going to you know take care of the government democrats are looking for that and that there aposs not no matter how much money that he has that is a very tough sell wallace and wait guys we aposve got to stop hold on harman actually i think we all need that excuse me wallace and the other thing it seems to me you aposve got to say is i aposm the one guy on this stage for all the talk about the working man who aposs actually put thousands of people to work all right panel that aposs my free advice no charge thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week he arrived on capitol hill as a 13 year old runaway now he aposs a confidant to the powerful commercial break wallace at a time when republicans and democrats on capitol hill seem more divided than ever there is one thing they all agree on and that aposs our power player of the week begin videotape bertie bowman senate foreign relations committee haring coordinator to me it aposs no secret it aposs just that you try to live and treat people the way you would like to be treated wallace bertie bowman is talking about how he has survived and thrived on capitol hill for three quarters of a century sen mitt romney r ut this is quite a guy i aposll tell you that bowman foreign relations committee is the best committee on the hill unidentified male bertie i aposm supposed to be the star here i don apost get bowman yes you aposre the star you are the star it aposs just like a pot of gold to me i work with good people and boy do they treat me nice wallace his story starts in 1944 when as one of 14 children of tenant ph farmers he happened to hear a south carolina senator burnet maybank bowman i heard the words if you aposre ever in washington stop by and see me when he was getting ready to get in his car the guy was over i ran and grabbed his coattail and asked him if i come to washington can i stop by and see him and he said yes my boy wallace on camera how old were you bowman i was about 12 and a half 13 i was going on 13 wallace you took off for washington at 13 bowman yes wallace voice over maybank hired bowman to sweep the capitol steps for 2 a week he worked his way up meeting the country aposs most powerful politicians and enjoying an insider view of congress joe biden former senator november 5 1999 bertie bowman the former clerk of these of this committee for 500 years bowman we know everything that comes in we know everything that goes out we know all of the business of every senator and everything wallace he was close with titans of the hill like jesse helms and segregationists strom thurmond here he is bringing in costs when thurmond filibustered the 1957 civil rights bill for 24 hours straight bowman we did a lot of things behind the scene that no one has seen and they still don apost see what senators do and what they don apost do and all that stuff so you keep that to yourself wallace by the mid apos60s he was on the foreign relations committee where he mentored a young man from arkansas
