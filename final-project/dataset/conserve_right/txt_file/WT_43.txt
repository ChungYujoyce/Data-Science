apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap peter navarro s eagerness to confront attack and be as one former associate put it a real jerk to people didn t serve him well as a political candidate in the 1990s but it fits what president donald trump was looking for to muscle companies to make critical supplies needed to fight the coronavirus and it fits much of what navarro has long wanted as well as the president s trade adviser he hasn t been afraid to raise his voice inside the white house and out the self styled china hawk has seized on the coronavirus pandemic as the opportune moment to push nationalist trade views that line up with trump s reliance on foreign made medical supplies he says is the original sin that underpins current shortages china s non transparency on the virus outbreak he says cost the u s five weeks in preparing for the coming pandemic top stories hogan says maryland can begin testing residents for covid 19 without appointment symptoms n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed navarro who holds a doctorate in economics but has no formal medical training got into a recent blowup with the nation s top infectious disease expert dr anthony fauci in the situation room when he challenged the doctor s resistance to pushing use of a malaria drug to fight the virus based only on anecdotal evidence that same week word leaked that navarro had warned in a late january memo about the high potential toll both in lives and economic damage from a potential pandemic navarro explained that he felt the need to write that memo because others in the west wing weren t taking the threat seriously enough his concerns didn t get much traction among others who saw them as more alarmist talk from navarro and trump for his part said last week he hadn t read the memo adding peter writes a lot of memos but the president and navarro a former peace corps volunteer have long connected over their shared hard line views on trade and their willingness to blame china for many of america s ills navarro 70 has used his time in the spotlight to offer a combative defense of the administration s efforts to slow the spread of the virus who coulda done better on this he asked during a recent appearance on 60 minutes on cbs i mean really think about this perhaps nobody in the administration better fits trump s nationalist tendencies the president looks to place blame on china and the world health organization for the damage the virus has brought to the united states navarro doesn t miss a chance to do the same telling fox news on tuesday that the who has blood on their hands who declared a global health emergency on jan 30 the next day trump banned foreigners who had traveled to china in the past 14 days from entering the u s in public comments however he continued to downplay the threat on march 10 for example he said be calm it s really working out and a lot of good things are going to happen navarro came to trump s attention with his searing reviews of policies that left american manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with china now navarro s job is prodding american companies to make the ventilators n 95 masks and other equipment that states and health care workers have been calling for as the virus spreads what we re learning from that is that no matter how many treaties you have no matter how many alliances no matter how many phone calls when push comes to shove you run the risk as a nation of not having what you need navarro said during a white house briefing earlier this month he declined to be interviewed for this report trump placed navarro in charge of overseeing compliance with the defense production act which allows the president to direct private companies to prioritize orders from the federal government at trump s direction navarro has used that authority against general motors and the 3m company though some democrats have called for much more aggressive use of the law it s not the first time navarro has tangled with the corporate world his support for tariffs to force other nations into concessions on economic and immigration policy is adamantly opposed by business groups such as the u s chamber of commerce but matches the president s vision he s done an incredible job for me in terms of negotiation in terms of understanding where the world is going economically trump said upon picking navarro for his latest role after winning election in 2016 trump picked the university of california irvine professor to lead a new white house council on trade navarro s advancement as a political adviser follows several failed attempts at winning political office in 1992 navarro ran an independent campaign for mayor in san diego losing with 48 of the vote to the republican candidate his campaign s emphasis was on restricting development and stemmed from his work as leader of a group called prevent los angelization now his campaign chairman was a fellow professor peter andersen who says navarro was an economic conservative but to the left of the democratic party on environmental issues i liked his indomitable spirit in terms of taking on the establishment taking on developers andersen said he never shrunk at all from that path it was andersen who said that navarro could be a real jerk to people never flinches smart egotistical self centered he goes forward unfettered when he s right narcissistic all of those things i would say about peter andersen said i loved him but i didn t like him in ensuing years navarro narrowly lost races for san diego city council and county supervisor in 1996 he ran as a democratic candidate for a san diego based congressional seat and even landed a small speaking role at the democratic national convention navarro ended up losing by double digit percentage points lisa ross who worked for navarro as the communications director in the congressional race said the more exposure people had to peter the more they got to dislike him but being liked is not a prerequisite for being an adviser to trump the thing is with peter he can bully his way around ross said i
