laboratories in the world that fact should have given our country a huge advantage with respect to detecting and monitoring emerging cases of covid 19 caused by the new coronavirus outbreak instead asthe new york times reports in a terrific new article officials at the food and drug administration fda and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc stymied private and academic development of diagnostic tests that might have provided an early warning and a head start on controlling the epidemic that is now spreading across the country as the times reports seattle infectious disease expert dr helen chu had by january collected a huge number of nasal swabs from local residents who were experiencing symptoms as part of a research project on flu she proposed to federal and state officials testing those samples for coronavirus infections as the times reports the cdc told chu and her team that they could not test the samples unless their laboratory test was approved by the fda the fda refused to approve chu s test on the grounds that her lab according to the times was not certified as a clinical laboratory under regulations established by the centers for medicare medicaid services a process that could take months in the meantime the cdc required that public health officials could only use the diagnostic test designed by the agency that test released on february 5 turned out to be badly flawed the cdc s insistence on a top down centralized testing regime greatly slowed down the process of disease detection as the infection rate was accelerating a frustrated chu and her colleagues began testing on february 25 without government approval they almost immediately detected a coronavirus infection in a local teenager with no recent travel history chu warned local public health officials of her lab s finding and the teenager s school was closed as a precaution the teen s diagnosis strongly suggested that the disease had been circulating throughout the western part of washington for weeks we now know that that is likely true did the fda and cdc functionaries commend chu for being proactive not at all washington state epidemiologist scott lindquist recalled what they said on that phone call very clearly was cease and desist to helen chu stop testing on february 29 the fda finally agreed to unleash america s vibrant biotech companies and academic labs by allowing them to develop and deploy new tests for the coronavirus that causes covid 19 the times notes the seattle flu study illustrates how existing regulations and red tape sometimes designed to protect privacy and health have impeded the rapid rollout of testing nationally while other countries ramped up much earlier and faster faced with a public health emergency on a scale potentially not seen in a century the united states has not responded nimbly due to red tape the coronavirus outbreak in the u s will be worse than it should have been advertisement next nsa s call detail records

msnbc do the exact same thing just in the other direction and so do abc cbs and nbc to a slightly lesser degree obviously you never watch cnn which has at least one republican on every panel where was obama born you re going to die hihn fnc always has at least one democrat too so what is your point other than the top of your head yawn fuck off and die hihn fuck off and die hihn make me sneer you

response to a post on stalking and unprovoked assaults well that s the intelligence of his gang of authoritarian gomers walks away laughing hawaii but his father was a foriegner so he s probably not a natural born citizen proof trump suckered birthers because they don t know what a natural born citizen is not a clue he says obama is not a natural born citizen why his mom was a citizen born in the us wichita but not his father one parent disqualification has anyone heard that rule applied to white folks and hawaii is american soil 1 if statehood entry made any difference all presidents must be from states who ratified our constitution double duh 2 hawaii became a state two years before obama was born which wouldn t matter anyhow see 1 3 parents are irrelevant unless the child is born on american soil but only one parent need be a citizen so obama would be a natural born citizen even if he had been born in kenya trump has been bonkers since long before he ran now windmills cause cancer oops correction parents are irrelevant unless the child is not born on american soil so obama would be a natural born citizen even if he had been born in kenya false his mother was not old enough under the law in effect at that time to confer citizenship on him she was a citizen at birth on american soil to two natural parents smirk another bluff by a devoted birther well when the legal standard for who is and is not a natural born citizen has changed so many times a certain amount of ignorance on your part must be expected how many space aliens are still imprisoned in roswell nm was the moon landing faked do you vote the criteria for citizenship at birth changed over time and was more complicated than if you had one american parent in the case of citizenship status of a baby born abroad to a us citizen and a foreign national not a us citizen there are us residency length requirements for the us citizen prior to birth of the baby for the baby to gain us citizenship there used to be different requirements depending on whether the us parent was the mother or father with the citizenship preference going to the father at one time the residency requirement of the us citizen had to be fulfilled as an adult when i had looked into it given the laws at the time of obama s birth if obama had been born in kenya he would not have been a us citizen at birth as his mother had not yet fulfilled the required us residency term as an adult to see the complication of the current law https www law cornell edu uscode text 8 1401 the links to the previous law are left as an exercise for the interested reader kenya just like his grandmother said she stated she was there saw him being born within a couple of hours the you tube video was removed forever even if he was born in kenya his mother was a citizen and he was raised in the u s this is litterally just racist drivel your race baiting is a malignant societal cancer citizenship is not a race issue but a legal issue natural born citizenship questions were raised when john mccain ran for president having been born in the panama canal zone and he arranged for a sense of the senate resolution to at least assert that he was still a natural born citizen toddy pump where did you get that crazy conspiracy i had just demolished the entire package for the lie that suckered you a natural born citizen includes children born anywhere if at least one parent is a citizen and meets residence requirements that is how crazy trump is and i acknowledge you as a victim not a perp https reason com 2020 03 11 how government red tape stymied testing and made the coronavirus epidemic worse comment 8163409 kenya but who cares to be president both parents must be usa citizens at the time of birth it doesn t matter where he was born it matters that his father was not a citizen at the time of his birth and therefore he is not a natural born citizen and as per the constitution was not eligible to run kamala harris had no citizen parents when born and is also not eligible ted cruz not eligible either obviously you do not watch fox as they also have token guests from the opposition often ones that more honestly represent the oppositions actual positions caught another victim of trump birtherism already proved you wrong but yours is the worst reply https reason com 2020 03 11 how government red tape stymied testing and made the coronavirus epidemic worse comment 8163409 that has never been the requirement obviously you never watch cnn which has at least one republican on every panel where was obama born who fucking cares you drooling halfwit this article is about the fda and the cdc this post is about how fox news coverage is so radically different from it s ebola coverage hell reason s coverage is radically different we re supposed to panic about the disease that gives most people infected a case of the sniffles and when it was ebola a disease that kills currently half the people that get it we were told not to worry we all had as much chance of getting it as we did getting hit by lightening so get off your idiotic and endless prattling about birthers who cause is moot and respond to what s actually going on around you hey are you joe biden azathoth obviously you never watch cnn which has at least one republican on every panel where was obama born who fucking cares you drooling halfwit president donald j trump sneer not exactly unprovoked you re just as arrogant and condescending as anyone else here cnn s coverage stands in stark contrast to its coverage of the 2009 swine flu which they did their best to downplay http www cnn com 2009 health 04 28 regular flu iref mpstoryview back then they went to great paints to emphasize the fact that the regular flu kills 36 000 people per year and to reassure people the novel swine flu for which no vaccine was available was not grounds for any great concern you obviously have not been following the facts on this covid 19 is a unique threat because an infection shows no symptoms for 14 days you feel great but you re infected which makes you a potential threat to many others that s why so many were infected in that wa nursing home it s more dangerous for the elderly and there were many of them all living together as a community and you obviously need a refresher on the 2009 swine flu i think the reason to be concerned is we had a vaccine for regular flu said dr carlos del rio of the emory university school of medicine in atlanta georgia this is a totally new virus you have a virus to which there s no pre vaccination there s no prior immunity and therefore the mortality rate may be higher than other influenza viruses from https www cnn com 2009 health 04 28 swine flu index html it didn t turn out to have a very high mortality rate in the us but we didn t yet know that in the early months when it first appeared in mexico it looked quite deadly but it seems that was largely due to poverty and lack of resources in the region where it first showed up the corona virus is a unique threat because the symptoms are mild and invisible and will not kill a relatively healthy individual under the age of 60 the odds of survival is effectively 99 but the h1n1 infected 59 million americans cdc estimate and killed 120 000 americans in a more visible and perhaps painful manner therefore it was safer than the wuhan virus it killed more people in such a transparent chivalrous fashion umm covid 19 has just begun xm h1n1 killed between 12 000 18 000 americans not 120 000 i am making a good money 500 to 700 hr online on my ipad do not go to office i do not claim to be others i yoy will call yourself after doing this job it s a real job will be very lucky to refer to this here read more due to red tape the coronavirus outbreak in the u s will be worse than it should have been well that s a wild fucking jump to an unverifiable conclusion if i ve ever seen one a frustrated chu and her colleagues began testing on february 25 without government approval they almost immediately detected a coronavirus infection in a local teenager with no recent travel history chu warned local public health officials of her lab s finding and the teenager s school was closed as a precaution the teen s diagnosis strongly suggested that the disease had been circulating throughout the western part of washington for weeks we now know that that is likely true if it was already circulating for weeks prior to any testing why would the testing have made a difference if people are already infected testing them isn t going to stop the infection it sounds like she might have been able to test it earlier maybe by those weeks if the cdc had just said yes when she initially asked instead of giving het the run around my point is that there is no basis to conclude that earlier testing would have stemmed the spread of the virus testing allows infected persons to be identified so they can be isolated and stop spreading the virus it is the point of testing because infected people that aren t tested aren t infecting anyone right the point being missed yet again is that the people being tested are the one seeking medical care that is the most severe cases many people are asymptomatic are not getting tested and are spreading the virus this is not that difficult to understand many people are asymptomatic are not getting tested and are spreading the virus right what is actually happening is that this virus has been circulating since christmas time and only now are medical professionals checking to confirm whether that older person who died from pneumonia actually had flu or coronavirus in january my family orange county ca had several flu like bouts the only reason we are seeing the virus spread right now is that people are seeking care with only slight symptoms and they are testing more people this virus cannot be stopped unless you freeze everyone in place and test 100 of the population and quarantine them its infection and symptomatic attributes are impossible to track and reliably stop this is not that difficult to understand it is difficult to believe you d be stupid enough to make this argument that s not an argument dumbass like many conservative libertarian thinkers i think sero and the article s author have made themselfs the victims of confirmation bias consider the facts 1 all dr chu s specimens were acquired before jan 15 2020 patient 1 returned from wuhan to seattle without symptons on jan 15 he sought medical help on jan 19 precisely because of a health alert issued by the cdc the cdc authorized a corona test for him on jan 20 and amazingly got the result positive the same day this was outstanding work by the medical community and cdc my citation for this is https www nejm org doi full 10 1056 nejmoa2001191 i urge everyone to read it sometimes regulations can become an obstacle to speedy responses sometimes they prevent an andromeda strain type of disaster the scientific theory behind this is sometimes you eat the bear and sometimes the bear eats you what author ronald bailey has done here is to take an example of red tape and presume that it caused harm but none of dr shu s specimens could have shown positive for covid 19 since there was no virus present in washington state prior to jan 15 we know that for a fact we did not know for a fact at the time dr shu asked for permission that however remote it wouldn t cause an andromeda syndrome geraje guzba is not stupid he s right and you are not a dumbass you just need to pay more attention to misapplying postulates to specific circumstances finally reading these comments i am convinced that a worse threat than covid 19 is our collective indulgence in civil discord over the small sub sections of political disagreement compared to the vast social and philosophical principles that we share and which have allowed us to self govern for nearly 250 years so be nice and make sure all your facts are true read bailey again john gibson thank you for a sensible and civil response if only more commenters here were like you ladyhawk informs us it s okay to be a lying sack of shit defending needless suffering and possible deaths if done in a civil tone trump s base scary https reason com 2020 03 11 how government red tape stymied testing and made the coronavirus epidemic worse comment 8166691 i will not be civil amidst such moral atrocities john gibson another lying trumptard defending the willful negligence of this administration resulting in needless infections and deaths shameful but typical dissecting gibson s bullshit and dumbing it down 1 dr chu tested without government approval 2 quickly found an infected teen 3 warned local authorities 4 the teens school was closed down by defying both gibson and this administration chu assured that an infected teen would no longer be a threat to his het classmates did the same for any classmates that may be infected that is how heroes git er done bailey verbatim a frustrated chu and her colleagues began testing on february 25 without government approval they almost immediately detected a coronavirus infection in a local teenager with no recent travel history chu warned local public health officials of her lab s finding and the teenager s school was closed as a precaution the teen s diagnosis strongly suggested that the disease had been circulating throughout the western part of washington for weeks we now know that that is likely true trump was correct his supporters would lie to defend trump of even murder with witnesses trump himself is not the only dire threat to america well then let s run a little thought experiment and do the opposite delay the testing even more like that outcome what a fucking maroon you have inside that skull of yours let s run another thought experiment test every person in the united states that ll stop the spread and be a great allocation of limited resources asshole go back to fucking your cousin if we tested every american and quarantined those that tested positive from those that tested negative wouldn t that slow down the rate of new infections bullshit trump said that this virus is nothing just a bug the us is safe and it will all be over this week the dotard hath spake if we tested every american i really didn t think you would go beyond this point typically when somebody puts an impossible condition in a hypothetical it is to illustrate the absurdity of the position like you yours was absurd from the start it hasn t improved well you either test everyone and quarantine every county in the country impossible or pretend that testing a limited subset of individuals is going to stop the spread of infection by those that are asymptomatic contagious and untested again shut the fuck up moving the goal posts is going to stop no one said this but you i love your mental gymnastics though testing a limited subset of individuals is going to stop slow the spread of infection fify not moving any goal posts if testing doesn t stop infections then earlier testing without all the evil red tape wouldn t necessarily have stopped anyone from contracting the virus read the original article i suspect like most you went straight to the comments how does your foot taste if testing doesn t stop infections then earlier testing without all the evil red tape wouldn t necessarily have stopped anyone from contracting the virus your if would tell anyone with at least half a brain that you are full of shit idiot other than shitting on hihn it seems you re only capable of shitting in your own mouth and then complaining about the color your teeth i d tell you to go suck weinstein s dick but the only movie in which you d cast is a porno in which you suck weinstein s dick faggot yeah bailey assumes a lot in making the claim it is certainly possible that more testing sooner could have made things less bad but it s far from clear that it would have if it s in the country it will probably just have to run its course maybe civic minded healthy people should try to get it to get some immunity in the population a bigger point is if they had more knowledge about it they would have much more information with which to make decisions instead we have media pants shitting freaking people out and politicians throwing dirt clods and taking actions that could push the world economy into a bad recession or worse and fuckwits in the media and democrats same difference clapping their hands like trained seals because they think they finally got orange man bad our political class and media really are vile motherfuckers why do you excuse trump s disgusting and dangerous role in so many deaths and needless infections as you rage a partisan hissy fit would you have forbidden thousands of cruise ship passengers from leaving the ship for quarantine to be safely away from the dozen or so known infected passengers saying it s to keep the numbers low how many lives would you risk to defraud the media and protect your re election so many deaths and needless infections you just proved his point give me stats on how many deaths and needless infections he has caused yeah quarantining the passengers is what you do to prevent spread and needless deaths really you hate so much you can t think posted in self defense again that s twice so far ladyhawk called out again so many deaths and needless nfections you just proved his point give me stats on how many deaths and needless infections he has caused i jammed that up your ass here https reason com 2020 03 11 how government red tape stymied testing and made the coronavirus epidemic worse comment 8166697 where you shamefully defended blatant lies to hide the truth also the cruise ship where he forced thousands to remain on board among dozens of known infections and how many unknowns before finally allowing the passengers to depart directly into quarantine these are human lives put at needlessly grave risk by an ego maniacal president who keeps fucking up because of course he says he knows more than the experts what s your excuse my point is that there is no basis to conclude that earlier testing would have stemmed the spread of the virus not the least of which being that the evidence at least from the article anyway that chu s test definitively works fda standards aside is sparse at best for people who ve obsessed so heavily over an abstract and to a degree unknowable number like cfr ron and other s don t seem to give two shits about more concrete and knowable factors like sensitivity and specificity one thing very much overlooked is the legal ramifications i m not saying the cdc should be impeding the testing of new diagnostics but given the discussions about quarantine and getting reimbursed by the government whatever testing does take place is going to carry a gold shield of legal protection whether that s public or private testing if chu s test compels the cdc to quarantine someone falsely will chu s team or business be held responsible if you have fact based warnings then you can decide if action is needed if you don t know you can do nothing until people start dropping dead in the streets actually you have no point as earlier testing would definitely helped prepare better and it is absurd to take the position you have presented your position is no more than why bother trying no reason except reality you test people to track the spread of the virus and quarantine those who have it limiting the spread cdc is led by trump appointees now i guess they aren t libertarians https www vox com 2018 3 22 17150322 robert redfield cdc director trump do you have a link to anything showing that the policies in question came into being after 2016 but it s run by career civil servants yes minister should be required viewing trump changed the rule regarding testing being done by labs not approved by the fda but incorrectly blamed obama instead of bush the obama administration thought about abolishing the rule but did nothing all per politifact in an article titled trump wrongly blames obama for limits on coronavirus testing i m disappointed bailey didn t mention it it s more evidence trump is the most libertarian president in our lifetimes he deserves credit for a libertarian policy change congress gets no credit if it was already circulating for weeks prior to any testing why would the testing have made a difference if people are already infected testing them isn t going to stop the infection similar to my initial thought if you didn t do the testing until 20 days later and then concluded that the virus had been in circulation for weeks what good does closing the school down do at that point sounds like a trade of the old precautionary principle worshipping boss for a new precautionary principle worshipping boss you think there s one case that starts it all and nothing ever starts new spreading you think that once that initial case is out there no new cases can pop up how fucking dumb are you people you think that once that initial case is out there no new cases can pop up quite the opposite i think the incubation period is 5 days and it s not yet clear how long someone can shed the virus and shutting down the school something like 20 30 days after discovering the identity of patient not zero is literally closing the barn door after the horse is out you aren t protecting anyone from primary exposure at that point you re engaging in a kabuki theater to minimize marginal risk moreover one case literally does not an outbreak make if the virus were passed from one person to one person it wouldn t be an outbreak and the idea that they caught an outbreak testing retroactive samples is a bit of a non sequitur thank you incubation period is 9 1 days this depends on the source of the data and to a degree is a bit moot i ve heard as little as 5 days and as long as 14 and that the window for shedding is even wider point being before the 20 30 days in general population this kid definitely contracted the virus from someone likely in school and almost certainly passed it off to quite a few people in school who themselves almost certainly passed it on the incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 from publicly reported confirmed cases estimation and application there were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of covid 19 the median incubation period was estimated to be 5 1 days 95 ci 4 5 to 5 8 days and 97 5 of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11 5 days ci 8 2 to 15 6 days of infection some might put your head on a pike for the woulda coulda shouldas around using and spreading outdated inaccurate or unsafe information i m not one of those people and in that 11 5 days the 97 5 of people who will develop symptoms will come into contact with thousands of people and each one of those will come into contact with thousands of people we re already in the millions here because it s a cold that spreads like a cold and acts like a cold it s not the flu and when people finally stop running in circles and screaming and shouting we ll discover that there were enormous numbers of infected that no one ever knew about and that will push the mortality rate into the same place as all other cold mortality rates the times when you wish you had a surveilance state no though that is the ultimate end point of the precautionary principle in your dictatorship having it spread through schools may well be the best way to get through this or find a vaccine but that will take a long time and it s not easy to mass produce quickly it won t go away until the population has some immunity exactly i ve been thinking the closing of schools and events is only going to prolong the problem i say keep them open but elderly and ill should not attend their choice and if a family member does get sick they should keep to themselves since a vaccine maybe years away are we going to shut everything down that long no an people will start to ignore it after a month i m one who thinks they have pushed to many pandemics that never came thru and calling this a pandemic is laughable based on past experince it ll have to run its course the goal is to delay and widen the time in which it runs its course one of the big threats from something like this is over running the medical system and general emergency systems i may be wrong i like almost if not everyone else here have no background in medicine or studying the transmission of diseases but schools seem prone to very fast rapid transmission since kids are filthy and in close contact i also have no medical expertise so i may be talking out my ass but maybe it would be for the best if it tore through the schools like when people used to deliberately get their kids infected with at the time unavoidable childhood diseases to get it all done with at once it needs to spread as slowly as possible so hospitals aren t overwhelmed with serious cases getting everyone sick at once is a recipe for disaster does zeb mean the crazed anti vaxxers who should be legally liable for the consequences of medical expenses and or deaths caused by their actions or do they demand to be treated kinda like welfare mooches not sure why zeb shares trump s goal of allowing as many deaths as possible does zeb mean the crazed anti vaxxers no what he s referring to predates the anti vax movement parent s would take their healthy kids over to infected kids houses just to get it over with in cases like chicken pox they wanted to ensure that that the kids got it as children due to the potentially severe consequences of contracting it as an adult there was even a south park episode about it yes it s hilarious trump s goal of allowing as many deaths as possible right as soon as he was advised about covid 19 he immediately thought to himself i wonder how may corpses we can rack up while a grinch like grin spread across his face even if you meant what you wrote as mere sarcasm it s the kind of wording that has a chilling effect on meaningful conversation you re not helping anyone by posting things like that he s still intentionally minimizing the virus efforts to help his re election and he said so the cruise ship where he refused to release thousands of passengers forcing them to stay on a ship with dozens of infected passengers saying it was to keep the numbers down they were not then counted as infections in america thank god the cdc pushed trump aside sent the ship to a remote port and the passengers left the ship directly into quarantine his oval office address was a massive failure the overnight futures market crashed immediately on friday the dow crashed over 10 the largest one day decline since 1987 nobody has faith in your orange god no other stock exchange has seen anything close to ours now losing more percentage wise than the crash of 1929 and their countries have many more deaths and infections but never allow needless death and suffering to damage campaign slogans his own daughter ivanka met with a man later found to be infected this virus takes 14 days to show any symptoms fourteen days but trump says you don t need a test until thank god the head of the cdc was badgered into committing himself to making the tests free at a congressional hearing and trump reversed his earlier refusal in his friday presser the jackboot press conference where he shut down the reporters mics so they could not ask followups and i m sure it s a safe cocoon for you containing fox breitbart limbaugh and infowars are we clear now this one is not sarcasm either i prefer to keep discourse civil including online so throwing around terms like tds isn t what i generally do but some people make it really challenging to adhere to that stance his oval office address was a massive failure i m guessing you ve seen trump speak publicly before nothing about his unique ability to mangle sentences semantics and speech in general should surprise you or anyone else who s paying even a modicum of attention thanks for the all caps though that and bolding the entire post is sure to open everyone s eyes you ve done the forum a great service no really nobody has faith in your orange god i m sure it s a safe cocoon for you containing fox breitbart limbaugh and infowars it s amazing how someone can be so presumptive about a person s political views based on scanty evidence nothing in the post to which you responded could reasonably be construed as a representation of vigorous let alone religiously fervent support for trump it seems to me that you re seeing what you want to see rather than assessing my words and those of others here in a dispassionately rational manner afaict even when someone posts an objectively reasoned assessment of trump if that assessment is not full on anti trump then you automatically dismiss it apparently considering any expression of fact or opinion which is not vehemently anti trump as worthy of only vitriol are we clear now this one is not sarcasm either hmmm i m still not sure whether you truly mean it perhaps if you had managed to increase the font size to 48pt your post would have been sufficiently convincing but i m just not feeling it sneer his oval office address was a massive failure i m guessing you ve seen trump speak publicly before nothing about his unique ability to mangle sentences semantics and speech in general should surprise you or anyone else who s paying even a modicum of attention whooooooooooooooooooooooooooosh 1 the overnight futures market crashed immediately 2 then the dow crashed over 10 the worst decline since 1987 he had hoped to reassure americas but scared the crap out of the markets that is failure not his grammar thanks for the all caps though that and bolding the entire post is sure to open everyone s eyes that was ridicule so is this it s amazing how someone can be so presumptive about a person s political views based on scanty evidence you were lying nothing in the post to which you responded could reasonably be construed as a representation of vigorous let alone religiously fervent support for trump i did not say otherwise but all the falsehoods and myths p s your snarky reply failed to even address the main point all that trump has done and failed to do to minimize this crisis what you asked me to detail and i did p p s i just read that his administration will cut cdc spending ooops wow so much to unpack here that i ll just offer a few responses regarding the markets the obsessive focus on them by the media the public and politicians is almost useless short term extreme volatility doesn t inform us of much except that trump is a poor orator which we all know and that stock prices often suffer from the whims of perception driven investor mobs also what i stated regarding his public speech covered more than simply grammar though disingenuously reducing it to that certainly made it easier to deride yes i admit to including some mild though not harsh ridicule i feel that the general tone of your posts plus your particular habit of cherry picking snippets of the posts to which you respond and then railing against those snippets while ignoring the context in which they had been written earned you a little snark no need to thank me you referred to trump as my orange god and directly implied that i m a consumer of infowars and similar drivel when i observed that you had no evidence upon which to base that claim your response was that you did not say otherwise a trivially obvious lie which you thought worthy of all caps the evidence backing that is all right here in this sub thread should anyone have the stomach to wade through your frantic missives you closed your post with a statement which in your obvious fervor to respond to things i didn t actually write shows that you managed to delude yourself into thinking that i had asked you to detail anything i didn t and again all the posts are right here to provide plain evidence of that furthermore my initial criticism of your writings was solely to mock your assertion that trump has a goal of allowing as many deaths as possible your words nothing else if you had simply claimed trump is incompetent that would have been entirely reasonable and my post likely would have been limited to the part about what some parents used to do about common childhood diseases i ll try again to convey something which i believe should be important to you you aren t helping yourself or the views you represent by approaching dialogue in the ways you do it s clear from your posts despite the vitriol they contain that you re easily smart enough to grasp that and to do better i hope you re not coming here just to provoke abuse because that would be a waste of your capabilities hand gg earlier testing would have identified cases when there were many fewer infected folks those relatively few folks could have been isolated quarantined and their contacts traced and monitored such early interventions would have prevented thousands more people from being infected thus stopping slowing the epidemic man ron no point in trying to explain that to these numbskulls they don t want to know any better they are happiest being stupid and showing the world how stupid they are ronald you are assuming there were fewer infected folks to test in the first place what is your source for that the incubation period for covid 19 is approximately two weeks give or take many of those infected are asymptomatic and contagious during that period and even when symptoms arise most cases do not appear to be severe enough to warrant seeking medical treatment the people being tested and testing positive are often the worst case scenarios basing quarantine protocols on those cases will not guarantee containment since there are likely many more individuals that will never be tested that are infecting others indeed as professor perkins concludes in the twitter feed you cite there are a lot of undetected cases out there further he concludes another important lesson is that it looks like increased diagnostic testing might be helping that said we re still probably missing more infections than we re finding and testing will have to keep up with the seemingly exponential growth of the virus as far as i m aware there is no existing estimate for initial pool of infected individuals to conclude that testing even quarantine measures would have resulted in less infections is still quite a large leap as they say garbage in garbage out what you think the infection starts once and never keeps on spreading you really ought to stop advertising how incredibly stupid you are it makes you look stupid i mean what do you when you get in your car in the morning do you look at the speedometer once and never again do you look at the morning temperature and assume it never changes for the rest of the day or week or eternity do you assume your coffee cup never empties once filled things change bud that s why things need constant monitoring heaven help you if you ever get up in the middle of the night and check the temperature by mistake you ll be dressed for 30 when you get to the office if you have nothing to add shut your mouth idiot take your own medicine much tip if you swallow all the pills at once you ll sleep like a baby you already think like one so go for it it makes you look stupid that s not just appearance gg i am puzzled could it be that red tape delays in the deployment of testing is a big part of the explanation of why there are a lot of undetected cases out there it certainly could be but you didn t hedge in your article you didn t present a possibility you presented an absolute as though it was thoroughly established and that was my objection the other possibility is that testing is only partially effective and that more testing isn t necessarily going to stop the spread of the virus this there are a number of other possibilities none considered it is possible as you admit but ron asserts as absolutely true that earlier accurate testing would have been helpful certainly possible likelihood unknown at this point on the other hand it is possible that the virus has already spread far and wide that nearly everyone has already been exposed to it that it s fatality rate is much much lower than has been initially assessed and that all testing and indeed all of the current government actions are pointless likelihood unknown at this point it is also possible that a fully free market on coronavirus testing would have resulted in a vast plethora of tests many of them worthless ridiculous or outright dangerous rip off your right pinky toenail and check the blood color to see if you re infected works every time likelihood unknown and unknowable for the record i think that fda cdc getting in the way of other qualified professionals trying to carry out tests is monumentally stupid and as a prediction saying the u s spread will be worse because of red tape seems fine as one s own prediction but it s nowhere near a fait accompli personally i think it s already spread to the far corners of the globe and is nowhere near as dangerous as being sold but ianad just a math and statistics guy nearly everyone has already been exposed to it that it s fatality rate is much much lower than has been initially assessed that seems pretty likely to me i don t see a lot of reason to believe that the numbers of infected people reported are not just the more severe cases i suspect that it swept through the central us around mid february i was just reading about the symptoms people are reporting before coming over to reason and they re pretty much what i and those i know well had experienced i don t usually get sick anymore or if i do get a seasonal cold it s generally just enough nasal congestion to be annoying for two or three days while my co workers are hacking up their lungs and taking sick days but whatever made the rounds in february kicked my ass i was telling a friend that i had forgotten how bad being sick could be plus the symptoms were just as unusual as what s being reported including the diarrhea for a day and strange headache everyone i know or work with got it and it hammered pretty much all the ones over 30 most peoples kids came through it easily if they got sick at all some of my co workers and most of my friends are older though under 70 and a few have weakened immune systems but nobody shit the bed or was even hospitalized i bet an antibody test would show all of us around here as having been already exposed you admit your definitive assertion is based solely on a possibility there won t be an admission or a modification of the article s unsupported conclusion that would requires journalistic integrity something that is sorely lacking here at reason without the hysterical headlines nobody would read this rag the goal of this article and other like it is to use every contrivance and misrepresentation of fact to somehow link the spread of the virus and any resulting deaths to trump s alleged incompetence it is dishonest hackery there s not a single mention of trump or connection to him in the article do you think that we re better off with less testing read the rest of the comments and stop being deliberately obtuse the intentions are clear enough bailey throws out some asinine red meat and all the tds afflicted retards lap it right the fuck up i made my points clear already if you had ready any of the prior exchanges above you d know exactly what my position is now go ahead and set up the gg thinks less testing and more people dying is a good thing strawman that you were going to set up in any event fuck off fuck off you first make the world a more intelligent place in the words of joe biden i ll knock you the fuck out you cod phased peony shoulder gg i am puzzled that much is obvious at least when it comes to the difference between speculation and fact oh and it could be true therefor it is isn t an argument that should be made let alone taken seriously by anyone with an i q north of room temperature isn t that bailey s argument you are arguing against reason and logic what is your point what would be better to do than the feeble things we are doing omfg ronald you are assuming there were fewer infected folks to test in the first place what is your source for that not what he said lol if the testing had done a month ago their would be fewer infected folks in cases like this the number of infected folks keeps increasing perhaps forever like the flu do the math i ll dumb it down 1 testing would have allowed fewer infected folks 2 since you don t understand what infectious means in infectious diseases if fewer people are infected then they cannot transmit the infections to others 3 then again even a stable genius cannot do the elementary math donald j trump trump called the virus a hoax and said democrats were fearmongering for suggesting serious action literally never happend literally insane you and trump or desperation trump called the virus a hoax when bullshit is all you ve got ok trump called criticism of his incompetent response to the virus a hoax i guess the buck stops at the cdc and trump was right everyone has jumped on the trump fucked this up bandwagon and when asked to identify what was done improperly the conversation inevitably devolves into a debate about whether or not trump has provided people with sufficient emotional coddling to get them through this apocalyptic event he hired john bolton wow you guys live under a rock to busy circle jerking yourselves with drool dripping off their chins when not french kissing trump s lard ass slurp slurp ok trump called criticism of his incompetent response to the virus a hoax in other words you lied and quiet clumsily he didn t call it a hoax he implied it was but why are you idiots defending him anyway and not addressing real criticism https www snopes com fact check trump coronavirus rally remark jesus christ ron when you argue with retards it only encourages them to think they might have a valid point ron is there a reason why we re talking about the one call her test made that saved teh chillunz rather than talking about how out of the huge number of patients they tested dozens tested positive or not and all of them went on to develop the illness or not absolutely don t disagree that the fda shouldn t be standing in the way of diagnosis but citing this anecdote seems a bit like the very sort of lab to newsroom sans peer review sensation that yourself scientists and libertarians would generally decry as dishonest and irresponsible even if it turned out ok mr bailey you can t be serious you state gg earlier testing would have identified cases when there were many fewer infected folks then answer this how can specimens collected weeks and months before the arrival of the virus in the u s reveal the presence of the virus dr shu had a huge number of specimens exactly how many is huge how lon g would it have taken t o test all of them what would it have cost the cdc confirmed a positive test on jan 20 i have no criticism of dr shu but every doctor in seattle should have known what was afoot as of jan 21 whether dr shu tested or not nothing would have turned out differently you are simply in error about this testing all flu patients would been futile costly and scientifically unsound educate yourself to avoid displaying your ignorance there have been many infected people with no known contact with a traveler from abroad direct or indirect and because a near majority of the symptoms are quite mild you have no clue on the timing and or number of infections proof john gibson lying sack of shit whether dr shu tested or not nothing would have turned out differently you are simply in error about this what a disgrace you people are 1 shu tested without government approval 2 discovered an infected teenager 3 alerted authorities who closed down the kid s school 4 she saved kids from infection and possible death by defying trump s cdc red tape and defying you how many others would be at risk if those kids had become infected and in their community what bailey actually reported my emphasis a frustrated chu and her colleagues began testing on february 25 without government approval they almost immediately detected a coronavirus infection in a local teenager with no recent travel history chu warned local public health officials of her lab s finding and the teenager s school was closed as a precaution the teen s diagnosis strongly suggested that the disease had been circulating throughout the western part of washington for weeks we now know that that is likely true how many more infections and deaths if shu had not defied the federal government gibson how many infections and deaths did you defend by lying like trump you value his re election above human life the lives of even schoolkids are you a father shame on you knowledge of the results of testing is what changes the actions of people and govts if you don t know shit then you believe that it s nothing at all and so you do nothing if you take pride in that ignorance then you assert that everything is under control and anything to the contrary is fake news meanwhile tick tock tick tock tick tock the virus keeps growing and that early ignorance turns into total stubbornness and a refusal to face reality this nobody is taking pride in ignorance the fatal assumption in this article is that there was a readily identifiable pool of infectious individuals that could have been quarantined had they been tested as promptly as possible whereas most of the evidence points in the other direction that is there are many undetected and practically speaking undetectable cases of infection throughout the general population of course knowledge influences actions incomplete knowledge is different to affirmatively state that earlier testing would have prevented further spread of the virus is just not supported by the evidence nobody is taking pride in ignorance trump was completely focused on making sure the numbers stayed low esp in comparison to other countries he wasn t interested in numbers that were accurate he was interested in numbers that make him look good this problem started inside the cdc but there was absolutely zero pressure from above to clear out the constipation the reverse the pressure from the wh was to keep the numbers low and the way you keep the numbers low is don t test what you don t know doesn t show up in the numbers as recently as this weekend when trump toured the cdc he was publicly complaining about the cruise ship american ship that loaded already infected american passengers crew from an american port docking because he didn t want those numbers added to the us numbers and he was praising the tests nothing about this is an indication of anyone taking pride in ignorance let alone trump given stories about potentially infectious patients being let out of quarantine i do not blame trump for exercising doubt about letting infected passengers be quarantine on land https www texastribune org 2020 03 01 san antonio coronavirus patient was released after weakly positive tes ffs look at the videos of trump at the cdc at his press conference his own words coming out of his own mouth trump deferred to the cdc i don t see how anything is an indication that anyone let alone trump is taking pride in ignorance nothing in bailey s article even mentioned trump but you know tds it is more infectious than the coronavirus why would he be deferring to anybody i like this stuff i really get it every one of these doctors said how do you know so much about this maybe i have a natural ability maybe i should have done that instead of running for president i don t care what he says as long as he does what is required and he does maybe we need another article about how trump tweets mean things therefore the virus will kill us all he hasn t done shit about the virus the only thing he gives a shit about outside himself is the markets markets puke for a fucking week and he s really quick to offer bailouts and other bs that will by the end of this year with more market puking cost a fuckload more than tarp and do nothing except reinforce the asset bubble of the 1 people die and he is so totally unaware of reality history that he retweets a meme that snarkily compares him to nero while commenting who knows what this means but it sounds good to me he is dumber than a cucumber which is fine it s your ilk s response to that that is the real problem keep praying for that apocalypse free and how dare he help the 1 by proposing the reduction or elimination of payroll taxes he hasn t done shit about the virus how inverted is your view of reality jesus fuck you people are hopeless utterly and completely deranged why would he be deferring to anybody why in a situation about an infectious disease would trump defer to the doctors at the centers for disease control what an idiot he should have done what exactly we reached the point the day after the election where anything trump does is wrong according to you people and it s just gotten worse from that point onward https www washingtonpost com opinions 2020 03 10 no president trump coronavirus wont be fixed by positive thinking no president trump the coronavirus won t be fixed by positive thinking gasbag blowhard please listen you don t know what you re missing donald s ass don t be kissin trump won t love you he ll push and shove you he ll take your vote then call you a goat he ll tax your money then steal your honey your pussy he will grab your back he will stab his victims routines he s iterating shit about you he ll be twitterating have you ever tried swallowing a fork that s the latest virus test i do not blame trump for exercising doubt about letting infected passengers be quarantine on land gasbag blowhard if people with infections are left in ships at sea they are in crowded conditions more crowding means more disease transmission their supplies have to be ferried to them and their shit and garbage has to be brought back to land unless you want to dump it to sea all the extra handling of materials back and forth means more people exposed as well as higher costs land facilities have better safer sanitation infrastructure by far safer and cheaper but noooo typical trump he wants to appeal to fear keep those cooties away from us next he will be calling to have these ships nuked from orbit you can also stick a fork in an outlet you tell me good sir why they would make the holes on an outlet so perfectly align with the prongs on a fork tell me gasbag blowhard cannot win arguments or make polite conversation even with anyone whose trump worshipping rituals differ in the slightest ways with gasbag blowhard s rituals gasbag blowhard can t handle facts and logic so gasbag blowhard constantly resorts to childish insults instead quite typical of all of the gasbag blowhards that i have ever known i can t make polite conversation with mentally ill libertarians that host websites identifying all the people that have been mean to them on the internet as though anybody gives a shit i can be polite for the record will you kill yourself please a typical gasbag blowhard s idea of a polite conversation a polite greeting per gasbag blowhards in nazi germany heil hitler a gasbag blowhard s idea of a polite conversation a polite greeting per gasbag blowhards in the usa today kill yourself observe and learn the ways and the ideas about an ideal society of gasbag blowhards in the usa today folks add me to your list then kill yourself nobody is taking pride in ignorance i disagree chu s test called one patient a number that we know and they pretty openly admit can t be correct moreover we they presumably know the outcome of her patients and testing we aren t discussing that because some people would prefer to shame others for acting out of ignorance rather than acknowledge their own just imagine if chu s test were right the government could quarantine people faster and harder and if her test is just as bad as the one the cdc developed they could quarantine people just as wrongly progress ber alles you are taking pride in your own ignorance and in wanting everybody else to know less the less the better according to you fuck off he s right you know you re arguing that having more information is useless because it s not going to solve every problem but this researcher already had her samples and her tests what s the harm in allowing her to go forward without the high holy priesthood of government bestowing their blessings on the proceedings it s not like she was interrupting her production of a universal cure for cancer in order to do the tests she was already running tests on flu swabs you sound like the sort of person who scoffs at wearing seat belts because if a 747 falls out of the sky and lands on your car a seat belt won t save you you re arguing that having more information is useless because it s not going to solve every problem never made that argument but ok no you didn t but this thread is derailed to criticize bailey deservedly in my judgement for claiming something too strongly when the real point is why the fda and the cdc think it s their place to stop people from gathering information on the virus that would be a fair point to make but bailey decided to publish pointless clickbait instead gasbag blowhard is the essential example of click bait but surprise surprise gasbag blowhard provides no coherent thoughts or links or factual or logical underpinnings of support of any kind to support the position of gasbag blowhard shall we be all surprised when gasbag blowhard calls for the assembly at midnight of all and sundry supporters of gasbag blowhard on the local street corner and there is zero response count me among the broken hearted paid my dime and only farted no but having an idea of the extent to which it already has spread can help plan a more sensible response anyway by what authority can the fda tell chu to cease and desist testing samples she already has with whatever tests she has anyway by what authority can the fda tell chu to cease and desist testing samples she already has with whatever tests she has i wasn t privy to the specific discussion but have been a part of numerous discussions with various parts of the fda they re usually pretty clear that you are free to test all you like you just can t contact patients and inform them of any results without the fda s approval the sort of thing that goes back to a mandate in the 30s when quacks would prescribe snake oil to treat non existent diseases i agree it would be nice to say those days are long behind us and the fda is near entirely useless but theranos https en wikipedia org wiki theranos theranos claimed its technology was revolutionary and that its tests required only about 1 100 to 1 1 000 of the amount of blood that would ordinarily be needed and cost far less than existing tests a turning point came in 2015 when medical research professors john ioannidis and eleftherios diamandis and investigative reporter john carreyrou of the wall street journal questioned the validity of theranos technology doesn t look like it was the fda that sounded any alarms there doesn t look like it was the fda that sounded any alarms there i thought the idea was that the cdc is exercising too heavy of a hand in shutting down bogus diagnostics a priori which is it goldilocks i was addressing your claim that the fda is necessary because of theranos when the fda had nothing to do with exposing the fraud nice try with the red herring though so how long after the wsj ran the article did the wsj shut down theranos if the wsj was sounding alarms then to whom in 2012 safeway invested 350 million into retrofitting 800 locations with clinics that would offer in store blood tests however after many missed deadlines and questionable results from a trial clinic at safeway s corporate offices the deal was called off in 2015 you can shove your own red herring right up your ass it s explicitly not the fda s job to comb the literature and shut down companies proactively the theme of the article is criticizing the cdc for being that proactive and then some so which is it goldilocks do we empower the fda and cdc to shut down sham medical and diagnostics more proactively or disempower so that shame medical and diagnostics companies can operate with greater impunity having an idea of the extent to which the virus has already spread is good but it does not retroactively reduce the number of those already infected including those that were not tested which is the argument bailey is making that is my only problem the notion that prompt and complete testing would have reduced the number of infections is unsupported it presumes there was a readily identifiable group of infected individuals just waiting to be identified and quarantined the reality is likely much closer to a scenario where the number of infected individuals greatly outnumbers the number of the patients that have been tested positive it is of course good to identify those who are infected but if those tests come at a time when that infected person has already infected others and those others have already infected others and so on and so forth is the testing really preventing anything bailey s argument is that the testing would have actually prevented the net number of individuals infected but there is really no way to know that it is pure speculation no it won t treat those already infected quarantined work however by decreasing the number of infectious patients interacting with the public while you would still have undetected cases not tested you have decreased the number of potential disease spreaders eventually this will slow the spread as you identify more and more infectious patients the earlier this is done the fewer who need to be quarantined it really isn t difficult delay in testing increases rather then decreases the number of people who need to be identified and quarantined eventually the number grows exponentially to large to deal with or the disease dies out on it s ow figuratively sometimes literally testing also allows you to identify others who need to be tested the longer you wait for testing the larger this population becomes eventually it becomes to large to test testing in january would have reduced the number considerably compared to waiting until march even if the disease first entered the us in december testing also allows you to identify others who need to be tested the longer you wait for testing the larger this population becomes eventually it becomes to large to test testing in january would have reduced the number considerably compared to waiting until march even if the disease first entered the us in december all this assumes the testing either way is meaningful fda standards aside i see precisely very little evidence of that being the case and for that the article should be criticized on scientific grounds we tested a bunch of samples one came up positive and we shut down a school long after the patient s illness had run its course is pretty obviously trading one set of self righteous extra precautionary stiffs in lab coats for another set of self righteous extra precautionary stiffs in lab coats wasn t there an article on reason about not using wuhan covid 19 virus to push your pet political issue i guess libertarians might as well push their issues if the china bad and free healthcare for all crowds are pushing theirs if people are already infected testing them isn t going to stop the infection geraje guzba virus expert and general expertologist of all expertology has spoken geraje guzba is actually projecting here if geraje guzba knew that he or she or it had ebola and aids syphilis and gonorrhea got tested for them and knew all about it he she or it would not change his her its behaviour and would keep right on sneezing or cumming or puking on everyone in sight geraje guzba having no consideration for anyone would ignore test results and do nothing about it to protect others projection at work here folks fuck off hihn does geraje have some daily quota to meet for totally bizarre comments if it was already circulating for weeks prior to any testing why would the testing have made a difference if people are already infected testing them isn t going to stop the infection 1 they d know to be quarantined which includes staying home and or staying i believe 6 feet away from others 2 the virus has no symptoms for 14 days that is why testing is so critical well that s a wild fucking jump to an unverifiable conclusion if i ve ever seen one no further comment needed it would have made a difference because we could have started mitigation measures a month earlier look at italy that s us if we don t get our shit together due to red tape the coronavirus outbreak in the u s will be worse than it should have been of course centralizing authority to provide medical testing prevents and slows testing this is the unseen of what central planning prevents seen reason used to have articles on how the fda generally murdered 100 000 americans a year by slowing adoption of effective treatments will reason ever go libertarian on healthcare and support a general right to self treat from providers and suppliers of your choice instead of the fda s choice they demand the right to get stoned but not the right to heal ourselves testing for corona virus primarily serves a public health purpose can you imagine the chaos that would ensue if some academics got the test wrong and spread inaccurate information about disease prevalence the thousands of lives that would be wrecked by the state because of false test results under our current system test results cause severe state action and false test results are a disaster that s why these tests are currently regulated then mandate the state can t act on the information until verified by the cdc most people when they learn they might have a deadly disease will take actions to prevent others from catching it and then we d get articles slamming the cdc for wasting precious time with futile verification procedures then mandate the state can t act on the information until verified by the cdc i m not king so i can t mandate that and politicians aren t going to mandate that for the simple reason that they would be blamed if someone diagnosed by an unofficial test would then go on to infect others so your proposal is not feasible you re welcome to try and come up with a feasible proposal you re welcome to try and come up with a feasible proposal i doubt anything proposed is going to happen thus all proposals are infeasible no true snotsman right because government never gets it wrong the state gets things wrong frequently what does that have to do with what we are talking about god you are dumb state mandates to prevent bad tests from giving false positives served only to provide us with a flawed state mandated test that gave many false positives meanwhile actual smart people who know what they are doing are prevented from fixing the situation because dumb asses like you think government knows best n and now we get to see how excessive regulation stymieing the early collection of accurate information will get to wreck thousands of lives repeating an unsupported conclusion doesn t make it true mr bailey the article provides the supported conclusion read what is written not what you want it to be i already had a long discussion with mr bailey he admits as much i don t expect you to keep up with every post but if you re going to comment know what you re talking about otherwise move along since there is no evidence to support otherwise you can t claim its not supported learn about the real world and move along to recap bailey made an unsupported claim in the most absolute of terms admitted he did so and then you chimed in with the eminently brilliant notion that bailey is actually correct because his detractors cannot disprove his assertion is it gold stars or blue ribbons these days anyone what do they give the retarded kids these days you re making a total public fool of yourself geraje and that s an understatement you re making a total public fool of yourself geraje and that s an understatement geraje is humiliating himself in publlic proof will get to wreck thousands of lives see you keep going down this path unsupported this virus is a perfect storm many people get it and don t know it many people spread it before they know it by their own statistics if a person has gone in with health problems probably 10 other people around them are spreading the virus without noticing more than a bad cold whether we were testing in january or testing in february this virus was going to get out of control you talk about all these other countries that were more aggressive with testing and yet among countries with heavy travel and dense urban areas few countries are in as good a state as the united states i agree that the red tape should be gone but i agree with others who point out that there is a high likelihood this virus was out of control even before this dr chu took her first test i don t understand why it is suddenly sacrilege to point this out my guess is that admitting things are being handled relatively well undermines the orange man bad narrative frankly i don t give a fuck about trump i care about people misrepresenting the facts because accurate reporting would make trump maybe potentially even for a split second appear to be deserving of at least some credit however minuscule and the regulated cdc test got it wrong can you imagine the chaos that would ensue if some academics got the test wrong they already got some of the tests they were given wrong lol not saying your point isn t on the nose just saying our government sucks aparently uniquely as other states are doing just fine libertarians for central planning and control of healthcare clownworld the only shocker here is the fact that the article was run by the nyt that was my surprise reaction too i have zero faith in the nyt s old motto all the news that s fit to print it seems to have become all the propaganda we want to brainwash you with and i keep on wondering what their real motive is more funding for the cdc and fda is my only guess my guess is that ron selectively edited the nyt s story i d guess the nyt throughout the story referred to trump s cdc and the trump administration and trump officials never missing an opportunity to suggest this is all trump s fault the truth is the cdc was given the job back in the 50 s of developing a plan for dealing with a biological weapons attack on the united states as well as all manner of infectious disease outbreaks and if their plan for dealing with a public health disaster of the magnitude of a new flu outbreak was to develop a plan for dealing with a public health disaster of the magnitude of a new flu outbreak i d have to say they re not doing a very good job more funding for the cdc and fda is my only guess discredit the cdc move straight from bench to public knowledge reporting the nyt is the record why bother with the cdc especially when bad people can fuck with it afaict chu s test made one right call maybe but you and others are certain that any skeptic that reasonably doubts such fantastic claims is labeled an idiot all the news that fits the narrative since the narrative this week is how trump s fda bungled coronavirus testing it gets in all the same principles of centralized control crippling healthcare have applied for decades reason used to write articles on how the fda was murdering about 100 000 americans a year by slowing adoption of effective practices i d say that s a wild underestimte of deaths caused by medical central plannind and control i doubt this estimate takes into account the compounding effects on the advance of medical care possible in a free society government systematic failure orange man bad run story the systemic failure was defunding the cdc for 12 years and letting john bolton cripple it even further the man failed his way to the top of washington orange man is an egotistical maniac who downplays everything in the most comical way bad thing will magically dissapear i have only the best people the fact that it s a story is normal what is not normal is how much you trumptards trust this crazy spoiled unprofitable billionaire but you will soon see your cult around this man will fall apart and you ll take the country with you also trump shut down a white house pandemic department in 2018 people keep saying trump needs to listen to the cdc but here is more proof that not only did the cdc fail with their own test they won t allow others to test maybe trump was right he does no more than everyone else https www vox com 2018 3 22 17150322 robert redfield cdc director trump so he put someone in who actually worked in the real world thank goodness for trump trump said he is a medical genius when he visited the cdc trump don t need no fucking experts he a genius but he s a stable genius about everything quotes from the donald in the anti gravity column in august 2017 scientific american magazine follow i have great genes and all that stuff which i m a believer in god helped me by giving me a certain brain i have a

insisting windmills cause cancer https time com 5649313 trump wind cancer iowa president trump says wind turbines cause cancer 99 of iowans disagree i hang my head in shame and fess i did not know well now i know ah does now consider meself to be edumacated thanks yew thanks i appreciate the correction but the gomers think you and i one person it is idiotic to have anything reside with the central government that require fast decision making if they want to offer coordination and have pre emptive powers after a showing of need ok had this been free market fools would have been able to buy these tests about 3 weeks after china started identifying the virus there are now a bunch of backlogged reagents chemical ingredients that are now being cranked out but that message that the market was short too far too long to communicate and undoubtedly would have flowed faster from one of 500 testing companies vs the central gov t exactly another item of note is the left and media demanding that trump and the cdc give difinitive orders instead of letting the individual states determine how to react i like the differing states doing different things to see which works best because in reality the cdc doesn t know whats best but i think they want trump to do something authoritarian mainly to attack him for doing just that ron s proposal seems really nuts but let s find out so we did it we ran tests for a month in all 50 states each state devised their own tactics in only a month we d know what works best simple well don t do what ohio texas idaho missouri and illinois did why not combined and adjusted for population their infection rate was nearly twice the average and 63 more people died per 1 000 that s so sad did all those people have to die they had no choice on experimenting but picked the worst tactics for those states we need to stop this can t why not a conspiracy freak named ron imagined a new sinister conspiracy of the left and media to foment hysteria and damage our president s re election okay we can t stop the testing can we get ron to shut up and sit down probably not of the seven conspiracies living with monsters under ron s bed five of them are severe threats to america to ron those 63 deaths are a small price to pay to save millions right i m wondering why you think the federal government wouldn t pick whatever hypothetical tactics it was that ohio texas idaho missouri and illinois picked we can kill an extra 63 people per 1000 in the whole country instead of just 5 states as a bonus our one size fits all federally mandated tactics can paralyze remote settlements in alaska for no good reason while being wholly inadequate in downtown nyc have an adult read and explain it to you i simply don t have enough hours or patience for more than some quick and obvious advice and comment 1 mine should be self evident as ridicule of ron s dumbass idea showing why it s dumbass 2 my hypothetical never mentions or even suggests any role for the federal government so i again suggest you find an adult with the time and the patience to help you through your obviously paranoid delusions 3 you also fucked up ron s proposal again delusional he never says anyone would pick any tactics he is so confident that the safest tactics lowest death rates would then be adopted by all states measured and compared per the type of crazed federalism popular among alt right gomers 4 you may be an alt right gomer yourself since you agree ron is bat shit crazy or want to know if he is your response should have been directed at ron 5 unless if you re really saying the federal government would intentionally urge how to kill the very highest number of people and you are not not joining my own satire as ridicule then a you re even crazier than ron is or b you assume congress would continue allowing president trump to kill even more than he has so far or c you assume ron wants to remove trump from killing more people including possibly himself which would give us the far worse pence as president who as governor said he d deal with an hiv crisis in his state by praying since god almighty would strike him dead for helping any goddamn faggots who should have been stoned to death on the steps of the state capitol building 6 sorry i ve already devoted more time than your query deserves if you need more you ll need to hopefully find an adult with the time and patience to read it to you ever so slowly explain it in the simplest of terms for you wipe the drool dripping off your chin and change your diapers both as needed and whatever additional baby sitting you require which is likely a lot by the way this too is satire i simply cannot believe anyone could possibly have posted your comment from serious concerns god bless america and all the ships at sea due to red tape the coronavirus outbreak in the u s will be worse than it should have been i m not sure it s just red tape at cdc that caused this cdc has long had a bit of a competitive streak re the who who s better at doing this stuff we are exacerbated by pols who always find votes in we re the real experts compared to some bunch of un weenies that creates a ton of arrogance it s no accident imo that everyone who just copied altered the who testing protocols rolled testing out much much sooner here s some testing comparisons by country china is missing here but last i ve seen their numbers of tested million is just behind korea the other problem i think is that the cdc has become captured by pharma vaccines is the mindset of both and has been so since the 1960 s and the successful childhood stuff problem is once you ve got that mindset there s a huge risk that that mindset of having a particular solution in mind also taints the way you go about collecting info cdc essentially stopped being a public health organziation and instead has become more of a free data gatherer for pharma i completely agree that that testing clusterfuck is going to make things worse here as in it s going to kill a lot of people pandemic declared by the who time to grow government ten fold declare martial law burn the constitution all for our safety or whatever the size of the state increases when the size of the problems increase i m sorry but capitalism can t fix everything maybe step out of your ideology for one second and realize the problems we re facing are far more managerial menial and ultimately bureaucratic because people don t know any other way to operate practically goddamn trump trash boeing share price is down 30 today and 50 off its 52 week high they just drew down 13 billion to pay current expenses markets are getting routed the trump crash is on its like 2008 all over again when the bushpigs wrecked the economy celebrate much and if you bought at the bottom you made out well and a good part of boeing s decline is based on their planes falling out of the sky and a good part of boeing s decline is based on their planes falling out of the sky my understanding is that they didn t so much fall as actively steered themselves out of the sky and at least part of the problem seems to be that boeing was less than transparent in reporting about or fixing the problem probably wasn t a good idea to hire 10 hr coders in india i m sure someone made good money off the decision especially since we give them tax breaks for leaving the country well that s almost never a good idea but that wasn t boeing s problem with the max they made changes to the plane but wanted to avoid the arduous and expensive faa re certification process required for new plane models so they not only assed up the sensor that was all over the news they also modified the plane s avionics software to interpret the sensor s readings in a way that was supposed to compensate for the broader changes to the aircraft in certain flying conditions that combination lead to real problems for the pilot trying to control the aircraft even worse those problems were exacerbated by the control hydraulics i forget the proper name which are supposed to prevent improper or sudden movement of the physical control the stick so that when the sensor failure mode occurred the pilot pretty much had to put every ounce of muscle into overcoming the control s safety hydraulics just to keep the plane straight it was a nightmare scenario and the initial rush to blame pilot error was unconscionable i haven t used the right nomenclature above sorry it s late it was a long week and my brain is tired while my body isn t ready for sleep yet hmmmm i would have thought investing in boeing would be as safe as investing in fannie mae or freddie mac they might not actually have access to the government checkbook but they re very very good friends with the people who do and everybody knows it i m sure like chevy the government will help boing if needed now if obama was in charge he d give boing to another country like he did chrysler bush did that lol this of course is why we need medicare for all if dr chu worked for the government not only would she know better than to ask for permission she would know to keep her mouth shut about the lack of testing after the fact every country with nationalized healthcare will have an easier time with this virus nationalizing your healthcare doesn t make you communist basing your healthcare on price gouging an insurance networks where your coverage changes according to your employer is a disaster it is amazing to watch you people spin your pro crony capitalist propaganda while you claim to love freedom what most of you fail to realize is if you want medicare for all you can automatically cut your yearly salary in half to pay for it then if you want free college tuition there goes another 30 right off the top now you are going to take home less than 20 of what you earn no matter what income bracket you are in the fda needs to be completely overhauled it s a failure in so many ways by overhauled i assume you mean cleansed with fire then who would protect us from the evil pharmaceutical companies by stopping their medicine and vaccines from reaching the marketplace the who could certainly use a good housecleaning they completely overstepped their mission on this and understepped their assigned role 1 quadrophenia the who has been far more competent here than the cdc that may be true as i ve followed the who s response to this closer than i have the cdc s it s likely the cdc has spent a little too much time allocating budgets and resources to making sure vaginas better stand up to penises in the stem fields and thus forgot the lessons of the broad street pump sorry but after four years if they re not being managed competently then the buck stops in the current wh and hhs not some bs from 8 years ago that serves your political goals what about trump totally closing down the white house department on pandemics in 2018 or did obama trick him into it although i agree that the who has been more competent than the cdc we shouldn t stop our criticisms of the who for one second it s the perfect example of how international institutions have been designed to get their funding from the highest bidder they have been totally reactive and not proactive at all who added to trump s humiliation on this so they should all be lined up and shot in front of their families but not in front of their dogs or puppies so far as type this only two trumptards are clueless that who was performing its purpose while trump was not he literally fiddled while rome america burns forget where i saw this trump is more interested in stabilizing the stock market than dealing with the virus yesterday he announced he would hold a press conference today to roll out his economic proposals a major economic package to help mitigate the crisis caused by the coronavirus and the oil war between saudi arabia and russia but today no plan was forthcoming trump s laser focus on helping industry has lost even former republicans bill kristol former republican stalwart reflected on trump s economic plans and tweeted congress 1 no bailouts for industries 2 targeted help for hospitals and the health care sector 3 general relief directly to workers and families the owners of capital have had a good decade and can weather a downturn it s labor that deserves a strengthened safety net this prompted one wag to respond wait who are you but hillary s emails he literally fiddled interesting that you would reference that saying though as it seems to be a slander of a country s leader nero certainly didn t fiddle while rome burned he couldn t have the fiddle was invented hundreds of years after the roman empire fell he literally fiddled nobody said nero literally fiddled not on this page the fda is not a failure but it suffers the same problem as all the government agencies instead of being focused on the mission of the agency you have lifelong government beaurocrats that act like they one of the participants in a game of survivor sabotaging their coworkers and bosses in hopes they will move up the corporate ladder yesterday i was talking to a guy i know who works at the nih and he surprised me by talking like a fucking marxist he said the cdc and the government should be the only entity to handle these things ever the private sector is too slow or they don t have the incentive to respond etc etc he said i don t argue with people about these things anymore it s too much effort and it gets you nowhere all i could do is sigh and shake my head oh yeah he praised the fuck out of china for their response to this oh they built a huge hospital in 10 days uh ok and they were able to contain it you can t do such things in the us don t you know too worried about profits he s such a smart guy otherwise pretty damned disappointing to hear that bullshit coming from him you can t do such things in the us don t you know too worried about profits the biggest obstacle is trump he fucked up the tests for nearly a month but you think he could build a hospital in 10 days maybe 20 days to build a nuclear reactor when you whine like a pussy about that hospital you re too worried about those damn commies never praise anything they do because they might be encouraged to do more good gasp when you whine like a pussy about that hospital you re too worried about those damn commies never praise anything they do because they might be encouraged to do more good gasp i can tell you re all about liberty and the truth thanks trumptards would be screeching in rage like you do when people criticize communist governments omg another totally stupid conservatard only communists would not french kiss trump s lard ass really well chump here s a link to the web archive of my political writing http www libertyissues com archive htm that s the index page with a very short summary of each article look especially at the topics taxes health care and federal budget debt you ll learn three things 1 i m a libertarian not a commie 2 by comparison on those three topics trump is a drooling retard with even less sense than you 3 you ve humiliated yourself publicly anything else china s response has turned out to be quite excellent after the first few weeks of denial brutally effective and it saved lots of lives the fact is that purely medically the lockdown prevented almost all future spread within wuhan people had to stay inside their apts with healthcare workers visiting them for tests and such so only a relatively small of even wuhan has been infected yet that will unfold further in the second wave and while that small of infected overwhelmed their hospitals they built hospital bed capacity fast for the less serious patients and brought 30 000 medical personnel from other places in china to deal with the full to bursting hospital system in wuhan none of that will happen here we won t be able to send medical folks from place a to place b like we do in hurricans or other sorts of disasters because this is going to hit everywhere in the us now and we won t have any extra fast build temporary capacity wuhan is now tearing down close to half of the beds capacity they built a month ago but presumably some of that stuff will be shipped elsewhere in china we are still a month from seeing the result on fatalities here i suspect we won t get as good results as even wuhan the milan area hit hospital capacity a few days ago and their fatality rates are now well above wuhan because the people who have serious cases can no longer be treated there and we are far slower than even italy in even understanding the problem we currently have this is dead people in the streets stuff third world it s gonna be the biggest mindfuck of our lives when our complacency and arrogance really hits home here as someone who s raised concerns about this virus and been taken to task for it here i would hesitate to praise the china response china s response didn t do a very good job of balancing liberty with proactivity and the measures may have caused very damaging second order effects that you ll likely never hear about because it s china i have some first hand knowledge of some of the things that china was doing and simply even if the american system swung into vigorous proactive measures you d simply never get away with the stuff that china s doing i also don t buy the chinese numbers i do believe they may have slowed the spread significantly but because china doesn t have a lot of credibility on transparency i suspect they had more infections and deaths than they admitted i suspect they had more infections and deaths than they admitted of course they did this is their nature at all times to be fair to the chinese government it isn t misreporting if you physically don t have enough capacity in test kits or ct scan to test everyone we re litterally having the same problem here it s also important to mention there is litterally almost 20 of the global population living in china no state no public private partnership no corporation no ngo is going to keep track of a virulent disease as it spreads through a population of litterally 2 billion people that s a totally unrealistic expectation now you ad on top of that the kill the messenger mentality that happens in any bureaucracy and honestly you ve got to tip your hat to the chinese from the way their system is designed from the ground up these people have worked around it to make it work the questions is can we do a fraction as well as what they re doing i say out government could quarantine a day care were the only people that got sick were kids i hope to god i m wrong correction i say our government couldn t quarantine a day care i totally agree that they didn t include liberty in any calcs at all and i agree that what they did do couldn t be replicated here here by the way is a video about the first 30 days of the lockdown yes its govt yes there s a ton of stuff that i m certain isn t in this video yes there s some of the typical we are all joyously working together to fight the enemy that you would expect but there is also a ton of info there that can be combined with other info to produce a much clearer picture of what has been happening there they did slow the spread massively not as much as they say they did in the stats but those pictures of empty wuhan are not a potemkin village people in their apartments for weeks are not spreading diseases around town so any normal disease curve that shows exponential growth for 2 months before peak is simply not true for wuhan they locked down within 3 weeks of the real breakout on the curve therefore any ignorant expectation of 2 months of exponential growth a huge pool of infected that would give us confidence that this is nothing to really worry about is also false deaths i m certain are higher than reported 11 million people locked down for 6 weeks of course people die and i m certain medical people weren t wasting time doing autopsies there stuff i didn t even really think about but that affects the known data that is out there before i looked at the video and the fact that xi visited wuhan yesterday is a really good indicator that they controlled the outbreak because absent that lockdown right now is roughly when the disease would be peaking in wuhan we re all thinking it we all know we wish we had a competent surveillance state right now well to be fairer to the us in the us we use soap don t spit all over the streets everywhere and don t live in filth like in most of china where this virus started in the us we use soap don t spit all over the streets everywhere and don t live in filth like in most of china have you visited san francisco lately yea china built a hospital that collapsed and killed more than the virus did that was not a newbuild that was a converted hotel doesn t matter it was still approved by the chinese government hence just because they did something doesn t mean its worth anything china built a hospital that collapsed and killed more than the virus did the virus killed more than ten https www cbc ca news world china coronavirus hotel collapse quanzhou 1 5490206 and there were two that china built while trump was more concerned with his election over human life apparently so are you some of you people are as shameless as trump actually 38 are dead so far btw do you want trump to take over property and turn it into hospitals that will collapse and maybe kill your family actually 38 are dead so far btw hahaha you e the one who sneered the number of deaths in china is ten 10 9 1 https reason com 2020 03 11 how government red tape stymied testing and made the coronavirus epidemic worse comment 8163049 and this really has nothing to do with commies it has to do with understanding that government does have a role in public health yes it doesn t surprise me that top down commie china does a better job than top down federal us govt re that sort of quick brutal public health action but the supposed advantage of our system is its decentralization and flexibility and such what we are imo going to find is we no longer have that capability not because the feds killed it but because we abdicated it instead of jealously guarding our ability to act locally we got lazy and cheap and have found it much easier to just complain about what other people do idk what countries are going to do a better job of doing this in a decentralized non commie way but i suspect it will be most it has to do with understanding that government does have a role in public health yes it doesn t surprise me that top down commie china does a better job than top down federal us govt re that sort of quick brutal public health action it s one thing to say that you do a better job of being brutal authoritarians and another thing to say that being brutal authoritarians works better than freedom you will be surprised to learn that most people will not view that as an absolute is freedom worth 10 million lives how about singapore style authoritarianism most people would put that in the free category and it certainly isn t the commie category r s and ancaps are just complete strawman wrestling manichean cartoons the world is not complete evil and complete good uber rationalist arguments are not proven

not free at all it s authoritarian as hell i don t know let s call it fascist i wouldn t want to live there if that s what you re asking trump is as dead as a doornail it s not how badly he screwed this up it s his refusing to ever admit he s been wrong as we get closer to november expect to see tons of video clips my own favorite was him saying he s happy because if people can t travel they ll spend more in america happy that people have dies and many more will or keeping people on that cruise ship to keep his numbers low or windmills cause cancer or endless https www youtube com watch v

that he s keeping america safe despite 2 000 passengers scared shitless he also was major in delaying the test kits for nearly a month then just the other day lying about how many test kits were then available corrected by his own health leader said a vaccine would be soon his own health chief said over a year so sad to see your disregard for sanctity of life your turn what has biden done even

lifted all restrictions on testing for the coronavirus get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter what the president said yesterday at the c d c that is consistent with what the f d a and the c d c are saying which is we as regulators or as those shipping the test are not restricting who can get tested mr azar said we are leaving that to the professional judgment of doctors and public health officials mr trump used shorthand to make that point mr azar said what he meant to say is we re not in the way of that mr azar said and he knows the numbers we brief him daily 1 has nothing to with the cruise ship 2 i said nothing about trump s phrasing listen hihn if you aren t going to add me to you list how much more do i have to abuse you when

mencken us editor 1880 1956 now tell us how your hissy fit has anything t0 do with what you assaulted me for the cruise ship and be specific how did i criticize trump s phrasing so you wanted trump to let everyone on board go out in public to infect more and kill more since thats what already happened with the previous cruise you are stupid how many people die from being qurantined vs how many will die without it umm all they passengers have been unloaded the ship went to a secure port where they were escorted into separate quarantines infected and non infected and you re the guy who said also trump like the number of virus deaths in china is ten https reason com 2020 03 11 how government red tape stymied testing and made the coronavirus epidemic worse comment 8163049 even crazier you are stupid how many people die from being qurantined vs how many will die without it i m stupid but you say people die from being quarantined in all of human history zero it s not the quarantine that kills my turn would you place infected and non infected people in the same room for what purpose would you do what trump did if it s me who s stupid how did you fail to read that trump kept over 2 000 people on the same ship where 20 were infected and one died again more than ten died in china got it you know what would be really meta hihn if you sock puppets started pretending to be you kill yourself kill yourself precious snowflake if you cannot stand having your ass kicked on your every provoked assault why not just stop you who said china had only ten deaths from the virus on top of being totally ignorant of that cruise ship you attacked me for go find some kittens and puppies to kick more your level as entertaining as this disagreement is without me nobody seems to be answering this question you posed what has biden done even close to being as morally degenerate you ve apparently forgotten biden s crime bills yes plural there was more than one of them the brutal consequence of them was many men mostly black and hispanic imprisoned longer than was appropriate due to enhanced and minimum sentencing provisions plus the utter evil of three strikes a basic sense of statistics should tell you that at least some of those sentences ended prematurely due to the deaths of prisoners who under sane legislation would not have lived out their last days in prison and before you respond that they would have died at the about same time anyway you should take a hard look at the outcomes of prison healthcare if we can call it that and i m not sure we can with apologies to rowan atkinson finally i m sure none of those deaths were due to violence that otherwise wouldn t have ended their lives were they not imprisoned for so much longer than they should have been right right finally if needless death isn t a requirement to answer your question then go look up why biden earned the moniker the senator from mbna what has biden done even close to being as morally degenerate you ve apparently forgotten biden s crime bills yes plural there was more than one of them 1 how many people died 2 one president vs the entire congress 1 i have never seen a study on that but i d like to my claim wasn t based on someone s analysis of quantified data but rather on simple likelihood naturally that s not supportable without some kind of published objective analysis but i feel that i chose phrasing which appropriately reflected that limitation 2 not sure what your point is here biden convinced an entire congress if you will more than once that his crime bills were good policy some members of congress the subset who wear their jackboots on the inside including both ds and rs were more than happy to sign on others had to be convinced cajoled or indirectly bribed with the usual horse trading enough of them in total to get his bills passed what has biden done even close to being as morally degenerate convincing an entire congress or at least enough of them to pass legislation that egregious minimum sentences and three strikes were good policy that would serve our citizens well definitely meets the bar of close to being as morally degenerate however to borrow an old dennis miller line he used to end his famous comedic rants on hbo that s just my opinion i could be wrong hand he almost killed corn pop for crying out loud so you disagree with somebody who triggered you damn that was posted as a reply to colossal douchebag just below it s he was was triggered because he disagreed with some other commenter can you orchestrate an entire convo between sqrlsy one and thelibertytruthteller no can you do that with sevo you are boring and an asshole the walls are closing in biden s a shoo in for 2020 even fox polling says he d beat trump biden s a shoo in for 2020 well he says he s running for the u s senate so you might be right lol yeah i don t trust polls this early out especially since we haven t seen what the trump team will do to attach him not moving any goal posts if testing doesn t stop infections then earlier testing without all the evil red tape wouldn t necessarily have stopped anyone from contracting the virus read the original article i suspect like most you went straight to the comments how does your foot taste i could no longer reply to the chain i read the article thanks your argument that 100 of the people who may have been tested positive for the coronavirus you know if testing was available would have listened to donald trump and gone to work to get better is more ridiculous than the idea that one or more people who tested positive would have self quarantined and lessened the outbreak it s an assumption that i feel pretty comfortable mr bailey can make your argument that 100 of the people who may have been tested positive for the coronavirus you know if testing was available would have listened to donald trump and gone to work to get better is more ridiculous than the idea that one or more people who tested positive would have self quarantined and lessened the outbreak set up a strawman then knock it down while you re picking up the pieces make sure to kill yourself make sure to kill yourself

impeccable often contradicting the opinion side just like fox news the times reported and described clearly how the 2008 financial crisis was created by clinton at the end they reported that an economic slowdown could cause massive mortgage bailouts like the 1980s on the imperiled middle class they described their research which concluded the problem is a lot fewer people in it the loss of manufacturing jobs which trump does not understand and cannot fix ditto for cato aggressive initial early testing and quaranteeing would have slowed the spread buying time for spring to arrive when the flu season is over protective equipment to be bought and trained for other supplies to be stockpiled without a run on them intensive care units to be expanded and quarantine centers to be established etc iow smooth out the spike in the critical cases so our infrastructure isn t overwhelmed jonova at https jonova com au has been arguing in this vein for months everyone who knows anything about this has been arguing we be proactive not reactive since china started shutting down but the apparatus of the state is controlled by reactionaries in both parties who are as reactive in

https www rollingstone com politics politics news corona virus covid19 mortality rate going to get worse fauci 965623 it s going to get worse federal disease expert warns congress about coronavirus dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases offered a clear eyed assessment of the covid 19 threat while testifying on wednesday though president trump insisted on tuesday that covid 19 will go away the government s top expert on infectious diseases warned lawmakers on wednesday that not only is the virus not going away anytime soon the worst is yet to come i can say that we will see more cases and things will get worse than they are right now dr anthony fauci who directs the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases told congress how much worse it will get will depend on our ability to do two things to contain the influx of people who are infected coming from the outside and the ability to contain and mitigate within our own country but the bottom line is that it s going to get worse fauci may be the only person on earth who can say with trump at his shoulder that trump is wrong and not get fired he does so constantly only twice with trump there that i ve seen he s a total nerd runs the federal agency that does the research and studies on infectious diseases seems to be the most respected health dude in congress by both parties especially when the president has gone full rogue you make the mistake of thinking trumpster can read it s a brain virus when you ask your family members to buy food and stock up and they say trump will save us only actually catching the virus will fix their broken mind this gov stymied private and academic development no never i d place 50 bucks on the fact the only thing the fda cdc and hhs does is stymie healthcare just as its been doing for over a 100 years they re the biggest cause of our healthcare crisis what a great opportunity to just shut their un constitutional competitive monopoly down so the agency that s been loosing funding for 12 years is the one to blame for the outbreak i hope you try this theory with everything maybe if we defund the military and then try to start a war that ll work too you keep posting that losing funding for 12 years statement from https www factcheck org 2020 03 democrats misleading coronavirus claims the 2020 cdc operating plan shows an increase from 2019 of 7 adjusted for inflation according to the trust for america s health overall the group s report says there has been a chronic under funding of the public health system in the u s but that began before trump took office and has continued you can see from the same article that funding increased the prior fiscal year too the article is well sourced with inline links so is that enough for you to stop posting this lie there is no shortage of genuine criticisms of trump you re not advancing your credibility by making shit up and then repeating it ad nauseum trump cuts off reporters mics during coronavirus press conference at his coronavirus national emergency press conference trump cut off reporters microphones so that they couldn t ask follow up questions the strategy of cutting off microphones didn t prevent pbs s yamiche alcindor from triggering trump by asking him about his decision to close down the white house pandemic office he shut down the pandemic office in 2018 those points are orthogonal to the repeated losing funding for 12 years assertion as i wrote in my prior post there are plenty of objectively valid criticisms of trump and his administration your post raises different problems so i think you would have better served your interests by starting a new thread or at least adding to a thread where those concerns would have been on point trump administration isn t backing off proposed cuts to cdc budget in early february the white house unveiled a budget that called for deep cdc cuts yesterday the administration refused to back down those points are orthogonal to the repeated losing funding for 12 years assertion nice try but i responded to this the 2020 cdc operating plan totally eliminating the pandemic office is more relevant to covid 19 as is insisting on cdc funding cuts in this environment nice try but i responded to this that s off topic for this sub thread which is solely about the claim of losing funding for 12 years and it takes very little capacity for reading comprehension to understand that furthermore proposed cuts do not change the fact that that assertion is false even if they were to go into effect and it takes very little reasoning capacity to understand that also you seriously picked out a single phrase there s no verb in the excerpt you quoted so it s not even a clause for an off topic response instead seriously nice try but no banana loosing funding is the hopeless cliche banner of government now isn t it even after taking 1 3 on average of everyone s income we re loosing funding will be the slogan pasted on their gold plated empire i don t usually read comments on this site just the articles today i decided to see what y all had to say about the topic which is an interesting one is the comment section always as worthless as this one don t people have better things to do like maybe watching informercials on tv sick stuff maybe i spoke too soon i got frustrated by insult comment after insult comment back and forth then i started reading in a different place and there i did find some rational discussion and interesting entries sorry your later reading seems to have merely minimized the level of worthlessmess sadly reason s comments are highly infected with both the alt right and the authoritarian right both having evolved largely from the faux libertarian statist ron paul the well known king of insult comment after insult comment even when he s not even arguing he ll find some way of insulting lol how did you miss that trump shut down the white house office on pandemics in 2018 or forced thousands of passengers to stay on that cruise ship trapped with dozens of infected passengers and he said he wanted to keep the numbers down re election over human suffering and possible debt cdc overruled him sent the ship to a remote port and the passengers left the ship walking directly into quarantine trump cuts off reporters mics during coronavirus press conference at his coronavirus national emergency press conference trump cut off reporters microphones so that they couldn t ask follow up questions the strategy of cutting off microphones didn t prevent pbs s yamiche alcindor from triggering trump by asking him about his decision to close down the white house pandemic office he shut down the pandemic office in 2018 anything else if you think this is bad you would weep over what slashdot has become https msd norge as com http anoudclean com this article does not include the most important piece of information who was president when the bureaucrats at cdc and fda who held up authorization of these coronavirus tests were appointed if we don t know who to blame what s the point who was president when 1 they fucked up 2 following trump s demands anybody notice a problem with the dates in the article on feb 4 2020 the secretary of hhs determined that there is a public health emergency and that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and or diagnosis of the covid 19 outbreak rapid detection of covid 19 cases in the u s requires wide availability of diagnostic testing to control the emergence of a rapidly spreading severe illness the fda has authorized one eua for covid 19 that is in use by the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc and some public health labs across the country also the lab testing requirements were part of the huge regulatory takeover of medicine by the obama admin laughing obama did that on airforce one on a flight back to kenya for a birthday celebration in his homeland but seriously hhs was taken over by president eisenhower at the precise moment hhs was created but ike was not a damn foreign born nigger sarc president donald trump handed gift by fabio wajngarten brazilian press secretary with covid 19 president bolsonaro of brazil s press secretary who met and handed a gift to president trump on saturday has tested positive for the coronavirus fabio wajngarten was pictured standing next to mr trump at the president s mar a lago resort he gave mr trump a cap that had the slogan make brazil great again mr trump was holding the cap that he had just been given later that evening mr wajngarten 44 attended a party at the resort hosted by kimberly ann guilfoyle 51 who is working as a senior adviser for president trump s re election campaign and is the girlfriend of donald trump jr the president s eldest son the white house says trump and pence refuse to be tested this leaves two possibilities likely trump and pence will both be tested but deny it very remote nancy pelosi the first female president now second in the line of succession to the presidency would trump risk even death to avoid admitting he ever made a mistake dear god wouldn t that be nice it d be even better if the republicans never recovered i am making 7 to 6 dollar par hour at home on laptop this is make happy but now i am working 4 hour dailly and make 40 dollar easily this is enough for me to happy my family how i am making this so u can do it easily read more perhaps a dozen trumpsters have lied here blatantly about bailey s fine investigative reporting they by focusing on the wrong case events a month earlier a diversion i ll dumb it down this is the relevant part of ron s reporting 1 dr shu tested without government approval 2 she discovered an infected teenager 3 she alerted authorities who closed down the kid s school 4 she saved kids from infection and possible death by defying trump s cdc and defying those guilty trump supporters ron s relevant paragraph a frustrated chu and her colleagues began testing on february 25 without government approval they almost immediately detected a coronavirus infection in a local teenager with no recent travel history chu warned local public health officials of her lab s finding and the teenager s school was closed as a precaution the teen s diagnosis strongly suggested that the disease had been circulating throughout the western part of washington for weeks we now know that that is likely true how many more infections and deaths if shu had not defied the federal government see the tragic irony trump was elected to drain the swamp now his supporters defend that swamp 1 by lying 2 and like trump ranking his re election above human life even the lives of schoolkids how many of those trumpsers are parents i wish we had a much better viable alternative than biden but even satan himself could not be as tragic to the american dream and to our most sacred values of course the demented open borders supporters would argue that not even the movement of two legged biohazards should be curtailed who argued this reason com who can you point to an article the cdc required that public health officials could only use the diagnostic test designed by the agency it should also be noted this is a different test than the one the cdc used coronavirus president donald trump handed gift by fabio wajngarten brazilian press secretary with covid 19 president bolsonaro of brazil s press secretary who met and handed a gift to president trump

possibilities likely trump and pence will both be tested but deny it or will be tested because i would anyway obvious lie very remote nancy pelosi the first female president now second in the line of succession to the presidency would trump risk even death to avoid admitting he ever made a mistake what it seems everyone is missing on these posts except for a select few is that governor inslee had the ability to overide the cdc if he wanted to and allow chu to do the testing governor inslee in fact instructed the health dept of washington state to agree with the cdc and not allow chu to conduct the tests not until a a firefighter from kirkland questions the uptick in increased calls to the nursing home did inslee or the washington state health dept become concerned that covid 19 was active in washington state should the trump administration be blamed for this not exactly since it seems the cdc is not listening to the trump administration and doing what they like this is clearly evident when trump specifically told them not to bring back any patients that tested positive for the virus from the cruise ship but they did anyway and did not tell the administration until the plane was already in the air this put the existing patients at risk along with the health care workers and the military once the plane landed again the military and healthcare workers were not informed of the necessary steps to take to protect themselves and everyone else now could this be because the cdc was not allowed to visit china to see exactly what was going on and what steps needed to be taken to keep covid 19 from spreading perhaps but lets look at this from a more realistic perspective how did the cdc perform when individuals came into the u s with ebola the failed miserably at the beginning because there was no clear direction same with the measles outbreaks tuberculosis outbreaks and the flu pandemic in 2009 since trump was not in office in 2009 what does this tell everyone it basically tells americans that the individuals in the upper management have no clue as to how the agency should be run instead it is more like a season of survivor where you have everyone backstabbing and sabotage each other in hopes of either getting a raise or a promotion instead of working together for the good of the american people it seems that the majority of the upper management needs to be applying for unemployment and hire individuals that actually are intelligent enough to put the american people ahead of their own personal ambitions and this goes for washington state bureaucrats also i d say the out of constitutional scope of the federal government is the very root cause of every symptom you ve described there isn t a constitutional authority granting the federal government any power over healthcare i d like to think they have the power to prevent nation to nation spread but i have yet to find that one short of invasion actually the government along with the president and even congress has the authority to act if there is a crisis that is going to affect the united states or the population of the united states the real issue is the liberals would rather have a pandemic of any kind instead of using steps to prevent them if pandemics or outbreaks are prevented there is no need to authorize large amounts of spending which in turn employ government workers which again in turn is a large voting block for democrats tuberculosis measles chicken pox even polio had all been eliminated in the united states but because liberals want open borders and free travel everyone one of those diseases have reemerged in the united states to devastating consequences for those who were affected by them actually the government along with the president and even congress has the authority to act if there is a crisis that is going to affect the united states or the population of the united states i d imagine so but i m really looking for the constitutional power that grants that privilege to the federal government i d imagine the founders took into consideration an international spreadable disease at some point there are 49 american fatalities so far and half of that came from a single nursing home a handful people died after returning from various infection zones wuhan iran princess diamond an aggressive early testing covers would have covered 200 000 americans at most we d be lucky to cover half that in reality and if we use korea as a baseline we d have maybe 8 000 active cases and only 60 serious cases the more testing scenario that exists in the minds of the usual crowd is something like every local hospital getting a test kit and opening their doors and saying we re here to serve you with a smile that s not how testing is done in asia korea locked down an entire city china taiwan and korea all use some kind of surveillance tech to track down individuals china uses social rating and if you bought cough medicine your ass belongs to a quarantine zone within the day korea is doing a good job making tests more available to the general public they relaxed their red tape on private sector who is ramping up test kits but since they test even mostly healthy people that s starting to result in unintended consequences the uk is already winding down tests on healthy people if you re healthy there s really no need to get tested i don t see any doctor gong on tv to say get tested now they know what that can do to their hospital operation thing have to be done in a parameter educate yourself if you re healthy there s really no need to get tested the infection shows no symptoms for 14 days which is how trump screwed up so massively and later caved getting tested when he had no symptoms reversing his press conference statement that unleashed another fire storm of ridicule actually that is a very ignorant answer the young are actually more contagious and carry a higher concentration of the virus than someone who is over 40 years of age and shows symptoms studies have shown this makes anyone under the age of 40 and showing no symptoms more dangerous to the rest of the population especially the elderly and those that have a compromised immune system that is why the virus was able to infect vast amounts of the population in wuhan because the young supposedly healthy infected healthcare workers passed it on to anyone that showed up at the hospitals clinics and emergency rooms the only country that has done a great job in containing it has been taiwan do you need a loan pay your bills or do you want to get off your any
