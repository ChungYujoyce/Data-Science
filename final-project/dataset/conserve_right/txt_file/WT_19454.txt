trump s purpose for the visit to pay tribute to the veterans of the battle that shifted the course of world war ii 75 years ago ahead of his trip some worried the unpredictable president would inject politics into the typically solemn ceremony while trump did not veer off script during the memorial expressing reverence for the bravery of veterans his comments before the event expressed none of

merkel discussed libya and conditions in west africa during their roughly 10 minute meeting said white house press secretary sarah sanders trump used his interview with morgan to dispute any notion that he meant insult when he used the term nasty in discussing the american born duchess of sussex meghan markle the phrase generated a lot of media coverage in the united kingdom trump worked diligently to explain that he was speaking specifically on her comments about him not about her trump said she was nasty to me and that s ok for her to be nasty it s not good for me to be nasty to her and i wasn t he said the controversy did not come up when he spoke with markle s husband prince harry who couldn t have been nicer trump was also asked about whether he would support banning silencers after a gunman in virginia used two semi automatic handguns a silencer and extended ammunition magazines to slaughter 12 people at a municipal building trump said a silencer ban was something i m going to seriously look at but he also was quick to emphasize his opposition to restricting access to guns he repeated his claim that in london you have stabbings all over and said he had read a story describing how your hospital is a sea of blood all over the floors similar comments in the past have provoked anger from british doctors and legislators trump said he discussed climate change at length with prince charles we were going to have a 15 minute chat and it turned out to be an hour and a half and he did most of the talking trump said he is really into climate change and i think that s great trump who has called climate change a hoax didn t indicate he was moved by the arguments he heard i believe that there s a change in weather and i think it changes both ways trump told morgan
