housecoronavirus task force warned in testimony tuesdaybefore thesenatehealth committee that reopening the economy before certain checkpoints set up in the trump administration apos s coronavirus recovery plan are met could bring serious consequences as i have said many times publicly what we have worked out is a guideline framework for how to open america again fauci said referencing a set of guidelines the white house has released for states and localities to begin opening their economies in order to proceed to the first of three stages states would need to see an uninterrupted decrease in coronavirus cases over a 14 day period depending on the dynamics of an outbreak in a particular region state city or area that would really determine the speed and the pace with which one does reenter or reopen fauci said if some areas cities states or what have you jump over those barriers checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks coronavirus what to know gop sen alexander apos staying at home indefinitely is not the solution apos fauci warned that prematurely lifting coronavirus restrictions closing schools and businesses and limiting travel would lead to suffering and death and turn the clock back instead of going forward when asked by sen patty murray d wash what could happen if areas do ignore the checkpoints fauci said the consequences could be really serious further when asked by sen elizabeth warren d mass if the virus was under control fauci said it is not right now it depends on what you mean by containment fauci said noting the virus is not completely under control so when you look at the dynamics of new cases even though some are coming down the curve looks flat with some coming down so i think we apos re going in the right direction but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak he added that without proper measures the u s could face a resurgence in cases he said the u s should be in a much better place by the fall but said if adequate measures are not taken there will be problems the time for magical thinking is over here warren said of president trump apos s pushes to reopen the economy quickly and optimism that the virus will go away the hearing which features fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid as well as three other top administration health officials is the biggest congressional hearing since the coronavirus crisis began it comes as states across the country are plotting their own courses for reopening their economies with some already opening sectors and others maintaining strict lockdowns president trump himself has stressed the importance of getting america back to work leading to criticism from some democrats that this approach could be too risky fauci

on the fickle nature of the coronavirus outbreak senior health officials including fauci scheduled to testify in person before the health education labor and pensions committee on tuesday may 12 will instead appear via video link ap photo alex brandon file fauci other health officials to testify before senate panel via videoconference amid coronavirus concerns on one point fauci said the government isfocusing on several different vaccine candidates using the hockey term multiple shots on goal to describe the increased chances that one would work additionally he said if more than one is successful that would help increase the availability of the vaccines globally but fauci noted there apos s no guarantee that a vaccine is going to be effective given the chance to attack trump in an exchange with sen tim kaine d va fauci declined to kaine pushed fauci on whether south korea apos s success on fighting the coronavirus showed that the u s response to the pandemic was inadequate fauci noted that there is a big difference between the u s and south korea fauci appeared remotely due to concerns that he might have been exposed to the coronavirus multiple senators also appeared virtually for the hearing including sen lamar alexander r tenn the chairman of the committee and murray the ranking member after consulting with dr fauci and in an abundance of caution for our witnesses senators and the staff all four administration witnesses will appear by videoconference due to these unusual circumstances alexander said in a statement alexander in his opening remarks emphasized the necessity of testing and also said the government might make an effort to mass manufacture a vaccine before it s been proven to work so it can be quickly distributed once it s officially approved dr anthony fauci coronavirus testing availability speed will play part in football apos s return those vaccines those treatments are the ultimate solution he said but until we have them all roads back to work and school go through testing murray wasted no time hitting the president in her opening remarks families across the country are counting on us for the truth about the covid 19 pandemic especially since it is clear they will not get it from president trump she said truth is essential the president isn apos t telling the truth we must and our witnesses must steak apos n shake permanently closes nearly 10 percent of its restaurants amid coronavirus crisis she also criticized the trump administration apos s tangible response to the virus saying it has been marked by delays and insufficient assistance to states and health professionals additionally she advocated for another coronavirus stimulus bill to help ease the burden of the economic shutdowns across the country aimed at slowing the spread of the virus fauci when questioned by alexander said it would not be reasonable to expect a vaccine to be ready for back to school season this year trump has said he would like to have a vaccine by the end of the year the idea of having treatments or a vaccine ready by the fall would be something of a bridge too far he said red lobster customers turned away due to large volume of mother apos s day orders fauci also added that there is a good chance to see further rebounds in the disease but that he hopes the u s will be better prepared to deal with them i would hope that if we do have the threat of a second wave we will be able to deal with it very effectively to prevent it from becoming an outbreak not only what we apos ve seen now but much much less he said admiralbrett giroir the assistant secretary for health emphasized that the u s had conducted more than 9 million covid 19 tests a number far greater than any other country and double the per capita tests performed to date in south korea a nation that many have held up as the model for handling the coronavirus apos effects he noted that by the late summer and early fall he expected the u s to be able to perform between 40 and 50 million coronavirus tests per month fauci got into a dustup with sen rand paul r ky over paul apos s criticism of some of the prognostications that have come from public health experts and the push to reopen schools quickly the history of this will be wrong prediction after wrong prediction after wrong predicition paul said mentioning among several other examples sweden which left its schools open i don apos t think you apos re an end all i don apos t think you apos re the one person that gets to make a decision i have never made myself out to be the end alland only voice in this fauci said i apos m a scientist a physician anda public health official i give advice according to the best scientific evidence he continued emphasizing that it is not clear children are generally immune from the harmful effects of the coronavirus we should be humble about what we don apos t know and i think that falls under the fact that we don apos t know everything about this virus and we really got to be very careful particularly when it comes to children because the more and more we learn we apos re seeing things about what this virus can do that we didn apos t see from the studies in china or in europe during questioning self proclaimed democratic socialist sen bernie sanders i vt pushed the witnesses on whether or not a vaccine once developed would be broadly available to people regardless of their income if god willing a vaccine is developed and if we apos re able to produce it as quickly as we all hope we can i imagine that that vaccine would be distributed to all people free of charge or at least make sure that everybody in america that needs that vaccine will get it regardless of their income sanders asked food and drug administrationcommissioner stephen hahn hahn said that issue was not under his purview as the fda commissioner but giroir said he would advocate within the trump administration to make sure the vaccine is accessible they should gain access to it i will certainly advocate that everyone is able to receive the vaccine regardless of income or any other circumstance hahn said democrats ahead of the hearing made clear they saw it as an opportunity to separate fauci from presidenttrump whom the medical expert is almost always with when he appears publicly so that fauci will feel free to criticize trump critics of the presidenthave argued his response to the coronavirus crisis waswholly inadequate alleging trump initially downplayedthe threat before letting petty politics get in the way of helping states and then moving too quickly to reopen the economy until now we apos ve mostly heard from the members of the coronavirus task force through the distorted lens of the white house press conference where the president often prevents them from answering fully interrupts their response or even contradicts their fact based evidence senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y said on monday this will be one of the first opportunities for dr fauci to tell the american people the unvarnished truth without the president lurking over his shoulder dr fauci let it rip he added click
