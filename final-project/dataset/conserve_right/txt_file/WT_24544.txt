orida race for house seat becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn paul manafort s two year legal battle with special counsel robert mueller concluded wednesday with a total of 7 years in prison but a crusading new york district attorney wants to make him serve even more time moments after manafort was sentenced to 43 months of additional prison time on federal charges in washington manhattan district attorney cyrus vance announced that he had won a grand jury indictment on state fraud and conspiracy charges against president trump s former campaign chairman mr vance s move appears to be an attempt to make manafort face some prison time in a jurisdiction outside of federal control and thus beyond the reach of a presidential pardon top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots no one is beyond the law in new york mr vance said in washington u s district judge amy berman jackson ordered manafort to serve 73 months on charges of illegal foreign lobbying money laundering and witness tampering the longtime republican operative pleaded guilty last year to avoid a trial judge jackson ordered 30 months of the sentence to be served concurrently with a 47 month term handed down last week by judge t s ellis iii in a separate financial fraud case manafort was convicted by a jury in that case the 7 years of total prison time is far less than manafort could have faced but it s a victory for mr mueller who brought the charges out of his investigation into the trump campaign s activities during the 2016 election most of the charges predate manafort s time with the trump campaign and judge jackson made clear that the case wednesday had nothing to do with mr mueller s directive to uncover suspected russian collusion with the trump campaign it was not resolved one way or the other by this case judge jackson said mr trump said wednesday that he felt bad for manafort and rattled off high profile republicans who worked alongside him over the decades i think it s a very sad situation he said but mr trump said he hasn t thought about offering a pardon it is not something that is on my mind he told reporters manafort delivered a vehement apology to the court he said he was ashamed of his conduct promised he had changed and asked that he be spared more prison time i can see that i behaved in ways that did not always comport to my personal code of values he said i am upset at myself for these failures the apology did little to sway judge jackson who ticked off his failings including flouting foreign lobbying laws and refusing to disclose that news articles and other supposed independent reports were paid propaganda by a russia backed ukrainian political party what you were doing was lying to members of congress and the american public if the people don t have the facts democracy can t work she said she also blasted manafort for violating his cooperation agreement with the government that deal was voided after mr mueller accused manafort of lying to investigators last year it is hard to overstate the number of lies amount of fraud and extraordinary money involved she said and there is no good explanation that would warrant the leniency requested prosecutor andrew weissmann described manafort as a criminal mastermind who schemed for more than a decade to conceal his foreign lobbying work and launder those funds to cover a lavish lifestyle he said manafort s crime spree continued while on bail when he was caught coaching witnesses it is evidence that something is wrong with sort of a moral compass that someone in that position would choose to make that decision at that moment mr weissmann said manafort joined the trump campaign as an adviser in march 2016 to manage convention operations he was made campaign chairman in may but resigned in august after the first reports surfaced that investigators were looking into his past business dealings with pro russian figures in ukraine defense attorney kevin downing suggested that manafort was being targeted unfairly for signing up to work for mr trump but for a short stint as a campaign manager in a presidential election i don t think we d be here today he said after the hearing mr downing blasted the judge for her treatment of manafort i think the judge showed that she is incredibly hostile toward mr manafort and exhibited a level of callousness that i have not seen in a white collar case in over 15 years of prosecutions he told reporters manafort has been in custody since summer when judge jackson revoked his bail on the recommendation of mr mueller the special counsel said manafort was interfering in the case by reaching out to witnesses although the federal cases have been completed manafort s legal woes are just beginning in new york the 16 count indictment that mr vance won against manafort includes charges of residential mortgage fraud attempted residential mortgage
