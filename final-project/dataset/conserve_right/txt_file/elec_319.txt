is simple and seductive if you need to show an id to board a plane open a bank account get public aid or do any number of other things it only makes sense to do the same before casting a ballot that was what wisconsin gov scott walker a republican said in 2011 as he signed a law imposing this new mandate there really is no barrier for people he asserted particularly in a society where people need photo identification for just about everything else including checking out a book from the library it s a reasonable requirement many of the advocates can t imagine anyone functioning in 21st century america without valid proof of identity so they are skeptical that requiring it could possibly be an obstacle to voting they also tend to believe that anyone who lacks something so basic deserves no accommodation these attitudes reflect a failure to understand the lives of many americans in the suit challenging the wisconsin law which recently was overturned by a federal court a parade of people attested that they lacked the required id and in many cases couldn t easily get it one of them was ruthelle frank a former member of the village board of brokaw she has never had a driver s license or state id and her 1927 birth certificate has a misspelling to get it fixed she would have to undertake a legal process that could cost 200 another was mariannis ginorio a young milwaukee woman she had no driver s license and wisconsin doesn t accept birth certificates from her native puerto rico issued before 2010 sam bulmer a homeless air force veteran could offer only a federal veterans identification card which is not on the list of ids recognized by the state statewide the court concluded 300 000 eligible voters don t have the documents needed for voting in the normal course of life people like this don t need them fifteen percent of white adults in wisconsin and half of blacks and hispanics don t drive passport holders are a minority of the population a lot of people don t need a photo id to board a plane because they don t fly in fact the transportation security administration doesn t bar anyone who shows up without an id in that case the tsa says you ll be able to fly as long as you provide us with some information that will help us determine you are who you say you are seniors can verify their eligibility for social security without a photo id food stamps federal regulations say any documents which reasonably establish the applicant s identity must be accepted and no requirement for a specific document such as a birth certificate may be imposed libraries will generally accept a utility bill or something similar to issue a card opening a bank account larry dupuis a lawyer for the american civil liberties union of wisconsin foundation says he never had to show an id to open his account which he did some two decades ago it s really a post 9 11 thing he says for banks to require one but many poor people don t have bank accounts those activities in any event are not constitutionally guaranteed which voting is the government can impose regulations that affect constitutional rights but it must have a good reason and the rules can t be an undue burden states can mandate a 24 hour waiting period for abortions which the supreme court says is a modest restriction justified by the state s interest in protecting the life of the unborn under federal law you may buy a gun from a private seller without an id licensed dealers must see photo identification despite the second amendment that s not hard to justify because if a person forbidden to own firearms acquires one say a convicted felon the outcome may be fatal if a person forbidden to vote manages to cast a ballot by pretending to be someone else by contrast the election result will almost never be affected besides the sort of fraud that an id would prevent is exceedingly rare the court in wisconsin found the requirement would block vastly more legal voters than fraudulent ones states have long had procedures that discourage fraud by impersonation without blocking legitimate voters from the polls the stricter new requirements may sound reasonable but they re not reasonable for everyone or reasonable for democracy next georgia city considers requiring a permit to ring somebody s doorbell steve chapman is a columnist and editorial writer for the chicago tribune show comments

preferred steven chapman article steven chapman is on vacation this week lol fine how about a purple thumb iraq has better control of voter fraud than we do shorter me what poppavein said its awesome start working at home with google it s a great work at home opportunity just work for few hours i earn up to 500 a week i can t believe how easy it was once i tried it out http www pow6 com any attempt to require any kind of voter check is racist but we already get the i voted stickers isn t that enough you racist koch loving boooosh voting rethuglicans how about a purple thumb bingo a simple and in no way burdensome way to prevent voter fraud all you have to do to vote in va is tell them your name and address if you don t think there are people making the rounds to different precincts armed with a list of nonvoters dead people then you re very very naive precinct 1 i m john jones 123 fake street precinct 2 i m rick roberts 456 palm court precinct 3 i m bob barrow 789 grave avenue it s a retarded fucking system all you have to do to vote in va is tell them your name and address no the left assures me that this never happens and roads without policemen have no speeding cars on them vote early vote often absentee ballots no have thumbs absentee ballots no have thumbs and there s never a whiff of corruption involving absentee ballots http www miamiherald com 201 aide html btw this is this guy s former aide http time com 99049 congress on cspan time doesn t mention his party affiliation so he must be a d how about a purple thumb i actually think some kind of marking system like that would be fine right hell you don t even need the voter rolls anymore really just go in vote get your thumb dipped it would have to be a really good dye something that couldn t be scrubbed off very easily at all but i would assume some company has just the thing wasn t there a story earlier this week about some foaming atm with dye maybe they re up to the job foaming atm ew isn t that dye they put in the garment protector thingy supposed to be a bitch to clean out or the dye they put in bags of money silver nitrate that stuff doesn t leave your thumb for weeks until the skin sloughs off ehhhh i agree with the idea but in a first world country any idiot can go to home depot or equivalent and by any number of solvents acetone is a pretty simple go to for almost every adhesive or dye to wipe off even really strong dyes except for maybe the silver nitrate the guy below said i don t think you can take that off i d open it up to literally everybody prisoners children tourists if you re thumb is unmarked vote no residency no id no age check nothing 1 voting is almost worthless i only do it because the pols check this shit and i want to scare them when i write them 2 no privacy intrusion of any kind 3 pols are always yapping about the importance of voting here ya go i d bet money there would be at least one precinct in the country where the vote tally would drop if you implemented this you d better start looking for suckers willing to bet against you those type of suckers would be easy to find unfortunately those are the exact kind of people who would weasel their way out of paying they d retroactively move the goal posts or declare extenuating circumstances etc i like it there d be a stink about absentee voting though yup at least the in advance kind you could print ballots in advance and hand them out at will so people could take them on vacations or business trips and submit remotely just make sure all election offices use the same ink etc wrong that might might prevent double votes but it does nothing to assure you are a citizen with the constitutional right to vote purple thumb that s practically blackface your motivations must be racist i can t help myself the logic behind laws requiring voters to provide a government issued photo identification card is simple and seductive if you need to show an id to board a plane open a bank account get public aid or do any number of other things it only makes sense to do the same before casting a ballot false premise the logic behind requiring that people who wish to vote prove that they are eligible to do so is that this country and states and localities have laws about who can vote and who can t and there are docuemented cases where people who were ineligible to vote did or voted multiple times or yada yada yada so the logix behind requiring some sort of id is to verify that the person seeking to vote actually is eligible to do so the other decoy shit chapman so helpfully listed are things that require identification and that some people have thus offered as evidence that requiring identification for banal shit exists so why is it a big deal for voting which actual is more important than your abilility to buy some booze or cigarettes etc to some people so fuck you as usual chapman false premise ignore actual issues that have occurred list some projected speculated number of people who might have a problem disingenuous the end you just said fuck you to everyone who takes the small government position ie no vote id i thought the real libertarian posishionnnnnz was no voting at all i m not sure i make the connection between voter ids and statism unless you go all slippery slope on me and start screaming about national id i d also be happy with the purple thumb approach i m a centrist classical liberal not a libertarian they aren t synonyms fuck off new bo i m not a black multi millionaire under 40 so i don t know why you called me a new bo and then you complain when i consider you a prog the small government position that conveniently coincides with the dnc talking points you know that libertarianism is separate from conservatism right by your logic reason is a leftist magazine because they support marijuana legalization and former republican governor of new mexico gary johnson also opposes voter id requirements gary johnson for whom i d have voted for in 2012 if i d been a us citizen is wrong you see i didn t grow up in the us i don t have an ounce of white guilt in me reason and gary johnson have plenty it s important that everyone in the country believes that the elections are fair many millions of americans suspect that the democrats engage in voter fraud requiring voters to prove that they are who they claim they are and eligible to vote is an important step to prove that the rule of law is followed and that the us elections are fair that s how it s done in most civilized countries however the democratic activists have to resort to voter fraud and more importantly need to stir up racial tensions in order to remain a national party that s why i truly despise your ilk i m not anglo saxon so i don t have white guilt and the part of me that is anglo comes from my grandmother who s a german ww2 refugee so no white guilt there either i m also part jew so i don t have ww2 german guilt either both major parties are fraudulent and shouldn t exist both republicans and democrats spout the same the other party needs corruption to exist nonsense while refusing to look in the mirror who s side were you on when ron paul schooled neocon giuliani on foreign policy in that 2007 debate if i had to guess you were on giuliani s side third parties and independents are the answer not more regulations and red tape people get what they vote for so it s idiot guilt then that forces you to produce such drivel you just said fuck you to everyone who takes the small government position ie no vote id i don t see how it is un libertarian to enforce the law on the books that says each person has to be registered to vote and can only vote once if you think its un libertarian to enforce a law then i think what you really mean is that the law should be repealed so unless you are saying we shouldn t concern ourselves with whether the person voting is eligible to do so or has voted more than once i have a hard time seeing why you would oppose a requirement that this all be verified ding we have a winner this is my general position as well rule of law is more important than future libertarian awesomeness and further the best way to build opposition to bad laws is to actually enforce them diligently a bad law not enforced is one that stays on the books and gets enforced when the man feels like it i d be fine with no checks on voting eligibility or any of the related laws in a libertarian state but we have a giant coercive state right now and it would be nice to limit the franchise to well people actually eligible to exercise it so long as such laws exist don t like that that s cool but push to change the law rather than suggesting it just be ignored because you don t like it because ignoring laws you don t like leads not to utopia but to blackshirts the idea expressed below that it somehow makes government illegitimate as opposed to other first principles doing so if anyone can t vote for any reason or if any restrictions like prove you re actually a citizen and over 18 exist is at best not obvious actually limiting the ability of people to take part in a government activity isn t exactly a fuck you to small government it isn t a government which does not have some measure of the consent of its governed strikes me as illegitimate in everything it does except those who can demonstrate that they re eligible to provide their consent most certainly is a measure of consent of its governed sure if limiting only to those who are eligible there is no problem but if it further limits or prevents those who are eligible then there is a problem malarkey smaller government can not be achieved if big government voters are allowed to stuff the ballot box how do you know who s for big government or not how do you know who s for big government or not if they have a d anywhere near their name uh no i m very much for minimal government but you can t have a system of voting without a method to prevent fraud without it the results of voting mean nothing it s also telling that cities like chicago are well known for their number of dead people who vote yet we keep hearing lies from those who politically agree with those who benefit from voter fraud that there s no such thing as voter fraud it s really telling that chapman is ok with showing id background checks restrictions to purchase guns when the second amendment clearly says that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed yet he s against showing a simple id in order to vote his reasoning is that someone buying a gun could kill people yet he ignores that a criminals still obtain guns so it s a moot point and b governments kill far more people each year than criminals chapman also said that it doesn t matter if people commit voter fraud since it wouldn t affect elections so using his own reasoning there s no problem with the extremely small minority who refuse to obtain an id because their lack of votes wouldn t affect elections so which is it do votes not matter and thus there s no reason to stop voter fraud or are votes important and it s a travesty to not let people vote who refuse to do such a trivial task as obtain a free id issued by the state so the logix behind requiring some sort of id is to verify that the person seeking to vote actually is eligible to do so bing bing bing we have a winner so fuck you as usual chapman seconded my thoughts exactly the entire article was an irrational straw man argument plus who cares if some lady needs to pay 200 to fix her birth certificate she doesn t need to vote to survive if she thinks voting is so important then she ll pay the 200 anyone to stupid or cheap to get an id shouldn t be voting if a person forbidden to vote manages to cast a ballot by pretending to be someone else by contrast the election result will almost never be affected bullshit if i vote for candidate a and a person committing fraud votes candidate b my vote is neutralized bullshit right back assuming randomness they will cancel if you assume fraud that s a different matter but even more irrelevant because it s so much easier to commit fraud where the ballots are counted and the campaign lies are the worst fraud of all you re full of it voting fraud is never random so that blows your assumption into a zillion pieces nonsense voter fraud would tend to skew to the more dishonest politician for ovbivious reasons like a they organize the fraud ala acorn b dishonest people are attracted to them c special interest parasites on the taxpayer how want a dishonest redistribution of spending and rule will vote for the dishonest politician bullshit on both the only reason politicians care about this issue is because id less people tend to vote in one particular fashion that fashion is easy to deduce from the two parties positions on the issue those positions of course should have no bearing on whether or not id is a good idea chapman s article does a good job of crtitiquing specific aspects of obtaining an id but doesn t really defeat the concept of voter id in principle i was bullshitting the fraud argument not the denial rationale you are right that s the main reason for politicians wanting voter id but i wasn t addressing that are you saying people too stupid and lazy to get an id tend to vote democrat bullshit on all of it voting is bullshit why are people who oppose the idea of proving who you say you are in order to vote so convinced that fraud isn t a significant problem if proving who you are isn t required the actual rate of fraud being perpetrated would obviously be impossible to ascertain it s anybody s guess under the status quo there are always close elections bush in 2000 franken s election to the senate a few years ago even a tiny amount of fraud can have a major impact actually if voter fraud was a significant problem it would be a national security issue and the nsa would respond surely they re tracking voters right jesus let s just wish fraud away because the political parties are just so trustworthy the point is these laws are not going to stop the kind of fraud that political parties are interested in but they will stop some actual voters from voting i don t believe the former the latter maybe care to elaborate a political party would have to be crazy to try to rig an election by having people show up and pretend they are some other voter in the ward because that voter may have already voted and boom you are caught by far the better way to do it would be to have the election officials rig the vote in some way and voter id laws do not touch that in the cases that have gone to court often both sides will actually stipulate or the court will find as a finding of fact that there are indeed quite a few people under these proposals who would not have the requisite papers to get the requisite id without some significant cost and effort a political party would have to be crazy to try to rig an election by having people show up and pretend they are some other voter in the ward because that voter may have already voted and boom you are caught nonsense you just keep voters on the rolls who are dead or who have moved where do you get a reliable list of dead and moved voters i m not sure what you mean simply refusing to clean the voter rolls leaves dead and moved voters there ready for fraud you don t need to get a reliable list you would need a list of dead and moved persons to check against the list of voters otherwise you could cast a vote for a living nonmoved person which happens see my twitchy link below you would need a list of dead and moved persons to check against the list of voters otherwise you could cast a vote for a living nonmoved person have you ever talked to a person that s worked at a polling place before because this happens repeatedly every election indeed the people who work polling places routinely kick people out who have already voted that day ask richard daley political operatives that work in government ones you hired appointed where do you get a reliable list of dead and moved voters chicago dnc headquarters of course i just don t buy it ids are required for any number of transactions including government ones it s basic and opposition to it in voting has to be at least partially based in a desire to engage in fraud lots of people live for years without any id i work with a group of people who exemplify this they had id s at one time they got hired they lost their id somehow years have gone by but they either don t bank or the bank people know them they are old enough to buy alcohol without being carded etc it is actually quite easy to make it without id then don t vote it s absurd to treat something that clearly should have minimum security with very little thanks for supporting my point infra um no i m not it s not anti libertarian to require some sort of authentication process it doesn t have to be a state id and certainly no one here is advocating a national id but it needs to be more than i promise i m not voting for the third time an illegal alien or whatever other fraudulent thing you suspect me of private entities require id all of the time for a variety of transactions this idea that voting doesn t involve fraud but every other transaction where fraud can unjustly benefit someone does is simply nonsensical thank you that s argument number one that i trot out whenever someone accuses me of hypocrisy for being libertarian and supporting voter id laws not to mention that my personal suspicion is that voter fraud is an overwhelmingly democrat institution as their allegations of racism on that issue are far more vehement and far less substantiated than on other issues where they regularly accuse their opponents of racism are you stupid he didn t support your point in any way his point was that id should be required for obvious reasons he states you then respond with a red herring because apparently you are intellectually dishonest or an idiot he reiterates his point plus adds a new one which is that if someone is to lazy or stupid to get an id they shouldn t vote voting also requires one to have an address to register to have transportation or accesss to mail should we get rid of all those requirements to just because some people don t have them maybe we should stop turning away people who look the same as someone who just voted after all not everybody looks different than the next guy and we might be preventing twins and triplets from voting you pretty much need an id to cash a check anywhere so no you don t i know my bank teller and they cash my checks all the time without asking me for id they asked once years ago but they certainly stopped asking a while back besides a lot of people got direct deposit back when they had their id and first landed their job you just proved my point how do you think so i said you pretty much need an id to cash a check anywhere so you said they asked once years ago but they certainly stopped asking a while back besides a lot of people got direct deposit back when they had their id and first landed their job if you make any cash withdrawals you need an id if you make a deposit you need an id if you visit a bank your need and id i you know your teller you don t need an id sure but do you personally know anyone who works the polls that s what she said i thought we were talking about whether you need an id to get through normal everyday life my example about my bank was to that whether you need one at the polls is of course the debate at hand i m only replying to those who say we should require at the polls because everyone already has one and has to have one they don t and they don t you sure as hell can t open a banking account or travel within 100 miles of the border or do any number of things without an id the fact that some people choose to live lives without id is fine so what if they want to vote they still need to register and i see nothing wrong with requiring them to get an id as far as i know every voter id law contains provisions which chapman elides allowing any voter to get a valid id for voting without having to pay for it if they can show need if you can point to a state with a recently adopted voter id law where the state waives the fees for the id and the documentation needed to get said id i would like to see it sure here s texas http www txdps state tx us d tionid htm you will note the lack of any fee being charged for this id i like the way you moved the goalposts on waiving the fees for the paper to prove you are eligible for the voter id i like the way you moved the goalposts on waiving the fees for the paper to prove you are eligible for the voter id it s not a goalpost move if you can not get the id without the other documents it s the goal itself don t forget to leave out the cost of bus fare to apply for the id talk about your barriers nothing ever anywhere is every completely and totally free if that s your standard then there is no way to meet it and you might as well go to the point of saying that we should allow anyone to vote as many times as they want nothing anywhere is totally free so let s just throw on as many more barriers as we can straw man argument you might as well go to the point of saying that we should allow anyone to vote as many times as they want that is exactly where his argument leads how the hell did you open a bank account without an id lol unless you have to buy sudafed sld applies here of course but the idea that voter id is an undue burden is laughable the fucking statists have made id mandatory for so many things at this point that it s silly to claim that having one to vote is a hardship the fucking statists have made id mandatory for so many things should we libertarians jump on that caboose because the democrats won some elections because that is what this all about voter id laws became big among the gop when obama won a funny named furrin seeming guy won so instead of looking at how their party might have issues it must have been corruption and fraud the democrats did the same thing when they lost elections remember the crying over the hackable electronic voting machines in 2004 that s not what i said you disingenuous twat you can make a principled argument and libertarians do and should but it s simply bullshit to suggest that the overwhelming majority of adults do not have some kind of government issued id card at this point we are well and truly into the papieren bitte era of america the progtarded belief that you should have to show id for everything except voting is hypocritical and based purely on their reliance on voter fraud to swing close elections such as franken or the wa governor s race a few years back it s simply bullshit to suggest that the overwhelming majority of adults do not have some kind of government issued id card at this point like i said whenever this goes to court the judges usually make a finding of fact about how many people do not and it is pretty significant every time i ve seen it take a look at the 5th circuit s recent ruling on the texas law good god almighty it s like pb has developed an altar ego to carry on with the libertarian purity testing things like vote early vote often don t invent themselves neither do stories of the dead voting for some reason both are traceable back to a specific political party this notion that we treat boarding an airplane buying liquor checking out a library book as more sacrosanct than voting in nauseating for some reason both are traceable back to a specific political party see i think this is telling this is what is behind the push the need to fight the democrats dirty election tricks i should also say that of course there is a lot of documented history of both democrats and republicans engaging in voter fraud in the earlier times of our republic nucky thompson was a republican remember we are well and truly into the papieren bitte era of america since this is america and not europe i would call it the sus papeles por favor era so bo can t really challenge the opposition to fraud so he imputes racism to those who disagree with him while faking a redeck accent to boot yup no reason whatsoever to think bo s a first class douche where is the racism imputed i actually explicitly reject such a charge below and i ve more than successfully challenged the opposition to fraud where is the racism imputed a funny named furrin seeming guy won yup no imputation of racism there i was thinking more xenophobia actually well isn t that special it doesn t make you one iota less of a douche supporters of voter id have stated their motivations that your first reaction is to ignore their own professd motives and ascribe something less worthwhile just demonstrates what i ve said about you for a long time you don t really argue in good faith you re a troll and i ve more than successfully challenged the opposition to fraud only in your own demented mind you bloody idiot should we libertarians jump on that caboose because the democrats won some elections could you please stop saying we libertarians it really doesn t make us all go well bo s a libertarian so we should just accept what he s saying voter id laws became big among the gop when obama won total and absolute bullshit they ve been pushing for that for as long as i ve been alive i could name example after ezample but need only list one the 2002 help america vote act that s years before obama was elected it s clear that not only are you stupid but dishonest and also to lazy to look shit up before spreading lies no wonder you don t want voter id you wouldn t be abel to vote or commit voter fraud because only stupid lazy people can t get ids and crooks don t like voter id for obvious reasons so they re working adults they can get id if they want it so they can get id to vote here for instance a non dl state id is maybe 30 you picked the least effective example possible for your disenfranchisement argument further i ll add that i support giving poor people id for free for the same reason voting is a civil right and a fundamental one in a democratic society but that doesn t mean we can t require id to prove eligibility it means id should be easy to get and not burdensome reason confuses me sometimes voting is completely pointless but proving you are you to vote is a horrific injustice that has disenfranchised too many people you may have noticed that nobody here save bo and tony agrees with anything chapman writes it s one of those impenetrable mysteries of life why reason still publishes him more licensing freedom and liberty not buying it shows how little you understand what it is like to be poor i imagine you have never found yourself homeless or elderly without proper id or any of the other situations described in the article if you don t want poor people to vote just say so it s disappointing to me how so many of the commenters here are passionate about our constitutional rights except this one reason gets it right on this one if you ve made enough stupid decisions through life to end up poor homeless and without id i really don t want you to vote if a person forbidden to vote manages to cast a ballot by pretending to be someone else by contrast the election result will almost never be affected besides the sort of fraud that an id would prevent is exceedingly rare the court in wisconsin found the requirement would block vastly more legal voters than fraudulent ones states have long had procedures that discourage fraud by impersonation without blocking legitimate voters from the polls the stricter new requirements may sound reasonable but they re not reasonable for everyone or reasonable for democracy what type of fraud is the most prevalent what procedures are you referring to if you believe this how is registration constitutional in general isn t that a barrier do you understand your opponents positions at all oh goodie we re doing the voter id thing again attested that they lacked the required id and in many cases couldn t easily get it utter bullshit idk about wisconsin but virginia sent voter ids to everyone that is registered to vote on that note i see no reason why you should not validate said registration by proving you are registered voting in the district that you are supposed to and getting just that one ballot under the help americans vote act there are 6 forms of id such that any one of them has to be taken as sufficient to allow a new registered voter in a district to vote it doesn t need to be a photo id it can be a utility bill or bank statement if it s got the address of the registrant you re in but as has been pointed out many times the far greater problem is fraud or just plain neglect in registration records we have a tough time getting enough signatures as a percentage of voters enrolled in a party to get candidates on the ballot because so many of the official records are out of date they died or moved away years ago so you can t get their sigs but they count toward the number you need i like that paul has come out and chided the fascination with voter id laws recently that so many libertarians the same people who rightly found real id and other papers please measures now want to push these laws is unfortunate for some people libertarianism has come to mean anything that will hurt democrats and while one can sympathize with that view six years into obama s rule it of course means much much more than that proof of identity to vote in a public election ok proof of identity to get a job bad is that too complex for you why would one be bad another ok i don t want government to have give me permission and the ok before i get a job but i do not think they should do the same before i cast my consent or not as to their ruling me i m their boss where are their papers it s a fucking right v a fucking privilege that simple you have a right to free association including association in employment contexts the government stepping in to require identification is violation of that right you have no right to vote voting is a privilege set up by government to throw you a bone sld s apply the government is in no way violating your rights by setting requirements to limit voting privileges otherwise felons couldn t have their voting privileges taken away children could vote and you wouldn t have to be a citizen to vote er you do know you have a 2nd amendment rkba but felons and children don t right scotus has long recognized a right to vote there are more amendments to the constitution concerning that right than any other fine you have the right to vote once assuming you are an eligible voter how do you enforce that without ids you can t all you can do is wave your hands and claim that all parties cheat and it doesn t really matter people proved and still do that they are eligible voters all the time before and without these kinds of laws er you do know you have a 2nd amendment rkba but felons and children don t right yes and jews in nazi germany had that same exact inalienable right unless you believe that rights are derived from a piece of paper and the nazis took those guns away did jews simply not have a right to keep and bear arms rights are inalienable and their source is not government voting is not a right the declaration of independence would like a word with you you mean the declaration of independence that the people didn t vote on that doesn t contain the bill of rights and that isn t our governing document how about requiring proof of identity for neither i don t necessarily think presenting ids is the best answer but literally anything to mark you ve voted once isn t necessarily a bad thing anyway i feel like most of the fraud occurs when someone who was registered doesn t show i think you are right anyway i feel like most of the fraud occurs when someone who was registered doesn t show but how would you systematically be able to know who those people were it would be a pretty fantastic gamble unless you had some inside help and if you have that why commit vote fraud that way because you look at the empty ballots and fill them out after the polls close you don t know who these people are until after the fact how do you think dead people vote because you look at the empty ballots and fill them out after the polls close that requires the election officials to be in on it voter id does nothing for that who do you think works the polls seriously look at my op i don t necessarily think presenting ids is the best answer but literally anything to mark you ve voted once isn t necessarily a bad thing anyway i feel like most of the fraud occurs when someone who was registered doesn t show so what do you think happens when someone does not show the crooked poll worker goes and gets a stooge to come in and vote for that person why not just have the crooked poll person rig the results right there themselves what when someone does not show the crooked poll worker goes and gets a stooge to come in and vote for that person this doesn t happen as often as this why not just have the crooked poll person rig the results right there themselves but they both occur why not attempt to prevent both what exactly is your argument my argument is that these laws will perhaps provide some benefit but also some costs the costs are some legal voters who will be unable to get the required id and vote if the benefits are small because the type of fraud it might and i stress might stop is small that makes the case for the law less tenable i agree which is why republican s are only addressing half of the equation because they engage in fraud to i think that some form of id or proof of who you are along with some additional check safety measure such as attaching that proof to your ballot would be the best answer it is very easy for even ordinary voters with no particular credentials at all to get a look at the sign in book at the polling place it does help a little if elections inspectors are in on it but there are so many of them that that help is not hard to get and it s not really necessary anyway in fact when you re signing in it s practically impossible not to see several close to your name in alphabetic order that s exactly how lbj got the to be the senate nominee in texas in 1948 more recently how about those polls in philadelphia guarded by club wielding black panthers the ones that eric holder dropped charges against the rest of out state votes 55 45 republican then at 3 am the totals come in from phiily going 70 30 democrat and outweighing the rest of the state i ll bet there were dem poll workers up late once they knew how many votes were needed filling in the appropriate number of ballots in the names of people who didn t show up or had moved or had died i ve lost count of how many statewide elections senator president where i have watched a close election be trending republican until after midnight then the democrat votes come rolling in in florida in 2000 bush has a lead of 70k votes with only 100k left to count and gore got the votes he needed how did that happen to me that was more suspicious than the recount fiasco let s only recount counties where we had a lead elections in the usa are highly manipulated by a number of methods including gerrymandering massively biased registration procedures illegal caging massively biased removals from voting rolls accidental misdirection of voters and massively biased allocation of and mode setting of voting machines among others but how would you systematically be able to know who those people were derp derp derp nsa data mining check the voter rolls against death certificates had some inside help like say from a federal bureaucracy which has been politicized why commit vote fraud that way why not who s going to catch you you hi i m tulpa virginian and i m here to vote today official looking at voter rolls ok mr tulpa wait a minute it shows here you have already voted today i m afraid i need you to step over here oh my god you re adorable you actually think election officials are honest and not the very ones committing the fraud god you re such an aspie retard again if the election official is dishonest why in the world would you get a stooge to come vote for someone who may or may not have already been listed as voting that day have you seen the video of the guy asking jim moran s son for tips on how to vote in someone else s name in a virginia election moran the younger tells him to bring a utility bill among other suggestions moran never suggests that it s illegal or immoral oh my god you re adorable you actually think election officials are honest and not the very ones committing the fraud of course they are the ones committing fraud that is exactly why voter id laws won t help much if it is the people in charge of checking ids who are committing the fraud why would you trust them not to lie about having checked ids this because it makes convincingly covering their fraud that much more difficult that is a specious claim where s your evidence many very good people work hard to make the elections work have you ever voted yes official looking at voter rolls ok mr tulpa wait a minute it shows here you have already voted today i m afraid i need you to step over here and then the person just leaves do you honestly think that poll workers attempt to arrest everyone who shows up again it s almost never prosecuted unless they catch you after the fact or the undercover video from new hampshire where he looked up obits of recently deceased people then went to the polls and said do you have a john smith why yes mr smith here s your ballot is it possible for people to vote in the name of dead people oh no we have safeguards to make sure that can t happen i m into genealogy and computer programming i ve written a script to download all the obits from my local newspaper it s was actually fairly easy the only risk would be if there s an honest poll worker who personally knew the deceased here s the problem with purple fingers they do nothing to affect absentee ballot fraud and i think that s where most of this kind of fraud occurs simply because you can only vote so many times in person on election day for real industrial scale fraud you need to either corrupt the polling places or you need to submit volumes of absentee ballots they do nothing to affect absentee ballot fraud the same is true for most of these voter id laws true enough that just means that we need to change absentee ballot laws to require that they be picked up in person after showing id i for one have no objection to requiring people to exert a slight bit of effort in casting their ballots aren t absentee ballots supposed to be for people who are for some reason unable to go do things like pick up forms in person if you can go pick up an absentee ballot why couldn t you just go to the poll and vote absentee ballots were originally only for those people that could prove they would be unable to get to the polls on the day of the election like being out of town on a trip now they are encouraged by the political parties to get participation from people that just can t be bothered to go to the polls because fytw there are lots of people who can t get there at all though deployed soldiers ex pats hospitalized people you don t have to show up to a physical location to get an absentee ballot you just have to prove you can t get to a ballot box on election day there are ways to make sure the old the infirm and the deployed can get absentee ballots but the problem is that it has become too easy to get an absentee ballot and way to easy to submitted fraudulent absentee ballots soldiers easily handled through the military ex pats easily handled by having them go to an embassy or consulate to get their ballot the disabled and immobile is a tougher one when i lived in australia in a major city the nearest consulate was over 1 000 miles away so not so easy all ballots are blank it s easy enough to provide blank ballot and pre addressed envelopes to people pretty much anywhere in the world well before the time of an election the trick is to provide a secure means of submitting an absentee ballot which means authentication and non repudiation of a sealed envelope but the ballot remains anonymous if the law says that a person must be a registered voter living in a given jurisdiction to be able to vote in the elections of that jurisdiction then it is not irrational to require potential voters to prove registration and residency at the time of the election i am personally ok with imposing id requirements on voters even if it punishes the stupid and the lazy i am personally ok with imposing id requirements on voters even if it punishes the stupid and the lazy again thanks for helping my point below i ll go beyond that i d gleefully impose any burden the prevents people from voting if they haven t decided who to vote for 2 weeks before the election these people are really too stupid to be allowed to vote for exactly the reasons you mention it s really amazing that anyone thinks mandatory voting is a good idea stupid and lazy get punished bo hardest hit even if it punishes the poor or are you equating poor with stupid and lazy gov of washington al franken they both had car trunks full of uncounted ballot boxes that were discovered but once we get into all electronic voting how do we know that once we push the button that my vote is actually faithfully recorded like when the president of honduras was impeached a couple years ago he wanted to have an unconstitutional referendum on changing the constitution to eliminate term limits once he was removed from office they found the election results on his office computer for an election that was never held but is the papers please aspect anything other than a slippery slope argument this is not the government butting in and asking for your papers while you re freely traveling or freely associating it s not even the government requiring you to have a driver s license when you re driving on private property voting is an activity managed by the state and an activity that no person is obliged to engage in and as has been said part of its duty in managing the ballot box is to ensure that only eligible voters vote it s not unreasonable to require proof of identification and eligibility nor is it at all analogous to the state demanding id in the pursuance of free activities or obliging people to interact with the govt and show id e g establishing checkpoints and as i m talking to you bo i trust you recognize that i m only challenging the argument i m generally ambivalent about this issue i don t want people voting at all so i won t lose sleep if poor or elderly people out there are dissuaded from voting but if asked to support a side i d be against it it will likely fail to prevent much fraud but more important is that it gives politicians the grounds for taxpayer funded ids or a national id still asking for id before voting doesn t strike me as unreasonable this is not the government butting in and asking for your papers while you re freely traveling or freely associating i see it as yet another instance and area of the government demanding of me that i present them with papers to exercise my rights and privileges i see it as yet another instance and area of the government demanding of me that i present them with papers to exercise my rights and privileges i m assuming that you oppose any kind of id or other background check for gun purchases then and you oppose voter registration which requires the presentation of papers the existence of one set of barriers seems to me to argue against adding another set not for for some people libertarianism has come to mean anything that will hurt democrats and while one can sympathize with that view six years into obama s rule it of course means much much more than that no actually for a much longer time it s meant only a little bit more than that if you look for the things that hurt specifically democrats as opposed to everybody else you get a damn good approximation of the opposite of the initial direction liberty needs to go in from here now don t take my word for it just look at the analysis don ernsberger did 20 yrs ago he wasn t expecting the outcome he found so it s not like any prejudice of his determined the outcome if those like chaman who wish to keep open an avenue of voter fraud would donate i 10th of the energy to helping those without to get ids that they spend shrilling about voter suppression the problem would be solved we have uncounted millions of people living in this country illegally and for that reason alone if no other we should require voter id there was recently an article about cali governor brown having to sell californians that obamacare was going to cost an additional 1 2 billion for cali taxpayers alone the article went on to say that there were 38 million potential voters but failed to mention there were only 6 3 million taxpayers among them another reason why voter id should be a requirement to vote http goo gl txku8t if those like chaman who wish to keep open an avenue of voter fraud would donate i 10th of the energy to helping those without to get ids that they spend shrilling about voter suppression the problem would be solved that cuts both ways supporters of voter id laws would be less open to attacks of voter suppression if they coupled their laws with some significant outreach to get proper id to those who can not afford or reach them but they usually don t and you can combine this with the fact that a lot of these voter id laws are part of more comprehensive election reforms which include measures like making it harder for third parties like the lp to get on the rolls and making it harder for groups like college kids who are more likely to vote libertarian than other groups to vote i think that pretty much everyone who is for voter id s has literally said that i have personally heard talk about the issu e they would provide for those that couldn t afford or reach one at some capacity but maybe that s just anecdotal actually i have heard the opposite the exchange usually goes like this supporter oh these people can get ids without much trouble everyone has one opponent that s not so it can be difficult for some to navigate the time and expense of the bureaucracy supporter well if it ain t worth it to them then they should not be voting after you have that last line it is kind of hard to argue you re not at least partly motivated or at least ok with the fact that some votes are going to be suppressed there is no expense in many states id s are issued for free mostly because they re needed for a host of things unrelated to voting the ids may be issued for free but the documentation needed to get that id usually is not that is usually the biggest barrier getting things like birth certificates and such have you ever lost your wallet and had to go through that process i did once it was a bear and i m a just successfully completed 2l some poor elderly shut in good luck with that poor elderly shut ins lose their wallets all the time eh exception proves the rule poor elderly people lose all kinds of things all the time do you now know any poor elderly shut ins the straws ask that you not grasp them so tightly if a few outlier cases of a shut in losing a wallet is your basis for opposing id for voting then it s time to look for a new argument if a few outlier cases of a shut in losing a wallet as i have said repeatedly in the court cases over this they actually find as a matter of fact how many people who are eligible voters do not have the requisite id and it is more than a few outlier cases nice of you to have no concern over those few outlier cases though as i have said repeatedly in the court cases over this they actually find as a matter of fact how many people who are eligible voters do not have the requisite id and it is more than a few outlier cases they do not find as a fact as you state just think bo if you really cared you could have helped someone get an id with all the time and energy you have spent here thank you for this comment i work with elderly people and it is clear that most commenters here don t have an idea what it might be like to be elderly or poor or homeless those folks still have a right to vote wait you carry your birth certificate in your wallet i carried my id and my ss card they were lost my parents could not find my birth certificate it must be a common enough thing because the places i went to get all the records had a procedure laid out for it i recently got a birth certificate over the internet with no problem i could have just as easily done it over the phone even if it were an obama phone voters who care about voting can and will get an id if they need one to vote thus demonstrating that if you let people redefine suppression to mean anything they don t like then anything they don t like will be suppression by this logic isn t the basic requirement to register itself an act of suppression i put the word suppression in quotes for a reason i d prefer barrier to entry or something so registration is a barrier to entry no question about that i guess we need to get rid of it having to be a citizen is a barrier to entry too are we gonna get rid of that requirement being a felon is a barrier to entry in some states being able to get your lazy fucking ass out of bed and down to the poll on time is a barrier to entry being literate enough to understand the instructions is a barrier to entry god forbid you work all day and don t have time to get to the poll that s a pretty damn big barrier to entry but no we re wheeling grandma off the cliff by requiring her to prove that she s not voting for the 4th time today by simply showing some form of identification that s a bridge too far she spent all day getting ready getting wheeled out of the nursing home arranging transportation and waiting in line but id that s just mean i like this logic that because there are already this or that barrier to entry we should support additional ones i wonder where else we as libertarians could apply it bo that seems to be a ridiculous posture this is such a trivial change to the current system that acting as if this is creating a substantial barrier to entry is a contrived concern you show a strong mood affiliation with democrats and it s highly likely that democrats will be net losers in this equation i suspect that this is what s really driving your concern what do people think gov t recognition of same sex marriage or any marriage is it s a record saying person a is married to person b can you be in favor of gov t s recording that but not recording who an individual is a couple months ago i believe in nc there was a rally against voter id participants were asked to bring their id to the rally to prove they were registered to attend supporters of voter id laws would be less open to attacks of voter suppression if they coupled their laws with some significant outreach to get proper id to those who can not afford them hahaha uh no they wouldn t remember racist until proven democrat i did not say anything about race but keep fighting your own personal culture war are you new jesus on a freaking biscuit the chief argument from the dems about voter id is racist 11 for some reason the left thinks blacks are incapable of getting ids well when a dem brings up that view then use that response but i am not talking about that oh you were only talking about yourself if so you shouldn t have phrased it like you were speaking for everyone who attacks supporters of voter id laws like wareagle said the racism claim is constantly being trotted out by dems for everything really but especially voter id i guess it is brought up a lot for legal reasons we have laws that allow for stricter scrutiny concerning laws that might have a disproportionate impact on races but not laws for the same thing base on income or education or whatever i m under no illusions that the democrat party is taking any position on this or anything frankly due to principle either black people being more likely to be poor and less educated i guess these laws would negatively impact more of them than others but that s hardly why i would oppose them texas has offered free ids to those who claim hardship if that s not enough then fuck them just because you and they think we should hand deliver an id to their front door is no reason that we should if someone isn t interested in voting enough to make sure they qualify to vote under the requirement of having an id then they don t want to vote 38 million possible voters in california voting about funding 1 2 trillion in additional obamacare costs to be paid for by 6 3 million taxpayers if you were one of the 6 3 million taxpayers would you consider it fair to expect the voters to at least be eligible to vote being required to show your papers is what a free society is all about isn t it and allowing anyone to cast as many votes as they possibly can is what democracy is all about isn t it i remember when one man one vote was the rallying cry of the democrats whatever happened to that i don t believe in democracy and i don t keep track of democratic rallying cries because i m not a democratic i voted for a constitution party candidate once for fuck sakes because i m not a democrat those activities in any event are not constitutionally guaranteed which voting is actually no we do not have a constitutional right to vote this article is just a hodgepodge of appeals to emotion and a straw man argument the logic behind laws requiring if you need to show an id to board a plane the logic is that an id is required to verify that you are who you say you are the examples listed are merely examples of other areas where id verification is required and that doing so is routine and doesn t put any extraordinary demands on the entrants these attitudes reflect a failure to understand the lives of many americans except that vastly more americans have ids than don t the burden of proof is trivial to claim it causes great hardship is clearly an exaggeration the government can impose regulations that affect constitutional rights but it must have a good reason and the rules can t be an undue burden voter identification is a good reason and the rules requiring an id are not an undue burden didn t chapman do an article on this very topic here two weeks ago or so it s like shikha and immigration i don t think that the primary motivation for voter id laws is voter suppression or racism but i m still not a big fan i can t say that i know for sure but it seems to me that significant voter fraud requires people running the polls i e the people who would check ids to be in on it making it easy to circumvent the id requirement it s pretty low on my list of bad things but on principle i don t like it at least allow some other way to verify identity which some states do in nh you can sign an affidavit and have your picture taken i don t think it s a conspiracy against black democrats just government overreach as usual the overregulation of businesses is spilling over into politics i think you and i are on the same page how about this for a sort of silly solution just making voting anonymous and let anyone vote as many times as they want i really think that the only value voting really provides is to inject enough randomness into the system to keep anyone from having too much control it s really not a good way to implement the will of the people if you are into that sort of thing when you only have 2 or 3 candidates to choose from really the government should be small enough and have sufficiently limited powers that it doesn t matter who gets elected but that would cause a voting arms race with vast resources spent creating the ultimate vote casting machine maybe it would save the economy just make it so one person can cast one vote at a time if they want to vote more they get at the back of the line and go again that way you can also measure the enthusiasm of the votes or how many people with nothing else to do each party can hire to go vote it s a very silly idea but i like it people take voting too seriously it s more difficult to have multiple ids than it is to register under multiple names if a person forbidden to vote manages to cast a ballot by pretending to be someone else by contrast the election result will almost never be affected sure and if a person kills and eats your grandmother the nation will almost never be affected that isn t the point we don t have spare votes lying around there s just one franchise per citizen every fraudulent vote counted requires a legitimate vote is nullified disenfranchisement is disenfranchisement just brainstorming but why can t the board of elections issue a photo id on request when someone registers to vote and they don t already have a usable id i assume that they had to provide evidence of identity in order to register bingo the boe issues an id good for voting purposes no fuss no muss because the entire point is to make it harder for people to vote that was so responsive to the point i made it was the whole point of these schemes is to reduce voter turnout which benefits republicans it can t possibly be to prevent in person voter fraud because that is a nonexistent problem if you want to reduce voter turnout then you make the system more cumbersome not less if you want to make it easy then just don t require ids at all as has worked just fine forever argument by bullshitting if you support these measures you are not a libertarian you are gop backwash and you don t get to call me a troll anymore because not only are you a partisan you re lying about it either that or you re an idiot who believes whatever the republicans and their flapping puppets tell you in which case i m sorry for what s happened to you argument by ad hominem on the other hand if you use a complete bullshit argument like tony does here you re a total douche it can t possibly be to prevent in person voter fraud because that is a nonexistent problem hahahahaha if you say so then it must be so if it never happens then you should have no problem with states offering free ids and then requiring them to vote as long as it does not have the effect of making it more difficult for legitimate voters to vote can someone explain why increasing unnecessary bureaucracy is the libertarian position i mean fuck you re willing to tolerate huge increases in risk in all aspects of life on top of that you all are skeptical of democracy anyway to put it mildly the only apparent organizing principle among libertarian positions is that they support republicans and everything they want because there s fuck all about liberty here tony you are obviously a democratic troll only democrats believe that rights exist in isolation libertarians recognize that rights come with responsibilities the other way i know your a democrat is that you equate libertarianism with anarchy libertarians don t object to laws they object to unnecessary laws protecting the integrity of a national election is a valid reason to have a law this is a good issue to separate the libertarians from the gop talk radio sheep guess which ones i think support not creating unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles to exercising a basic right for the single purpose of benefiting a specific political party during a democratic presidency especially one as statist as obama s has been in tone and in policy a lot of conservatives travel with libertarians and a lot of libertarians become convinced that the gop as the lesser of two evils should be supported by libertarians hence a lot of what you see on this site a lot but really a lot of that just attests to how awful on a libertarian scale obama has been anyone who thinks the gop is the lesser of two evils has been in a coma for some fraction of 40 years that includes on big government and spending grounds the only thing republicans do is pretend to be for the things you guys are for they ve never and i mean never actually demonstrated it look the trolls are jacking each other off like you had to look really hard for 1 of those huh oh you of course disclaimer i like the idea of photo ids but i don t think it s the most urgent issue as the democrats argue the fraudsters would find other methods and the democrats should know democratic spokesperson you see voter ids are useless because if i wanted to commit vote fraud hypothetically i would first check the records of infants who died 18 or more years ago and create a fake voter profile for them and issue it to one of my operatives and the operative would accumulate enough identities to vote multiple times and they d have ids because they registered fraudently or i would also hypothetically simply stuff the ballot boxes how would an id requirement prevent that chapman has a sliver of a good point with regard to the requirement of government issued id being bad it should be any id there is also the point that bad voter rolls are worse than voter id law other than that there is no case against some kind of voter id law ontario has had it for years without a problem it should be any id which is the functional equivalent of no id any id includes a crayon drawing of me on a big chief tablet with my name under it stop that you should know perfectly well that it means a co op id or something like that the major parties have major grassroots efforts to bus voters to precincts etc to up their turnout the notion that they d go to those extraordinary lengths but stop short of actually fudging ballots for registered voters who do not turn out is naive in the extreme the dem woman in ohio who just got released early for voter fraud is an example you have to be all kinds of stupid to believe that was an isolated event she just got caught because she wasn t very smart about it and the point about her case is this it was not a case of one fraudulent vote it was one person casting i believe 6 total votes extrapolate from there and you get the potential for massive numbers of votes and it doesn t require more than one person in a key position at a polling location to produce a lot of these fraudulent votes the argument that the parties would be foolish to risk it misses the point entirely it s not a top down thing it s passionate believers on the ground here and there doing their own thing it s all the more likely in places where one party rule prevails such monoliths breed rationalizations like the one that woman in ohio used she not only was unapologetic she bragged and was proud of her fraud the constitution requires voters to be citizens if there s no check for that than you might as well remove the statement from the constitution the most vote fraud happens in another way argument is bullshit it s like saying that most burglaries don t happen via the bathroom window so you don t need to secure it if you want a secure election system you secure it at all levels but of course many people don t want a secure election system but there are always tradeoffs with any policy voter id probably will make it harder or impossible for some people to vote in some elections now one might say that you shouldn t vote if you can t be bothered to get the id but at the moment stupidity and laziness are not disqualifications for voting i m not trying to tell you that that is worse than the potential fraud with no id requirement but you have to take that into consideration let s not go all proggie here and pretend that any well intentioned policies won t have negative consequences all you need is a way to implement voter id that doesn t make it harder or impossible for some legitimate voters to vote it s not hard say some grizzed mountain man emerges from the woods having been born and lived his life away from things like voting and towns and stuff he has no birth certificate or ssn but he is still a citizen with the legal right to vote what about him yes i am being a bit ridiculous but there always could be people denied their right to vote by the id requirement as i ve said this is pretty low on my list of things to be upset about and i think that most of the arguments against it are stupid but i ll maintain my principled stand against an absolute id requirement then get him an id there are various ways to confirm who he is he has no birth certificate or ssn but he is still a citizen with the legal right to vote with zero paperwork of any kind i don t think he s even going to be able to register that s the issue that s being skipped over here you can t register to vote without showing some proof of identity and residency so how do you say nobody should have to show id to vote without saying nobody should have to register to vote but you an register in a neighborhood and then vote for decades there these laws are talking about presenting the government approved id every time you vote after that yeah no you can register to vote by mail with no such proof at all and there are many fraudulent registr ns like that the board of elections is supposed to act when they send notice of an election and it comes back addressee unknown which it won t as long as someone in the bldg takes the mail but often they don t i had to be out of town during the 2012 election i didn t have time to obtain an absentee ballot before leaving town as a result i was not able to vote was i denied my right to vote yes but it was my fault because i wasn t able to comply with the rules of the election it was my responsibility and not the state s to make sure i was able to vote this happens to thousands of people every election voter id is no different if people want to vote they will get the required id a few isolated cases should not be the basis for law as for the some people can t get an id argument then set up a system to help them get ids at no cost to them in fact that question is a good test of the nature of these objections if a voter id requirement came with a means to provide free ids to those who don t have them would you still object my guess is that those still objecting would be 1 libertarians who don t like ids on principle but mostly 2 democrats who worry they ll lose more elections if fraud is reduced if states pushing voter id laws would do this then i would agree those complaining have no leg to stand on georgia s voter id law did exactly that and still the democrats threw a hissy fit and the obama administration tried to have it struck down all voter id laws have provisions for free ids but that s not enough because the id opponents complain that the documentation required for an id are not free but how far should this hand holding go at some point you have to wean people off of breastfeeding everyone gets a free birth certificate when they are born if they lose it they usually have to pay a nominal fee for a new one big deal if everything has to be free then the govt needs to provide free transportation on election day as well chapman was misleading about something else everyone needs an id eventually everyone without an id you can t cash a paycheck welfare check unemployment check or social security check or alternatively you can t set up a bank account for direct deposit without an id despite what chapman said in the article unless your own brother or sister works at the bank they need to verify your identity new york investigation finds fraudulent voters allowed to cast ballots 97 of the time non citizens caught voting in 2012 presidential election in key swing state in the doi case of course because either someone at the polls would have to recognize the person as not being who they voted in place of or see the signature as not matching somali immigrants charged with illegal double voting in minn non citizens voted in colorado media smear messenger why can t i use my facebook profile to vote three fifths of milwaukee s black voters have vanished without a trace voter fraud in wisconsin over 4 500 more votes than voters in 2004 i say just restrict the vote to landowners over age 30 that will get rid of most of these problems http twitchy com 2012 11 06 than once http www telegraph co uk com vote html would you care to narrow those down to cases of actual fraud and then perhaps cases in which ids would have made a difference because i ve been through a few of the links but haven t found one yet then compare those numbers to the numbers of disenfranchised by these laws and tell me it s an appropriate trade off personally i don t really care about voter id laws however i ve been lectured by sweet little birdies that the sanctity of our democratic process is the damn well most important thing we do also that regulations always help the little people isn t who can vote and who can t too important to leave to a free market also i remember a sweet little birdie telling me that the libertarian strawman position was to remove laws so that law breakers don t exist and declare victory somehow letting any person any time show up to a polling place and cast a vote with little or no checking and then declaring voter fraud to not exist seems strikingly similar but heck if all these laws make voting too hard why require people to register to vote in the first place i say you show up you cast a vote show up as much as you like if you care to vote that much you ve earned it i seriously doubt our national trajectory would be effected much at all really this is not that difficult there is no evidence of in person voter fraud being a problem warranting these solutions whatever i may believe you are required to be for as little government intrusion as necessary between people and their basic rights it s not some fluke that i m one of the few people here agreeing with the article this happens to be the obviously correct position based on the principles you re supposed to have tony there is no evidence of in person voter fraud being a problem warranting these solutions and absence of evidence is not evidence of absence tony you should get this already we don t regulate based on needs we regulate based on fears and by god shouldn t we have common sense regulations to make sure that our elections are just for the kids whatever i may believe you are required to be for as little government intrusion as necessary between people and their basic rights right because libertarians are supposed to have consistent principles whereas your only principle is believing that you can pull whatever inconsistent gibberish you wish to justify whatever you feel like so apparently we need as much government intrusion as our democratic system calls for except when it comes to regulating voting and abortion and gay marriage other than that though whatever comes out of democracy is all you need to know about what s good and proper for basic human rights especially health care but not guns and not speech but definitely voting everyone should be free to cast whatever votes they want however we should probably place very strict limitations on what those people can read hear and see right up to an election because we can t just have people voting with bad information now can we other than that though we need as free and open a democracy as we can get right you are entirely wrong the logic is that we see that massive numbers 10 s if not 100 s of thousands of people with the same name and dob are voting in multiple states we see thousands of people who are dead still voting we see many many districts all over the country where the number of registered voters exceeds the number of eligible voters we see strong evidence of massive voter fraud and voter id solves most all of it this is a strong case for voter id and voter id solves most all of it i just don t think that is entirely clear do we know that the illegitimate votes are being cast by people who walk in and misidentify themselves it seems more likely to me that most of the dead people voting type stuff is done by crooked poll workers getting their ad views worth out of even chapman articles but i do think the comment thread s longer this time a popular argument for the postal office is that some people choose to live in isolated areas without internet access so to cater to these individuals who either can t or won t adapt to modern times do we have to spend millions of dollars to run the po in an increasingly paperless world yes voting is a right but it s one reserved for citizens and the courts have generally recognized state s right to verify voter identity theoretically you can exist without photo ids proof of residency birth certificate passport but 99 of us want to be able to drive purchase alcohol apply for financial aid leave the country etc and many legal immigrants keep those documents close because they need them to apply for citizenship so the only question is is obtaining a photo id an undue burden not really and i actually have to spend money or visit government buildings doesn t count as one if you were born in 1863 and your confederate birth certificate is invalid or you just misplaced your document then some exceptions can be made but that s an argument for government efficiency not doing away with photo id very well put so 300 000 adults in wisconsin can t buy old milwaukee i think this is a travesty actually worth writing an editorial about instead we have a lame ass bit complaining that it s too hard for people to prove their identity so we should just leave the door wide open to election fraud god forbid anybody should ask the people that elect our rulers to do anything to prove they exist are eligible and are voting only once these are some really good points the government should not be able to force you to get a drivers license or any other photo id the government doesn t force you to get a drivers license if you want to drive you are required to get a drivers license to prove you are eligible to drive if you want to vote you should have an id to prove you are eligible to vote it s really simple voting is like breathing you get do do it because you are alive it is not like eating which you get to do because you have earned something to eat no you get to do it because you re a citizen not everyone alive can vote in u s elections tell that to illinois politicians voter id makes perfect sense for a democracy it s democratic government which doesn t make any sense the logic behind laws requiring voters to provide a government issued photo identification card is simple and seductive the logic is voting is participating in the coercive power of government and like any exercise of coercive power should be held to the agreed upon limits of that power in a verifiable way checks and balances you know like checking someone s id so they can t vote a 1000 times those activities in any event are not constitutionally guaranteed which voting is another part of that guarantee is equal representation so that you don t get to vote 1000 times if you want your hand on the gun of government i insist that you don t get any more fingers on that gun than i do and that this is verified is this the way reason is going now chapman will pick a topic to say something stupid about and reason will publish the same nonsense half a dozen times in rapid succession until he finds the next hobby horse to ride if the government didn t have amassed so much coercive power arguably unconstitutionally then who votes would matter a great deal less the mask slips here just come out and say it folks you think some types of people should vote less because they don t tend to vote how you think they should and voter id laws suppress their votes so that s why it s ok republicans of course have this figured out so surely you do too and aren t actually for this policy on principle that would be ridiculous no this is not what i think or what most people who support id laws think this is what democrats want you to think because they have been the traditional beneficiary of voter fraud most of the time the first mayor daley was notorious for voter fraud it is not an accident that vote early vote often has become a part of our collective lexicon also if democrats believed voter id laws would benefit them it would not just be the law of the land it would be a constitutional amendment their objection is just transparent hypocrisy i can t imagine that it would be difficult for the state s to issue voter id cards to the folks who for whatever reason don t have another type of id perhaps the author doesn t like his and her bathrooms either because some have ambiguous genitalia one can always find a few outlier cases to argue against any sensible requirements aimed at preventing fraud now don t get me wrong i m perfectly ok with folks living their lives off the grid but voter fraud by primarily the left is notorious see the wonderful article in the new yorker about lbj s election to the us senate to get the flavor of the whole subject sometimes you just need to go to a little bit of trouble in order to exercise your rights this editorial is frivolous here s the thing fellow libertarians the requirement for an id to vote stands the entire premise of our republic on its head that premise is this people are mostly pretty decent by and large individuals can be trusted to do the right thing our judicial system is absolutely based on that premise and our bill of rights codifies it further it is a logical game of chicken and egg to start issuing id s who is an acceptable arbiter of id s and where did they get that authority the answer of course is from the people who elected them or elected those who set up the regulations to have someone give out id s but did those people who voted have id s generally no like terrorists getting lucky some times we are stronger to accept the small damage done by the evil than to try to completely erradicate it idea is to prevent the poor who are more likely to vote democrat from voting giving the republicans a better chance of winning an election same basic principle that was used in the south to keep blacks from voting for much the same reasons discrimination based upon economic status instead of race and the idea of democrats is to protect the rights of illegal immigrants dead people and felons to vote voting among minorities has increased in states that passed id laws you must be on mars or something if you think the poor in this country doesn t have a driver s license i think all of this voter id stuff is a red herring it makes very little difference whether every single person votes or not just like it makes very little difference whether a bunch of illegals vote or not the real problem is that government has become so powerful and intrusive that people try to decide through voting things that should never be decided through voting in the first place do you really think anybody would care a great deal about who the president was if all he did was command the military at the direction of congress and worried about keeping interstate commerce free and open it doesn t matter who votes what matters is who counts the votes josef stalin sorry i just totally disagree voting is different than your examples in that it is supposed to be limited to citizens of the united states and limited to one vote per person obama of course is against both of these concepts and proved it by holding a job as a community organizer to perpetrate voting fraud and yes it can and does matter sorry not buying it rights come with responsibilities the right to vote means following the rules associated with voting everyone has to register in order to vote everyone has to either show up at their appointed polling place during voting hours or obtain an absentee ballot proving you are who you say you are is no different the wisconsin law may be more restrictive than it needs to be but the basic principle is still sound mr chapman you should review crawford vs marion county and understand how wrong you are the right to vote is not explicitly in the constitution states grant the franchise to vote the constitutional amendments that speak of voting only apply when the states have granted that franchise the state doesn t have to show how widespread voter fraud is the possibility of it happening is more than a compelling enough reason for the state to take measures to ensure the process is unpolluted a few points voting is not a natural right it is a privilege granted by the state if there was no state voting would be meaningless the us constitution does not limit the requirements to vote it just makes it equally available based on race sex age indeed it allows limiting the vote to those 18 and older if you do not have any way of determining an illegal vote and do not check for illegal votes you can t determine how much illegal voting is done hence the claim that there is almost no illegal voting is invalid if obtaining an id is made inexpensive or free and easy enough to get then there is no real excuse for not getting one voting is a fundamental privilege of citizenship if one doesn t have to show some proof of citizenship to vote then citizenship is meaningless a few points political choice is an illusion believing that your vote could make a difference is more than an illusion it is pure folly you go vote and nothing will change wars will continue debt will increase rights will continue to fade all of this about voting i d illegal voting it is a distraction from the real fact that you really have no say about how you are ruled there are small differences from one president to the next but for the most part by the time anyone becomes president they owe so many powerful people that they are tightly controlled presidents have no real power the real power is the people behind them with billions of dollars the president is mostly a front man personally i used to vote to make a difference but i no longer agree to have anything to do with this criminal illegal government other than what i have to to keep the slavemaster off my back the next time i get involved will be when people finally quit talking about voting and decide it really is time for real change at some point our founders figured out that talking was not going to solve the problem when are we going to do the same if you were born here it is easy enough to get id if you are here legally form another country then you already have the paperwork to prove your identity and it is easy to get id only if you are here illegally is it difficult to get id or if you want to vote multiple times under different id s then it is very difficult to get legal id anti deportation nuts know this but they don t care about the law that is possibly the dumbest argument i ve heard 300 000 people statewide is 5 of the state population and is negligible i don t care if they don t drive and don t fly and there is always some sob story about this poor poor pitiful person has a problem getting an id if you want to vote get an id there is only one reason to not support this and that is that you have no interest in fair elections without a valid accounting of the voting citizenry elections are and have been for some time fraudulent 300 000 eligible voters don t have the documents needed for voting and how many of those 300 000 are like the corner cases that were mentioned in this article 1 maybe so 3 000 people out of million can t vote for some off the reservation reason so that we can insure the integrity of our voting system i m good with that who wouldn t be just because a few losers can t figure out a way to get a driver s license or other state issued id doesn t mean it is widespread problem or that the law is flawed the vast majority of people have no trouble getting an id is it really too much to ask you to prove you are who you say you are when voting no it s not the people against these laws are more interested in perpetrating voter fraud to elect democrats than they are in the integrity of the vote it s ludicrous that some people expect those who would choose the candidates and measures that govern the citizenry to bear a responsibility to prove they are who they say they are i think we can all agree that voting should continue to operate on the honor system right no one is politically motivated enough to use deceptive tactics to win elections i m sure no one has ever tried to vote twice they ve already had their say why would they surely no felon or non citizen would ever attempt to vote because they re ineligible and they know that so why would they no vote harvester would register phony identities to vote and then have paid volunteers present that voter registration card or info at the polling place and vote as that fictitious person why go to that kind of trouble and we all know dead people don t vote duh and since no one would ever attempt these things why put ridiculous measures in place to ensure against them it s as absurd as locking your doors at night nobody wants your stuff and nobody s trying to steal votes either dude it s all a bunch of right wing fear mongering and as this article proves no one should be subjected to the outrageously oppressive requirement to prove they are who they say they are least of all for something as silly as controlling the political process we are on the honor system people and if we don t have honor then what do we have actually there s no reliable measure of the extent of vote fraud chicago is famous for the number of dead people who turn out to vote but there s no assurance that this doesn t occur with regularity if id is not required one group the 20 million criminal aliens in america illegally could tilt many elections i don t see other countries inviting criminals from other countries to come vote in their elections why should americans risk criminals affecting our elections by the same token those living in the no id world should not be denied a vote that is their right to have a cost free means of self identification should be developed this may necessitate setting an earlier voting deadline for those with no id so that their right to vote can be verified before the votes are counted but that should prove no barrier to those who really want to vote and thereafter id may be issued so in subsequent elections there are no delays reason s push to accommodate the criminal invaders who have illegally crossed our borders taken up residence overloaded our social welfare programs burdened our school driven dozens of hospitals out of business and brought disease and crime to america is well known this article appears to be a part of reason s campaign to turn america over to the criminal aliens fuck off back to the tribune chapman those activities in any event are not constitutionally guaranteed which voting is there is no constitutional right to vote perhaps you should read the damn thing if a person forbidden to vote manages to cast a ballot by pretending to be someone else by contrast the election result will almost never be affected almost never so you re willing to accept a few fraudulent elections as long as these few losers aren t disenfranchised besides the sort of fraud that an id would prevent is exceedingly rare citation the court in wisconsin found the requirement would block vastly more legal voters than fraudulent ones bullshit the community organizers who pick these idiots up and drive them to the polls can simply make an extra trip to get them down to the dmv for a free state id they only have to do it once not every election i don t want to hear this bullshit about birth certificates a copy can be had for 30 if you can t scrape that much money together voter disenfranchisement isn t your biggest problem weak steve so everyone can get a one time only pass on the id after which she ll have a full year to get an id surely that will satisfy all the hand wringing liberals so concerned about voter suppression right no because then come the next year we still won t be able to identify the folks who got the pass on having an id at the previous election solution if you want to vote get some type of id from your local elections office surely these folks all file for and receive some type of welfare right do they use an id for that or is it just given to them because they say hey i need some food stamps please log in to post comments john stossel 5 27
