transforming an issue that once splintered the party into a benchmark for the 2020 election even though the bill has little chance of passing the republican led senate or being signed into law by president donald trump the outcome pushes the phased in rate to the forefront as the new standard one already in place at some leading u s corporations while the increase would boost pay for some 30 million low wage workers intended as one answer to income inequality passage was assured only after centrist democrats won adjustments to the bill reluctant to embrace the party s left flank they pushed for changes including a slower six year phase in of the wage it s a reminder of moderates influence on policy but also the limits top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message
