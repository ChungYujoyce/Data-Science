speculation mounted that the president would turn to mr esper to take over at the pentagon at least temporarily mr trump has not nominated mr esper to serve as defense secretary in a permanent capacity when asked tuesday afternoon whether he intends to make the nomination the president told reporters most likely that s what i m thinking about doing lawmakers on both sides of the aisle offered praise for the army secretary who is also a former senior raytheon executive although some were circumspect about another looming nomination process senate majority leader mitch mcconnell kentucky republican said he supports mr esper and sen james m inhofe oklahoma republican and chairman of the senate armed services committee said mr esper should be formally nominated sen jack reed of rhode island the top democrat on the armed services committee said the situation leaves us in a position where this president has to send up a nomination and that has to be done very quickly mr esper dodged the question last week when asked by the washington times whether he believed mr trump was considering him over mr shanahan i have no comment on any of that he said after a speech to defense industry leaders in arlington virginia i m very privileged and pleased to be the army secretary an army veteran who served in the gulf war mr esper brings a wealth of experience to the job the 55 year

details and potential fallout of mr shanahan s nomination withdrawal mr shanahan sought to downplay any hype about his decision the confirmation process should focus on securing our nation against threats readiness and the future of our military and ensuring the highest quality care and support for service members and their families he said in a statement after having been confirmed for deputy secretary less than two years ago it is unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up and painted in an incomplete and therefore misleading way in the course of this process i believe my continuing in the confirmation process would force my three children to relive a traumatic chapter in our family s life and reopen wounds we have worked years to heal he said ultimately their safety and well being is my highest priority i would welcome the opportunity to be secretary of defense but not at the expense of being a good father in one reported

with mr shanahan some critics quickly took aim at mr esper over his ties to the defense industry i m not thrilled that the next acting defense secretary is a former raytheon executive said mandy smithberger director of the center for defense information at the project on government oversight as tensions increase over iran we need a permanent secretary of defense who has the credibility
