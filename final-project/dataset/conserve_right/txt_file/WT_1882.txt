philadelphia has one of the most notorious public pension gravy trains in a program called the deferred retirement option plan it s a retirement double dip that allows city employees to collect their full salaries and their pensions simultaneously during their final four years on the job during a voter revolt in 2011 against city council members enrolled in the pension program council member

they ve made in the past mr mcconnell said on fox news we re not going to let them take advantage of this pandemic to solve a lot of problems that they created for themselves with bad decisions in the past given the roughly 2 8 trillion that congress has spent on coronavirus relief for workers and employers mr mcconnell said lawmakers must decide whether there needs to be another tranche of emergency aid he said congress needs to clearly weigh the impact of the amount of money lawmakers have already added to the national debt some republicans such as sen bill cassidy of louisiana agree with democrats that states need a bailout if the economy is to recover anytime soon clearly we re worried about the debt mr cassidy said wednesday on cnbc on the other hand if we go into a depression we re going to really have debt if we don t have police departments and emts and fire departments and garbage pickup none of that will matter this is about helping cities which have totally lost their tax base because of covid 19 to recover to provide those essential services mr cassidy said he is advocating a plan that would award each state a base amount of aid plus extra determined by a formula that takes into account a state s population its tax revenue loss and the level of harm to its economy from the pandemic we will not grow if our cities cannot provide police garbage and fire services for small businesses which are the keystone of our economy he said and so this is another piece of what we do to restore our economy the president who is coming under fire from some black leaders over
