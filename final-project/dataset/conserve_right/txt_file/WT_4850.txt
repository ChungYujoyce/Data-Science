which witnesses to call for the public impeachment hearings in the coming week on saturday republicans released a list of people they want to hear from among them biden s son hunter one of his former associates at a ukrainian energy company and the anonymous whistleblower but republicans need the committee s approval to summon their witnesses and democrats are in the majority the committee chairman california rep adam schiff quickly cast doubt on whether republicans will get their way without getting into specifics schiff said he won t let the hearings serve as a vehicle to conduct sham investigations into the bidens or the 2016 election nor will he let the hearings aid trump s effort to threaten intimate and retaliate against the whistleblower altogether republicans want to hear public testimony from eight people they identified some of whom have already testified privately they also want to hear from anonymous officials who helped the whistleblower prepare his or her complaint the top republican on the committee california rep devin nunes said democrats are conducting a one sided inquiry and it s important to hear from certain people familiar with ukrainian
