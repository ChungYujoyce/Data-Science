tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion some memories especially painful ones have the power to bring the past back to life with the clarity of a pointed dagger that s why house democrats dusted off the figure of john dean the watergate whistle blower and set him before the american public in their relentless campaign to destroy donald trump and his presidency they reckoned that mr dean would demonstrate a link between the donald and tricky dick in the event it was a bridge to nowhere the novelist thomas wolfe said it best you can t go home again nancy pelosi s democrats who control the partisan machinery of the u s house of representatives claim a responsibility to hold the president accountable for every misdeed in office but their strategy of resist rage and rout was set the moment the 2016 presidential election was called at the invitation of jerrold nadler chairman of the house judiciary committee mr dean who was richard nixon s lawyer appeared before the committee on monday as part of the campaign to do what robert mueller couldn t the historical context that mr dean was called in to provide like a medical specialist flying in to attend a hopeless case was meant to amplify the ways that the subject of the mueller report is an echo of watergate most prominent according to his testimony is the parallel between richard nixon s order that the fbi halt its investigation into the break in at the democratic national committee at the watergate hotel and mr trump s request to fbi director james comey to go easy on lt gen michael flynn who had just resigned from his post as national security adviser the fbi said he had lied about his telephone conversations with the russian ambassador to the united states top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches mr dean testified that in his opinion the subsequent firing of mr comey for refusing to lift the cloud over the trump presidency by saying that mr trump himself was not under investigation mirrors the obstruction of justice mr nixon committed the comey firing echoes nixon s firing of special prosecutor archibald cox in the infamous saturday night massacre in october 1973 the crucial difference which mr dean left out of his analysis is that robert mueller found that neither president trump nor anyone in his campaign colluded with russians so there was no crime to cover up therefore there was no obstruction of justice no harm no foul john malcolm a constitutional scholar at the heritage foundation filled in the missing context for the house committee clarifying the reason why mr mueller s investigators did not say the president committed a crime certainly any prosecutor considering charging someone with obstruction of justice would give considerable weight to the fact that the person did not in fact commit the underlying offense that was being investigated as happened here mr trump scoffed at dean redux can t believe they are bringing in john dean the disgraced nixon white house counsel who is a paid cnn contributor mr trump tweeted no collusion no obstruction democrats just want a do over which they ll never get exclamation points his there is one striking parallel between watergate and the russian collusion controversy which mr dean did not address spying on a rival political campaign in the case of watergate five burglars were caught breaking into the offices of the democratic national committee in the russia collusion probe officials of the obama justice department had initiated crossfire hurricane a secret investigation into suspected russian collusion that led to spying on the trump campaign attorney general william barr has opened an investigation into whether that domestic spying operation was warranted careful not to prejudge anything that culminated in the mueller inquiry mr barr has turned everything over to john durham a u s attorney in connecticut democrats counted on the mueller report to provide the evidence of crimes needed to send mr trump to a place where the sun rarely shines when it didn t all that was left to do was to grasp flimsy parallels to the past they reckon that by keeping the spotlight on the mueller report they can divert attention from the architects of obama era espionage and their text messages vowing to thwart his election if there are lessons to be gleaned from john dean s reflections on the mueller report it s that any comparison between richard nixon and donald trump is a contrivance now the investigators themselves face investigation turnabout is r
