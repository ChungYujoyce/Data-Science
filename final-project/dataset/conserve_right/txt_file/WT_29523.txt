tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion once upon a time america was a recognized leader among the governments of the world for a colorblind system of justice that included due process a presumption of innocence until proven guilty and a basic common law common sense right to face one s accuser in a court of law we re losing those cherished rights post 2016 presidential election america s devolved into such a hyperpartisan atmosphere that core constitutional concepts are being pushed to the side for cheap political wins top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick n y gov andrew cuomo s careless cruelty shows in coronavirus nursing home policy gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid it s getting to the point it won t much matter who wins in 2020 democrats or republicans because in the end the american people will emerge the losers heck we re already losing look at this tweet from president donald trump about the whistleblower report on his ukraine call like every america i deserve to meet my accuser especially when this accuser the so called whistleblower represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way then rep adam schiff made up what i actually said by lying to congress shortly after trump again tweeted this in addition i want to meet not only my accuser who presented second third hand information but also the person who illegally gave this information which was largely incorrect to the whistleblower was this person spying on the u s p resident big consequences and what s wrong with that yet cnn drummed up the hysteria and painted trump s call as threatening trump one cnn report read escalated his attacks on the whistleblower demanding to meet his accuser face to face during a day of rage filled tweets about the democratic attempt to impeach him nbc followed suit whistleblower s lawyer says trump is endangering his client by calling for the person who gave the whistleblower the information to be publicly identified the news outlet wrote and from the guardian this trump lashes out at whistleblower and renews attack on house intelligence chair the point is this so freaking what yes whistleblowers have their protected rights to whistle blow but there are limits to what accusers can accuse based on hearsay while keeping their identities in the dark americans deserve truth in justice not question marks about motives trump s call for his accuser to come forward isn t just human nature really it s what anybody in his position would do but it s also based on u s law it s also based on long held and admirable notions of u s justice that give the accused the right to know who s doing the accusing so ultimately the why s of the accusations can be discerned so ultimately the innocence or guilt of the accused as well as the motivations of the accuser might be exposed the fact that some actually find controversy in trump s demand to know the identity of his accuser just shows how far this nation s straying from its most basic of constitutional protections and also sadly despicably how willing some are to trade short term political wins for the long term sustainability of america if we can t manage to navigate today s hot political climates without decimating crucial freedoms in the process without killing the basic concepts of u s justice america will soon enough reach a time when the political parties of officeholders won t matter at all the presumption of innocence is deeply rooted in our nation s history and tradition such that it is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty attorneys with the institute for justice wrote in filings before the u s supreme court shannon nelson and louis alonzo madden v colorado precisely without rule of law without regard for rule of law america will crumble cheryl chumley can be reached at emailprotected or on twitter
