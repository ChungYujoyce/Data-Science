mccain was a dear friend of mine sen joni ernst of iowa a member of the republican leadership and a veteran said at a town hall meeting thursday according to video posted by the des moines register no i don t agree with president trump and he does need to stop that added rep dan crenshaw of texas a former navy seal mr president seriously stop talking about senator mccain trump has stuck to his suggestion that mccain a prisoner of war in vietnam was not a hero because he was captured and the president can t seem to forget mccain s decisive thumbs down that sank the gop effort to repeal president barack obama s health care law he was horrible what he did with repeal and replace what he did to the republican party and to the nation and to sick people that could have had great health care was not good trump said in thursday s interview blaming the media for asking about mccain in fact trump himself tweeted about the late arizona senator apparently without provocation over the weekend a few republicans such as sen mitt romney of utah objected then trump on wednesday fired back at an official event in lima ohio i gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted which as president i had to approve i don t care about this i didn t get thank you he told his supporters that s okay we sent him on the way but i wasn t a fan of john mccain there wasn t much reaction from the crowd to trump s references to mccain s funeral the president wrapped up the remarks after five minutes with an acknowledgement that his opinion of the late senator isn t shared by all republicans some people like him and i think that s great sen rob portman r ohio who attended the trump event told the columbus dispatch afterward john mccain was a war hero in fact mccain s family made clear that trump was not welcome during the weeklong cross country ceremonies that the senator had planned himself instead mccain invited former presidents george w bush who defeated mccain during the 2000 gop nomination fight and barack obama who defeated him in 2008 to deliver eulogies on the value of pursuing goals greater than oneself trump signed off on the military transport of mccain s body went golfing and was uncharacteristically quiet on twitter during the washington events trump s publicly nursed grudge against mccain has not appeared to alienate core supporters some of whom had soured on the senator by the time of his death aware of this gop lawmakers until now have stayed subdued or silent though trump sometimes infuriated them with his comments on their late colleague mccain s family and other allies have ripped trump for keeping up the commentary we only said goodbye to him almost 7 months ago mccain s daughter bridget tweeted to trump on thursday even if you were invited to my dad s funeral you would have only wanted to be there for the credit and not for any condolences unfortunately you could not be counted on to be courteous as you are a child in the most important role the world knows trump has said for years that he doesn t think mccain is a hero because the senator was captured in vietnam mccain was tortured and held prisoner for more than five years the president has never served in the military and obtained a series of deferments to avoid going to vietnam including one attained with a physician s letter stating that he suffered from bone spurs in his feet after the health care vote in 2017 trump was furious and it showed in the days after mccain s aug 25 death the administration lowered the american flag over the white house to half staff when mccain died on a saturday but then raised it by monday after public outcry the white house flags were again lowered trump s relentless new targeting of the deceased senator seemed to cross a boundary for several republicans mcconnell called mccain a rare patriot and genuine american hero in the senate mcconnell tweeted his memory continues to remind me every day that our nation is sustained by the sacrifices of heroes the kentucky republican who is up for re election next year never mentioned trump but others weren t so shy sen johnny isakson of georgia called trump s remarks deplorable it will be
