to seeking reunification with the island which they consider a renegade province see also beijing faces decision on how to respond to donald trump s tweets the call was the starkest example yet of how trump has flouted diplomatic conventions since he won the nov 8 election he has apparently undertaken calls with foreign leaders without guidance customarily given by the state department which oversees u s diplomacy president elect trump is just shooting from the hip trying to take phone calls of congratulatory messages from leaders around the world without consideration for the implications said bonnie glaser senior adviser for asia at the center for strategic and international studies in washington vice president elect mike pence said sunday that the phone call shouldn t necessarily be interpreted as a shift in u s policy he shrugged off the attention to the incident as media hype it was a courtesy call pence told nbc s meet the press over the decades the status of taiwan has been one of the most sensitive issues in u s china relations china regards taiwan as part of its territory to be retaken by force if necessary if it seeks independence it would regard any recognition of a taiwanese leader as a head of state as unacceptable taiwan split from the chinese mainland in 1949 the u s policy acknowledges the chinese view over sovereignty but considers taiwan s status as unsettled ned price a spokesman for the white house national security council said trump s conversation does not signal any change to long standing u s policy on cross strait issues yet the
