the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion with the exception of george h w bush every president in the last four decades has had a military debacle donald trump is on the verge of one he can still avoid it but time is running out jimmy carter had desert one ronald reagan had the beirut bombing bill clinton had blackhawk down bush ii had the aftermath of the regime takedown in iraq and barack obama had the isis emergence in the wake of his ill advised iraqi withdrawal in each case the disaster occurred in the first term of the chief executives involved all five seemed to have learned something from disaster although mr carter didn t get a second term say what you will about the first bush but he knew how to throw a war as witnessed by panama and desert storm up until early october donald trump appeared to have avoided military disaster during his first term but the withdrawal of u s troops from the turkish syrian border was followed almost immediately by an attack by our nato ally turkey on our anti isis ally the kurdish peoples protection units ypg this raises the specter of both a humanitarian crisis and the escape of thousands of isis fighters and their supporters from prisons and camps mr trump made a mistake his domestic enemies know it but more importantly some of his closest allies know it the question now is how to recover while there is still time top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots when you unilaterally withdraw from a conflict three things can happen two of them are bad in the best case the turks will stop at the buffer zone that they have said they want to create south of the turkey syria border in that case the incident will likely be quickly forgotten but even if that happens mr trump will get no political credit at home or abroad the first really bad thing that can happen would be a protracted turk kurd guerrilla war followed by an escape if the isis remnants and a resurgence of isis activity in syria for which the president would get most of the blame the worst case would be for the syrian assad regime and their iranian russian allies to move into the power vacuum and massacre all of the anti regime rebel forces while regaining control of all of syria again mr trump would get the blame and the russians and iranians would become dominant in the region put simply mr trump is facing a lose lose situation no matter which scenario plays out sometimes the best action is to do nothing and that is precisely what mr trump should have done in syria there was no hue and cry to withdraw troops and the situation was as stable as anything can be in the middle east u s casualties were negligible and the u s political debate was focused on domestic matters mr trump s desire to get out of foreign conflicts was the least of the issues his base cared about given the present impeachment imbroglio when president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey asked him to withdraw the president should have said no and gone on to more important things now he is in a serious but fixable pickle extreme flexibility in needed the situation is not yet irreversible but the president must act quickly if he wants to avert disaster he should insist on a turk kurd cease fire followed by u s brokered talks aimed at a solution that would secure the turkish border while allowing the kurds to continue to control isis prisoners and detained civilians there are areas of compromise that can be reached diplomatically that can put a brake on the situation before the current crisis the american presence was a combination of peacekeeping between the kurds and turks and a low level counterinsurgency presence to prevent a re emergence of isis it wasn t perfect but it was working the syrian government was a russian iranian rump state despised by the region s dominant arabs isis was reduced to a low level but controllable insurgency and the fragile anti isis coalition which the turks were a negligible part was holding by putting american diplomatic pressure backed up by military pressure back to work mr trump has the potential to begin to work toward a viable solution that would keep two of its most valuable regional allies away from each other s throats this is as much an opportunity as a problem if handled properly the president s strategic approach is based on having allies do more that approach is totally undermined if the allies are killing each other instead of our mutual enemies gary anderson lectures in alternative analysis at the george washington university s elliott school of internationa
