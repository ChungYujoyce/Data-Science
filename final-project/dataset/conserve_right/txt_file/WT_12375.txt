government is worried that a similar wave of anti china sentiment will take hold in the united states according to china watchers in and out of government what beijing fears most is that special counsel robert mueller the former fbi director will add white house dealings with china to his investigation of russian election meddling one main effort of the chinese government is trying to tamp

view anbang issued a statement june 13 tersely saying mr wu is temporarily unable to fulfill his role for personal reasons american china specialists say the action against mr wu appears aimed at avoiding a political backlash against the perceived chinese influence operation directed at the trump white house unlike russia s election operation that involved hacking and the dissemination of stolen emails chinese influence operations in recent years are aimed at american policymakers through the use of former officials like former secretary of state henry kissinger and former senior military officers like retired adm bill owens a former vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mr trump met with mr kissinger who is said to be close to mr kushner in the white house on may 12
