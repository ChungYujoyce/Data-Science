ertainty over u s trade talks with china casting a shadow over what has been a bright spot for the trump administration insight from president trump s top white house economic adviser larry kudlow this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday december 9 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace the white house chief of staff is out prosecutors tie president trump closer to russian interference and other crimes and doubts about that u s china trade deal rattle wall street begin videotape peter navarro white house trade adviser everybody in washington now agrees that china is a bad actor doing bad things wallace we aposll discuss trade talks the arrest of the top chinese executive and what it means for the u s economy with one of the president aposs top advisors larry kudlow then a week of dramatic revelations in robert mueller aposs russia investigation what to the court filings show and what does it mean for the president president donald trump i think it aposs all turning around very nicely there aposs absolutely no collusion which is very important wallace senator angus king a key member of the senate intelligence committee joins us plus sen charles schumer d n y senate minority leader we do not want to let a trump temper tantrum govern our policies or cause the shutdown of the government sen john kennedy r la i don apost think the president is bluffing wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel if a government shutdown over president trump aposs border wall is now unavoidable and our power player of the week unidentified male the pilot said we have to go tom you stay here you die you join jesse wallace one american hero aposs act of devotion he aposll never forget unidentified male tom shouted at the cockpit he said jesse we aposll be back for you somehow someday wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the trump administration is getting a makeover on his way to the army navy game yesterday the president announced chief of staff john kelly will leave by the end of the year meanwhile uncertainty over the u s china trade deal is casting a shadow over an economy that has been a bright spot for the administration joining us now president trump aposs top white house adviser larry kudlow larry welcome back to fox news sunday larry kudlow white house chief economic adviser thank you chris i appreciate it wallace in july just a couple of months ago president trump said that white house chief of staff john kelly would remain on the drive through 2020 now he says that kelly is out as one of the top few white house staffers what happened kudlow well look it aposs been a long two years for the chief general kelly you know he ran homeland security has been running the white house staff i think by the way he aposs been a very good chief very orderly processes in the white house as you know it aposs not an easy thing to do general kelly is a remarkable patriot he has given such phenomenal service to this country perhaps it is time for a rest president trump at our senior staff christmas dinner friday night had some wonderful complimentary things to say about the chief i heartily concur so i suppose it aposs time to move on wallace well let me ask you two more quick questions one did kelly resign or was he forced out kudlow i don apost know to be perfectly honest i think it was very amicable all right that aposs what i understand you know again the president saying good things about the chief i aposve been in so many meetings i mean just so many meetings in my tenure a little less than a year now i think a lot of the gossip is just wrong i think they did get along everybody is going to have disagreements that aposs the way life works but was he fired i don apost think he was fired i wasn apost privy to that final conversation but the president had great things to say about him wallace what do you think about nick ayers kudlow i think quite a lot of nick ayers actually i aposve known him for a while if the president i guess will let us know tomorrow or sometime early in the week who the next chief is going to be in terms of nick ayers mike pence aposs chief of staff i think the world of him wallace all right let aposs turn to your day job the stock markets had a terrible week since president trump and president xi had dinner in argentina on saturday night the dow lost 1 100 points or 4 5 percent the s p 500 is now in the red for 2018 question how much of this is because of confusion over just what the u s and china have agreed to kudlow well i don apost know i mean i will grant you that trade issues china trade issues haven apost been all buttoned down yet but look chris the first couple days after that dinner i was down there g20 argentina the markets did very well both in china and the u s as a matter of fact since then there have been some issues the huawei issue that aposs a technology company that was violating iranian sanctions and canada has taken them in and they will probably be extradited to the u s there have been some different statements here and there look i can just tell you right now we are on track china has finally i mean wednesday and thursday china aposs commerce department issued some very positive promising statements sometimes i think these things get lost maybe the beautiful funeral of former president bush but they said look they agree with the timetable they agree with the deadlines they expect to be moving immediately to take actions on key commodities for example by lowering tariffs and opening up export sales for us things like energy agriculture industry something like 35 chinese agencies and the supreme court are now working on new legislation to deal with the ip theft issues and other technologies wallace larry the reason kudlow so when you piece it together chris there aposs a lot of good things out there and i think that sometimes it gets lost in the shuffle wallace well here aposs part of the reason why it got lost and why it took to wednesday or thursday for people to find out about it because there are big differences between how the president and the white house is describing what was agreed to and with the chinese are saying was agreed to and let me put a couple of them up u s says china agreed to quote very substantial purchases of agricultural and other products the chinese say nothing specific about how make those purchases will be president trump says the chinese will remove their 40 percent tariff on u s auto imports the chinese are ducking that one and then there aposs the difference between what you and white house trade advisor peter navarro had to say on friday about that 90 day deadline for a suspension of tariff increases take a look begin video clip kudlow the president has indicated there is good solid movement and some good action he might he might be willing to extend the 90 days we aposll have to see on that unidentified male if they aposre not resolved in 90 days is this administration willing to walk away peter navarro white house trade adviser it aposs not a question of walking away it aposs a question of moving forward on the strategy end video clip wallace that led that contradiction between you and peter navarro led to a 500 point drop in the dow on sunday forget the chinese the white house can apost seem to get its own story straight kudlow well i don apost with all respect i don apost think there aposs much daylight between peter and i we are focused right now on this first 90 day increment regarding what may happen in the future and presidential considerations that will be up to potus of course working with president xi i really think that aposs an exaggerated point but chris look i understand people are looking for these issues let me just read very quickly here was the chinese congress department announcement i think it was wednesday or thursday china will immediately implement specific issues that have been agreed upon by agriculture products energy and automobiles automobile tariffs announcement is going to come from a state council tariffs commission as i said earlier it was also announced that a number of chinese government agencies and the supreme court are looking at new laws to prevent intellectual property theft these are very strong indications president trump himself i mean i remember he called me early thursday morning to say did you see that announcement did you see that announcement and i did and i think it aposs very positive really we are making more progress now on more specific issues than ever before now let me just add quickly trust but verify that aposs very important ambassador lighthizer will be looking very carefully at the course of his negotiations he will evaluate he will make sure there are enforcement mechanisms and timetable mechanisms that aposs terribly important wallace right kudlow nothing in this game is done until it is absolutely verified to our satisfaction so that aposs a caveat wallace ok but let me kudlow i don apost want to lose that however having said that the chinese owned statements are really very positive wallace ok well except for instance the president tweeted 40 percent tariff on auto imports is lifted the chinese have not committed to that and there was a big bump in the road on saturday night president xi and president trump are sitting there having dinner together you aposre at the table with them and suddenly there aposs the arrest last saturday of meng wanzhou the chief financial officer of telecom giant huawei as you say for allegedly violating u s sanctions on trade with china a couple of quick questions one did president trump know about that arrest when he sat down to dinner with president xi and if not what was his reaction afterwards kudlow he did not know he did not know and he had no reaction afterwards wallace well the reports have been that he was livid and frankly just as an outsider if one of the top businessmen in the other parts of the country was being arrested while i aposm making nice at dinner i aposd be livid kudlow he didn apost know ok i will just state that unequivocally he learned way later by the way way later look regarding the huawei prosecution let me just say that aposs a law enforcement action that aposs primarily department of justice it is a very important issue because the evidence suggests at least so far the alleging suggests that huawei did break the iranian sanction through different financial channels we will see how that plays out that aposs an enforcement channel chris enforcement lane we aposre talking about wallace i just want to ask you one question about it plays out if i may larry kudlow yes wallace republican senator marco rubio said this week after the arrest that huawei a telecom giant is a bad actor here is rubio begin video clip sen marco rubio r fla senate foreign relations committee knowing the history of huawei and how it served as an instrument of chinese espionage and influence it aposs concerning but you know if we have a case to be made the right thing to do is to charge her and the right thing is for canada to extradite her end video clip wallace but now china is warning the u s and canada where she aposs being held that there will be consequences if she continues to be held and one of the top papers in china the global times says that her arrest amounts to a declaration of war can you guarantee me that as part of this negotiation the president the administration will not let her go kudlow i can apost guarantee anything as i say this is a doj nsc law enforcement issue i don apost know how it aposs going to turn out i aposm not an attorney it aposs outside my lane so we will see look the u s has laws about these things the u s has a number of laws on the books now that protect a number of points i mean not only violations of sanctions be it iran or other countries we have laws about anything that was stolen we are discussing loss people can apost do business in the u s or sell us goods services intellectual property that we think was stolen so that aposs just being tough and protecting the family jewels in my judgment and that aposs protecting the integrity of u s national security policy very very important how this affects trade chris i can apost sit here and be absolutely definitive all i will say is it seems to me there aposs a trade lane that we are discussing where you and i both agree the early returns from china are very positive and it looks like we will get new actions and there is the law enforcement lane they are different they are different and i think president trump and president xi and lower officials will generate or continue to keep that difference i might be wrong i can apost predict the future on this thing but there are different channels and i think they will be viewed that way for quite some time wallace larry thank you thanks for your time and we aposll watch how the markets do this week kudlow thank you chris appreciate it wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the departure of white house chief of staff john kelly and other shake ups in the administration commercial break begin video clip trump john kelly will be leaving at the end of the year we aposll be announcing who will be taking john aposs place it might be on an interim basis i aposll be announcing that over the next day or two end vidoe clip wallace president trump announcing on his way to the army navy game he is letting general john kelly as white house chief of staff go amid a number of staff changes and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz charles lane from the washington post former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and the co host of benson and harf on fox news radio guy benson well congressman chaffetz president trump announced yesterday that john kelly is out his likely replacement and i discussed with larry kudlow this fellow nick ayers very sharp political operative now the vice president aposs chief of staff question what happened to kelly and if in fact ayers is taking over from kelly what does that tell us about where the trump term presidency is headed over the next two years jason chaffetz r utah former congressman well this country owes a lot to the kelly family the sacrifice he has made but also his son and the loss of his son but he served two years with the trump administration the homeland security and the chief of staff by all accounts it aposs a tumultuous time in the white house but we have a lot to thank there i think nick ayers has proven himself with the vice president very different approach i think than general kelly wallace in what way chaffetz well he seems to be a very disciplined person he did cut his teeth early on on some of the campaign issues and as we transition to 2020 i think it aposs important to know that also think perhaps one of the names mick mulvaney is also in the mix it seems like ayers is going to get but mulvaney the president i think signaled that there might be an interim person in the place and i think wallace but when you say he aposs political is part of it that we are headed up towards 2020 we are going to have a democratic congress you need a markup politically savvy person in that job chaffetz yes i think you aposre going to have to deal with a democrat controlled house of representatives and you couple that with the 2020 election right on our heels i think you need somebody who can bridge that gap and with the president aposs attention is going to be drawn towards wallace chuck given how president trump runs his shop can anyone succeed as white house chief of staff and nick ayers who as i say is a very sharp political operative he was the executive director of the republican governors association when they scored a lot of games there he has his own critics charles lane the washington post yes he does he aposs thought to have maybe as part of being political he aposs thought to have very sharp elbows he aposs a young man in a hurry is only in his mid 30s and that always draws a little resentment from the more experienced types there are people in the mixer are jared kushner and the president aposs daughter ivanka wallace when you say they aposre in the mix they aposre not going to be chief of staff lane no but they are known to involve themselves sometimes in the affairs of the white house and may have something to do with general kelly aposs departure too they have struggled all along for stability in their and at a certain point you say to yourself well is it the staff or is it the president and the president thrives it seems on conflict and instability that seems to be what makes him comfortable he likes as i think he said himself he likes it when people are in conflict around him and then he can deal with that so you know a best case scenario for this white house is that they find somebody who can hold on for the next two years until the election but that would be different from the previous two years wallace well speaking of conflict and unfinished staff business nine months after secretary of state rex tillerson was dismissed incidentally by tweet he finally got around to talking about what it was like to work for president trump here aposs just a taste of that begin video clip rex tillerson former secretary of state doesn apost like to read doesn apost read briefing reports doesn apost like to get into the details of a lot of things but rather just kind of says this is what i believe when the president would say here aposs what i want to do and here aposs how i want to do it and i would have to say to them mr president i understand what you want to do but you can apost do it that way it violates the law it violates a treaty end video clip wallace well not surprisingly the president fired back tweet rex tillerson didn apost have the mental capacity needed he was dumb as a rock and i couldn apost get rid of them fast enough he was lazy as hell congresswoman harman i guess that will be sending christmas cards to each other this year jane harman former congresswoman well i have no idea why rex tillerson did that interview but let me just say wallace we love that he did that interview harman well fine wallace we like people airing their dirty laundry harman congratulations on fair and balanced anchoring on the show big deal really big deal wallace thank you thank you i thought i was going to get through without that but go ahead harman well you didn apost but now back to this i mean i came of age when john kennedy said ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country we just buried a president where duty honor and country where the theme of his service over his entire lifetime and i think rex tillerson came to washington out of a feeling of duty honor and country and i think he was an excellent head at exxon and i what went on wallace he was not a very good secretary of state harman yes right he had no experience at the state department and certainly was a misfit with president trump but i think the latest tweet is a sad shows a sad lack of stability and respect for honorable people who come to serve wallace how about and what tillerson i mean tillerson punched harman well that aposs what i said i think it aposs unfortunate wallace so they both harman well yes i think the whole thing was unfortunate just a comment on john kelly absolutely gave his son or his son gave his own life in afghanistan to protect our country and we should really honor his service and i surely hope we are not going to see tweets like the tillerson tweet after john kelly leaves his service for his whole lifetime his military service was so honorable wallace guy let aposs go back to my discussion with larry kudlow in the last section how what do you make of the differences that we are seeing and how the u s the president the white house is describing what was agreed to or even what aposs on the table in the discussions between the u s and china on trade and with the chinese are saying about it are the markets right to be concerned about those differences and how big a monkey wrench did the arrest of this really top i don apost think you can overstate how important this chinese businesswoman is what kind of a monkey wrench that throw into all of this guy benson co host benson harf well i think first on the arrest it aposs one of the rare instances in d c where there was virtual unanimity that there were bad actors and something like this was due and important given their sanctions violations their espionage their ip theft i think there was bipartisan applause maybe the timing was unfortunate given the broader context of the back and forth in these negotiations but to your first question i aposm a big fan of larry kudlow always have been but i was not terribly convinced by his responses to your questions where you put up the full screen graphics here aposs what we are saying here aposs what the chinese are saying where do we go from here and i think there was sort of a lot of let aposs wait and see in the markets are waiting and seeing and that aposs why we aposre seeing i think and witnessing the downturn in the jitters wallace congressman chaffetz i aposve got about a minute left we aposve seen this movie before where there aposs talk about an agreement they begin months of negotiations and nothing much concrete comes from the chinese how worried are you how worried should the markets be that we aposre going to see this again chaffetz i think the president is actually willing us in the right direction nobody is challenging and taking on china and we aposve all know that they have been abusive in their intellectual property theft they have been taking advantage of the u s markets the fact that the president is putting america first is exactly what he campaigned on no doubt it aposs going to be tumultuous getting there but the president is pushing us in the right direction wallace but are you confident that the chinese are going to what the president says keep their word and really change the way they act chaffetz yes i really do i think the huawei situation is going to be a distraction i understand the timing is bad but i can tell you having set through a lot of meetings over eight and a half years i served huawei was always in a lot of those discussions wallace fifteen seconds harman right goal but wrong way to manage it and i think people are skittish seeing the photo op on north korea and seeing the photo op with russia that we aposre going to get yet another photo op and no serious progress wallace all right panel we have to take a break here we will see you all a little later when we come back what robert mueller aposs latest moves mean for president trump we will discuss the key takeaways from friday aposs court filings with senator angus king a member of the senate intelligence committee that aposs next commercial break wallace coming up former fbi director james comey gets grilled on capitol hill begin video clip james comey former fbi director one we could have done this in open setting and two when you read the transcript you will see that we are talking again about hillary clinton aposs emails for heaven aposs sakes end video clip wallace we aposll discuss it by the top member of the senate intelligence committee next commercial break wallace a flurry of court filings this week reveal new information about robert mueller aposs russia investigation and now federal prosecutors are trying to connect the dots between president trump his campaign his company and the kremlin joining me now from maine senator angus king an independent and a key member of the senate intelligence committee senator the special counsel and federal prosecutors in new york issued court filings this week on paul manafort michael cohen and general michael flynn question what if anything did you learn about possible criminal activity by president trump and where does this investigation stand out sen angus king i maine senate intelligence committee well i think the first thing to say is the mueller filings on friday with regard to manafort and the district of new york talking about cohen and also mueller i thought they were less interesting if you will or important than the flynn filing earlier in the week and what was interesting about that was what wasn apost said in other words there were very large sections of the flynn filings that were redacted that we couldn apost see what they were and the special counsel went out of his way to compliment general flynn on the fulsomeness of his testimony and how helpful he had been and basically recommended no jail time it was a kind of prosecutorial pardon if you will based upon a high level of cooperation the mueller and cohen filings weren apost that i mean i aposm sorry the wallace manafort king the manafort and cohen yes manafort and cohen filings weren apost as as revealing cohen aposs basically went over the information that has already been revealed in his in this plea arrangement about the payoffs wallace but but senator senator let me drill down on on one point there king sure wallace on the illegal campaign hush money payments to two women new york prosecutors write this cohen himself has now admitted with respectable to both payments he acted in coordination with and at the direction of individual one who we know to be donald trump king right how damaging is that to the president king well the president has a series of defenses if indeed that is charged to be a crime i guess in one would be it wasn apost willful and knowing which was what the statute requires and also the question is it was his own money a candidate can spend his own as much money as they want there are no limitations on the other hand it wasn apost disclosed and that aposs one of the key factors here and the key word there is at the direction of which directly implicates the president in what could be a felony and and so that is a significant development but that was really in in cohen aposs guilty plea last august this really sort of amplifies that wallace let me ask you about another thing in the cohen filing by the special counsel not the new york prosecutors the special counsel says in november of 2015 someone who claimed to be close to the russian government offered quote synergy on a government level to the trump campaign cohen says he didn apost follow up on that but he did have a series of other meetings with russian officials how significant is that king well i think it is significant because it it is just one more connection it appears that that discussion is about the trump tower moscow project which we now know was underway and and being discussed not underway in the terms of being built but certainly they were working on trying to develop such a project from the fall of 2015 into the middle of 2016 which is contrary to earlier reports that there were no relationships with the russians nothing going on and and here aposs the thing chris if you want to build a big project in moscow you aposve got to work with the government you aposve got to have permission you aposve got to have a go ahead from the highest levels of the of the government and that means vladimir putin and so this establishes that there were contacts going on during that period and michael cohen was in the middle of it wallace so bottom line at the end of this week as opposed to if i had spoken to you last sunday is there anymore there there when it comes to the president king i don apost think it it changes that although well yes let me modify that answer i think yes going back to my original comment i think michael flynn the michael flynn filing was very significant he met with the special counsel dozens and dozens of time and gave a great deal of information a lot of which is redacted which is suggestive that there aposs information we don apost know i think that aposs the most significant filing of the week i think the manafort and cohen finally gave us a little bit of additional information but i think the flynn filing if i were in the white house would be the one that would make me nervous wallace i want to ask you about the president aposs reaction on friday night he tweeted this totally clears the president thank you does it king no i don apost i don apost see that at all in fact the cohen finally as you aposve already pointed out implicates him in the commission of a felony i wouldn apost call that being totally cleared now it doesn apost speak directly to the issue of conspiracy with the russians involving the 2016 campaign although again the cohen filing talks about relationships to people in russia at the highest level with regard to synergy with the russian government and the trump campaign so it aposs suggestive but not conclusive chris there aposs a lot of talk recently about smoking guns and in criminal prosecutions you rarely find smoking guns it aposs a it aposs an accumulation of evidence and then that aposs what aposs happening here it aposs more of a drip drip than an opening of the firehose and it continues to develop in ways that aren apost favorable to the president but i think as you suggest in the filings this week there aposs nothing definitive but there aposs nothing that exonerates the president either i was surprised by that tweet i was wondering if he read the same documents i did wallace the president had two other tweets this week that stirred controversy i want to put them up on michael aposs cohen seeking no prison time the president wrote he lied for this outcome and should in my opinion serve a full and complete sentence but on roger stone saying he will never testify against mr trump the president wrote nice to know that some people still have guts do you see those tweets as some other people do as evidence of witness tampering king i think it aposs troubling and you you could add a third instance and that is when he said last week that a pardon for manafort is not off the table i found that very troubling that aposs dangling a pardon i used to be a governor chris and i had the power of the pardon and to me if i had thought about pardoning a criminal who had some ability to implicate me in some criminal activity i can apost imagine it frankly and and that aposs what we aposre talking about here so when you add those three things together it aposs very troubling again it aposs not definitive it aposs not a smoking gun but it aposs troubling when you aposre essentially saying punish the guy who aposs given information against me and let the guys off who aren apost talking that aposs that i think troubling is the word i keep using i think that aposs the that aposs the best characterization of it wallace former fbi director james comey testified before two house committees on friday for a total of almost seven hours and afterwards he had this to say begin video clip james comey former fbi director when you read the transcript you will see that we were talking again about hillary clinton aposs e mails for heaven sakes so i aposm not sure we need to do this at all end video clip wallace now the republican majority has contended and what they were trying to find out and asked about four hours in this in this hearing was that there was bias both for hillary clinton in that investigation and against donald trump in that investigation did you see any evidence of that did they did they find that king no and i think the there aposs a really important point here and that is the investigation of donald trump was completely secret it wasn apost made public at all there wasn apost a whiff or a suggestion of it nobody ever even knew about it through the election until well after the election so if if that investigation was undertaken for political purposes it it had no result it didn apost it didn apost affect the election whatsoever on the other hand the hillary clinton investigation was very public and many people feel that director comey aposs statements about reopening the investigation in the later part of october about a week or ten days before the election was one of the things that sunk hillary clinton aposs campaign so the the i understand the argument but the conclusion doesn apost doesn apost support it wallace senator king if if the trump investigation was a was political they certainly didn apost pull the trigger on it wallace senator i aposve got about 30 seconds left the republicans are making a big deal about the fact that fbi director comey former director said i don apost recall i don apost remember over 200 times in his testimony i know you probably haven apost gone through the 235 pages but do you think that indicates that he was dissembling or not being candid king i had probably 20 meetings in the intelligence committee with him over the course of five years and i never saw that from him it would be very surprising to me i wasn apost there i didn apost see it but on the question of the political hillary thing the inspector general of the of the justice department did a very long i think 150 page analysis of that concluded there were some judgment calls that they disagreed with but it wasn apost undertaken in any way for political purposes and that aposs an independent investigation that was very thorough wallace senator king thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir king yes sir glad to be with you chris wallace up next president trump signs a short term spending bill to keep the government open through december 21st what would you like to ask the panel about the end of year fight brewing over his proposed order will just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump congress must fully fund border security in the year ending funding bill we have to we have to get this done schumer so if president trump wants to throw a temper tantrum and shut down the government over christmas over the wall that aposs his decision end video clip wallace president trump and senate democratic leader chuck schumer squaring off over whether the must pass government funding bill in two weeks will include money for the border wall with mexico or not and we aposre back now with the panel well congressman chaffetz president trump is insisting on 5 billion for the wall in this bill that has to be passed by a week from next friday the 21st four days before christmas democratic leaders are now saying they won apost even make a deal on daca on protecting the dreamers if it means they have to fund the wall to 5 billion does this mean that a government shutdown it will partial because they passed a number of bills already but a partial government shutdown is inevitable over christmas and if so who pays the political price chaffetz well i think it aposs a very real threat because i think the president aposs wanting his 5 billion it aposs embarrassing the republicans weren apost able to produce that when they had the house and senate and the presidency they spent 8 trillion over those over those two years and they couldn apost come up with 5 billion it aposs an embarrassment i think the president aposs serious about this but i also think that all bad bills that pass pass within seven days of christmas and that aposs what this is headed for wallace and and if it if there aposs a shutdown who take who pays the price chaffetz i think the president is on the winning side of this they want to protect the security of the united states of america and all these graphics and all these things you see of people coming north i i think those republicans will claim victory but i think those in the middle will understand the president aposs trying to protect the united states wallace we asked you for questions and we got this on twitter from leah yamim she writes i thought mexico was paying for the wall and i misremembering the donald trump promise during his make america great rallies or was he plain lying congresswoman harman how do you answer leah first of all and secondly does nancy pelosi have any choice on this if she were to give any ground on funding for the wall wouldn apost that doom her as being elected speaker jane harman director woodrow wilson center well first of all mexico will not pay for this wall second of all those who will pay the price are the people who live paycheck to paycheck who won apost get a paycheck over christmas real people get hurt i saw the movie i was a member of congress and the government shut down over christmas for 27 days in 1995 it was a disaster it was during the the reign of newt gingrich but at any rate who else will pay the price i think the president will nancy pelosi should make a deal in my view and chuck schumer should too and i hope they will put daca in there put ending u s military assistance to yemen which is something on a bipartisan basis that the that the senate wants those would be at least two and and and border security is something at least i strongly support not not necessarily a physical wall everywhere which is wallace well wait wait wait you say not necessarily for that aposs what that aposs the price of admission harman i know but you can apost put a physical wall through certain environmental areas and and along the coast of texas so wallace right but you aposd pay for a wall harman i i would find a way but let but one more thing hemorrhaging deficits if we aposre headed for a recession all these billions of dollars do add up and and with the trump tax bill and other things there aposs just no relief in sight so i would return if i could some form of of this wonderful plan that was supposed to balance the budget and and cut spending in a responsible way do tax reform and do entitlement reform wallace well that isn apost going to happen in two weeks let me let me let me bring in our two other colleagues here really quickly because i want to get to another subject guy how do you think this is going to play out guy benson townhall com well i would just point out that even though the possibility of a shutdown is serious and obviously we aposre here talking about it and they aposll be talking about it in the building behind you i think in the coming weeks if there is a shutdown it aposs always a partial shutdown of the federal government wallace right benson it will be even more partial in this case because the republican congress has passed more appropriations bills through regular order wallace right benson than they aposve done in two decades including defense so i think the urgency in some of the scare tactics in a fight around a shutdown won apost be available to the democrats although i think they aposll get their licks in on the president if it is the wall as a sticking point wallace who who pays the price here charles lane fox news contributor well this is the last stand for the wall with the republicans in control of the whole government i tend to think if they don apost if if if there aposs a shutdown over the wall i think the president will be rewarded at least with his base for for making that struggle but if it goes on a lot longer than that because there isn apost a lot of support for the wall generally then he will start to pay a price wallace all right meanwhile for all the talk about by republicans about democratic voter fraud there seems to have been another case perhaps in north carolina where it was the republicans who were involved in voter fraud let aposs put this up republican mark harris has a 905 vote lead over democrat dan mccready in a race for congress mccready had already conceded but now there are allegations of a gop operative mishandling hundreds of absentee ballots which may have been the difference and the democrat mccready has now unconceded guy what do you make of this and explain what aposs going on here benson yes i mean it doesn apost look good and if you read into the details i would not be surprised if we end up seeing a new election in north carolina 9 because i think this shady character aposs fingerprints are all over this wallace well tell what he did benson so he was collecting ballots so absentee ballots and allegedly wallace this is a republican it aposs not it aposs not mark harris but it was somebody on his staff benson correct someone who was sort of working for him wallace yes benson and he has a long history he aposs worked for both parties and over the course of time and he has this amazing track record where his clients tend to outperform expectations by far when it comes to absentee ballots where they collect these absentee ballots from voters something happens to them some of them appear some of them disappear and then boom the outcomes tend to benefit his clients subsequently wallace yes and we should point out that it aposs even got a name which is vote harvesting i aposve never heard that expression before in north carolina it aposs illegal either you have to submit your absentee ballot or a close friend harman right wallace or somebody connected to you benson a relative wallace a relative benson right wallace has to has to submit the ballot it can apost just be somebody submitting hundreds of ballots benson however setting aside this particular case in north carolina what you just described that vote harvesting scheme it aposs actually perfectly legal in places like california and there was a fascinating piece on npr where they looked at will this incident renew scrutiny for mail in voting states like colorado like washington state where this could be a widespread problem relatively speaking wallace all right here is the reaction from the democratic democratic party chair in north carolina begin video clip wayne goodwin north carolina democratic party chair north carolina voters deserve to know the truth and as more details come to light every day it becomes increasingly clear that a full investigation must be completed before the election can be certified end video clip wallace and and that gets very interesting chuck because there aposs going to be an investigation inside north carolina about this but ultimately who decides whether or not to seat a member to congress the congress the house they decide whether or not to certify it or call for a new election lane and by the way next year that will be mancy pelosi and the democratic majority will be deciding wallace right lane so my bet would be this gentleman mark harris will never be seated wallace the republican lane the republican who ostensibly won this will never be seated either because there aposs a new election which he can apost win with this cloud over him or because the election is never certified or finally because the democrats never agree to to seat him and there aposs another wallace in fairness there aposs no evidence that mark harris know about this lane correct but you know there aposs another factor here which is this gentleman was not the republican party of north carolina aposs choice for this seat bob pittenger robert pittenger the incumbent was this is an insurgent republican candidate so there aposs not a whole lot of love for him in the republican party wallace and and it turns out that in the republican primary the same thing happened lane this may have happened as well benson that aposs exactly right lane so just a final point on that if i may excuse me that that i think there aposs very little incentive for the republicans to go to the mats for this guy it aposs only one seat out of a large minority conference i think he aposs toast wallace so instead of a 40 seat pickup it could be a 41 seat pickup lane yes harman i won in 1994 when the late absentee votes were counted and in los angeles it was a requirement that your family had to bring in the absentee votes and i finally won by 811 votes in my election was certified wallace well at least in the story i read it now has changed and anybody can bring them in benson yes wallace you can harvest votes i like harvesting votes thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power players of the week a story of devotion from two members of the greatest generation commercial break wallace as we heard this week in the farewell to president bush tales of heroism from world war ii have become part of our national identity but some members of the greatest generation volunteered for the three year conflict in korea filled with heroes of its own including our power players of the week begin videotape adam makos author devotion tom and jessie were devoted to their country they were devoted to each other devotion was just this overarching theme and it was just fitting for for men going off to serve their country wallace voice over adam makos is the author of devotion an epic story of heroism friendship and sacrifice and what a story it is tom hudner came from the country clubs of new england jesse brown from the sharecropper fields of mississippi and when they met as pilots in the korean war jesse was surprised tom came over to shake his hand makos it was unusual for him that this tom hudner was so open to being friends with a black pilot and so it took jesse a little while to get used to the fact that he could trust this man wallace by 1950 jesse was the first black carrier pilot in the navy and he and tom were flying combat missions over the chosin reservoir in korea where 100 000 chinese troops encircled 20 000 u s marines makos the only way to find the enemy when you aposre seeking them out is to get low and slow and in this case jesse aposs plane was hit by a a random shot a golden bullet if you will wallace jesse saw a pasture on top of a snow covered mountain somehow he guided his corsairs down to a hard landing makos the minute his plane hits the clock is ticking the enemy can see the smoke rising because the airplane is slowly catching fire and they begin moving in that direction wallace on camera and what did tom hudner do makos tom hudner did something that has not been attempted sense it had never been attempted before he said i aposm going in and he made an intentional crash landing in that same pasture alongside of jesse aposs plane wallace voice over tom shoveled snow into the engine to stop the fire then try to pull jesse from the plane but he was trapped in the wreckage and had serious injuries makos and he almost practically held his hand and stayed with him as the darkness set in as jesse was fading and then finally he took home jesse aposs last words and those were tell daisy how much i love her a last message to his his wife pamela knight daughter of jesse brown he died with me and my mom on his mind and asked tom to deliver a message of love to my mom and me wallace daisy was jesse aposs wife and pam was their only child not quite two knight to know that he had this great love for my mom that he that his last thoughts were of her it just makes me feel that i have a legacy that is difficult to live up to almost wallace a helicopter flew 13 miles behind enemy lines to rescue tom who didn apost want to leave his dead wingmen makos the pilot said we have to go tom you stay here you die you join jesse tom shouted at the cockpit he said jesse we aposll be back for you somehow some day wallace tom thought he would be court martialed for crashing his plane instead he was the first member of the navy to receive the medal of honor in the korean war wallace on camera did he carry the memory of jesse brown through his career through his life makos he helped put jesse aposs widow through college when tom was received a cash award from the grateful residents of his town he sent that checked down to daisy wallace voice over but one thing always bothered tom he never returned to get jesse in 2013 tom was 89 he and adam went to north korea to meet officials there capt thomas hudner jr ret medal of honor recipient well we have great hopes that we can find the airplane wallace but it was the monsoon season and they never got there tom died in 2017 back in 1950 a navy reconnaissance flight found the two corsairs and recent satellite images identified the pasture but the two planes were likely salvage for scrap metal and pam and adam can only hope someone buried jesse wallace on camera how much would it mean to you to get your dad aposs remains back knight it would mean everything to be able to at least know my father has a final resting place here on this side where we can go and visit and also that we aposre keeping a promise to my mom wallace voice over adam hopes as part of u s diplomacy with north korea to keep tom aposs promise to his friend makos he didn apost see it as a very big
