has been trying to appease shareholders by entering negotiations to sell two of its most valuable assets its stakes in china s alibaba group and yahoo japan in a complicated deal that could have generated billions of dollars for dividends and possible acquisitions the company based in sunnyvale calif had sought to avoid a confrontation with one of its largest shareholders new york hedge fund manager daniel loeb by purging its board of four longtime directors including chairman roy bostock both those efforts foundered tuesday the negotiations to sell yahoo s stakes in alibaba and yahoo
