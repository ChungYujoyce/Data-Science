to enjoy all the benefits of our website stoicism is a part of many nations identity not just britain s can the pandemic be met withdispassionate resilience if there is one poem that sums up the british cult of stoicism the stiff upper lip it is if by rudyard kipling its politically dubious roots inspired by an excitable scottish colonial administrator s failed coup d tat in the transvaal in 1895 take away little from its enduring influence on how britons see themselves voted the nation s favourite poem in a bbc poll in 1995 its lines come to mind when we witness our compatriots responding stolidly and dispassionately after some large or small trauma if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same yet the poem is also much more than british ahead of the munich agreement in 1938 the czech political magazine pr tomnost published it as a call for national resilience in the 1961 kenyan election tom mboya one of the founding fathers of the country s independent republic recited it to a huge crowd at an end of campaign election rally in nairobi what other poem could as if does at once adorn a tennis club that hosted the us open feature in the film apocalypse now and according to the indian writer khushwant singh represent the prayer like essence of the message of the gita a hindu text in english the poem is universal we brits might like to think that stoicism our stiff upper lip sets us apart from what we imagine to be more flappable peoples we might see our cities getting on with their business after a terror attack or a natural disaster for example and approvingly deem that behaviour typically british we are however indulging in a self flattering fantasy most cultures have some notion that certain or most things are out of our control and most cultures consider it in some form virtuous to accept this reality by treating kipling s two imposters triumph and disaster with equanimity it might horrify some british exceptionalists to learn that the very term stiff upper lip was originally an americanism if we needed proof of that coronavirus is it at the time of writing there were 116 358 confirmed cases of covid 19 around the world china along with south korea taiwan and hong kong seemed to have contained the virus through draconian restrictions on everyday life measures that others would soon have to impose to slow the spread and keep their health systems from becoming overwhelmed italy s government had just extended the lockdown affecting northern regions to the whole country with alarming reports of hospitals unable to cope with the numbers of ill the figures in iran too were shooting upwards with several political leaders infected and the true numbers thought by many to be much higher than reported early stage countries such as the us were only starting to brace for the scale of the disruption and grief ahead and that was without getting into the looming human costs of the financial turmoil rippling around the planet in the virus s wake we are probably much closer to the start of this saga than to the end but one pattern is becoming clear around the world as in britain political and moral leaders commentators and ordinary citizens are urging their fellow citizens to respond with dispassionate resilience often by invoking it as a supposedly distinctive national trait sometimes populations are living up to their stoical self images sometimes they are conspicuously not and it is the very centrality of stoical behaviour in so many value systems that makes the coronavirus a test of the things societies tell themselves about how they behave in adversity and thus about who they really are it is a mirror revealing whether those things are really true the question is will people like what they see in it stoicism of course is a classical western tradition that corresponds to comparable but philosophically distinct notions of dispassionate resilience in other cultures but it is as good a place as any to start zeno of citium the philosopher who founded the school around a stoa

sally out on matthew arnold s darkling plain and might not live up to its ideals in britain at its worst when those born after the second world war imagine they know and shared the sacrifices of the generation that fought and suffered it this angst might be particularly pronounced but not uniquely so as the virus spreads and restrictions bite and as societies are tested around the world people will on the one hand be celebrating wuhan jiay u type moments of defiance and on the other struggling to reconcile the moments of panic with their stoic self image it is not inconceivable that this balancing act could trigger national identity crises the answer is to be stoical of course but to be stoical in the right way stoicism or whatever you or your culture call an attitude of deference to the wider order of things and avoidance of domination by one s passions should not be a performance or a litmus test for millennia it has been the case that those who most venerate stoicism are often those who least naturally exhibit its traits seneca for example was not an exemplary ascetic but a neurotic adviser who lived amid the lavish appetites and passions of emperor nero s court stoicism is not an ideal that can be easily if at all achieved it is a virtue to respect and to strive towards however hopeless the goal rather as rieux and tarrou strived to save oran from the plague in camus novel done right stoicism tolerates human error and weakness but applauds every choice to tolerate the imminence of misfortune with good humour calm decency and solidarity it is that which should guide societies as they face the coronavirus yes we should meet kipling s imposters as if they are just the same but sometimes we will fall short as it happens it is the poem that the students pasted over if in manchester in 2018 still i rise by maya angelou that sums up this flawed but quietly resolute true stoicism as well as anything did you want to see me broken bowed head and lowered eyes shoulders falling down like teardrops weakened by my soulful cries you may shoot me with your words you may cut me with your eyes you may kill me with your hatefulness but still like air i ll rise

it matters that so many cultures make steeling oneself for hardship and defining one s tribe by the ability to do so integral to their self image and it matters especially in times like these when

british stoicism the writer of the piece madeline grant quotes the historian thomas dixon s book weeping britannia on stiff upper lip britain s shift to lachrymose self pity in moments such as the
