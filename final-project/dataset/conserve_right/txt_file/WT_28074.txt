tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn house judiciary democrats first impeachment hearing fizzled tuesday as a fiery and combative corey lewandowski dodged their questions pressed for details about his personal conversations with president trump mr lewandowski was defiant the hearing dissolved into a shouting match at times as mr trump s former campaign manager visibly frustrated democrats with his refusal to answer the white house has directed that i not disclose the substance of any discussion with the president or his advisers to protect executive branch confidentiality said mr lewandowski who never worked in the white house i recognize this is not my privilege but i am respecting the white house s decision see also corey lewandowski hearing erupts in chaos over mueller report democrats who hoped to glean more information from mr lewandowski in their bid to impeach mr trump were disappointed i think it is just shameful that the republicans the white house and the witnesses continue to obstruct justice rep pramilla jayapal of washington state told the washington times it just has to make the american people wonder what they have to hide democrats pressured mr lewandowski to disclose conversations he had with the president about suspected obstruction of former special counsel robert mueller s investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 election see also corey lewandowski gambles on trump ties to excite gop for potential senate bid mr trump ordered mr lewandowski to persuade then attorney general jeff sessions to restrict mr mueller s investigation according to the special counsel s report mr lewandowski confirmed the account but said he didn t deliver the message he said the reason was that he was out of town vacationing with his children not because he was squeamish as one democrat suggested he also insisted that the president did not pressure him to break the law congressman the president didn t ask me to do anything illegal he said in a particularly contentious exchange with rep steve cohen tennessee democrat rep david n cicilline of rhode island said mr lewandowski s confirmation of mr trump s order was exactly what democrats needed that s explosive this is a private citizen being summoned to the oval office and being directed to give a message to the attorney general mr cicilline said this is classic obstruction of justice rep henry c hank johnson jr of georgia acknowledged that no new information or bombshell revelations were gained from the more than five hours of questioning but he said the hearing helped democrats create their own record independent of the mueller report prying any other information out of mr lewandowski proved nearly impossible as he repeatedly stonewalled and enraged democrats with his pugnacious attitude you are like a fish being cleaned with a spoon it s very hard to get an answer out of you mr johnson said rep sheila jackson lee didn t fare much better the exasperated texas democrat told the former campaign manager this is the house judiciary committee not a house party yet mr lewandowski continued mocking democrats he addressed rep eric swalwell of california as president swalwell in a nod to his failed bid for the 2020 nomination mr lewandowski also slow walked the first question from committee chairman jerrold nadler as the new york democrat asked him about sections of the mueller report mr lewandowski stalled by repeatedly asking for a copy during a short afternoon recess mr lewandowski tweeted to promote his potential bid for a u s senate seat from new hampshire mr lewandowski s conduct so infuriated committee democrats that some demanded that he be held in contempt of congress for obstructing their investigation mr nadler said he would consider the request and called the former campaign manager s behavior completely unacceptable mr lewandowski isn t the first witness democrats have had trouble controlling in a hearing it s becoming a serious problem for us that the white house has ordered absolute defiance and obstruction of our investigations rep jamie raskin of maryland told reporters we really have to figure out how to deal with that the members are frustrated and a lot of people are talking about contempt in particular mr raskin floated the idea of congress parallel power also known as inherent contempt to hold witnesses accountable for not cooperating democrats considered invoking the long dormant congressional power earlier this year but decided instead to go through the court system as they did with former white house counsel don mcgahn and attorney general william p barr despite their frustrations some democrats said mr lewandowski provided evidence to add to their case for impeachment obvious obstruction of justice is being done in full view now in some ways they re helping to drive the case ms jayapal said the president was impressed with his former campaign manager s performance mr trump highlighted mr lewandowski s opening statement which offered a vociferous defense of the president such a beautiful opening statement by corey lewandowski thank you corey the president tweeted shortly after the hearing began republicans said the time would have been better spent holding hearings on the justice department inspector general s report on former fbi director james b comey the report found that mr comey violated fbi policies when he leaked a set of memos detailing his conversations with mr trump it s a shame that you re here mr lewandowski said rep matt gaetz florida republican jim comey should be sitting in that chair he should be answering questions about why he did so much damage to the fbi and our country mr gaetz later said the hearing was held because democrats hate this president more than they love their country the hearing was the first by the committee since it passed a measure defining the parameters of their investigation into possible obstruction of justice by mr trump as members consider recommending articles of impeachment to the full house two former top white house aides were also scheduled to appear tuesday but they defied congressional subpoenas at the instruction of white house counsel pat cipollone the white house said the aides rick dearborn and rob porter are absolutely immune from answering congressional questions steven groves white house deputy press secretary said the same legal position has been followed consistently by administrations of both parties mr nadler said the white house s effort to stop or limit former staff from testifying is an absolute cover up this is a cover up plain and simple he said if it were to prevail it would upend the separation of powers envisioned by our founders mr lewandowski came out swinging in his opening statement telling democrats they were wasting their time he quickly pointed a finger at the obama era intelligence community for failing to stop russian meddling in the 2016 election the obama biden administration and the intelligence community overseen by james clapper jim comey and john brennan had the responsibility to the american people to ensure the integrity of the 2016 election he said i leave it to this committee and the american public to decide how successful or not they were in doing their jobs he also accused democrats of taking the nation down a rabbit hole of russian collusion allegations fueled by trump haters as for actual collusion or conspiracy there was none he said what there has been however is harassment of the president from
