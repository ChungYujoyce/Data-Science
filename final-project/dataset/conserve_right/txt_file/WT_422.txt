bernie sanders but many voters are already looking ahead to november and whether trump can again win in the state that perhaps more than any other catapulted him into the white house in 2016 for sanders the stakes could hardly be higher he defeated hillary clinton in michigan in 2016 emboldening his argument that he could win with a diverse coalition that drew well from young voters working

university of michigan and blue collar flint and dearborn home to a large concentration of arab americans it is a promise he has made in other states during the primaries but so far has largely failed to deliver i am more than aware that trump in 2016 won the state of michigan by a small vote sanders said i do believe the people of michigan aren t going to make that mistake again sanders canceled a planned trip to mississippi to spend more time in the state this past weekend but he has struggled to broaden his appeal with black voters as evidenced by biden s wipe out win in south carolina and

prevent the same mistakes the party made in 2016 when the black community felt largely unseen and ignored she has endorsed sanders citing the ongoing water crisis in flint and detroit s aggressive water shutoff campaign that has disrupted service for 100 000 plus residential accounts across the city since 2014 lewis patrick said the party needs to speak to issues that are impacting lives on a daily basis we ve told every candidate before we got down to the final two that we noticed in the debates when they came to detroit that was missing from the conversation she said referring to when the city hosted democratic presidential debates last summer what we re seeing is that many campaigns are treating black and brown communities as sort of a drive by vote sanders has spoken to flint s

his promises to restore the state s lost jobs manufacturing jobs in michigan grew from 616 800 when trump took office to 628 900 last december according to the bureau of labor statistics but some counties that trump won have experienced job losses and the state faces the prospect of further downturns as coronavirus reverberates through the economy while top union leaders have lined up to support either biden or sanders many of their rank and file members continue to back trump because of his views on social issues like guns and abortion a number of union households who voted for trump
