 of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion on may 7 south korean customs authorities announced they had discovered 17 500 capsules made from the incinerated remains of human fetuses and infants being smuggled into the country from china for sale coming in the wake of the high profile drama concerning the effort of the chinese government to suppress the voice of the brave blind anti population control activist chen guangcheng this news has placed the issue of the regime s brutal one child law forcefully before the conscience of the world therefore a look at the origin and history of this atrocity is in order in june 1978 song jian a top level manager in charge of developing control systems for the chinese guided missile program traveled to helsinki for an international conference on control system theory and design while in finland he picked up copies of the limits to growthandblueprint for survival publications of the club of rome a major source of malthusian propaganda and made the acquaintance of several europeans who were promoting the report s method of using computerized systems analysis to predict and design the human future fascinated by the possibilities mr song returned to china and republished the club s analysis under his own name without attribution establishing his reputation for brilliant and original thinking in no time at all mr song became a scientific superstar seizing the moment to grasp for greater power and importance he pulled together an elite group of mathematicians from within his department and with the help of a powerful computer to provide the necessary special effects issued the profoundly calculated judgment that china s correct population size was 650 million to 700 million people which is to say some 280 million to 330 million less than its actual 1978 population top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey mr song s analysis quickly found favor at top levels of the chinese communist party because it purported to prove that the reason for china s continued poverty was not 30 years of disastrous misrule but the very existence of the chinese people paramount leader deng xiaoping and his fellows in the central committee were very impressed by the pseudo scientific computer babble mr song used to dress up his theory and even more impressed by the possibilities that arrogating the power to permit or deny children would provide to the state thus began the most forceful population control program since nazi germany qian xinzhong a soviet trained former major general in the people s liberation army was placed in charge of the campaign he ordered all women with one child to have a stainless steel iud inserted and to be inspected regularly to make sure they had not tampered with it to remove the device was deemed a criminal act all parents with two or more children were to be sterilized no pregnancies were legal for anyone under 23 whether married or not and all unauthorized pregnancies were to be aborted women who defied these injunctions were taken and sterilized by force babies would be aborted right through the ninth month of pregnancy with many crying as they were being stabbed to death at the moment of birth those women who fled to try to save their children were hunted and if they could not be caught their houses were torn down and their parents thrown in prison there to linger until a ransom of 20 000 yuan about three years income for a peasant was paid for their release babies born to such fugitives were declared to be black children illegal non persons in the eyes of the state without any right to employment public schooling health care or reproduction millions have been confiscated from their mothers and placed in orphanages where if not adopted in short order they are left to expire without food in dying rooms local communist party officials were given quotas for sterilizations abortions and iud insertions if they exceeded them they could be promoted if they failed to meet them they would be expelled from the party in disgrace these measures guaranteed results since 1983 the combined total coerced abortions iud implantations and sterilizations have exceeded 30 million per year or nearly one billion in all given the supreme importance to rural chinese families of having a son both to take care of aging parents and to continue the line and honor family ancestors many peasants simply could not accept a daughter as their only child as a result female infanticide has become rampant during the period from 2000 to 2004 almost 1 25 boys were born for every girl born indicating that one fifth of all baby girls in china were either being aborted or murdered in some provinces the fraction eliminated was as high as one half according to chai ling the former tiananmen square rebel leader who now heads a dissenting organization all girls allowed the death toll now exceeds more than 100 million girls such is the horror of china s population control policy america needs to take a strong stand against it and aid in every way those brave men and women who would
