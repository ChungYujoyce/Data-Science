have guns he said we re going to have to give major consideration for building new facilities for those in need at the same time we will be taking mentally deranged and dangerous people off the street

said instead among other things we have diversionary programs for gun offenses the routine downgrading of charges for violent crime and entire sections of the criminal code that are ignored he said
