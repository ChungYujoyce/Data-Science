cution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic daca can and probably will ultimately be ended by the trump administration but the supreme court spent tuesday morning debating whether homeland security s original justification in 2017 for phasing out the obama era deportation amnesty was good enough or whether the justices need to send the matter back for a do over what s the point wondered justice stephen g breyer who seemed sympathetic to the plight of more than 600 000 dreamers currently protected by the 2012 deferred action for childhood arrivals program but who also wondered what sense it would make for judges to play ping pong with the agency top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender outside the courtroom hundreds of dreamers rallied demanding the justices heed their calls to preserve the program that has given them work permits social security numbers driver s licenses taxpayer benefits and a chance to deepen ties to american society inside the courtroom they found a defender in justice sonia sotomayor who said president trump had tried to have it both ways assuring dreamers he d take care of them while pursuing the end of the daca program that protected them this is not about the law she said this is about our choice to destroy lives but her passion didn t bleed over to the other justices who while acknowledging that livelihoods ride on their ruling said the case is less about illegal immigration and more about whether mr trump and his team checked all the right boxes in announcing the phaseout in 2017 solicitor general noel francisco defending the trump administration in court tuesday said the courts should do very little peering behind the curtain he pointed to a long line of cases he said show judges must defer to agencies when they lay out the reasons for their decisions in this case he said it was perfectly natural that homeland security would want to end the obama policy that carved people out of immigration law enforcement nothing in immigration law requires the department a law enforcement agency to not enforce the law he said he warned that if the justices refuse to accept mr trump s phaseout they ll have to grapple with the legality of daca itself a program that has long faced serious legal questions including from mr obama who repeatedly told immigrants he lacked the power to create such a broad program before reversing himself in fact the program was created by then homeland security secretary janet napolitano who issued a memo she did not put the program through notice or comment nor follow other procedures generally required of major policy changes now ms napolitano as president of the university of california system is one of the chief plaintiffs against mr trump arguing his team didn t follow the right procedures in winding down her program she was in the courtroom tuesday ms napolitano s challenge is part of a messy legal web of cases one district court sided with mr trump and approved the phaseout while three courts ruled against him and said his team failed to provide adequate justification meanwhile texas has sued to end ms napolitano s original 2012 program along the way courts struck down a similar obama program known as dapa which applied to a broader group of immigrants who are in the u s illegally daca applied to immigrants who were under age 31 at the time who d come to the u s illegally by 2007 had arrived before turning 16 years of age had pursued a high school education and who d kept a relatively clean criminal rap sheet the obama administration said applications would be judged on a case by case basis and approval was not automatic but it was pretty close to being so in the first full year 97 7 of cases decided resulted in approval even under the trump administration approval rates were still above 80 until the phaseout was announced more than 800 000 people were approved for daca over its lifetime and some 660 000 were still under its protections as of september the others either failed to renew managed to get a more permanent status such as by marrying an american or in some cases had daca stripped from them for criminal activity while high performing recipients are more common the washington times has detailed some of those criminal entanglements including more than a dozen who have actually been arrested at the border over the last 18 months on charges of migrant smuggling even the lawyers backing daca said any administration has the power to wind the program down yes said theodore b olson one of the lawyers for daca recipients in response to a question from justice brett m kavanaugh so the question then comes down to the explanation the justice said yet should the courts rule that mr trump s phaseout isn t legal mr francisco said they ll have to rule whether ms napolitano s original memo was legal if you disagree with us on any of our other arguments you absolutely must address the ultimate legality question because we simply cannot be forced to maintain a policy that this court concl
