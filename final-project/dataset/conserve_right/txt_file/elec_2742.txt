eight ball that is always wrong if dan liljenquist falls short in tuesday s utah republican senate primary it won t be for a lack of trying the former state senator has waged a no holds barred campaign against six term incumbent sen orrin g hatch saying the veteran lawmaker failed to rein in federal spending voted to approve nonessential programs without paying for them and contributed to the 16 trillion national debt through years of inattention when mr hatch refused to participate in a televised debate mr liljenquist held a debate anyway playing film clips of the senator that purported to show him changing his position on a number of issues top stories 500 doctors tell trump to end the coronavirus shutdown say it will cause more deaths democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots you are not going to die from covid 19 when the hatch camp sunk 10 million into a re election effort that includes massive television ad buys the liljenquist side countered with a door to door retail campaign aimed at mobilizing voters and creating an under the radar buzz for the upstart candidate the result has been the most bruising campaign of mr hatch s 36 year senate career despite the senator s 10 to 1 fundraising advantage and recent polls showing him with a healthy double digit lead utah s senior senator has bristled at the missives launched against his record by mr liljenquist as evidenced by several heated exchanges during their only radio debate june 15 on ksl newsradio in salt lake city at one point mr liljenquist asked the senator whether he should take responsibility for the eruption in federal spending during his tenure in washington frankly no said a clearly irritated mr hatch and i m offended you keep bringing it up mr liljenquist issued a statement later that day calling it absolutely baffling that senator hatch refuses to take any responsibility for his record the race represents the latest in a series of hard fought republican primaries between longtime republican lawmakers and young conservative challengers since the tea party movement exploded onto the political scene in 2009 last month sen richard g lugar of indiana became the latest veteran republican to fall victim to the conservative onslaught falling in the primary to richard mourdock the state treasurer two years ago sen robert f bennett of utah was blindsided by the movement failing to muster enough votes at the state convention even to qualify for the two candidate primary which was won by mike lee mr hatch clearly learned the lessons of the bennett debacle pumping millions into his pre convention campaign seeking out support from high profile conservatives and wooing utah s tea party activists the senator has benefited enormously from endorsements by presumptive republican presidential nominee mitt romney and more surprisingly former vice presidential candidate sarah palin widely regarded as the face of the tea party mr hatch nearly won the nomination outright april 26 at the utah republican convention capturing 59 2 percent of the delegate vote and falling just short of the 60 percent needed to avoid a runoff mr liljenquist took second place with 40 8 percent of the vote a poll taken immediately before the utah republican convention showed mr hatch leading mr liljenquist by a margin of 62 percent to 20 percent since then mr liljenquist has picked up some undecided voters but a survey released friday by the deseret news and ksl tv shows mr hatch still ahead by a margin of 60 percent to 32 percent the discrepancy between the two candidates ages mr hatch is 78 and mr liljenquist is 37 meaning he was just 1 year old when the senator won his first term has played less of a role than some analysts had predicted said salt lake city pollster dan jones who conducted the survey that really didn t seem to matter mr jones told the deseret news maybe it s because so many people have religious leaders that age the tea party group freedomworks which was instrumental in mr bennett s defeat ran ads against mr hatch before the convention but has since limited its campaign to mailers and door to door efforts on behalf of mr liljenquist freedomworks political director russ walker said that even if mr hatch wins the relentless attacks on his spending record mean that he s likely to vote as more of a fiscal hawk than he has in the recent past but liljenquist spokeswoman holly richardson isn t so sure hatch is going to be a six year lame duck ms richardson said is he really going to change the habits he s developed over 36 years i doubt it i really doubt it the winner of tuesday s primary will face democrat scott howell a former state senator in heavily republican utah however the winner of the republican senate primary is more or less guaranteed to coast to a general election victory copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view
