beijing ducks last december they ll explain the disappointment and excitement that came with his decision to leave after only two weeks and how he is now trying to return to the nba francis will say that he is all of those things and more deep down he s still the scrawny kid walking up to the takoma park boys and girls club that he was nearly three decades ago he s still the 5 year old who wanted to be the next randall cunningham or tony dorsett but was convinced to give basketball a try i didn t have any tennis shoes at the time so i m just out there on the basketball court messing around francis said from houston and guys are laughing because i don t have shoes he was introduced to anthony langley a basketball coach and mentor at the club who still helps out there langley saw that francis heavy shoes were weighing him down and drove him to a nearby foot locker after practice to pick up a pair of basketball shoes i saw that he was obviously very intelligent very competitive wanted to win everything that he attempted langley said of course nobody could ve foreseen that he would be an nba player francis disagreed he became a regular at the basement basketball court of an old stone firehouse off philadelphia avenue playing pickup games day and night it was on that hardwood floor nestled in a little wooden gym that francis developed what he calls his d c mentality an aggressiveness and determination that vaulted him to nine seasons in the nba even though i wasn t the tallest guy he said i always thought i could be an nba basketball player above all else he s still steve from the neighborhood a chinese rock star it was mid december in beijing and shougang gymnasium was filled to capacity sore and weary eyed from his flight eight hours earlier francis sat on the bench with untied shoelaces and a bag of ice taped to his ankle beijing ducks coach min lulei said that he would rest his new star for at least two days with 17 seconds left the 6 000 people in the stands changed his mind the fans started chanting my name throwing fruit throwing sodas francis said the coach came up to me and said i got to put you in with his shoelaces still untied and the bag of ice still wrapped around his ankle francis was given a standing ovation as he dribbled out the final seconds it was a bizarre beginning to the former nba veteran s brief stint with the ducks francis was treated like a rock star after his time in houston playing alongside yao ming but according to chinese news outlet tom sports he pocketed 800 000 and played less than 14 minutes before returning to the u s his reason for leaving just watching them play and then not playing like 40 minutes a game no disrespect to the players in beijing but i was just looking at the game like if y all want to win why not put me in after an all america campaign in his only season at maryland francis was chosen with the second pick in the 1999 nba draft he averaged 18 1 points and 6 0 assists a game over the course of his nine year career appearing in three all star games two slam dunk contests and sharing rookie of the year honors with elton brand in 2000 the franchise played for eight different coaches traveling from houston to orlando to new york to portland and from there to the waiver wire he wound up back in houston where he made only 10 appearances before season ending knee surgery in 2008 i had tendinitis my whole career he explained jumping and dunking like i dunked for 10 12 years at my height it s eventually going to take a toll on you and i knew that between contracts and buyouts francis earned 103 5 million during his time in the league even when he was sidelined in 2008 sports illustrated pegged him as the 22nd highest earning athlete in the united states without playing a single minute he made 20 3 million more than carmelo anthony no 25 tom brady no 28 and albert pujols no 34 francis was arrested for public drunkenness at los angeles international airport last october then on july 23 tmz com reported that he has been accused of sexually harassing one of the artists signed to his record label the singer 20 year old shauna simien alleged that the two were discussing details of her contract when francis groped her between her legs simien said that she filed a police report in may 2010 but that no charges have been filed according to the report it is what it is you know i can t really do too much about it francis told tmz com last week i m with my wife so if she don t believe it whatever anybody else said is he said she said from basketball to the boardroom lifeguarding francis tweeted in july along with a picture of his children brooklyn 5 and doppie 3 swimming in a backyard pool playing time was only part of the reason he decided to leave china having to raise two kids in a foreign country was another of course my daughter i love her the most he said but my son i look at him like me francis grew up in a low income household with his mother brenda wilson and three siblings his biological father left the family when francis was just 6 then at 18 his mother lost a bout with cancer forcing steve and his 5 year old sister to move in with their grandmother he dropped out of high school stopped playing basketball and as langley put it lost his way i was in a daze man forever francis said i don t even know if i still ever woke up from it experiencing that it was hard today francis spends his time juggling a number of business opportunities but his foundation is at the top of the list founded in 1999 it funds a number of community outreach programs and fundraisers in washington and houston its cornerstone is the brenda wilson scholarship which has distributed more than 350 000 in college scholarships in the past eight years you know sometimes you hear from some of these people who go on to be successful and they kind of forget where they came from that was never steve s philosophy langley said he has always come back home to takoma park and he has always been supportive of the community langley oversees another aspect of francis foundation an aau basketball team based in takoma park called the dc warriors he remembers watching a 14 year old francis sell hundreds of dollars worth of raffle tickets to be able to afford team jerseys now langley and the next generation of takoma park basketball players have nothing to worry about francis continues to fund the dc warriors providing free camps for kids and supplying them with basketball shoes travel bags and a 12 passenger van to travel to tournaments i didn t ask for him to do it he had one of his friends show up with the van and park it in front of my house langley said of course that s the kind of person he s always been very honest very loyal never forgetting his roots francis also centers his business ventures in the d c area he still calls home he always has been a fan of hip hop and decided to seriously pursue that passion in 2000 by starting a record label now called mazerati music he took a more active role in the label after his basketball career began to slow down and now dedicates much of his time to promoting washington hip hop even though he s based in houston steve s whole thing is really to break some major artists in d c francis business manager nate peake said his home base will always be washington d c and he ll never forget that he s never gotten away from that peake also grew up in takoma park and has watched francis transition from player to businessman together they run peake management group a sports management firm that primarily promotes boxing francis became involved with the company as a player and helped promote the mike tyson kevin mcbride fight at verizon center in 2005 he listens and he really does his research on things before he gets into it peake said he s a true professional francis also is a principal owner or investor in a construction company a catering service a clothing line producer and a lawn mowing service he plans on opening a restaurant with fellow maryland star walt williams in college park between phone calls and meetings he still has to find time to spend with his wife shelby and their kids when ranking business basketball and family his priorities are simple family family family yeah my wife doesn t like it all the time he said of his schedule she said as long as a roof is over our heads she s cool that d c mentality francis said he would welcome returning to the nba he s playing three days a week at his personal court in houston while frequently jogging and biking to build up cardio he hopes to resume pickup games in september i think i m doing good now because unfortunately it s a lockout and i have time to not rush myself to be at the top level like i did before i went to china francis said i have time over the summer to really improve myself and try to set up a workout with a team in his chase for the spotlight he s traded dunks for record deals his appearance in china only reinforces this mentality but whether 1 400 miles away in houston or 12 000 miles away in beijing francis hasn t forgotten where he came from i learned how to be a man before i even got to the nba by growing up in washington he said seeing my family struggles here and my friends families struggle and seeing all the violence and stuff that was going on that really helped me play so aggressively it s having that d c mentality like i can t be stopped above all else he s still
