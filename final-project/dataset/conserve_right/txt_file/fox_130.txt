as it considers what to do next about iran aposs saudi attack begin videotape trump we have just sanction the iranian national bank it aposs going to be at the highest level of sanctions corke we aposll see what happens a familiar refrain from president trump when asked with the u s might do next to respond to iran aposs attacks on saudi oil fields iran denies it was behind those attacks in addition to more sanctions the president has authorized sending a battery of u s forces to the region at saudi request esper as the president has made clear the united states does not seek conflict with iran that said we have many other military options available should they be necessary corke the strikes which washington says it can prove came from iran have pushed the regent to the brink for

scott morrison the prime minister of australia as well kevin we aposll see you soon thanks joining me now from new york is the secretary of state mike pompeo mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday pompeo john it aposs great to be with you roberts mr secretary earlier in the week you said of the attack against the saudi oil facilities that it was quote an act of war and you said that iran was definitely behind it when you say something is an act of war does that demand ultimately a military response pompeo well john our mission set has been very clear president trump would like to have a diplomatic solution that aposs the task that aposs in front of us that aposs what we aposve been aiming for for a little over two years now with the strongest sanctions that have ever been put in place against this revolutionary regime and john you know the history forty years of terror from iran it aposs an anti semitic set of leaders that would like to wipe israel and america from the face of the earth our mission set is to avoid war you saw what secretary esper announced on friday we aposre putting additional forces in the region for the purpose of deterrence and defense with our objective to be very clear to support the iranian people so that they can get this regime to cease behaving in a way that is so destructive not only to their own country but to the entire middle east roberts mr secretary there are reports this morning that houthi militants in yemen have warned both saudi arabia and the united states that iran may be planning another attack in saudi arabia is that true pompeo so i aposve certainly seen that reporting and i won apost talk about american intelligence and what we know but suffice it to say we are consistently concerned that iran will continue to behave in the way that it has now for 40 years it did so before the jcpoa it did so during the jcpoa and they continue to act in ways that are inconsistent with our obligations i aposm here this week at the united nations i traveled to jeddah and to abu dhabi this week the whole world understands that iran is the bad actor they are the evil force in the region they are destabilizing in the middle east and i hope this week here in new york the whole world will come together to push back against this and convince the iranian leadership that this behavior is simply unacceptable roberts that may be a tough hill to climb though yes pompeo i think there aposs a handful of countries that are actually supportive of iran and what iran is doing are certainly unwilling to push back but it aposs the case this is the world aposs responsibility to respond from these state on state acts of war that took place in saudi arabia this past week roberts if iran were to launch in the middle of all of this another attack against saudi arabia would the united states have any other option but to respond militarily pompeo john unlike the previous administration we try we do our best to avoid talking about what we will do but the american people should know just like the iranian people should know america is prepared to respond in ways that are consistent with america aposs national security interests our first aim of course is to keep the american people safe and secure and part of that is to make sure that we have all the things in place so that we can do that roberts mr secretary many military and foreign policy experts even members of the president aposs own support group believe that in calling off the retaliatory strike in response to that drone shoot down at the last minute the president signaled to iran that there are no consequences for its malign activities what do you say to that criticism pompeo well first of all there have been consequences real consequences the iranian economy will shrink by between 10 and 15 percent in the year in front of us and we took a handful of actions some of which i can apost talk about here so there were certainly consequences the iranians aren apost looking for a green light the iranians have behaved poorly for 40 years and so it aposs not the case that any particular response has allowed the iranians to think they have freedom to move about the cabin ph i assure you of this the iranian leadership understands four square that president trump will take appropriate action and impose appropriate costs on iran if they continue to act in the way that they aposve done over these past now 40 years roberts you mentioned mr secretary at the beginning of this the sanctions that president trump put on iran on friday he said that there were sanctions at the highest level if these sanctions don apost work what aposs next what aposs left pompeo well they are working john the toughest of the sanctions the essential ban on the iran aposs ability to sell its crude oil around the world took effect only crosstalk pompeo in may of this year roberts but what i mean is if they don apost work if they don apost work to bring iran to the table pompeo as secretary esper said on friday night we aposre prepared to act in ways that are necessary in order to achieve the outcome president trump has very clearly laid out i talked about it a year ago in may we know what the objectives are we simply want iran to behave like a normal nation roberts mr secretary is it possible that if there were a retaliatory military strike against iran that it would be able to be contained or would it as javad zarif and the iranian revolutionary guard council have warned erupt into all out conflagration in the middle east which would likely involve u s bases in the region would likely also possibly involve israel pompeo we aposre certainly deeply aware of the risks that aposs why we want to resolve this in a way that doesn apost resort to kinetic action if it aposs at all possible to achieve that but as for zarif i don apost know why nobody listens to him he has nothing to do with iranian foreign policy he lies all the time we need to make sure that we do the right things to protect and secure america and do our best to provide the resources to the emirates and the saudis who i had a chance to speak to this week on my trip so that they have increased capability to defend themselves and their own people and when we when we do those things i aposm confident that we will have set the conditions for deterrence and if that deterrence should continue to fail i aposm also confident president trump will take the actions that are necessary roberts all right we will see what happens at the united nations general assembly this week i aposll see you there later on today let aposs switch to this whistleblower complaint we still don apost know the exact substance of the complaint but it does seem to revolve around a july 25th conversation the president had with the ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky and we have heard from reporting in the wall street journal that the president asked zelensky about eight times to have the ukraine work with his attorney rudy giuliani to investigate joe biden and his son hunter biden aposs involvement in burisma holdings a ukrainian natural gas company to your mind is that an appropriate conversation for rudy giuliani to be having with ukrainian officials pompeo well john you aposre asking me to comment on an i c ph report i haven apost seen and some reporting i have no idea if that has any foundation whatsoever as for appropriate action i aposve watched the president engage with the ukrainian leadership i listened to conversations i remember the previous administration refusing to send defensive weapon systems to ukraine this president has chosen to do that not once not twice but now three times so that the ukraine people could fight back against the overtaking of southeast ukraine you remember it was the previous administration that allowed vladimir putin to take one fifth of the ukrainian country we aposre going to see president zelensky this week i do hope i do hope that if vice president biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate if he had a conflict of interest or entered ph or allowed something to take place in ukraine which may have interfered in our elections in 2016 i do hope that we get to the bottom of that roberts mr secretary you said that you have not seen the complaint not many people have i assume though that you have seen a transcript of the telephone call that the president had with zelensky should a transcript of that be released to clear the air pompeo i aposll ultimately leave that to the white house but you know john those are private conversations between world leaders and it aposs it aposs not often that those are released and when they aposre done it aposs done when the white house deems it appropriate and i aposll leave whether that should be released to them roberts again i assume that you aposve seen the transcript is it as described in the wall street journal pompeo you know i haven apost seen the wall street journal piece john there aposs a lot going on in the world roberts right the whistleblower complaint reportedly alleges a quid pro quo or a promise made to a foreign leader the wall street journal reports there was no evidence of a quid pro quo in that call with zelensky was there a quid pro quo was there a request to investigate biden and or his son and was that linked to a promise of aid pompeo john i aposve watched this president evaluate how and when and to the extent we should provide support to ukraine both defense assistance and other foreign assistance we aposve been at the center of that those conversations have always been 100 percent appropriate 100 percent lawful and 100 percent ensuring that the american taxpayers were protected that we put those resources to good use and we aposve got good outcomes in ukraine when we used american taxpayer dollars to support the ukrainian leadership every single time john roberts if there was a quid pro quo would that be a problem pompeo john you aposre asking me to provide legal analysis on a hypothetical on a report i haven apost seen come on roberts i mean if an american leader says to a foreign leader we will do this and it might have something to do with usa in exchange for this is that a problem pompeo john it aposs the case we have foreign assistance that is evaluated against american objectives consistently it aposs my duty to protect america by making sure that when foreign assistance is provided to countries that america benefit from that and it aposs completely appropriate to make sure that american taxpayer dollars are used appropriately roberts do believe that there should be an investigation into hunter biden aposs involvement with the ukrainian gas company pompeo i aposll leave that to others but i certainly think it aposs appropriate if there aposs concerns and there aposs enough information to justify looking into it the american people deserve to know if that was handled in an appropriate way by vice president biden roberts just before we go mr secretary are you ruling out a run for the senate from kansas next year pompeo i aposve said the same thing john for a long time as long as president trump is going to have me as secretary of state which i hope is a long time that aposs what i aposm going to continue to do roberts i aposm sure he wants you as secretary of state for a long time i aposm just wondering if you still have aspirations for the senate pompeo it aposs what i want to do too i want to be president trump aposs secretary of state roberts all right secretary pompeo we aposll see you later on in new york pompeo thank you sir roberts thanks for joining us we aposll be following all the action of course at the united nations general assembly next week commercial break roberts interactions between president trump rudy giuliani and the president of ukraine are under scrutiny following reports of a whistle blower complaint claiming that the president urged the ukrainian to investigate the son of former vice president joe biden potentially influencing the 2020 race joining me here live in washington to talk more about this is mr trump aposs personal attorney rudy giuliani rudy welcome back to fox news sunday rudy giuliani attorney for president donald trump how are you how are you john roberts i aposm good thanks for joining us let aposs clear something up first of all giuliani sure roberts let aposs dial the clock back to thursday play this exchange between you and chris cuomo on cnn in which you appeared to at first say you didn apost ask ukraine to investigate joe biden and or his son and then you seemed to change her mind giuliani right roberts listen listen here begin video clip chris cuomo cnn did you to ask the ukraine to investigate joe biden giuliani no actually i didn apost cuomo you never asked anything about hunter biden you never asked anything about joe biden giuliani the only thing i asked about joe biden cuomo and his role with the prosecutor giuliani is to get to the bottom of how it was that lutsenko who was appointed cuomo right giuliani dismissed the case against antac cuomo so you did ask ukraine to look into joe biden giuliani of course i did cuomo you just said you didn apost end video clip roberts all right so which is it did you ask the ukraine did you ask the ukraine did you ask ukraine to look into it or not crosstalk giuliani i clarified it immediately roberts all right giuliani he said to me did you ever talk about joe biden i said no then i said i did say that you should investigate joe biden and hunter biden the no was obviously wrong i corrected it immediately roberts giuliani i corrected it before he corrected it the reality is the distinction is this what they are trying to say is i went there for a political mission to kind of get joe biden in trouble ridiculous i went there as a lawyer defending his client i i have known about this for five months i have been trying to get people to cover this for five months so i knew it would be very very hard to get this out and what i aposm talking about this it aposs ukrainian collusion which was large significant and proven with hillary clinton with the democratic national committee a woman named chalupa with the ambassador with an fbi agent who aposs now been hired by george soros who was funding a lot of it when biden got the prosecutor fired the new prosecutor who biden approved you don apost get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country unless something fishy is going on the new prosecutor dropped the case not just on biden aposs kid and the crooked company that biden aposs kid work for burisma that was done as a matter of record in october of 2016 after the guy got tanked he also dropped the case on george soros apos company called antac antac is the company where there aposs documentary evidence that they were producing false information about trump about biden fusion gps was there go back and listen to nellie ohr aposs testimony nellie ohr says that there was a lot of contract between democrats and the ukraine well i have all the contacts and john when the rest of this comes out and when you look at china and the 1 5 billion that the that the biden family took out of china while that guy was negotiating for us this will be a lot bigger than spiro agnew they have fallen into a trap roberts so you went over there to investigate alleged ukrainian interference in the 2016 election giuliani yes and if i can apost do that i can apost defend a client i roberts all right so when did this morph into an investigation of joe biden and hunter biden and is it appropriate for you as a representative of the president to be going to ukraine and finding dirt on joe biden and or his son to use politically in 2020 giuliani well that aposs the way you characterize it it aposs certainly appropriate roberts that aposs the way it appears to line up giuliani no it doesn apost roberts you went there for one thing you found out something else and that aposs what you have been digging on this crosstalk giuliani that aposs the way the pro biden media lines it up this began with someone coming to me saying this information can clear your client about the corruption in ukraine between the ukraine the democratic party the ambassador and the fbi agent who investigated the case crosstalk roberts but it then but then it morphs into biden giuliani and inextricably combined because biden had the guy fired shokin by the way his statement is on record the lazy press could go read it they don apost have to listen to me there are three videotapes of prosecutors on record available on here that nobody has covered for five months because this town protects joe biden his family has been taking money from his public office for years 1 5 billion from china when our vice president is supposed to be impartially and independently negotiating for us and the kid he takes him on air force two to china and the kid roberts that was in 2013 giuliani yes and the kid unfortunately is a drug addict china didn apost give 1 5 billion to his kid biden aposs kid a recovering drug addict kerry aposs stepson and whitey bulger aposs nephew ladies and gentlemen go look at what the press has been covering up on you can you imagine roberts this is a company called rosemont seneca let me just let me just come back if i could giuliani you got to stop for a second whitey bulger aposs nephew roberts let me just stop for a second giuliani one point five billion coming from china when our vice president laughter roberts mr mayor giuliani that doesn apost shock you roberts let me stop for a second because giuliani i mean how far have we deteriorated roberts let me stop for a second because we are throwing around a lot of ukrainian names that people don apost know about giuliani well that aposs because nobody would ever cover this roberts viktor shokin was a prosecutor back when biden was the vice president he was looking into burisma holdings giuliani right roberts of which hunter biden was on the board of directors giuliani correct roberts there were some allegations that there was some monkey business going on with burisma laughter roberts joe biden joe biden joe biden went over to ukraine in 2016 giuliani right roberts and said that i aposm going to withhold more than a billion dollars in loan guarantees unless you fire this prosecutor joe biden talked about that in 2018 let aposs roll that giuliani right laughter begin video clip biden i said i aposm telling you you aposre not getting the billion dollars i said you aposre not getting the billion i aposm going to be leaving here and i think it was what six hours i look at it i said we aposre leaving in six hours if the prosecutor is not fired you aposre not getting the money end video clip roberts but shokin had been heavily criticized for corruption and it was the united states and a number of other western countries who said giuliani so is everybody in the ukraine roberts he needs to go giuliani more relevant roberts so was this tied to hunter biden or was this the united states saying you have got a bad actor there because he was accused of corruption in his office and other countries in the west were saying he needs to go as well giuliani what does it matter if the if the son is under investigation he didn apost disclose that doesn apost the thing strike you i mean it is so warped doesn apost it strike you as strange that he would tell that story and not mention to you that his son aposs company was the major defendant in the investigation the guy who was carrying on do you i happen to know and i have seen the records do you know why he was fired do you know how the kid was paid three million dollars goes from ukraine to cyprus i aposm sorry ukraine to latvia latvia to cyprus cyprus to rosemont seneca i have seen each one of the wires when that prosecutor shokin subpoenaed cyprus he got a response i have the record they gave him all the information but two people hunter biden and john kerry aposs stepson i aposm sorry john kerry aposs speechwriter who was the best friend of his stepson roberts the prosecutor who followed giuliani when that happened joe biden knew that they were zeroing in on hunter and he went over there and he got him fired and the next day people showed up and they started on getting the case for the kid dismissed as well as the case for soros and that aposs what brings me into it roberts now the prosecutor the prosecutor giuliani no you got to let me finish roberts ok giuliani he said i went there to get dirt on joe biden do you know when i found out about joe biden do know what i told my colleague they are going to cover this up too bad biden is involved in this i got a nice straight case of ukrainian collusion the minute i say biden that washington press corps is going to go nuts they have been covering up for years china plagiarism roberts ok ok all right now you aposre straying into areas of opinion as opposed to fact giuliani no i aposm not i aposm straying into what is wrong with us today and the unfairness roberts we need to point out we need to point out that yuriy lutsenko who was the prosecutor who was appointed after shokin was fire giuliani approved by roberts resurrected reanimated the case and found that hunter biden was in fact paid millions of dollars but lutsenko said that the board of burisma was able to pay a board member whatever they wanted and he didn apost see anything wrong with that giuliani john how is the coverage so distorted roberts i aposm just pointing out a fact giuliani if you did any work you would find out lutsenko is the prosecutor that biden put in there aposs a newspaper article in which biden approves lutsenko when he aposs appointed doesn apost that strike you as odd that the vice president would approve a particular prosecutor did you ever bother to look crosstalk giuliani let me finish roberts one other point we need to make here before we go giuliani no no no i want answer another question unless you let me finish this is really unfair these are very important things that have been covered up for years to protect slimy joe the reality is that there are three other prosecutors where all you have to do is go online three others that say that this was done precisely to get rid of biden to cover up hunter and to cover up soros i will give you their names one of them is kulik konstantin kulik the other is shokin himself and the third one is a prosecutor by the name of inazdir ph they are present officials three of them were officials one is still an official of the ukrainian government if you bothered to look you could listen to them on tape telling you that now they may all be lying but lutsenko may be lying also but it aposs 3 1 roberts one more point we got to make giuliani and lutsenko is biden aposs chosen prosecutor roberts ok you have made your point one more point to make we need to make giuliani you will also find there is a great deal of suspicion roberts yes joe biden yesterday told our peter joe biden told our peter doocy yesterday that he never discussed overseas business with his son hunter giuliani do you believe that roberts i don apost know do you believe that giuliani i aposm flying my son to china how long is the flight to china roberts its a while giuliani fifteen hours 16 hours 17 i aposm flying my son to china on air force two i aposm going to negotiate with the chinese to help america my son is going there to negotiate to help the biden family when he comes back and eight days later the kid gets a billion dollars in his ridiculous private equity fund run by a recovering drug addict somebody connected to the vice president of the united states and somebody connected to the biggest gangster in america wait a second the son doesn apost say to him i got a billion dollars by the way you see what joe said it aposs contradicted by the son the son said i talked to my father about it how about this there was an article on december 9 of 2015 in the new york times raising holy hell about biden aposs son being on the board of the most corrupt company in ukraine and how strange it looked i don apost know if joe reads the newspapers but somebody must have read that to him and finally if joe didn apost know what his son was doing abroad how may conflicts are there this guy was flying blind i don apost know did he get money from russia did he get money from cuba was he doing business in venezuela you aposre telling me that the vice president of the united states was there for eight years his son is going around the world taking millions from some adversary of the united states roberts yes giuliani don apost say yes this is important roberts no no we have i aposm saying we have got to go giuliani this is about the only time i have gotten to point out a tremendously large scandal that affects the american people and it aposs your job to do it not just mine i aposm doing it to defend my client roberts we are out of time giuliani but you aposre telling me that he had no system with his son to check on conflicts so we know of two we know there aposs a big conflict with ukraine we know there is a big conflict with china since joe says and is apparently selling the swamp media on the fact that he didn apost know well joe how many more conflicts are there venezuela cuba roberts you have mentioned that we have got to leave it mr mayor we are giuliani one point five billion is enough for most people to get investigated roberts we are out of time for this morning but clearly we are going to keep looking into this giuliani and this is going to get bigger and bigger and everything i say i can prove roberts rudy thanks so much for being with us giuliani take me on roberts all right appreciate it coming up we will get reaction to the president aposs iran policy with the top democrat on the foreign relations committee senator ben cardin joins us here next commercial break roberts coming up president trump authorizes new economic penalties on iran begin video clip trump we have just sanctioned the iranian national bank it aposs going to be at the highest level of sanctions end video clip roberts we aposll ask our sunday panel whether the move will bring tehran back to the negotiating table next commercial break roberts as the united states boosts its defenses in the middle east after blaming iran for the attacks on saudi oil facilities the islamic regime says it aposs ready for any scenario joining me here in washington senator ben cardin a top democrat on the foreign relations committee senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen ben cardin d md john it aposs great to be with you thank you roberts so the u s is sending more troops and defensive weapons to saudi arabia and the united arab emirates to counter the threat coming from iran your thoughts about sending more men and material there cardin john this is a very dangerous situation there could easily be a miscalculation the temperature couldn apost be harder between the united states and iran our job is to isolate iran iran is the bad actor and what the president needs to do is get an international coalition to continue to work against iran aposs support of terrorism the challenge of course is because as the united states has been isolated when the president withdrew from the iran nuclear agreement so we aposre having difficulty with our european allies to get the type of support we need but we have to isolate iran roberts there are reports that from the houthis apparently to saudi arabia and to the united states i don apost know if you saw my question to the secretary of state that iran is planning another attack in saudi arabia if iran were in the middle of all of this launch another attack at saudi arabia would that demand a military response cardin there aposs really not a military solution to the problem of iran we need to make diplomacy work clearly there could be a miscalculation we have to defend ourselves no question about that but we have to reduce the temp where we are where we could have this miscalculation it would be disastrous if we got into a fighting war in iran it will have consequences throughout the entire region it aposs not in our national security interests roberts all right so we aposve got the united states ramping up sanctions on iran withdrawing from the jcpoa which you yourself didn apost didn apost vote for and iran is countering by shooting down american drones firing missiles and launching drones at saudi oil facilities i mean they are in a shooting war so is is this is this i mean if you let somebody fire at you and you don apost shoot back are you not showing weakness cardin well john here here aposs the fault of the trump policies before we withdrew from the iran nuclear agreements there were conversations with the europeans about strengthening the sanctions against iran for the non nuclear violations we could have had that international support and tightens the economic pressure against iran but still stay within the nuclear agreement by pulling out of the nuclear agreement it aposs the view of europe that this is an american problem rather than an international problem roberts but but you know the arguments this president said look it covers the nuclear but it there aposs a sunset clause to it of a decade which isn apost much when you look at you know the history of nuclear development but it also does not do anything to reign in iran aposs malign activities i pointed out you yourself did not vote for the jcpoa because you were worried about future uranium enrichment so why stay in a bad deal cardin no i agree with that analysis but the way to fix it is to work with europe work with our partners to deal with the non nuclear violations strengths the sanctions against iran on the non nuclear side make sure they stay in compliance with the nuclear obligations they were in compliance with the nuclear obligations when the united states pulled out the bottom line is we made the we isolated the united states rather than isolating iran and iran is the bad actor there aposs no question about it we don apost know what they aposre going to do but we certainly need the support of our international partners roberts but how serious is iran about the jcpoa the united states pulled out there is still five signatories to it yet iran is violating the agreement cardin well the issue is iran we don apost know how iran aposs calculating this but we do know that the u s sanctions is having a major impact on their economy so the benefits they thought they were going to get under the nuclear agreement they aposre no longer getting roberts right cardin that aposs causing them to recalculate roberts for the moment president trump says he aposs showing restraint about iran he aposs got people like secretary pompeo saying it aposs an act of war others are pointing fingers like mark esper and pompeo at iran the president saying i aposm going to sit back and wait and see how this plays out listen to what he said in the oval office the other day begin video clip donald trump president i think the strong person aposs approach and the thing that does show strength would be showing a little bit of restraint much easier to do it the the other way it aposs much easier and iran knows if they misbehave they aposre on borrowed time end video clip roberts so you aposve got the president aposs aides on the one hand saying act of war iran aposs responsible the president saying i aposm waiting and seeing her he aposs leaving the door open to negotiation even amidst all this tough talk could that be a good strategy to try to bring them to the table cardin i think it aposs an important week with all the world leaders most of the world leaders meeting up in new york for the opening of the general assembly of the united nations i hope that we can get that type of unity with the international community in regards to iran so that the military option is not the right option i agree with secretary pompeo that diplomacy should be the way we proceed i agree with that and hopefully this week we can get the type of support in new york to make a difference in the calculation by iran so that they stop these horrible things what they aposre doing is horrible we can apost let them continue to do that roberts let me switch to this intelligence committee inspector general whistle blower report the wall street journal reported on friday that the president had a conversation with volodymyr zelensky the ukrainian president in which he about eight times pressured zelensky to have ukraine work with rudy giuliani to look into joe biden the ukrainian foreign minister vadym prystaiko said today quote i know what the conversation was about and i think there was no pressure so you have democrats on the one side calling for the president aposs impeachment over this and then you have the ukrainian foreign minister saying i don apost see any pressure cardin i think we need to know what happened the allegations are that the president used the power of his office for partisan political purposes jeopardizing the national security of the united states by withholding aid to ukraine one of our key strategic partners that roberts nobody aposs made the connection about aid yet we don apost even know what this thing aposs about cardin we we at least there aposs been some reports that there was 250 million that were held up ultimately was released roberts i think people have connected the dots but i don apost think we aposve got anything really to back that up cardin well that aposs what let aposs find out let aposs let aposs find let aposs have transparency here we can easily find that out if information about those phone calls would be released and we could see exactly what aposs involved but the president has chosen at least to date not to release that information these are serious allegations let aposs find out i i i don apost want to reach a conclusion i aposm just suggesting to you that an allegation that the president used his political office for partisan reasons jeopardizing our national security we need to get to the facts roberts is there a case to be made to launch an investigation into joe biden and his son hunter biden aposs their involvement in ukraine let aposs listen to what the president said and what joe biden said the other day begin video clip trump somebody ought to look into joe biden aposs statement because it was disgraceful where he talked about billions of dollars that he is not giving to a certain country less a certain prosecutor is taken off the case biden not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion not one single one and so i have no comment except the president should start to inaudible end video clip roberts now in fact a lot of credible news organizations including the new york times have been looking into this ken vogel who aposs the reporter who wrote about it and here aposs the article back in may said on friday that there aposs this could be a significant issue for joe biden and that there aposs more there cardin well well john i know what happened in 2015 with the prosecutor the international community needed that prosecutor to leave congress wanted that prosecutor to leave corruption was the center problem we had with ukraine maintaining our coalition against russia for with sanctions and we had to deal with the corrupt issues and the prosecutor was in the center of that so that that was a policy that we wanted to implement joe biden aposs issue has been looked at for a long time there aposs been findings that there is no improper involvement this is a distraction by the president of the united states to distract from his most recent situation roberts you don apost want to prejudge the situation with the president and his whistle blower but a lot of your democratic colleagues are already making the leap to impeachment is that going too far cardin i i think you need to get the facts i don apost think you should you know the impeachment process is a way in which congress exercises its responsibility checks and balances in our system but you can apost act on that type of a remedy until you have the facts so let aposs get the facts first roberts senator cardin always good to see you cardin nice to be with you roberts thanks so much for coming in coming up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the prospects of a showdown between the united states and iran commercial break begin video clip mike pompeo secretary of state i think it aposs abundantly clear and there is an enormous consensus in the region that we know precisely who conducted these attacks it was iran nick paton walsh cnn correspondent what would be the consequence of an american or a saudi military strike on iran now mohammad javad zarif iranian foreign minister an all out war end video clip roberts the top diplomats from this country and iran in a war of words this week over the fallout from the attacks on saudi arabia aposs oil industry and its time now for our sunday group jonah goldberg for the national review fox news political analyst juan williams susan page of usa today and matthew continetti founding editor of the washington free beacon are we going to war susan with iran susan page usa today well judging from your interview with secretary of state pompeo i aposd say probably not he you asked them if it aposs an active war does that demand a military response and he repeatedly denied declined to say yes and judging from what the president did in june after the american drone was shot down and he backed away from a military strike i think the odds are against us taking military action in this case roberts the fact that he backed away from that strike does that mean that he cannot take military action matthew continetti washington free beacon no i mean he could take military action at any time he aposs the commander in chief what we aposre seeing though is that the maximum pressure campaign of the trump administration has met maximum resistance from the iranian regime and the cyber operations and the economic warfare that the trump white house has been waging against iran has yet to deter them from their malign behavior in the region but that status quo is something i think the president prefers to all out war roberts right it the congress is saying he aposs got to come to congress for an authorization to use military force against iran first of all does he have to and if he went to congress would he get it jonah goldberg national review it depends i think we would need more provocation than what we have seen i aposm sort of a purist on this kind of stuff i do think that you should go to congress unless it aposs in response to an immediate and urgent national security thing then it congress has the has the sole authority to authorize war but we aposve seen that eroded so much over the last 50 years like so many other congressional prerogatives that i think it aposs anybody aposs guess juan williams political analyst i think john based on your question you can tell there aposs no clear end game in sight what we know is the president says he doesn apost want war there but he aposs previously also said we aposre locked and loaded and what was incredible to me was to hear him say that he aposs waiting for guidance to come from the saudis now the iranians are no friends of ours but gosh the saudis i don apost know if they aposre a reliable and trustworthy regime they kill american journalists 9 11 is not to be forgotten roberts and here aposs another argument that people made the united states has sold saudi arabia and the president made a big deal of this billions of dollars in military equipment can apost the saudis handle this themselves page and well i guess we aposre going to find out i mean we aposre making this gesture to saudi arabia with a very limited deployment but but yes saudi arabia has a lot of defensive abilities a lot of it provided by the united states helped by the united states williams but i think the key point here is iran has denied responsibility but we have no reason to trust that they are not responsible or at least supporting the houthi rebels that did this but the point from the american political perspective is we are still trying to get out of afghanistan there is no appetite in his country for starting another war without a clear end game in sight and the president has not provided that continetti and the president aposs policy it reflects exactly that attitude though williams right we all know what we aposre doing ph page and the president aposs base doesn apost back it either ph continetti he doesn apost want to get involved either what aposs remarkable here for 70 years plus the united states has guaranteed the free flow of oil from the persian gulf that is ending at its ending because of fracking roberts let aposs get on to the whistle blower issue here president trump he was leaving for houston a short time ago he said this about his conversation with volodymyr zelensky the president of the ukraine back on july 25th listen begin video clip trump the conversation i had with the president of ukraine was absolutely perfect and people better find out who these people are that are trying to subvert our country because here we go again these are bad people but the conversation i had with the president of ukraine was absolutely a ten end video clip roberts so it was a ten is there anything wrong with the president saying to the president of the ukraine look why don apost you work with rudy giuliani and investigate what ties joe biden and hunter biden have to ukrainian natural gas companies page yes it aposs soliciting foreign help in your campaign for re election for president of the united states and it aposs something that i think people would generally find alarming roberts now the ukraine helped hillary clinton so goldberg yes ok look i mean we aposve got to separate a whole bunch of things here the idea you know people who are you know president trump has has some weird messaging on this on the one hand he says it aposs all made up and fake news on the other hand he says he was spied on which would suggest that in fact the allegations are true rudy giuliani comes on air today and take great umbrage at the accusation or insinuation that he aposs a political hit man and then he spends the next seven minutes like the one of the biggest political hit men i aposve ever seen it could be i don apost i think there aposs a lot of smoke and and bluster going on in what giuliani is doing it could all be true if the president of the united states tried to bend national security based upon his own partisan self interest that would be very very very bad and the people who say he aposs just interested in corruption this seems to be the only corruption case in the world he aposs concerned about is the one about the guy who aposs beating him by ten points in the polls roberts the washington examiner had an article this morning that suggested that the whistle blower does not have firsthand knowledge of any of this but the point is is that if you aposre going to investigate the president and there are 9 573 investigations of the president going on right now should you not also investigate the person who might become president continetti a lot of conversations in washington over the last 48 hours have begun with the word if and the fact is we don apost know and so i think the advocates of impeachment in this case carry a heavy burden john one is that with the russian investigation there was a whole lot of misreporting and factual inaccuracy in the actual reporting two when the mueller report came out it did not provide the data that democrats wanted to impeach and third all of these charges as illustrated in rudy giuliani aposs interview with you have the potential to boomerang on the democratic party roberts all right so let me ask you about the democratic party juan you heard ben cardin say he doesn apost want to prejudge anything he wants the information he wants to see this you aposve got alexandria ocasio cortez you aposve got elizabeth warren you aposve got a myriad of other democrats not even waiting for a shred of evidence here they aposre looking at reporting and saying impeach him off with his head i mean should they not wait do they not have a responsibility to wait until we know some facts here before we got down the impeachment road williams yes i think everyone should wait but remember there aposs no reason to wait on the transcript if as the president describes it nothing untoward took place why is it that the administration is making such an effort to obstruct the congress from getting that transcript what we know is roberts it aposs not the transcript that they aposre not holding back williams well roberts it aposs the complaint williams well the complaint the transcript the whole thing if because the transcript goes beyond the complaint which is why i said transcript but the idea is that this administration has through the justice department stop what is the law the law says that if you have an urgent complaint the inspector general of the director of national intelligence would transfer that to the congress it aposs not going on that is wrong goldberg previous presidents have also disputed the idea that the president has an obligation by the by statute to do that it aposs a it aposs a murky constitutional issue page the one democrat we haven apost heard from calling for impeachment is the one democrat who counts speaker nancy pelosi she set a standard that we need to hear republicans be outraged by the president aposs behavior not just democrats and so far we haven apost heard that roberts fifteen seconds continetti we aposll be waiting for a long time roberts yes fifteen seconds should the transcript be released williams of course continetti i think if it exculpates trump they should release it but there is the issue of executive privilege here governing foreign communications which also needs to be respected williams if this was obama house republicans would have roberts we aposve got to go thanks juan see you next sunday by the way coming up next our power player of the week denzel washington and the club he says made him the man he is
