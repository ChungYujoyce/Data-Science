no interest in engaging in a new conflict in the middle east however we will defend our interests in a statement from its u n mission iran accused the u s of escalating tensions the u s economic war

t damaged by mines company president yutaka katada offered no evidence for his claim which contradicted the u s military account katada also said crew members saw an iranian naval ship nearby but did

thursday s attack resembled one in may that targeted four oil tankers off the nearby emirati port of fujairah u s officials similarly accused iran of using limpet mines u s secretary of state mike pompeo said the u s assessment of iran s involvement was based in part on intelligence as well as the expertise needed for the operation it was also based on recent incidents including the fujairah attack he said he also tied iran to a drone attack by yemen s houthi rebels on a crucial saudi oil pipeline around the same time taken as a whole these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security a blatant assault on the freedom of navigation and an unacceptable campaign of escalating tension by iran pompeo said he didn t elaborate iran also denied being involved in last month s attacks its foreign minister questioned the timing of thursday s incidents given that japanese prime minister shinzo abe was meeting supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei in tehran pompeo noted that abe had asked iran to enter into talks with washington but tehran rejected the overture the supreme leader s government then insulted japan by attacking a japanese owned oil tanker just outside iranian waters threatening the lives of the entire crew creating a maritime emergency pompeo added on friday abe condemned the attack as a threat to safe navigation abe told reporters he briefed trump by phone on his trip to iran but did not give details except to say the president thanked him for trying to help de escalate tensions in the region and that he planned to continue cooperating closely with the u s the u n security council held closed consultations on the tanker incidents late thursday at the request of the u s but took no action tensions have risen as iran appears poised to break the nuclear deal which trump repudiated last year in the deal tehran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of crippling sanctions now iran is threatening to resume enriching uranium closer to weapons grade levels if european nations don t offer it new terms to the deal by july 7 already iran says it quadrupled its production of low enriched uranium meanwhile u s sanctions have cut off opportunities for iran to trade its excess uranium and heavy water abroad putting tehran on course to violate terms of the nuclear deal regardless meanwhile saudi arabia said friday its military intercepted five drones launched by houthi rebels targeting the kingdom including the abha regional airport the kingdom said a similar attack wednesday
