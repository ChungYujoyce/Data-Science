apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic seoul the two former top u s negotiators in talks that melted down with north korea in 2009 have some sobering advice for north korean leader kim jong un ahead of his second summit with president trump don t blow this special chance stop foot dragging get specific about the denuclearization steps you re actually going to take and be ready to clarify what you really want in exchange for abandoning your nukes that s the message former ambassadors christopher r hill and joseph detrani offered in successive speeches at a conference this weekend in south korea s capital where the high stakes of the trump kim summit slated for vietnam at the end of the month took center stage it is very unusual for any country to have two summits with the american president said mr hill who was the lead u s diplomat in multiparty talks with pyongyang during the george w bush and barack obama administrations top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches as they come to vietnam it s time to get down to work said mr hill i would suggest that north korea start talking about the list of what their nuclear programs are and what order they would like to see these nuclear programs taken away mr detrani a former cia official who served as the state department s special envoy for north korea talks before their collapse nearly a decade ago offered a similar take suggesting a lack of specific movement on denuclearization during the months since mr trump and mr kim met in june in singapore has been frustrating there s going to have to be some heavy lifting there s going to have to be some details put on the table because i don t think anyone is going to be patient and say let s wait another six months and wait for another heads of state meeting he said there needs to be some movement and the movement has to be on the core issue which is complete verifiable irreversible dismantlement of all nuclear weapons nuclear weapons facilities which include plutonium and highly enriched uranium the straight ahead messaging from two former officials who know what it s like to negotiate with the north koreans comes as speculation and momentum mount ahead of the summit in hanoi u s special representative for north korea stephen e biegun the working level negotiator in the role mr detrani held years ago spent much of last week on a rare visit to pyongyang in talks with his north korean counterpart preparing for the summit our discussions were productive mr biegun said during a subsequent meeting with south korean foreign minister kang kyung wha in seoul according to the associated press while he said there is hard work to do before mr trump and mr kim meet other u s officials said mr biegun is slated to hold another working level round with the north koreans before the summit but regional experts warn that time is increasingly short for serious pre negotiations to unfold and wariness has grown that mr kim aims to strike a deal directly with mr trump for interim sanctions relief in exchange for something far less than a total dismantlement of the north korean nuclear arsenal mr biegun and other top trump advisers have said they are committed to keeping sanctions pressure on north korea until it irreversibly denuclearizes but private analysts have expressed concern the president may concede to some form of relief if mr kim agrees to abandon ballistic missiles that pose a direct threat to the u s homeland the korea times an english language newspaper in seoul reported saturday that mr biegun and a team he brought to pyongyang last week focused their efforts on pushing for the dismantlement of the north s intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms something u s intelligence has long expressed concern about given the prospect such missiles could be mounted with nuclear warheads capable of targeting u s cities while the report claimed that the u s officials also pushed for the complete closure of the north s yongbyon nuclear facility the korea times cited an unnamed source as saying that among washington s demands was for pyongyang to list its icbm developers that the missile program may be a focus of working level talks suggests that mr biegun s team could be seeking a small breakthrough to be announced when mr trump and mr kim meet but it s unclear whether the north koreans will be willing to commit to anything verifiable particularly with regard to any major denuclearization steps ultimately being sought by washington at their singapore summit in june mr trump and mr kim inked a broadly worded statement agreeing to pursue the total denuclearization of the korean peninsula it s not one sided mr hill said saturday that without specific steps and a clear timeline talk of total denuclearization is just talk for the north koreans to talk about denuclearization without a time frame is almost to me talking about it in a kind of biblical sense that is at the end of the world they ll consider denuclearization he said that s not going to work for any american president it s important in talking about denuclearization they begin to show some denuclearization added mr hill who was u s ambassador to south korea before serving as assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs during the bush and obama years he and mr detrani spoke alongside other former u s officials and political leaders as well as several leading south korean experts on north korea at a conference hosted by the washington times and segye ilbo a seoul based newspaper the event was attended by a range of high level south korean officials including prime minister lee nak yon mr detrani said the north koreans need to be prepared to present a list of all of their facilities nuclear weapons and the personnel who ve worked on these issues this is not to mention the establishment of a verification regime that s very comprehensive that permits nuclear monitors to visit non declared suspect nuclear sites he said suggesting that the likelihood is high for an escalation of u s north korea tensions without a breakthrough at the summit that could mean a swift return to the tension that gripped both sides after pyongyang hurled rhetorical threats at the u s and south korea in 2017 and carried out its sixth nuclear bomb test nuclear test a period that also saw mr trump threaten to rain fire and fury like the world has never seen on north korea if it did not halt its provocations i can assure you if we don t succeed now at this important inflection point the possibility of going back to maximum pressure and fire and fury is real and we know the potential consequences of going back to that policy mr detrani said at the same time he said the u s has to be prepared to get serious about what concessions it is willing to make if mr kim comes through with verifiable denuclearization steps it s not one sided mr detrani said for the north koreans to denuclearize in a comprehensive way that s a very major strategic decision on their part we have to be prepared to put things on the table and i think what we re going to see with president donald trump is we are prepared to have actions for actions we will reciprocate it doesn t mean we re going forgo sanctions he said but there are many other things that can be done on the immediate front the u s could consider opening a liaison office in pyongyang agreeing to a formal declaration ending the korean war something north korea has been seeking for some time and perhaps inking a formal non aggression pact to be signed by mr trump and mr kim mr detrani said on the north korean side mr hill said pyongyang must seize the moment to clarify what exactly that it wants from washington i would suggest if i were the north koreans and if i were concerned about sanctions i d be talking about what are the sanctions that the u s might be prepared to relax in the context of denuclearization he said meanwhile south korea and the u s struck a new deal sunday that increases seoul s contribution for the cost of the american military presence on its soil overcoming previous failed negotiations that caused worries about their decades long alliance the associated press reported south korea last year provided about 830 million covering roughly 40 percent of the cost of the deployment of 28 500 u s soldiers whose presence is meant to deter aggression from north korea mr trump has pushed for south korea to pay more on sunday chief negotiators from the two countries signed a new cost sharing plan which requires south korea to pay about 924 million in 2019 seoul s foreign
