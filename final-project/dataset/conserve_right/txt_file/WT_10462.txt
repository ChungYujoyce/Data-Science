apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic nuclear cut review the obama administration has been secretly working on a review of u s nuclear weapons in what officials say is part of the white house effort to make deeper cuts on strategic nuclear forces the administration has made up its mind that they want to go lower and the only way to go lower is to change the military requirements for how many weapons are needed said a u s official familiar with the review top stories ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk the review has been dubbed a mini npr after the nuclear posture review conducted last year that coincided with lame duck senate approval in december of the new start treaty which calls for cutting nuclear arms to 5 000 warheads pentagon and u s strategic command spokesmen had no immediate comment the mini npr is now looking for even lower levels raising new concerns among national security officials about whether the united states will be able to deter china s growing and largely secret nuclear forces or a revanchist russia that is also bolstering its arsenal administration officials have made references to the nuclear weapons cutting effort in recent weeks among them were rose gottemoeller assistant secretary of state for verification she said at a conference on deterrence in august that the united states has made it clear that we are committed to continuing a step by step process to reduce the overall number of nuclear weapons including through a possible agreement with russia that would cover all types of nuclear arms strategic tactical and deployed and non deployed gary samore white house arms control coordinator said in may that the review of nuclear arms was under way we ll need to do a strategic review of what our force requirements are and then based on that the president will have options available for additional reductions he told arms control today that review is ongoing mr samore noted that the review is taking time because we ve reached the level in our forces where further reductions will raise questions about whether we retain the triad or whether we go to a system that only is a dyad the current triad strategic force consists of three types of delivery systems land based missiles bombers and submarine missiles it is not known which delivery system would be placed on the chopping block under the mini npr mr samore noted that if there is no agreement or treaty for the next nuclear cuts even unilateral cuts are being considered north korean counterfeits new details of north korea s counterfeiting of u s currency were outlined in a recently released state department cable the july 6 2007 dispatch labeled secret said the u s government was concerned about north korean efforts to buy equipment and technology used in producing counterfeit u s currency north korea has approached drent goebel of germany to purchase an intaglio press capable of counterfeiting u s currency the cable said the u s has repeatedly warned both germany and drent goebel that north korea could use this equipment to produce counterfeit u s currency german officials promised to block the currency press sale to pyongyang the secret service according to the cable has evidence that the north koreans continue to produce and distribute counterfeit u s currency over the past several years the u s secret service has implemented an aggressive campaign to stop the counterfeiting of u s currency by north korea through disruptions in the supply of materials and equipment used to produce counterfeit u s currency the cable said it noted that the north koreans were linked to the production and distribution of high quality counterfeit 100 bills called supernotes these counterfeit banknotes are produced in the same manner as u s currency utilizing similar processes and materials as u s currency the cable said also noted was the fact that the justice department had indicted irish national sean garland on charges of collaborating with north koreans in making supernote forgeries the cable said u s concerns were based on indications that north korea tried to buy the currency production gear from drent goebel in late 2006 and that north korea s central bank tried to buy currency paper manufacturing equipment from the german company both sets of equipment are suitable for the production of counterfeit u s currency possibly including supernotes the cable said since the cable u s and diplomatic officials in washington have revealed that north korean government counterfeiting is directed by gen o kuk ryol a confidant of north korean leader kim jong il north korean supernotes were discovered in las vegas in 2008 in pusan south korea in 2009 and earlier in the philippines the supernotes are made on a high quality currency printing press identified at the pyongsong trademark printing factory in north korea run by the operations department of the korean workers party which is headed by gen o white house spin washington news reporters are well versed in the ways of political spin but rarely has an example surfaced so clearly than in the recent white house handling of its contentious decision not to sell new f 16 c d model jets to taiwan the insider nelson report newsletter written by former hill staffer chris nelson reported on friday that it has passed on unofficial administration requests not to write about the f 16 a b decision as an explicit no to c ds rather we have been repeatedly urged please make clear that the decision should be seen as about a b retrofitting only and not a no on c ds mr nelson stated further that we ve been repeatedly requested don t write something which seems to rule out administration consideration of c d s at some point even if not necessarily before the end of this year that spin was reflected in saturday report in new york times often described by critics as a house organ for the administration that stated the president has not ruled out selling the new f 16s an administration official then briefed reporters on tuesday at new york s waldorf astoria hotel where president obama was staying for the u n general assembly and we re obviously prepared to consider further sales in the future the official said the reality according to a senior administration official is that the sale of c d jets was blocked by the president at the urging of national security adviser thomas e donilon who was advised to do so by nsc staff aides daniel r russel and evan s medeiros amid concerns that new jet sales would upset china the administration announced on
