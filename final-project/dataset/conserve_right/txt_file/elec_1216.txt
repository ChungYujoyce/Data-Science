calling a leftist political agitator conducting an organized disruption of a donald trump rally a protester is like calling a carjacker a transportation facilitator rosa parks was a protester the trump rally disrupters are thuggish enforcers and it s time republicans stop blaming the victim when the thugs show up for the cameras by a planned coordinated chorus of shouting chanting and provocative physical obstructions these thugs are not affirming anyone s rights they are enforcing the canons of political correctness as currently taught in our universities condoned by the mass media and too often excused by short sighted politicians too willing to score cheap shots at the expense of vital principles candidate donald trump is the number one target today because he is leading the parade but it was me yesterday and it may be you or your favorite candidate tomorrow a few years ago while still in congress i had been invited by the college young republicans tospeak on the campus of the university of north carolina chapelhill as i watch what is happening at trump rallies i am reminded of my own experiences and the thought that i have never seen a group of conservative students or adults pull the same violent crap on liberal speakers only the left is so frightened of ideas these totalitarians who disrupt peaceful assembly should be charged with hate crimes as i have never heard more vile hate filled language than that which spews from their mouths i been been a vocal supporter of ted cruz but i am ashamed of how he was so quick to join the group think chorus in blaming trump s language for inviting and inciting the protesters why are so many republicans willing to allow pc thugs to become the arbiters of acceptable taste and language in political speech do they really think the thuggery is aimed only at trump s language and not his ideas or do they care about such distinctions the planning for the organized disruption of candidate trump s public events began the day he launched his campaign by attacking illegal immigration and open borders and the disruptions began as soon as he became the presumed winner of the republican nomination turning the 2016 election into a referendum on trump s persona instead of hillary s dishonesty and obama s legacy is a cornerstone of democrat strategy do you think any self respecting progressive would waste his time disrupting a kasich rally or mitt romney why bother the left only targets its mortal enemies not useful idiots who parrot the pc line on cultural diversity the religion of peace and open borders politics please let us know if you re having issues with commenting copyright 2020 breitbart
