years ago at this time thought he d be the one sitting in the white house instead he s back in the senate newly re elected to a six year term and deploying his considerable legal mind in the defense of his former nemesis his office has been running a war room and issuing fact checks to poke at the democrats case while mr cruz himself has been holding press conferences making the rounds of television and radio and recording a new hit podcast the verdict where he delivers a withering critique of the impeachment top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role

and jerrold nadler democrats impeachment maestros even if he doesn t get to ask the questions himself that role will be played by chief justice john g roberts jr no senator has a better understanding of the constitution and the law in this area than senator cruz does says ron nehring who worked for mr cruz s 2016 presidential campaign and his 2018 senate re election bid it turns out a lot of people are eager to hear what he has to say his podcast which launched a week ago as the impeachment trial began now tops the charts as the most popular show on apple s itunes the joe rogan experience where host joe rogan just made news with his controversial endorsement of sen bernard sanders in the democratic primary is in second place mr cruz makes a half hour episode well worth the investment saturday s installment saw mr cruz confirm reports that gop senators were angered by mr schiff claiming the white house promised retribution on any republican who defied the president mr cruz said he heard some senators on the floor booing mr schiff for the claim that was an interesting moment that stuck with people he said the senator also reported on speculation among republicans that democrats have turned on former vice president joseph r biden who had been their leading presidential candidate which he said is one reason the house impeachment team has thrown biden under the bus by focusing so much on ukrainian corruption i don t know the theory is right but it was a significant topic of conversation around the dinner table mr cruz said as for the legal arguments mr cruz laid out how he would attack the case against the president his advice don t let mr biden off the hook those in the white house have noticed mr cruz s firm backing and are appreciative he s gone out of his way to be a team player said one official they are also aware though it s more than just a good legal scholar at work on their behalf he s running for president the official told the washington times he s got to make peace with the trump wing and this is it that mr cruz is backing mr trump at all much less emerging as such a fierce and formidable defender would have seemed shocking to anyone who d just watched the gop presidential primary four years ago mr trump emerged victorious after such lowlights as suggesting mr cruz s father was involved in killing president kennedy mr cruz also believes mr trump planted a fabricated story about multiple affairs in the national enquirer a publication that was doing mr trump s bidding for much of the campaign mr cruz responded with a combative convention speech that declined to endorse mr trump a cruz aide said the senator is now happy to be defending mr trump but his fight against impeachment goes beyond that he s really defending the constitution the aide said he s really dialed into this mr cruz isn t the only 2016 opponent sitting in judgment of mr trump there s also sen marco rubio another who four years ago thought he d be sitting in the oval office instead mr rubio has settled into a leadership role on foreign affairs he was one of the president s fiercest defenders of the drone missile strike that killed iranian gen qassem soleimani and his impish sense of humor is also back according to the white house official who said mr trump in the white house has been liberating for both men by reducing the pressure on them to run for office in 2020 he s allowed guys like cruz and rubio to be who they are the official said in cruz s case a pretty good thinker with a quick mind a natural debater in rubio s case it s a guy that looks at a lot of the conventions of the business he s in and realizes how ridiculous they can be mr rubio was always willing to work within the senate gop to achieve his aims mr cruz not as much he famously butted heads with fellow republicans by orchestrating the 2013 government shutdown over obamacare and a year later clashed with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell over the debt mr nehring says those were different times in part because the gop was battling a democratic president then mr nehring says the 2018 campaign where mr trump campaigned for mr cruz made clear the presidential battle is a distant memory for both the senator and the president fellow gop senators say they aren t surprised that mr cruz is being a loyal soldier now times have changed said sen james inhofe oklahoma republican he and other senators said democrats impeachment case which they call the weakest to ever reach the senate is helping cement gop unity cruz is a lawyer rubio is a lawyer a lot of us carry common sense into this i think in this case the proponents of impeachment are in real trouble said sen richa
