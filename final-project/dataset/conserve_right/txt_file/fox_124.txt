government in a moment we aposll talk with white house counselor kellyanne conway but first rich edson with the latest right here in washington rich good morning rich edson correspondent good morning sandra it is a weeklong stalemate that appears headed into next year president trump insists on more money for a wall on the southern u s border one democrats reject as immoral and ineffective begin videotape edson president trump says he aposs in washington ready to negotiate he tweeted i aposm in the white house waiting for democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security from what i hear they are spending so much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime in our military he aposs also threatened to shut down the border with mexico to pressure congress into approving billions more for a wall on the southern border white house budget director mick mulvaney says that administration has offered democrats a deal that would spend less on a wall in the 5 billion the president is demanding trump thank you very much everybody edson he says democrats have just shut down discussions democrats say they aposve offered more money for border security they refused to budge on wall funding rep john garamendi d calif let aposs spend the money wisely after all it is a large amount of money 5 billion as taxpayer money or it aposs borrowed one way or the other edson after they take control of the house thursday democrats say they will pass a bill to fully open the government though without agreement from the republican controlled senate and white house the shutdown would continue federal employees are scheduled to return to work wednesday after the new year holiday there were about 800 000 will either be furloughed or working without pay until congress funds the government and approves back pay end videotape edson and more federal offices say they are running out of money the environmental protection agency says it aposs implementing its shutdown plan and the iconic smithsonian institution says wednesday it will close its museums research centers and the national zoo sandra smith rich thank you joining us now counselor to the president kellyanne conway kellyanne nice to see you this morning and thank you for coming on the program at a time where we are told the president is working on this shutdown standoff on an hour by hour basis what can you tell us has changed in recent hours kellyanne conway counselor to president trump he is i aposve spoken with the president and sandra he has said that he aposs ready to receive a counteroffer from the democrats it aposs been many many days since the house passed its 5 6 billion for border security it aposs not restricted to just a wall it aposs what cbp says they need they need technological enhancements physical barriers the steel slats the president has tweeted about and talked about from the oval and elsewhere it aposs just that border security is national security and we have a flood of drugs coming into this country and into our communities we have obviously an increase in gang members coming over we saw just what happened to officer singh in california god rest his soul murdered by a criminal alien who had come back into this country should not have been here in california a sanctuary state or in a sanctuary city and this is somebody who we aposve got 31 sanctuary cities six sanctuary states you got people want to make us an entire sanctuary country we just need democrats to come to the table and be honest with themselves and who they aposve been in recent past thirty nine democrats this past year voted for some kind of physical barriers and border security enhancements and the summer crosstalk conway on committee voted for dhs funding smith let me dig in before you go on there i want to dig into two things that you just said the president is waiting on democrats to respond and we know that he tweeted about that he said waiting on democrats to come on over and make a deal what we are hearing from democrats is the president is not reaching out to us so there aposs a lot of blame being thrown around has the president directly nancy pelosi chuck schumer in recent days has he reached out specifically to any democrats conway the president has made very clear that the house passed the package and then what always what happened here is what always happens sandra is that the senate then received it it is with them they can counter offer they can sign the 5 6 billion which is a modest investment in our nation security when you think of the 800 billion they spend on a stimulus package in the last administration and the sundry list of items that they fund to the billions of dollars 4 trillion budget or so we should have 5 billion for border security it aposs just a modest investment and by the way democrats themselves have been for secure offenses they aposve been for border security they aposve been for enhancements i prefer chuck schumer 2006 and 2009 to 2000 to chuck schumer in 2018 and apos19 where he has the amnesia about how he voted for the secure fences act how he said enhance border security is a good way to keep out illegal immigration so we have to be honest about the flood of drugs and crime of gangs that are coming that aposs not everybody that aposs not most people but we do know from the dhs statistics that a number of women are saying they aposre being assaulted a number of people saying they aposre being assaulted women saying they aposve been sexually assaulted is up the number of children and family units that cbp or custom and border patrol are being asked to absorb his overwhelming the system we have the flores decision from the courts and we have the congress that fails to close the loopholes smith so conway they can close the loop and not close the border smith kellyanne it sounds even like talking to you right now that there aposs room for compromise on the part of president trump when i hear language from you rather than wall talking about a fence or other border measures john kelly was just interviewed by the l a times and made a bit of news saying this on the wall it aposs not a wall he said if the president still says wall oftentimes he was a barrier or fencing now he aposs tended towards steel slats but we left the solid concrete wall earlier on in the administration when he asked people what they need and where they needed it and furthermore on this back and forth this was mick mulvaney the president aposs acting chief of staff on friday on that issue begin video clip mick mulvaney acting white house chief of staff the democrats have simply shut down the discussions they did not even counter us we went back to them by the way after their second 1 3 billion and picked a number less than five we actually came off of our 5 billion slightly they instead of coming up from the 1 3 billion left town end video clip smith so perhaps you can use this as a message to democrats where is the president willing to give on these issues is it on the dollar amount is he willing to come off that 5 billion is it simply the language in the wording of the wall or the fence conway we aposre having it is a silly semantic argument because people who just want to say wall wall wall wanted to be a four letter word and not respect what customs and border patrol and ice tell us they need which is enhancements of the border there may be a wall in some places there may be steel slats there may be technological enhancements but always saying wall or no wall is being very disingenuous and turning the complete blind eye to what is a crisis at the border when it comes to the drugs pouring in you know all the fentanyl that ice interdicted last year enough to kill every man woman and child in this country didn apost walk over the border by itself the gang members here are coming in the folks who are coming in the criminal aliens because the democrats voted against kate aposs law sanctuary cities law they voted against the removal of criminal aliens apos law now they are not coming to the table and border security i believe the president has already compromised he was he originally asked for 25 billion the house is at 5 6 smith all right conway they did their job the senate has to come back it aposs a modest investment and by the way when we aposre talking about cpb and ice if some of the democrats had their way the more left wing ones we wouldn apost have ice and we wouldn apost have cbp we wouldn apost have the folks who rescued 4 300 people in the last year you hear about the tragic deaths of these migrant children you don apost hear about the 4 000 individuals who were rescued by cbp smith and we know the president has been tweeting about that as well pointing fingers at democrats for what is happening at the border and the loss of those two children what conway this needs to be a nonpartisan issue it needs to be a nonpartisan issue with a bipartisan solution border security and national security is everyone aposs business and it is dismaying to watch a number of these democratic senators who instead of coming to the table and talking about border security for this nation sandra running in 2020 crosstalk conway talking about 2020 the president is talking about 2018 smith the shutdown continues the standoff continues we aposll see what happens here got to get to a couple other things before we let you go kellyanne the markets this week while we have seen during his presidency president trump tout record breaking u s stock market it aposs not been the case this month in the month of december alone it aposs on track to be the worst month for the u s stock market in almost ten years it aposs down 9 percent this month what is the president saying today on the state of the markets and the volatility that we aposve seen conway well the president knows that markets ebb and flow what he knows is they are up from his election day and he knows that he is presiding over the lowest unemployment rate in about 50 years lowest ever crosstalk smith does it concern him does it concern him what aposs happening conway we want the robust we want the robust trump economy to continue which is unemployment under 4 percent and growth in few of those quarters over 4 percent the fundamentals are strong you know our secretary of the treasury made the calls to the major banks and reported that they have said there aposs liquidity there we know there aposs great consumer confidence if you look at what was spent over the holiday season we also know that there is we aposre nearing i read 4 trillion in household debt you know whether it aposs credit card or student loans and whatnot but this president the fundamentals are there 12 regulations out for every new one in in 2018 the massive tax cut and jobs act boom to this economy one year ago that has led to raises and bonuses and the repatriation of wealth that was parked legally overseas the corporate tax rate going from 35 percent to 21 percent has spurred so much growth people are just looking at job security now they aposre looking at job mobility the jobseekers the job holders and the job creators have all benefited in the trump economy so he aposs watching that he will do what it takes to keep this economy fortified smith it aposs great to have you here with much happening on a busy weekend two other subjects one quickly on syria the president has said and he aposs defended his decision to pull troops out of syria saying a lot of people are going to come around to his way of thinking what has been done by this administration to ease the concerns of our allies in the wake of that decision conway well the president told me just yesterday that he had a terrific closed door meeting in iraq when he and the first lady went to applaud our troops for the great job that they are doing for this nation in iraq and in germany but in iraq he had a closed door meeting and he said watch what happens and this guy always wins watch what happens because he aposs got plans and he will i won apost get ahead of his announcement but he did want me to convey that secondly i took note that in the major mainstream if not left leaning newspaper the former u s ambassador to syria under president obama was applauding the president aposs actions to come out of syria he says it may not be popular among some but it aposs the right thing to do and here aposs how to do it best this president has said to some of us around him on a regular basis it breaks his heart to write those letters again and again to the parents of those american troops who were killed in syria and that we also know that this president is cleaning up the mess left by the last administration and never took the advance of isis in syria seriously they talked about some goofy redline never enforced that but this president doesn apost believe in endless war with american troops and i aposm so happy he and the first lady went to iraq went to germany and thanked the troops up close and personal it is the right thing to do and he aposs happy to do it smith the one final question to you kellyanne and i know we are covering a lot of ground here a big week is coming up for sure you aposve got defense secretary james mattis out january 1st we just saw the interview from john kelly he aposs out january 2nd january 3rd the congress begins what are the president aposs expectations before you go for the week to come and the year to come conway sure well first the democrats have to come back nancy pelosi needs to come back from hawaii less hula more mola for the dhs customs and border patrol funding our border security they need to come to the table and do their job a fully functioning democracy demands that both parties come together and that the congress and the executive branch work together the president also has been listening to the joyful noise that many democrats have been making on your network and elsewhere sandra promising to work on infrastructure as a big priority we hope that aposs true because that is a major priority for this president and always has been he aposs a builder and he wants to three see things happen obviously keeping all of the agencies funded including dhs reopening the government getting that border security funding going he aposs got of the state of the union coming up that aposs being worked on now as well and i think the president will continue to focus on the robust economy immigration foreign policy and put really make sure people understand that that 2 6 percent raise that he promised the military and reiterated over this weekend he aposs take that to the bank because he passed a 700 billion for them last year 716 billion or so for them this year and in there it aposs a 2 6 percent raise they deserve it they work to keep us free to allow us to have this conversation particularly as women in a thriving democracy smith always a good time to thank all of our service men and women and we aposll do that this morning and kellyanne conway conway yes god bless them smith thank you very much for your time this morning thanks for joining us and good to speak with you conway thank you happy and a healthy new year smith and to you as well let aposs turn now to house majority whip steve scalise congressman welcome back to fox news sunday covered a lot there with kellyanne conway it is day nine of this shutdown congressman haven apost been in d c for a few weeks it is quiet in this town when does this shutdown end congressman rep steve scalise r la house majority whip well good morning sandra and frankly it can end today if chuck schumer nancy pelosi agreed with the president on the bill that we passed out of the house just a few days ago that bill is still over in the senate it aposs ready to be taken up and look if the senate has got a different way and a better way to approach border security they ought to put that their plan on the table chuck schumer was for this in 2006 i aposd be curious to know what changed is it just that donald trump is the one requesting it but if he aposs got a better way to keep this country safe i think it aposs incumbent upon him to show the american people what that plan is but we aposve got a crisis at the border this president is trying to keep this country safe that aposs what this fight is about so this can be solved today if they just came to the table and said here aposs our plan to get the country safe but you can apost smith congressman i aposm sorry for interrupting but you just heard kellyanne conway and she laid out where the president stands today on this how far apart do you think the two sides are scalise i don apost think it aposs as much that the two sides are far apart it aposs that you aposve got one side that refuses to negotiate because they are so afraid of the radical left base that wants open borders and look a lot of them campaigned on abolishing ice and just think about this sandra last year alone ice agents these border agents that are protecting the interior of our country saved more than 900 children from sexual assault and human trafficking that stuff is actually happening at the border we are stopping a lot of it but we are surely not stopping all of it and so you just see this cop killer in california he was here illegally there are bad people that are trying to cross this border there are good people that come here illegally every day like officer singh who came here from fiji legally to seek the american dream but there are also really bad people that came over like the cop killer how many of them are getting through that we don apost stop everyday smith it aposs really interesting because congressman with kellyanne we just talked about this john kelly interview with the l a times where he talks about the president he still says wall oftentimes frankly john kelly said he was a barrier or fencing now he has tended towards steel slats so a lot of folks are trying to understand the language that is being used here because the president said himself that he wanted a wall a fence whatever they would like to call it referencing democrats i will call it whatever they want and when asked about that 5 billion figure this week this past week he said it aposs complicated with whether he was willing to come off of that number so i aposm just asking the question do you think there aposs more room for negotiation with this president than most people are giving him credit for scalise there aposs a lot of different items that relate to border security that we can negotiate about but let aposs first recognize this is about securing our border and the president has been very clear about what he wants to do to keep america safe and he campaigned on it he was elected on this and so again if there aposs a better way that chuck schumer can put a plan on the table to keep this country safe i want to see it if he aposs ok by the way with the thousands of criminals that we stop every year how many thousands do we not stop because we don apost have a secure border that aposs what this fight is about and is he ok with those people coming across illegally who are criminals in this caravan there aposs over 600 criminals smith but i aposm just trying to understand from you congressman how much you would support the president caving on some of those initial demands such as the 5 billion mark louis gohmert of the house freedom caucus urging the president to stick to his initial demands saying he needs to hold the lines until hell freezes over if we did see the president cave on any of his demands i just wonder how you think that this base and his biggest supporters would respond scalise well sandra i don apost think it aposs about caving and frankly i don apost think it should be about personalities let aposs remove the personality again chuck schumer was for a wall before it was donald trump asking for the wall so if he remove the personality from it let aposs get to what it aposs going to take to secure the border and i aposll give you one example sandra in law today there are prohibitions that stop the president from building the wall in certain areas where frankly we have them most porous parts of our border we need to remove those legal limitations there aposs also limitations let aposs stop him from building a wall in certain ways there are cheaper and more cost effective ways of building a wall and the president can apost do that today because the law blocks in how stupid is that the law actually says if there aposs a lower cost and more effective way of securing the border the president is legally prevented from doing that in the bill we passed just a few days ago we removed those legal limitations to the president can keep this country safe in the best and most cost effective way possible smith all right finally on this issue i just want to ask you you know we just asked kellyanne about whether or not the president has directly reached out to democrats she said the offers are on the table we are waiting for democrats to respond would you like to see the president pick up the phone and try to call nancy pelosi or chuck schumer at this moment scalise well he had that sit down meeting at the white house where they were adamant that they didn apost want to do anything that he wanted to secure the border so the bottom line is there is an offer on the table in the form of an actual bill that can get to his desk we passed it out of the house it aposs still in the senate up until january 2nd that bill was still alive and active let the senate go in and start negotiating and actually passed something out of the senate that secures this border and gives the president the tools he needs to keep america safe smith all right congressman we are looking at a big week ahead four more days until democrats take control of the house what are your priorities for the new congress and can you find common ground scalise well sandra i aposd like to see us continue to build on the economic success with that look hardworking families all across this country are seeing the best economy they aposve seen in generations anybody who aposs looking for a job right now has multiple opportunities to go and find a job that aposs really positive i want to see us build on that and allow families to have even more security let aposs focus on also getting our fiscal house in order if we help rebuild our military working with this president last year and as kellyanne just talked about our troops are about to get an important well earned pay raise now let aposs focus on actually getting our budget balanced again and let aposs talk about infrastructure a lot of other issues we can work on in the new year but democrats have to be willing to work with this president you aposve seen a lot of focus on what they aposre going to do in terms of what the president calls presidential harassment that aposs not what this country wants they didn apost campaign to get the majority by the way on talking about those issues let aposs focus on getting this economy growing even better and it aposs doing great right now let aposs keep building on the success smith all right congressman scalise thank you it aposs always good to talk to you and thanks for sharing part of your holiday weekend with us scalise happy new year sandra smith happy new year to you well up next making sense of these markets it aposs been a wild ride and the economic outlook for 2019 what is it with an internationally respected economist we speak to him next commercial break smith we wanted to get some unique perspective on this week aposs wild swings on wall street and to make sense of those big market moves we decided to bring in mohamed el erian chief economic advisor for allianz parent company of investment giant pimco where he was ceo mr el erian also served as chairman of president obama aposs global development council wonderful to have you on the program this morning mr el erian thank you if i could first ask you i know you had a chance to listen to the interviews before this kellyanne from the white house and congressman steve scalise it aposs an interesting moment for this country where wall street is reflecting the actions of the white house and congress perhaps in a bigger way then we have seen historically can you can you weigh in on that and sort of provide some clarity on what we are seeing in the markets today mohamed el erian chief economic adviser allianz so to understand what aposs happening on wall street and that is volatility unsettling volatility in the worst december in history you have to look beyond washington yes washington is an added factor but there are three things going on one the global economy has become more uncertain not because of the u s the u s is doing fine but because of europe because of china two central banks have changed behavior they are no longer buying securities there are no longer keeping interest rates really low the fed and european central bank are tightening liquidity and finally behavior has changed on wall street it aposs no longer about buying every dip it aposs about selling every rally so there aposs a lot going on and this being amplified by computer trading so it aposs really important to get the focus back on what aposs working and that aposs the u s economy smith well you hear the r word thrown a lot recession these days our concerns of one are they overdone at this point or is that becoming a reality el erian it aposs certainly not becoming a reality you would need either a major policy mistake or a massive market accident to push us into recession but we will slow down unless we build on the pro growth policies and i think the reference to infrastructure is an important one you can get both parties to support that and an infrastructure effort would increase productivity you could do it through with private and public partnerships and importantly it would build on what has been done so far to get us to a higher growth platform smith there aposs been a lot of talk about the president aposs open criticism of the federal reserve and i just i know you just mentioned the risk to the markets that the federal reserve poses with these interest rate hikes the president has been very critical of those hikes saying the only problem our economy has is the fed and he aposs been critical since he took office it was a couple years ago he said the fed is obviously not independent how does that open criticism from the u s president how does it affect markets el erian it certainly unusual but i think even the fed is understanding that it needs to communicate better it needs to do two things in particular one show that it is more sensitive to markets and what aposs happening outside this risk of spell backs what the president has called get a better feel for what aposs going on and second and that aposs a communication issue that i think the fed has understood judging from what we aposve heard from the president of the new york fed and then second the fed has to realize that it cannot keep a really important policy tool on automatic pilot that it needs to be more sensitive to what aposs happening and i think that the fed can regain control and we can stop the self inflicted wounds smith do you think the president aposs criticism of jerome powell and his actions as the federal reserve chairman are they warranted el erian no i think the president has a point in saying get a feel for what aposs going on beyond the strict narrow domestic economy i think you don apost want to cross over to much of the line of central bank independence central bank independence is very important for economic stability and economic stability is key to economic growth an inclusive growth that brings up everybody aposs well being so i think there is a point in telling the fed be more sensitive about the spell backs but you want to maintain the autonomy of the central bank smith well there is just one trading day left in 2018 and that of course is tomorrow and the dow is on pace to suffer its worst month dating back to 2009 so there aposs obviously concern on main street if you could mohamed look out into the new year and tell us what you see as far as the economy and the stock market what are the biggest risks and the biggest assets at this moment el erian i think the most likely outcome is decoupling the economy will remain strong growing at 2 5 to 3 percent wages will continue to rise at 3 percent or north of that and the economy on a stand alone basis will look fine but because of what aposs happening in the rest of the world because liquidity conditions have changed markets will remain volatile so don apost be surprised if you see these thousand point swings in the dow that is our new reality for a while and it reflects the fact sandra that we aposre coming from a very good 2017 people forget that everything went right in 2017 higher returns no volatility and great correlation so i think of this as a normalization it doesn apost feel good in the short term but it aposs ok over the long term smith you say it doesn apost feel good it just last week it was monday christmas eve it was the worst christmas eve performance for the u s stock market on record everybody came back from christmas day wednesday the dow rose more than a thousand points in a single session it was the largest single day point gain in stock market history it was really a historic week we look forward to 2019 we see what aposs to come you sound pretty optimistic mr el erian thank you it was nice to speak with you this morning el erian thank you smith up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss what it will take to break the budget standoff commercial break smith coming up president trump defends his decision to withdraw u s troops from syria begin video clip president donald trump our presence in syria was not open ended and was never intended to be permanent end video clip smith we aposll ask our sunday panel about the pushback to bring them home coming up on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip rep jim mcgovern d mass the one thing that we should all want to do no matter what our political philosophy may be is to keep the lights on rep mark meadows r n c i would say that the needle has moved towards a a very long shutdown just because of the impasse that we aposre seeing in the the unwillingness of democrats to actually engage in meaningful dialogue end video clip smith incoming house rules committee chairman jim mcgovern and house freedom caucus chair mark meadows on the chances of ending the government shutdown which is now in its second weekend and it is time now for our sunday group washington post columnist and former bush white house speechwriter marc thiessen philippe reines former senior advisor to hillary clinton anne gearan of the washington post and charles hurt opinion editor for the washington times thank you all for being here in between the holidays this week and it aposs wonderful to have you so happy new year to you marc what aposs it going to take this town aposs pretty quiet marc thiessen former bush white house speechwriter it aposs pretty quiet because nancy pelosi aposs in hawaii on the beach sunning herself whilst 800 000 federal workers are about to lose their paychecks look i think the democrats are getting a little cocky here because the reality of the optics of nancy pelosi being in hawaii where all these workers are out about to lose their paychecks is bad and because donald trump is offering compromises i mean donald trump came in with saying he wanted 5 billion for a wall he aposs already cut that in half to 2 5 billion smith he aposs willing to call it a fence thiessen yes he aposs will he aposs willing he aposs so you know he aposs offering reasonable compromise on this thing right now he owns the shutdown because he started the shutdown because he claimed the mantle of the shutdown but over time if the democrats refused to negotiate they aposre going to own the mantle of the shutdown so what americans want is a compromise they aposve agreed to 1 3 billion already that aposs what aposs already agreed to donald trump is asking for 2 5 in committee they asked the democrats voted for 1 6 so the difference between 1 6 and 2 5 billion in washington is a rounding error and we aposre shutting down the government over this i mean it aposs ridiculous smith philippe to that you say what philippe reines former hilary clinton senior adviser well i aposd say you know for at least another few days can remind everyone that the congress and the white house is controlled by the same party the republican party it aposs taken two years to get to the point where nothing has happened so let aposs just not make this all of a sudden nancy pelosi and chuck schumer aposs fault second i think we have a weird dynamic year in that this is the least sort of urgent shutdown i you know i don apost know how many i aposve lived through but this no one seems to care smith that could change in the next couple of days reines it could and you know what it should and i think part of the problem here is that the president doesn apost seem to mind the shutdown it seems consistent with his brand with what his people want and by the way you were you were talking to your previous guests about the president caving he has he aposs not caved to the democrats he aposs caved to the far right and i think democrats to some extent are watching this play out i haven apost seen mitch mcconnell or paul ryan i mean i don apost know if they aposre in hawaii or if they aposre in you know some southern pacific islands smith charlie charles hurt the washington times look the issue of securing the border is not some cave to the right wing that is actually a far more bipartisan if you go out beyond the beltway here a far more bipartisan issue and it aposs why donald trump won the election in 2016 because he was listening to people not just the right wing base of the republican party but to to the voters in general and the big picture optics here are far better for for president trump than they are for democrats you have a situation like you have that that tragic tragic killing of a police officer in california where you have a legal immigrant who was serving his community killed by an illegal criminal member of a mexican american street gang you know an issue who never should have been in the country in the first place an issue like that if we weren apost in these sort of crazy times with the media and politics in this country a story like that would be would sort of be defining everything that we talk about and you know you can say that donald trump does own the shutdown because of the comments that he aposs made but by the same token you could also say the democrats who if democrats went along with this and agreed the way they have in the past to secure the border we wouldn apost be talking about this right now smith nobody is talking about this right now that aposs the problem right and the white house isn apost talking to the democrats and democrats are calling the white house anne gearan the washington post yes i mean kellyanne conway earlier in the program was issued an invitation said the president is here at the white house waiting for a call waiting for democrats to come and visit i think at this point democrats feel that they have a whole lot less to lose from a prolonged shutdown than the president does that calculation may change i think to your to your point that definitely could change but you know they the optics of nancy pelosi in in hawaii are not something that that we aposve heard a great deal of discussion about instead the optics of the california shooting and the optics of two dead guatemalan children are are defining the the border part of this smith in that reines well let aposs look at how that aposs being discussed it aposs not fair to say there aposs been no discussion of border security president trump tweeted a few times yesterday literally blaming the democratic party for the deaths of these two children you cannot talk about politicalization ph thiessen but the democrats no no hold on philippe the democrats have been blaming him for their deaths the democrats reines the democrats have said that while children are in american custody we have a higher responsibility thiessen democrats have been blaming him for the deaths of these children reines no that aposs not true thiessen because they aposre saying the conditions under his administrations and these and the overcrowding in the border patrol facilities are outrageous and they aposre trying to pin it on him how can you be reines i was inaudible thiessen how can anyone blame donald trump for the deaths of these children when the democrats won apost fund border security to so those two facilities wouldn apost be overcrowded in the first place smith let aposs first reines one thing has nothing to do with the other thiessen yes it does smith first of all this is a tragic situation and we have reines he has not spent most of what was earmarked last year smith we had the response from the white house obviously everyone agrees that is a tragic situation the loss of these two children both sides clearly want to find a solution for this anne can they gearan yes i mean i think there there aposs a there aposs a solution in two things here there aposs there aposs definitely a solution to the shutdown really all that would have to happen there is both sides say that they are going to reach a deal and then you can and then you can end the shutdown right they don apost actually have to have some signed piece of paper that is possible i think that doesn apost realistically happen until after january 3rd so yes smith so by the way if and i believe steny hoyer nancy pelosi they aposre going to they aposre going to put legislation on the floor january 3rd if that is if that think gets approved in the senate gets to the president aposs desk is he just going to veto anything that doesn apost have a wall in it thiessen absolutely and he should i mean look this is a bigger issue than just the shutdown this goes to the entire legislative agenda for the democratic congress coming in in 2019 if the democrats should be celebrating right now because they have something that donald trump desperately wants money for a border wall in negotiations there aposs a technical term for this it aposs called leverage right you and what you do is when you have leverage you use it to get something donald trump is willing to negotiate so if you have leverage you can get you they could get donald trump to agree to daca they could get donald trump to agree if they want to fund the full border wall to 11 million illegal immigrants getting status they could use it for health care reines i aposm going to defend donald trump for a second please turn the cameras off donald trump did try to negotiate on daca and on immigration security and he got his head handed to him and not by me and not by my party but by this party and by many people on this channel thiessen no he no that aposs not what happened smith and you can apost thiessen what happened reines that aposs exactly what happened thiessen it is not what happened it reines he aposs negotiating against his own conservative wing smith marc can i have your final thought and we got to go thiessen the reality is that if the democrats are smart they can get they have to decide are they the resistance or are they now a governing majority because they aposre now the majority in the house and so do they want to govern and get things done or do they just want to resist if they want to get things done you use your leverage to get something in exchange for it there aposs nothing morally wrong with building a wall five years ago every democrat in the senate voted for the gang of eight bill which president obama agreed to sign that not only funded 700 miles of border fencing but said not one illegal immigrant will be given permanent residency until the wall is complete five years ago under president obama because donald trump wants it they aposre going to stand they aposre going to stand on this hill get something done reines according to john kelly donald trump doesn apost even want it hasn apost wanted it for two years smith hold those thoughts we aposve got to take a break right here when we come back how will president trump aposs plan to pull out u s troops in syria affect the strategy ahead in the middle east our sunday group returns next commercial break begin video clip trump there will be a strong deliberate and orderly withdrawal of u s forces from syria very deliberate very orderly while maintaining the u s presence in iraq to prevent an isis resurgence and to protect u s interests end video clip smith president trump answering critics on his troop withdrawal decision during an unannounced visit to iraq this week and we are back now with our panel i will go first to you charlie as far as the president aposs he is defending this move this week we have seen him do it on several occasions but what is the administration doing however was my question to kellyanne conway to ease the concerns of our allies who may have been caught off guard by this move hurt well certainly that is an issue and it and i think everybody feels for for the the kurds who have been fighting we aposve been fighting alongside in in syria it aposs it aposs a tough situation but all of this this strum and drang ph that we hear today in washington from both parties about this precipitous withdrawal you know the mistake that was made in syria was not made by donald trump pulling out the mistake was made when we didn apost have the debate going into syria in the first place and it seems like and i know that marc and a lot of smart people around here who can make a lot of very good arguments for why we should be why american troops should be in syria but but the american people don apost know what the reason is fighting isis is the only reason that they aposve ever been given congress has never debated this this has not been something that and quite frankly americans are tired of this sort of endless wars and it is after immigration is a big reason why donald trump got elected gearan that aposs actually that that aposs not right they aposre the american people have been given at least three different reasons for why troops are there you can debate the merits of all of any of them but certainly the isis counter isis mission was the original one 2015 when we first went in then you have the two reasons that have been offered that the obama administration reason you then have the two reasons that have been offered as additionally under trump which is countering iran and countering russia both valid potentially valid military national security issues but those are three different reasons john bolton having argued most forcefully the counter iran one those things are not being mentioned here hurt let me just say being given reasons is different from congress debating and voting on something thiessen of course pass an authorization of military force to fight al qaeda after 9 11 hurt it it thiessen hold on hold on after 9 11 al qaeda in iraq became isis it aposs the same terrorist organization that we were fighting after 9 11 in iraq and that hurt and but thiessen but hold on hurt inaudible specific thiessen donald trump donald trump campaigned everyone says that donald trump campaigned on withdrawing from syria donald trump campaigned by calling barack obama the founder of isis because he engaged in a precipitous withdrawal that led to the rise of the islamic state that when obama pulled out there were 700 al qaeda according to cia director john brennan at the time there were 700 al qaeda fighters left they became tens of thousands and took over a territory the size of great britain today in syria there are 30 000 isis fighters still under arms our intelligence community believes that they are more powerful than they were before the bush surge that knocked them down and they have they aposre stolen 400 million they aposve stolen 400 million from iraq 9 11 cost al qaeda 100 000 this is a they are not defeated yes donald trump has done a very powerful thing in driving them out of their physical caliphate taking the handcuffs off of our military in doing that but they are not defeated yet and if we pull out our troops and if we and we and we abandon the kurds that we and the arabs that we trained to fight them they are going to come back and we are going to pay for it here at home hurt so why not go to congress and get that specific approval i don apost think anybody would have a problem with that if we did that thiessen i don apost think even donald trump is arguing to do that smith perhaps an interesting voice that emerged among all this criticism was robert ford senior fellow at the middle east institute yale university he was u s ambassador to syria from 2011 to 2014 during president obama aposs time in office he penned a piece trump syria decision was essentially correct here aposs how he can make the most of it in the first paragraph he says it was an essentially correct but widely unpopular move he goes on to make the point that this was the right thing for president trump to do reines well i think you have to disambiguate a few things and both charlie and marc are touching on them there aposs why we aposre in syria what have we done since and why are we leaving now and how was that announced and i think there aposs plenty of blame to go around for everyone for those things it is an honest conversation to talk about why we aposre in syria but as marc pointed out it is not honest to say that we did our job there we have wiped out isis that is disingenuous that is basically lying and that is not right but for for and again syria aposs a wicked problem so this isn apost as simple as obama should have fixed it hillary would have fixed it trump is screwing it up but you can apost spend two years on the campaign trail and then a year and a half since saying we aposve had an inadequate debate about syria we aposre in there we don apost know why and then wake up one day and not have a debate even with your own team and just announce it to the country that is an odd solution to having a healthy debate smith just really quick before i give charlie the last word on this because i can tell you want to he robert ford went on in his piece to make the case in any case u s troops can apost destroy the islamic state ideology and restraining future recruitment by the extremist group requires more than just some infrastructure rehabilitation projects he went on final word to you hurt yes but the reason that president trump isn apost talking about wanting to have a big debate about this is because he knows what he aposs listened to the american people and they don apost have patience for this smith all right this is a great group to have on a sunday thank you so much to our panel and up next we revisit a few of the interesting people chris featured as his power player of the week in 2018 commercial break smith most sundays at this time you aposll find chris wallace here
