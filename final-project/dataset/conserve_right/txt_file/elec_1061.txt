national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions the nationwide generic ballot tells us almost nothing about which party is likely to win control of the house if you really want to get a handle on how tomorrow s elections will turn out you need to go through all the competitive districts one by one if you do that you find the balance of power in the house of representatives is really close probably within a handful of seats let s begin with ballotpedia s big list of competitive districts better to begin by looking at too many districts than too few and they selected 80 seats that s 71 republican held seats and 9 democratic ones why do the republicans have so few districts where they could win a democrat held seat because with a few exceptions they already picked all the low hanging fruit in 2010 and 2014 and held on to it through 2016 there just aren t that many competitive districts represented by democrats left now let s cross off seats that look like wishful thinking no devin nunes is not losing in california s deeply conservative 22nd district no matter how much democrats wish they could make it happen no mario d az balart isn t losing in florida s 25th district after he won nearly two to one last time cathy mcmorris rodgers is not losing her seat in washington s fifth district in wisconsin s first district the home district of retiring house speaker paul ryan the only polls showing democrat randy bryce ahead are by democratic firms the lone independent survey showed republican bryan stiel ahead by six points jwplayer

alaska s don young down by one percentage point and he s been around 50 percent in recent cycles but he s the longest serving house member so he and his campaign probably know what it takes to win in a tough cycle despite the scandals and accusations polling shows duncan hunter jr and chris collins hanging on pretty comfortably and dana rohrabacher is in stronger shape than many expected as for the remaining races i ll be placing a fair amount of weight on polls when available there s been a lot more polling done of house races this cyclethan was previously the norm and while the polls can collectively be wrong in favor of one party see friday s morning joltfor more discussion about that they re still the best measuring stick we have if fundraising numbers equaled votes beto o rourke would have his race wrapped up by now the partisan lean of the district in recent cycles at both the congressional and presidential levels counts for a lot as well has the incumbent demonstrated an ability to win while the other party was winning his district in the presidential race did the advantages of incumbency keep a congressman winning as the district s demographics changed cycle by cycle think of what follows as a reasonably pessimistic analysis for example republican barbara comstock couldwin in virginia s tenth district and she s shown strength in past cycles winning 53 percent to 47 percent for example while hillary clinton was carrying her district 52 percent to 42 percent in 2016 but this is the classic suburban moms repelled by trump district and democrat ralph northam won this district by 13 points in last year s governor s race this district has been polled nine times since august and democrat jennifer wexton won seven times often outside the margin of error pencil in a wexton win i also count on the democratic base to be motivated and give the democrat the edge in most races where it is close eleven term incumbent pete sessions could well hang on in texas s 32nd district but the most recent and probably last survey in this district had democrat colin allred narrowly ahead mimi walters is fighting to the end in california s 45th district but she s narrowly trailing in all of the independent polls for a while it looked like democrats had blown their chances in the leaning blue florida 27th district but donna shalala appears to have gained ground as october wore on in maine s second district incumbent republican bruce poliquin is keeping it really close but challenger jared golden has enjoyed a very small lead in the last two polls there are a handful of districts where we can give the republican an edge young kim has kept it really close in the independent polls in california s 39th district if there were going to be a democratic wave here gil cisneros probably would have enjoyed some sizable leads in this classic swing district in florida incumbent carlos curbela will probably hang on in florida s 26th district for all the talk of kentucky s sixth district being the perfect bellwether race of this cycle republican incumbent andy barr hasn t trailed in a single independent survey this autumn mark down only one republican as extremely likely to pick up a democratic seat though pete stauber in minnesota s eighth district which is currently held by retiring democrat rick nolan but there s an outside chance of the gop flipping a few more as well in arizona s first district democrats are a little worried about incumbent tom o halleran so far just over 40 percent of the returned ballots in this district are from registered republicans versus just over 36 percent from registered democrats demographically minnesota s first district is a classic opportunity for a gop pickup republican jim hagedorn is a controversy prone candidate but maybe that won t hold him back in a nationalized election danny tarkanian s keeping it close in nevada s third district as you ll see below anygop upset could have big ramifications pennsylvania is the state that s going to really complicate things for republicans because the state supreme court redrew the district lines a few months ago giving democrats their dream map of course it s hard to predict what will happen in newly drawn districts for example keith rothfus won his old district with 61 percent of the vote but now he s up against another incumbent democrat conor lamb in a far more democratic area outside of pennsylvania it looks like democrats will pick up 22 seats just short of the 23 they need but stauber s win in minnesota flips one seat back to the gop giving democrats a net gain of 21 if pennsylvania kept the status quo the republicans would enjoy a 220 215 majority with pennsylvania s new lines the consensus is that the state s congressional balance will shift from 13 5 republican at the beginning of this congress to 9 9 this gives democrats four additional seats adding up to a net change of 25 seats just past the 23 seats they need for a majority under this scenario the good news for democrats is that they win the house gain the chairmanships of the house committees and can investigate the trump administration to their hearts content the bad news is that getting much of anything passed with just 220 democrats will be extremely difficult republicans would no doubt attempt to entice conservative democrats to switch parties and vice versa president trump would probably go through the entire democratic house caucus to see if any of member wanted any appointed position this would take a vote away from nancy pelosi and give the republicans a shot at winning the seat in a special election the above analysis will probably get something wrong and if the republicans exceed it by just a little bit there could be a one seat majority the republicans will have it if they exceed this projection by three the democrats if republicans exceed it by two the post election wrangling could end up even more dramatic than
