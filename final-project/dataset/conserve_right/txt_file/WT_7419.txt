nations across asia that will receive millions in aid the fact sheet did not however mention china at a moment when u s and chinese officials are trading barbs over the coronavirus u s officials say beijing has engaged in a global propaganda campaign to blame america for the pandemic while attempting to project an image of china as the global leader in helping nations respond to it china critics at u s think tanks say beijing is pushing false claims about its international aid efforts the most remarkable case according to mike watson an analyst with the hudson institute in washington is in italy where china s ostentatious delivery of supplies and doctors has caused much consternation among americans who worry that the united states is losing its global leadership role media accounts often omitted that the supplies were bought and paid for by the italians when the most newsworthy element to the story is that china actually kept its commitment to deliver what it sold mr watson wrote last week in the national review overall china has returned to europe about as much medical equipment as it received taking credit for in effect receiving supplies from northern and central europe and delivering them later to southern europe but unlike the european donors the chinese aren t doing it for free he wrote chinese communists are boasting about their magnanimity and are letting germany and the european union take the blame for shortages across europe that are largely due to chinese hoarding this is not philanthropy this is mercantilism beijing has pushed back against such characterizations an opinion article published sunday by global times a beijing tabloid controlled by the chinese government claimed china has offered over 80 countries and international organizations emergency assistance to fight the coronavirus pandemic sent seven teams of medical experts to five badly hit countries including iran and italy and held dozens of video conferences with various countries to share experiences the article went on to argue that some in the west are once again politicizing the assistance china provided making it another weapon to slander china at a press conference last week mr pompeo told reporters that beijing is engaged in a disinformation campaign that has pushed false narratives about the coronavirus including conspiracy theories that the virus originated in the u s and was spread to china this is crazy talk the secretary of state said teams of international scientists including several from inside china have agreed for more than a month that the virus came from a wet market in the chinese city of wuhan where fish poultry and other animals are slaughtered on the premises mr pompeo did not mention china in a statement on the new u s humanitarian aid allocation last week he did however promote the united states as the the single largest health and humanitarian donor to nations worldwide since 2009 american taxpayers have generously funded more than 100 billion in health assistance and nearly 70 billion in humanitarian assistance globally he said he went on to describe the newly allocated 274 million as an initial investment noting president trump s early march signing of the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act which includes 1 3 billion in additional u s foreign assistance to
