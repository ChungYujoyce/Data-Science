profound public health and economic consequences no not really we re doing a great job trump said recently when asked if he would contact any of the living former presidents even in the face of the greatest challenge of his presidency trump has expressed confidence in his team and said he didn t want to bother the former presidents he added that he would reach out if he thought he could learn from them instead he has frequently criticized his predecessors disparaging obama s handling of the h1n1 virus pandemic of 2009 2010 that killed nearly 12 500 americans and george w bush s response to hurricane katrina in 2005 in which more than 1 800 people were killed mostly in new orleans look i respect everybody but i feel i have an incredible team and i think we re doing an incredible job trump said at the white house so i don t want to disturb them bother them i don t think i m going to learn much i guess you could say that there s probably a natural inclination not to call now if i felt that if i called i d learn something and that would save one life it would save one life ok i would make the call in two minutes he said but i don t see that happening that hasn t stopped clinton

overrun by the virus he is also using the bush institute to highlight how people across the country are helping each other bush spokesman freddy ford said in an email bush and former first lady laura

where they live michael chertoff homeland security secretary when hurricane katrina slammed the gulf coast said bush leaned on the former presidents because he understood that presidents bring to the table a unique perspective that no other official has bush was widely faulted for a lackluster response to the unfolding disaster in new orleans which became a permanent blot on his two terms in office chertoff who commented at a recent event hosted by the cipher brief an online intelligence newsletter said presidents have to be the ultimate decision maker often relying on information that is fast moving and changing so i think getting the perspective of your predecessors is very helpful chertoff said presidents seeking help from those who came before them isn t a modern phenomenon in the

by publicly calling carter a terrible president jeffrey engel director of the center for presidential history at southern methodist university in dallas said president george h w bush kept his living predecessors briefed on issues big and small in case a situation arose where he would need to seek their counsel the fact that trump doesn t go outside of his own info bubble to seek advice is perhaps
