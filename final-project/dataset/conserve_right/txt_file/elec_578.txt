immigration at the gopdebate donald trump s rivals teamed up at thursday s fox news republican presidential debate in a concerted effort to cast him as a political salesman willing to say anything and take any position to win the nomination but in the end pledged to support the gop nominee even if it apos s trump marco rubio ted cruz and john kasich all pledged to support the eventual nominee and trump who has occasionally threatened to mount an independent bid also vowed yes i will support the nominee the moment of unity in detroit was a break from the otherwise tense and personal debate at other times the republican front runner repeatedly was challenged by the moderators and his rival candidates on his alleged inconsistencies trump defended his statements one after another for instance saying i changed my tune from welcoming middle east refugees to suggesting the u s can t take them after learning new information i have a very strong core he said while adding i have never seen a successful person who wasn t flexible but his rivals argued this flexibility raises questions about whether trump really would deliver on his promises there s a difference between flexibility and telling people whatever you think you need to say to get them to do what you want them to do rubio charged claiming once again that trump is trying to con people ohio gov kasich without naming trump directly suggested voters are tired of politicians telling them what they want to hear and not delivering at other times trump was kept busy swatting down attacks on his character his readiness to be president and his business record he has spent a career convincing americans he s something that he s not in exchange for their money rubio said of the front runner this little guy has lied so much about my record trump answered you haven t employed in your life one person i ve employed tens of thousands of people the sustained attempt by the three other candidates to challenge trump s authenticity comes as they scramble to disrupt his march to the nomination following the super tuesday contests where trump padded his sizeable delegate lead once again the debate saw cruz and rubio hitting trump from both sides including pressuring him to release a reportedly secret tape of him speaking bluntly about his immigration policies to the new york times editorial board trump said he s not going to release the tape he admitted he s changing and softening his position on certain visas for highly skilled workers but said he s also not very flexible on his proposed u s mexico border wall cruz called the times tape issue troubling and questioned whether he told the editorial board he doesn t believe what he says on immigration you can resolve this issue very quickly by simply releasing the new york times tape he said questioning whether he s lying to the public you re the liar trump said i ve given my answer lyin ted trump also tangled with cruz after accusing cruz of being the primary supporter of supreme court chief justice john roberts cruz rejected the claim and when trump tried to interrupt said breathe breathe breathe rubio quipped when they re done with the yoga and when brushed off by cruz added well trump is very flexible so you never know trump also moved to deflect criticism about his former trump university which is the subject of several court cases he called them a minor civil case he could settle this led to another tense exchange with cruz who said donald learn not to interrupt count to 10 kasich meanwhile defended his campaign claiming he ll turn it around soon and would earn crossover votes in a general election cruz also confronted trump over his past financial contributions to hillary clinton s campaigns challenging his decision to send four checks for her 2008 presidential bid why did you write checks to hillary clinton to be president in 2008 cruz asked it wasn t for business trump countered though that it was for business we re doing many many deals outside of the united states trump said justifying his donations to clinton s 2008 campaign but he said he also supported ronald reagan and other republicans and maintained that the last person clinton wants to face in november is him trump faced off thursday against a narrowing field of republican rivals as his battle with the gop establishment hit new levels of intensity just hours earlier 2012 gop presidential nominee mitt romney ended any semblance of sitting this one out and delivered a scathing speech against trump s candidacy the address in which romney called trump a phony who would sink the country into recession underscored how divided the party truly is over trump s rise trump at the top of the debate hit back at romney calling him an embarrassment and asserting he s just trying to get back in the game he was a failed candidate he should have beaten president obama very easily trump said i guess he wants to be relevant rubio meanwhile defended his shift to leveling personal attacks at trump which he started doing at the most recent debate donald trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks he said if there s anyone who s ever deserved to be attacked that way it s donald trump rubio though said he s ready to get back to the issues trump then made an off color joke when responding to rubio s jab at his supposedly small hands he hit my hands nobody has ever hit my hands if they re small something else must be small i guarantee you there s no problem despite resistance to trump from senior gop figures super tuesday showed primary voters once again breaking in huge numbers for trump s campaign delivering him seven state victories out of 11 and building his already substantial delegate lead over his rivals the field thinned again after super tuesday with retired neurosurgeon ben carson saying he sees no path to the nomination and while stopping short of suspending his campaign sitting out thursday s debate in detroit each of the remaining candidates is continuing to campaign undeterred by trump s dominance on super tuesday and his delegate lead cruz won three states including his home state of texas on tuesday rubio won his first in minnesota kasich has not won any but is banking on his home state s primary on march 15 cruz has openly applied pressure on the two other candidates to
