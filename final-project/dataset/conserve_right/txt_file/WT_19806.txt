apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap what s so stunning about former house speaker paul ryan s new admissions regarding president donald trump is that his story is now so ordinary ryan decided to leave washington as relayed in a new book american carnage by tim alberta rather than endure two more years of the trump presidency the disclosures portray the once rising gop star as deeply conflicted in the age of trump saying one thing in public but thinking another in private as he tried and ultimately failed to serve alongside the president top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century i m telling you he didn t know anything about government ryan says in the book i wanted to scold him all the time what i learned as i went on to scratch that itch i had to do it in private so i did it in private all the time and he actually ended up kind of appreciating it ryan s story is remarkable but not rare trump s critics in the gop are increasingly unwilling or unable to speak their minds publicly about the president for fear of enduring his wrath or that of his constituents the silence of republicans takes on new significance as trump seeks a second term potentially deepening his hold on the party those of us around him really helped to stop him from making bad decisions all the time said ryan who stepped down after nearly two decades in washington in the book we helped him make much better decisions which were contrary to kind of what his knee jerk reaction was now i think he s making some of these knee jerk reactions trump shot back friday lashing out at the former speaker as a baby and a terrible speaker trump unleashed his criticism on one of wisconsin s favorite sons just before leaving washington to visit the state which he wants to win again in 2020 he called the retired congressman s record atrocious despite ryan s work in securing trump s main domestic policy achievement the gop tax bill paul ryan let us down paul ryan was a terrible speaker trump told reporters on the south lawn he didn t know what the hell he was doing this is the dilemma facing republicans in the age of trump if they disagree with the president they face consequences if they stay close they often must contort their political preferences to fit his unpredictable actions if they decide to leave as ryan did they lose part of their platform to influence and shape the white house one republican congressman said friday that on capitol hill and beyond everyone is in on the joke they take the good with the bad with this president and find their own way in trump s party said the congressman who was granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking but the style and substance of trump s mercurial presidency has so disrupted political norms and standard operations that some of the party s once ascending members are like ryan taking leave he s not alone said flake who retired early rather than run for reelection alongside trump i could not stand on a campaign stage with the president when people shouted lock her up and i m not alone in that the arizonan said by phone friday the problem isn t just trump it s trumpism unfortunately it s a virus that s infected not just the republican party but the democratic party as well trump s allies scoff at those who struggle to find their way in today s gop saying the white house has an open door and welcomes wide ranging views there s room for a difference of opinion and to be passionate about it said rep mark meadows r n c a trump confidant but you don t have to be personal with your attacks and i think that s the difference meadows said voters back home are watching to see if what lawmakers say when they campaign beside trump is backed up by their work in congress some members enjoy running as a pro trump republican only to not support that title when they re here in washington d c he said rep patrick mchenry r n c who had been part of the house gop s leadership team said if you want to have an adversarial role then this administration will treat you as an adversary and if you want to be a friend of the administration and have constructive criticism they will take it they will listen ryan is
