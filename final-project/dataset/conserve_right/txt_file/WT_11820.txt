should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion as the united nations wrapped up its recent climate conference in bonn talks organizer christiana figueres proclaimed that climate change is the the most important negotiation the world has ever faced faced with real problems financial meltdowns unemployment war and genuine human suffering the world no longer agrees it s a good thing human productivity doesn t threaten the global thermostat the way the u n would have us believe if it did we d be cooked countries rich and poor are backing away from commitments they made years ago during rosier economic times before the public became aware of climategate renewable energy costs and genuine debate the kyoto protocol the only binding international agreement signed since the global warming scare began expires after 2012 canada russia and japan have declared they will not renew china and the united states never signed it and the u s has made it plain it is not about to and poor countries are becoming less enamored about signing on as they realize hard economic times mean there will be little climate mitigation and restitution money coming their way from formerly rich countries top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots even die hard warmists increasingly recognize that bureaucratic solutions hatched at these conferences are rife with waste fraud and abuse they may enrich a few but they are powerless to control earth s climate in march german investigators reported that 850 million euros disappeared when shady companies swarmed into carbon trading emissions and energy businesses criminal enterprises raked in tens of millions fended off regulators with delaying tactics and then announced bankruptcy or vanished an italian sting operation resulted in arrests of wind farm developers who billed the country for subsidies but never produced a kilowatt of electricity london s liberal guardian newspaper was aghast to learn that the world bank s biocarbon fund had arranged to pay european entrepreneurs 1 million to establish a system under which 60 000 kenyans would restrict themselves to farming under rigidly controlled inefficient sustainable techniques for that they will receive 1 4 million over 20 years that s right the beneficent world bank will enrich more europeans so 60 000 kenyans can receive 23 83 apiece for 20 years of drudgery poverty and misery a princely 1 19 a year even the european union finally understands how little bureaucracy and energy deprivation dictates the climate it is not enough for the eu to simply sign up for another commitment period eu climate representative jurgen lefevere admitted we only represent 11 percent of global emissions burning fossil fuels contributes only a fraction of total annual atmospheric carbon dioxide buildup and the eu contributes just 11 percent of that the eu s commitment to slashing co2 emissions by 20 percent invites corruption has no control over chinese or indian emissions and has no effect on the climate the biggest divide evident in bonn was between the united states and large emerging economies even obama administration officials who are thoroughly committed to man made global warming catastrophe claims finally recognize the fraud problem in bonn the u s insisted that all countries subject their emission reduction claims to verification however china will accept only an agreement that lacks verification and guarantees the right to cheat meanwhile the chinese are happy to be the world s leader in manufacturing wind turbines 95 percent which they gladly sell to guilt ridden western countries china and other nations support the notion that prosperous countries owe the world restitution for the sin of engaging in the industrial revolution and becoming prosperous we can only hope some nation s representative will have the courage to remind china and its fellow climate travelers that the west never forced them to spend 50 years mired in communism bureaucracy and stagnation while it is encouraging that the global warming camp no longer has things entirely its own way celebration would be premature for all the gnashing of teeth and complaining about corporate influence we hear from global warming bureaucrats and campaigners the truth is that today the warmists are the establishment billions are being redistributed to researchers developing nations carbon speculators alternative energy investors and other carbon profiteers who would like to turn billions into trillions pity the poor carbon traders whose markets expire with kyoto not all have their villa in the sun yet but rest assured they will do whatever is necessary to get theirs big warming will not surrender its hold on western taxpayers without a fight the warmist camp plans to retake the initiative at the december u n conference in durban south africa it intends to turn back the clock to the time when the media would attribute any weather or nature event to global warming without question or critical examination al gore s recent rolling stone diatribe essentially calls on the media to censure climate disaster skeptics and adopt a one sided man made warming narrative the new york times may go along but the huge and growing alternative media will not this week s heartland institute international conference of climate alarm skeptics in washington will only reinforce the lack of evidence for man made armageddon and the disastrous consequences of staying the current u n course many believe the last minute appearance by dozens of world leaders crippled the copenhagen climate conference but with the big names absent from cancun mexico and now bonn the u n wants them back ms figueres capped the bonn conference with a call for high level political attention if she succeeds just imagine the mischief a gathering of heads of state foreign ministers bureaucrats researchers green campaigners and carbon profiteers can do at an african beach resort then imagine how nearly impossible it will be to repair the harm they inflict action must be taken to avert such a result david rothbard is president of the committee for a constructive tomorrow craig rucker is cfact s executive
