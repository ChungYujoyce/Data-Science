conflicted over whether hillary clinton can take on republican presidential front runner donald trump in the general election with some fearing she provides too much ammunition for the flamboyant businessman s style of attack while mr trump is leading the national polls and calling the shots in what s become a circuslike gop primary season mrs clinton tops a sedentary democratic race with two other opponents respectfully nipping at her without doing much damage and party stalwarts are happy to have it that way i hear a lot of people saying you know i ve watched the democratic debates and the republican debates and they re so different i m sure glad i m on the democratic side and they re talking about the issues they don t always agree with one another but they explain why said david allen a democratic party leader in barnstead new hampshire democrats have resolved themselves to not go into a circus and tear one another down photos top 10 handguns in the u s but mr allen said he does worry about how the eventual democratic nominee will stand up to the sort of withering barbs mr trump has dished out to his own side we re going to start to have to look at how the democratic candidates play against donald trump because he s certainly holding onto his lead in the republican party and he has certainly played the republican candidates in a way that has hurt some of his opposition and i think people are going to start asking all right who s going to stand up under his type of campaigning mr allen said if bernie sanders is the candidate trump will play up how un american socialism is and if hillary gets it he will dig up everything in the past 40 years and use it and won t mince words in using it other activists say there s a sense that while it s mrs clinton s turn to run there s no swell of on the ground enthusiasm for her to carry the party s banner into the general election photos conservatives in hollywood celebrities who lean right i don t think the democratic primary race has generated all that much intensity said ron romine chairman of the spartanburg south carolina democrats who is neutral in the race i don t feel like anywhere in the state there s all that much passion the usual suspects will go out and vote but there s not an intensity that you might think there should be with the first woman hillary is so familiar she s been around forever she has her supporters and they re going to go out and vote for her so there s not a whole lot to parse out he said you either like her or you re not enthusiastic mr trump already has started taking aim at mrs clinton just as some activists had feared at a rally in south carolina on wednesday the billionaire real estate mogul declared war on the clintons as he explained why he wouldn t attack mrs clinton as low energy the term he used to devastate his gop rival former florida gov jeb bush i just don t like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies because i consider them enemies mr trump said we view this as war don t we view this as war it s war it s war bothered by mrs clinton s accusation that he has a penchant for sexism mr trump continued to attack her husband former president bill clinton saying he was one of the great abusers of women of the world the clinton camp this week said they would stand up to mr trump deputy communications director christina reynolds said in a statement that hillary clinton will stand up to him as she has from the beginning citing mr trump s demeaning remarks about women immigrants asian americans muslims the disabled or hard working americans adding that he has pushed around nearly all of his fellow republicans mrs clinton s own supporters seem unfazed by the threat of mr trump i expected that to come up no matter who the republican candidate was and the bill clinton past i m not the least bit surprised said bonnie chehames who is campaigning for mrs clinton in new hampshire i can t imagine trump beating hillary clinton and i don t care what the polls say the republican party will be fractured if trump s nominated and that s good for the democrats she also said mr trump s candidacy has helped mrs clinton by taking press attention away from her during the primary season the media isn t really poking at her with negative comments if donald trump were not the media superstar darling that he is i m sure that wouldn t be the case mrs chehames said still support for mrs clinton as the democrats champion in the general election remains lukewarm especially among supporters of mr sanders her chief rival who cite many of the same criticisms as mr trump in arguing against her nomination i just don t trust her said jason frerichs the democratic party leader in montgomery county iowa i m a progressive that s my value and that s what i want i don t need an ideological purity test i just don t trust her she s pivoted on too many issues important to me i m 38 and earn 45 000 a year how can she understand what my life is like she s a millionaire she s a career politician i just don t see much excitement for her outside the baby boomers who think it s her time mr frerichs who is caucusing for mr sanders said he understands mr trump s followers and believes mrs clinton will struggle against him because she can t match his charisma and doesn t invoke any emotional connection or ties with her supporters bernie s popular for the same reason why donald trump is popular people are sick and tired of the same old politicians he said he said he would vote for mrs clinton if she wins the democratic nomination but he refuses to campaign for her i think we would see a low voter turnout with democrats in the general election she just doesn t fire up the base mr frerichs said now i could be wrong and many women could come out just because she s a woman but most of the young women i see are caucusing for bernie copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission
