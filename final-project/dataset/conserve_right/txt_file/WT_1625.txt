they re doing it to you again bernie they re doing it to you again former mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana edged out mr sanders in the iowa caucuses though both campaigns have requested a limited recanvass of certain precincts after technical errors marred the process and caused a nearly weeklong delay in tallying final results sanders supporters are still sore about 2016 when it was revealed that top democratic party officials discussed undermining mr sanders in his battle for the party s presidential nomination against hillary clinton mr trump also recited the poem the snake a mainstay from his own 2016 campaign i used to do this a lot and people couldn t get enough of it to be honest with you he said i haven t done it for a while and i want to do it tonight because you re

trump needed this job like a hole in the head why d he do it for all of you the president came within a whisker of defeating hillary clinton in new hampshire in the general election though a republican presidential candidate hasn t carried the state since 2000 you have some pretty strange election laws here right remember last time we won the primary tremendously the president said we should have won the general election but they had buses being shipped up from massachusetts now you get prosecuted if you do what they did but we have done great this has been an incredible state for us just great people and we hear that they re good because you have crossovers in primaries don t you he said lines to get into the venue snaked down the surrounding streets as people queued up to make sure they got a chance to see the president the arena size crowd dwarfed the number of attendees the 2020 democratic candidates have been drawing to their events around the state at various schools and community colleges there was a similar crowd in the same venue for the new hampshire democratic party s mcintyre shaheen 100 club dinner on saturday though that event featured about a dozen of the democratic presidential contenders mr sanders drew more than 7 500 people to his own election eve campaign event in durham his campaign said it was the largest crowd of any candidate in the race in new hampshire the vermont senator said mr trump was in the state the night before the primary because he s scared we will show donald trump his hatred is no longer welcome by winning in new hampshire defeating him in a general election and transforming this country he said mr buttigieg s campaign touted that he collectively drew more than 5 000 people to four events across the state sunday supporters of the president said they saw his election eve rally as a way to mess with the democrats ahead of a make or break primary for much of the field it s brilliant absolutely brilliant look at the crowd here said janet hansen of hooksett n h who said she would be working at the polls tuesday it s a mess really the democrats are just in disarray i don t think they can put up anybody that s really going to be able to defeat him she said if i were a democrat i d probably vote for somebody like tulsi gabbard but she wouldn t have a chance probably michael griffin of east bridgewater mass said mr trump is just in the heads of the other side every single thing that they try to do to him the russia thing he wins the impeachment thing he wins said mr griffin 57 a fraud investigator they don t know what to do with him he s driving em crazy every single thing they try he just comes out smelling like roses he said people don t understand what a great salesman mr trump is this guy could sell ice to eskimos i watch him sometimes and i m just in total awe mr griffin said ken murphy a letter carrier from massachusetts chuckled at the prospect of mr trump s messing with the other side with the rally takes it away from the dems he said i love it i love it he s no dummy this guy mr murphy didn t put much stock in the 2020 democratic field he said the struggling joseph r biden likely would have self imploded even without mr trump s pressing the issue of his son hunter biden s business ties in ukraine which was at the heart of the impeachment case against the president i think his senility s coming in the guy can barely speak he said dave bo
