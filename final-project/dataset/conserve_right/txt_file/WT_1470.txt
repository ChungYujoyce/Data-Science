jail for business owners for violations or a regulated business could lose their license to operate abbott s new order also means cities like houston and austin which have required people wear to

opening texas must occur in phases americans remain overwhelmingly in favor of stay at home orders and other efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus according to a survey from the associated press norc center for public affairs research a majority of americans also say it won t be safe to lift social distancing guidelines anytime soon according to state health officials texas had more than 25 200 confirmed cases of covid 19 as of monday with 663 deaths and more than 11 100 deemed recovered the number of infections is likely higher because many people have not been tested and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick for most people the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks for some especially older adults and those with existing health problems it can cause more severe illness and be life threatening associated press reporters nomaan merchant and juan a lozano in houston and terry wallace in dallas contributed to
