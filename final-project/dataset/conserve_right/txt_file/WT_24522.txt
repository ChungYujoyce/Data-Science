president trump s staunchest supporters wince at times over some of his tweets but in deciding whether to vote for him in 2020 those who ignore his success with the economy and defeat of the isis caliphate and instead focus on his comments might keep in mind what many of our presidents have really been like mr trump s comments that intentionally or not occasionally provoke outrage do not compare with the recklessness of john f kennedy the criminal cover up known as watergate that richard nixon engaged in the bizarre behavior of lyndon johnson or the repugnant conduct of bill clinton as revealed in my book the first family detail secret service agents assigned to protect kennedy soon learned that he led a double life he was the charismatic leader of the free world but in his other life he was the cheating reckless husband whose aides snuck women into the white house to appease his sexual appetite top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time besides one night stands kennedy had several consorts within the white house one was pamela turnure who had been his secretary when he was a senator then became jackie s press secretary in the white house two others priscilla wear and jill cowen were secretaries who were known as fiddle and faddle respectively neither did much work says former agent larry newman who was on the kennedy detail they would have threesomes with kennedy if secret service agents found kennedy to be reckless lyndon b johnson was uncouth nasty and often drunk while president johnson had affairs with several of his young fetching secretaries at one point lady bird johnson caught him having sex on a sofa in the oval office with one of his secretaries johnson became furious at the secret service for not warning him air force one crew members say johnson often closed the door to his stateroom and spent hours locked in with a pretty secretary even when his wife was on board johnson would come on the plane air force one and the minute he got out of sight of the crowds he would stand in the doorway and grin from ear to ear and say you dumb sons of bitches i piss on all of you recalls robert m macmillan an air force one steward then he would strip naked even in front of his daughters often inebriated johnson stashed bottles of whiskey in his car at the ranch one evening when he was president he came back to the white house drunk screaming that the lights were on a waste of electricity he is the only president i have seen who was drunk says frederick h walzel a former chief of the white house branch of

to blacks with the n word on air force one johnson was discussing his proposed civil rights bill with two governors explaining why it was so important to him mr macmillan remembers that johnson said
