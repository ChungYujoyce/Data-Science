apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic an experimental scramjet powered ultrahigh speed strike vehicle is emerging as the pentagon s main choice for a new long range rapid attack weapon a senior pentagon official says alan r shaffer principal deputy assistant defense secretary for research and engineering told a defense industry conference that prototypes and recent tests proved concepts for hypersonic arms and several systems are part of a high priority effort by pentagon weapons developers despite the era of sharply diminished defense spending hypersonic vehicles can deliver nuclear or conventional payloads in precision strikes against increasingly hard to penetrate air defenses of countries like china russia and iran he said photos awesome rifles the best and the baddest we the u s do not want to be the second country to understand how to have controlled scramjet hypersonics mr shaffer told the precision strike association s annual review on tuesday the comments come 2 1 2 months after china s surprise jan 9 test of a new hypersonic glide vehicle dubbed the wu 14 that ultrahigh speed maneuvering vehicle test represents a major challenge for current u s missile defenses which are designed to counter non maneuvering ballistic missile threats lee fuell a technical intelligence specialist with the air force national air and space intelligence center told a congressional china commission hearing jan 31 that china s hypersonic glide vehicle is a ballistic missile launched system that glides and maneuvers to its target at speeds up to mach 10 about 7 611 mph photos michelle malia sasha obama tour china on taxpayer dime at this point we think that s associated with their nuclear deterrent forces said mr fuell who noted the chinese could use the system with conventional warheads for long range precision strikes mr shaffer declined to comment on how the chinese hypersonic test has changed u s plans for hypersonic weapons but the senior weapons research official said the pentagon s most promising hypersonic vehicle is the x 51 a cruise missile sized weapon powered by an advanced engine called a scramjet the x 51 developed by boeing flies at up to 3 882 mph or mach 5 1 and is launched from under the wing of a b 52 bomber the experimental aircraft is a good candidate to win this year s collier trophy the annual award recognizing the most significant recent achievement in air or space flight mr shaffer said mr shaffer said hypersonic weapons when fully developed will be less expensive than current jets and cruise missiles powered by complex turbine engines with many parts a scramjet or supersonic combusting ramjet hypersonic vehicle has few moving parts after three difficult tests including one described awkwardly by testers as an un ignition event the x 51 scored a breakthrough last year during a successful flight test the vehicle flew for just 300 seconds but traveled several thousand miles and reached a height of 80 000 feet considered near space at over mach 5 it s the second time we have shown a scramjet can ignite and give positive acceleration mr shaffer said that is a huge deal that means we are now starting to understand hypersonics the next step is for weapons engineers to make the system affordable and mr shaffer urged engineers to tackle the problem another hypersonic weapon on the pentagon s drawing board is the htv 2 or hypersonic technology vehicle that is boosted by a missile like the chinese wu 14 and then maneuvers and glides to its target at very high speeds mr shaffer said that system in tests flew a long distance at very high speeds and made a controlled re entry despite not meeting test goals the tests generated substantial data another system is the army s advanced hypersonic weapon a missile launched glide vehicle that had a successful test it will fly at speeds faster than mach 5 a fourth system is the hypersonic international flight research experimentation program or hifire a mach 8 weapon being developed with australia a briefing slide during mr shaffer s talk emphasized the benefits of hypersonic weapons as long range high speed and effective payloads the weapons will provide rapid responsive strike in anti access access denied environments the pentagon euphemism for china s high technology weapons designed to push u s forces out of asia kiev russian subversion russia s military forces are not the only problem for ukraine reports from the region indicate that russian saboteurs are working to foment instability and increase pro russian sentiment especially in the eastern part of the former soviet republic ukrainian justice minister pavlo petrenko told reporters monday in kiev that security services are seeking to counter russian sabotage groups in the southern and eastern regions mr petrenko said intelligence has identified specially trained sabotage groups for destabilizing the situation in the southern and eastern regions the groups are engaged in subversion he said at present ukraine s security services are working out special measures for the liquidation and detention of these sabotage groups that are operating in the east mr petrenko said according to the kiev online news outlet ukrainska pravda the minister denounced members of the crimea legislature following sunday s vote of independence from ukraine and russia s expected annexation of the crimean peninsula the security service of ukraine internal security forces known as sbu told the unian news agency friday that it had captured a russian gru military intelligence officer as part of a sweep of subversives the agent was arrested at a checkpoint near kherson north of crimea and was armed with an akc 74 assault rifle and five magazines he was dressed in the black uniform of the russian special operations forces but without any russian military insignia the foreigner had on him several ids issued for different names the security service said in a statement the sbu obtained a document confirming that the detainee is an employee of the military intelligence of the russian armed forces the service said the russian was engaged in intelligence gathering and subversion in the kherson region military analysts said the captured commando is likely part of the two main military forces that took over the crimea in early march those forces have been identified as elements of russian 76th guards air assault division based in pskov near st petersburg and a gru special operations unit based at kubinka near moscow black clad spetsnaz commandos with no russian military insignia also conducted operations in chechnya in 1994 saudis shift east from u s saudi arabia is moving away from its long close relationship with the u s as a result of the obama administration s policies in the middle east instead of relying on the u s riyadh is moving closer to the pakistan fueling new concerns about a secret agreement between the two states to share pakistan s nuclear weapons in a future crisis or conflict saudi crown prince and defense minister salman bin abd al aziz al saud visited pakistan last month and reports of the visit indicate the saudis are looking at buying chinese designed jf 17 multi role combat fighter from pakistan this year additionally saudi deputy defense minister prince salman bin sultan reportedly visited pakistan s heavy industries taxila regarding a deal to purchase the chinese pakistani al khalid tank newsweek reported in january that the saudis also secretly purchased medium range df 21 missiles from china in 2007 the road mobile df 21 is one of china s most advanced systems and the new missile reportedly is meant to upgrade riyadh s aging df 5 intermediate range missiles nuclear capable weapons that analysts say are not accurate enough to be useful for conventional warheads the df 21 by contrast is the basis for china s advanced df 21d a precision guided ballistic missile capable of hitting u s aircraft carriers at sea the shift in military alignment away from the united states and toward china and pakistan is being read in washington as a sign of saudi arabia s anger over certain u s policies the saudis are not happy with the u s led talks with iran that have legitimatized tehran s uranium enrichment the two countries also differ on how to deal with the civil war in syria the saudis also are said to be upset at the declining interest by the u s in middle east affairs and the tendency of the obama administration to mishandle its friends and allies while reaching out to enemies in the region con
