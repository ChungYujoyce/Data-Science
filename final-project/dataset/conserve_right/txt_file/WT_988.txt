apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic so have you ever heard of femocrats the term has been around since the late 1980s and designates a female government official who advocates feminist policies according to the oxford dictionary or alternatively women who vote for a female candidate regardless of platform or position because she is female this according to the urban dictionary but wait the cultural and political influence of this designation could be on the wane as weary voters cringe over feminist rhetoric which may not yield much now comes a timely new essay from amber athey white house correspondent for the daily caller it is titled the sad death of the femocrats and makes the case that the novelty of a female presidential candidate has worn thin and that being a woman is no longer the primary qualification you also have to be good enough to win ms athey writes in spectator usa referring primarily to the democratic ladies who are indeed running for u s president at the moment top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time none of these women will be prepared to go up against the brash and unfiltered trump and democratic voters are getting sick of watching so called empowered women explain away their failures as bigotry the femocrats have used their gender to avoid grappling with the fact that their political styles and personalities have

jones and billy eichner as journalist matt drudge and one more thing ms lewinsky the news organization says is one of the producers an avalanche of liberal bias there is so much biased reporting emanating from the impeachment process against president trump that the media research center has designated an entire new section to chronicle all the liberal rants by major news organizations and individual journalists alike the section now contains some 600 analytical reports from the conservative media watchdog s very canny and tireless staff some of the reports are not just disquieting they are downright alarming the impeachment trial of donald trump should begin with an indictment of the media the alleged crime committed by president trump revolves around his request that the president of ukraine investigate the shady business dealings of hunter biden with a corrupt ukrainian oil and gas company that investigation might have been unnecessary had the news media chosen to do what they re supposed to be doing investigative journalism write brent bozell founder of the organization and tim graham the center s director of media analysis why would trump have to ask a foreign official for an investigation into biden sleaze because when politicians have a d next to their name the idea of the press holding people accountable goes out the window it is unfathomable that the american news media would choose not to investigate the activities the two learned gents note romney s moment of clarity one utah republican has a prudent warning for democratic lawmakers who get too dramatic
