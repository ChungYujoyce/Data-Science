 sign in says health care mandate carries penalty manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong in the wake of the supreme court s ruling last week republicans on capitol hill spent four days laying out an attack on president obama s health care law as a massive tax increase on monday mitt romney s top campaign strategist undercut them eric fehrnstrom said mr romney agrees with mr obama that the law s punishment for flouting the individual mandate and not buying health insurance is a penalty not a tax just like the legislation mr romney signed as governor of massachusetts top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots you are not going to die from covid 19 russian fighter jets intercept u s navy patrol aircraft over mediterranean the governor has consistently described the mandate in massachusetts as a penalty mr fehrnstrom said on msnbc the governor disagreed with the ruling of the court he agreed with the dissent that was written by justice antonin scalia which clearly states the mandate was not a tax after watching the court reject their legal arguments congressional republicans settled for what they hoped would be a powerful political attack bolstered by the court s declaration that the individual mandate amounted to a tax the court s conclusion contradicted mr obama who during the debate in 2009 and 2010 had repeatedly said it wasn t a tax the court has now spoken it is a tax senate minority leader mitch mcconnell kentucky republican said in the aftermath of the ruling he said the justices blew the president s cover the national republican congressional committee began issuing press releases using the court approved tax argument to attack democrats after mr fehrnstrom s comments monday however activists said they had been undercut we did not like obamacare to start with and now that the supreme court has called it a tax it gave romney the room to run straight for a touchdown tea party nation founder judson phillips wrote on the group s blog what kind of idiots are running the romney campaign instead of spiking the football and winning the romney campaign has just turned over the ball he wondered whether it was too late for the gop to have a brokered convention and replace mr romney as its presidential nominee one it was a stupid thing to say said ben marchi former director of the virginia chapter of the anti tax group americans for prosperity at the end of the day whether you call it a tax or a fee it means more money out of working americans pockets in tough economic times people who don t have jobs right now don t care whether you call it a tax or a fee still he hoped conservatives would rally to mr romney anyway conservatives don t trust him because he s the author of romneycare conservatives trust him because he s pledged to repeal obamacare mr marchi said mr mcconnell s office didn t address the conflicting republican messages choosing instead to focus on an area where the senate minority leader agreed with mr romney the supreme court should have ruled obamacare unconstitutional a spokesman said mr romney signed a health law in massachusetts that included a mandate similar to the obama reforms requiring everyone to buy insurance and imposing a fine on those who didn t justice ruth bader ginsburg even cited mr romney s law as backing for the national law in her concurring opinion last week but mr romney has vowed to repeal the federal law saying it goes beyond the powers of the federal government and saying states should be left to experiment at this point mr romney and mr obama agree that the mandate is not a tax putting them in opposition to congressional republicans but mr romney and mr obama disagree over whether the law is constitutional mr romney won backing from some gop quarters virginia attorney general kenneth t cuccinelli ii who filed one of the key lawsuits against the national health care law told the washington times that mr romney is correct to argue that the penalty isn t a tax they upheld the law by expanding any known definition of the taxing power very dramatically mr cuccinelli said for those who want to deny it s a tax then they have to essentially concede that it s unconstitutional under any other power the romney campaign also tried to frame the issue as a problem for mr obama the supreme court left president obama with two choices the federal individual mandate in obamacare is either a constitutional tax or an unconstitutional penalty spokeswoman amanda henneberg said gov romney thinks it is an unconstitutional penalty what is president obama s position is his federal mandate unconstitutional or is it a tax during the primary election campaign mr romney s opponents attacked him as the wrong messenger for republicans to take into a general election battle that they hoped would make a referendum on the health care law those opponents said mr romney as the man who signed an individual mandate plan in massachusetts didn t have the credibility to attack mr obama on monday they said those fears were borne out romney s team still hasn t solved their most fundamental problem how to attack obama s health care policies while continuing to embrace their own said matt latimer a speechwriter for president george w bush administration who briefly advised newt gingrich s presidential campaign mr romney s primary opponents warned all along that the governor s own record on health care would make him a flawed candidate mr latimer said his campaign s remarks today totally undercutting the republican line of attack on obamacare only prove that point seth
