 the last time the marquette law school surveyed the governor s race in wisconsin scott walker led his democratic opponent mary burke by seven percentage points today his lead has all but disappeared he s tied with her 46 46 among those registered to vote with a small number of respondents six percent still undecided that represents a significant tightening of the race from the most recent marquette law school poll in march which walker led 48 41 a few possible reasons for why the race is so close women in march gov walker split this crucial demographic down the middle 48 48 now he s underwater by an alarming margin 49 41 he does however still maintain a significant lead among men 52 42 although that lead is not nearly as pronounced as it once was two months ago 52 37 young people voters between the ages of 18 and 44 now strongly prefer the democrat in the race walker once dominated this demographic 49 38 but not anymore his numbers have slumped considerably as he now trails in this category by 10 percentage points 51 41 now it s true that he s expanded his lead 49 42 among voters 45 and older but at some point he ll need to tap into the youth vote if he wants to win re election this fall name recognition the last time marquette s pollsters surveyed this race most respondents didn t even know who mary burke was and indeed they still don t but only 51 percent of respondents now say they have never heard of her or know too little about her to view her favorably or unfavorably compared to 59 percent in march her favorability ratings though have risen markedly quoth the pollsters twenty seven percent have a favorable opinion and 22 percent an unfavorable opinion of her in march 19 percent were favorable and 22 percent unfavorable the sample the d r i sample breakdown two months ago was 27 25 44 this week s offering was 32 24 41 in other words many more self described democrats participated in this survey than the last one is this why the race is a now a dead heat meanwhile exit polls show that in 2010 when walker first won state wide office the d r i split in wisconsin was 37 36 27 this suggests perhaps that if walker can turn out the gop base in 2014 as he did in 2010 he ll likely win re election turnout is one of the biggest unknowns of the fall election one of the marquette pollsters said between now and election day some voters will become more engaged by the election while others may lose interest these results show that the election outcome can change depending on turnout as both parties seek to mobilize their supporters let the games begin alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist twitter fact checks a pair of president trump s tweets update trump responds townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
