fusion s bank records he wanted to determine who bankrolled a partisan unproven dossier that has become such a large part of the fbi s congress and journalists investigations the nunes subpoena forced the law firm perkins coie to admit that the democratic national committee and the hillary clinton campaign paid the bills the money went from democrats to perkins coie to fusion to british ex spy christopher steele who then paid kremlin sources for dirt on mr trump none of mr steele s core charges of collusion has been publicly confirmed fusion and the house at first worked out a deal for relevant banks records but house lawyers say they learned that fusion withheld 112 transactions pertinent to the probe the suspect transactions house lawyers say deal with two russia issues one is the dossier the other is fusion s payments from another law firm bakerhostetler that money came from the russian firm prevezon holdings which is lobbying washington to repeal a law that brought stiff

relationship with fusion gps the house filings states fusion s attorneys did not hide their disapproval of what they called mr nunes fishing expedition and mccarthy like tactics if they had not filed suit the said the committee would have happily prowled through all of fusion s banking records and used them for no purpose other than to inflict harm we respectfully submit that committee republicans are using these overbroad demands to punish fusion for having investigated mr trump the attorneys asserted that fusion enjoys a first amendment right to associate freely with clients and contractors on political and other matters and a first amendment right to engage in those client activities when they further political and commercial speech house attorneys argued fusion has no such rights it is instead a profit maximizing hired gun selling its investigative services to the highest bidder they said fusion s goal to be highly compensated for its work is not protected associational interest
