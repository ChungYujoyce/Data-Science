tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn former vice president joseph r biden quickly consolidated his lead in polls in the democratic presidential contest as he and president trump seem intent on skipping the primaries and declaring the 2020 race a two man affair within days of entering the race mr biden surged to the front of the crowded field with more than 35 support and a double digit lead over his closest competitors according to three polls released tuesday the polling bounce confirmed a growing belief among democratic voters that mr biden is uniquely equipped to beat mr trump in 2020 see also biden should make one term pledge say 2020 campaign supporters mr trump also took note of the biden campaign launch he fired back at mr biden s attacks on his moral character and his leadership after ignoring similar jabs from the other democratic hopefuls the middle class is booming now despite what joe biden says white house counselor kellyanne conway told reporters at the white house taking on mr biden s claim that workers are hurting and disrespected in the trump era mrs conway provided a preview of a possible general election debate with the former vice president he also sounds like someone who wasn t vice president for eight years he s got this whole list of grievances of what s wrong with the country as if he didn t work in this building for eight years we inherited that mess she said mr trump has repeatedly hit mr biden since he entered the race dubbing him sleepy joe and mocking him for holding his campaign kickoff in pennsylvania in 2016 mr trump put pennsylvania in the republican column for the first time since 1988 and he will need to keep it there to win a second term in 2020 he obviously doesn t know that pennsylvania is having one of the best economic years in its history with lowest unemployment ever a now thriving steel industry that was dead great future the president tweeted right out of the gate mr biden has acted as if he were the inevitable nominee he described his candidacy as a challenge to the racism and bigotry that he said defined the trump presidency give eight years to this administration in the white house we re going to forever and fundamentally change the character of the country he said tuesday on the stump in iowa we can t afford four more years of this mr trump s critics said the president s rapid response revealed that he is afraid of facing mr biden in 2020 that follows mr biden s argument that his popularity with labor unions makes him a threat to the blue collar support mr trump needs in pennsylvania ohio wisconsin and michigan to remain in the white house republican strategist chris wilson said the counterpunching is classic trump while it reinforces mr biden s image as the democrats standard bearer he said it also softens him for a possible 2020 showdown i don t think engaging biden at this point is a bad move he is the democratic front runner even if he s not a prohibitive favorite mr wilson said giving him free shots unanswered would basically be letting him start running a general election campaign now and then joining in later and giving your opponent months of unanswered messaging is never a good strategy for mr biden there are obvious advantages to focusing on mr trump and ignoring the other candidates for the democratic nomination he avoids clashing with rivals over a litany of thorny issues in his record from 36 years in the senate and two terms in the white house and the longer he monopolizes news coverage in the race the more his claim to inevitability becomes a self fulfilling prophecy sen bernard sanders of vermont the champion of the party s far left who has vied as a front runner attempted to blunt mr biden s rise he made several appearances on tv news shows in recent days to highlight mr biden s votes for the iraq war the north american free trade agreement trade deals with china and wall street deregulation all votes frowned upon by liberals mr biden is banking on democratic primary voters being more concerned with electability than liberal orthodoxy tim malloy assistant director of the quinnipiac university poll said its survey shows that mr biden has a winning message so far the democratic primary race suddenly gets real with a fast start by former vice president joe biden and a very clear indication from voters that he is the only candidate who can send president trump packing 18 months from now he said the quinnipiac poll showed mr biden with 38 of the vote followed by sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts with 12 and mr sanders with 11 mr biden was up 10 points from the same poll a month ago he led with 39 in a cnn poll a 10 point jump from last month he was trailed by mr sanders with 15 and ms warren with 8 a morning consult poll put mr biden out front with 36 mr sanders in second with 22 and ms warren a distant third with 9 mr biden gained 6 points in the weekly morning consult survey ms warren like mr sanders a far left candidate has gained traction in polls she advanced into second or third place after strong performances last week at two candidate forums and the rollout
