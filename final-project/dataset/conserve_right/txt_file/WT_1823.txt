apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic americans have been getting a serious civics lesson over the past month as they turn to washington for answers to the coronavirus crisis only to find out their state governors have far more control over what goes on in their daily lives state and local authorities are the ones making decisions about shutting down businesses and allocating medical equipment to hospitals it s the system the country s founders designed though it seems anachronistic to many while a deadly disease pushes past all national and state boundaries top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender in our federal system the federal government exists to support the actions of state and local governments said thomas a birkland an associate dean at north carolina state university the federal government doesn t run the fire department the local governments run the fire department in most cases that also means the chief executive a governor or in some cases a mayor is wielding the power congress has been reduced to the role of banker capitol hill fought over the size and scope of a 2 2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package once lawmakers approved it they retreated to their homes and left the washington stage to president trump the president is cloaking himself in the trappings of power with daily trips to the lectern in the white house briefing room making pronouncements and fielding questions but one former white house official pointed out that most of what the president says about covid 19 the disease caused by the new coronavirus is conjecture or suggestions for behavior he can t compel governors or even citizens to act one exception where the president does have power is the military thus the deployment of navy hospital ships to covid 19 hot spots he also is doling out the largesse that congress has appropriated and stiffening security to prevent incoming flights and to return illegal border crossers quickly mr trump has said he is pondering broader travel restrictions inside the u s but ilya somin a law professor at george mason university said there is debate about whether he has the power to order such a move if he did try to do that it would be complicated mr somin said not all governors are happy with the situation that has fallen on their shoulders michigan gov gretchen whitmer a democrat told fox news sunday that a single national strategy could end the epidemic faster the federal system also leaves governors bidding with one another for scarce medical equipment from the private sector at the white house reporters have been indignant that mr trump hasn t stepped in to force a national policy we have a thing called the constitution the president reminded them saturday as he defended governors who haven t issued shutdown orders i want the governors to be running things governors are indeed running things and they have produced wildly different policies rhode island gov gina raimondo a democrat told state troopers to stop out of state vehicles and order occupants to self quarantine if they plan to remain in the state more than a dozen other states have requested quarantine periods for out of state visitors with varying degrees of compulsion even within states authorities are experimenting dare county in north carolina home to some of the most popular outer banks resorts has declared a full ban on any outsiders entering that includes vacation home owners who don t reside in the county permanently officials said despite that dare reported its fifth covid 19 case saturday in a population of about 37 000 on the other side of the ledger nine states don t have stay at home orders for residents mr birkland at north carolina state university said that s federalism at work every state is going to have a different set of needs and a different take on what their situation is he said and then every governor is probably going to have a different calculus about what the risks and benefits of certain actions are going to be even with the freedom to choose different paths governors are under intense pressure to adopt the same rules as everyone else most of them are complying figuring there is wisdom and perhaps political safety in numbers what remains to be seen is whether the crisis prompts a rethink of the federal structure or other aspects of power i m for more decentralization rather than less but i honestly don t know what the optimal level of centralization is on this issue mr somin told the washington times he said allowing states to set their own policies means one mistake won t affect the whole nation that s true for governors but also true for mr trump he said the worse the president performs the less people should want power to be concentrated in the white house but a pandemic also tests the usual strictures of federalism because one state s lax controls can end up leading to spread of infections in neighboring states mr somin said that s known as an externality which the divided federal system may not be prepared to accommodate house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat is asserting lawmakers rights of oversight she has announced a special investigative committee to watch how the administration handles the covid 19 outbreak and compared it to the truman committee which investigated spending on the war effort while world war ii was still raging the panel will root out waste fraud and abuse she said it will protect against price gouging and profiteering it will press to ensure that the federal response is based on the best possible science and guided by the nation s best health experts mr trump compared the investigative effort to democrats recently failed attempt to oust him through impeachment i want to remind everyone here in our nation s capital especially in congress that this is not the time for politics endless partisan investigations he said it s not any time for witch hunts it s time to get this enemy defeated mr birkland though said oversight is exactly the role congress can fill including an after action report on coordination between the federal government and the states to see where they cooperated where they clashed and what might be changed to deal with future crises mr somin said governments tend to impose emergency measures during a crisis and then keep those powers we should be more aware than some people seem to be of the dangers that can rise from that if the emergency powers are not rolled back after t
