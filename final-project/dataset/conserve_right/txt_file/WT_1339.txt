which left for the weekend on thursday as plans for quick passage in the house fell apart will be in on monday which will be the soonest the chamber could vote on the bill depending on what if any

otherwise would put senators and their staffers at risk of catching the virus unnecessarily we have been warned to limit unnecessary travel and gathering in large groups senators and staff are working to serve their states locally as best they can and with unanimous consent for these measures there is no valid reason to force extra travel this week he said in a statement however the fact that lawmakers passed this latest legislative fix without a price tag made it nearly impossible to push through the senate on a unanimous basis the chamber also needs to pass a bill to reauthorize and reform the foreign intelligence surveillance act parts of which expired sunday both mr mnuchin and mrs pelosi said they will start working on the next package this week the secretary wants the bill to specifically help sectors like the airline tourism and cruise industries mr mnuchin defended the strategy saying it wasn t like the auto and banking bailouts that were spurred by the recession in the early 2000 s if you re providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you re taking collateral and you have security that s not a bailout he said on fox news to the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted again our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted the total
