 remember how the president s major address this afternoon was supposed to contain a significant reframing of his economic message heading into november white house officials hyped this speech as a meaningful shift in rhetoric and approach even as they conceded the president s comments would contain no new ideas they were correct on the latter point but astonishingly the president didn t even follow through on the former pledge which was ostensibly the entire purpose of the speech obama essentially repackaged the exact same speech he delivered in april but inserted the names romney and bush a few more times same tendentious arguments same disingenuous analogies same examples same strawmen read all 6 300 words here i could waste my time writing another detailed rebuttal to all of the distortions and inanities embedded in today s presidential remarks but i ve already done so feel free to go back and read my april piece it really was thorough and took quite a long time to craft if you don t have the time to do so rest assured that this president has no new ideas nor any clue about how to effectively rebrand his stale ones the rnc is already having a field day rolling out a new website that needles obama for his intellectual and leadership bankruptcy http obamasnewideastofixeconomy com in short this address essentially tried to cast obama as the challenger and george w romney as the nefarious incumbent he complained about the terrible bush years average unemployment 5 2 percent average deficit less than 300 billion conflated conservative economic policies with the 2008 meltdown the true causes of which are a and said that the asserted economy is very much on the mend james carville call your office he whined about republican obstructionism i exploded that red herring earlier and called for more infrastructure investments to fix crumbling roads and bridges as if the massive stimulus 1 0 never happened fair shares and balanced approaches abounded not to mention more dire warnings of draconian republican cuts these cuts actually increase spending but at a slower rate the only interesting twist this speech offered was the president s suggestion that novembers election was a chance for voters to break washington s stalemate there s some truth to this bush fatigued voters elected an inexperienced charismatic cipher in 2008 when he and his congressional allies exploited their huge majorities to pass the stimulus and obamacare the public had seen enough they sent 68 new republicans to congress in 2010 i suppose you could say 2012 might be the tiebreaker i ll leave you with three items 1 obama spoke about paying down the national debt in a responsible and balanced manner here s how his unanimously defeated budget proposed to do so actually it proposed no such thing as it never balances 2 another rnc creation mischieviously reminding the president why he isn t running on his record 3 lefty jonathan alter dumping all over obama s speech on msnbc one of the least successful speeches i ve seen barack obama give in several years update this is a snippet from the much shorter teleprompter free pre buttal speech mitt romney delivered earlier this afternoon romney and the president are both in ohio today talk is cheap no kidding this fall s debates are going to be fun update obama s major economic speeches by the numbers highlight he s now eclipsed 50 000 words update ii during the president s 54 minute diatribe the national debt increased by approximately 150 000 000 00 alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist twitter fact checks a pair of president trump s tweets update trump responds townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
