apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic des moines iowa pete buttigieg could be on the losing side of the debate over whether a woman or a gay person is more likely to shatter the glass ceiling in presidential politics the political message of the former south bend indiana mayor is hitting home with democrats across iowa particularly in the more conservative areas of the state that are worried about the party moving too far left mr buttigieg s homosexuality though is giving many iowans cold feet top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches grant dyer said mr buttigieg is his favorite candidate but acknowledged worries that the former mayor can t beat president trump in an election because he s gay i really admire pete but i just don t think he can win said mr dyer who is leaning toward supporting sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts there s too many people who think that is a horrible awful thing oh my god his wife susan nodded in agreement a lot of people aren t ready for it she said overshadowing the question of whether the nation is ready for a gay president has been a debate over gender and electability ms warren thrust the subject to the forefront by accusing sen bernard sanders of telling her in private that a woman could not win the white house with the first round of voting just over the horizon ms warren and her allies are leaning into her womanhood betting she has more to gain than lose from playing the sex card elizabeth warren runs through airports and runs through train stations and she is a woman on a mission rep debra a haaland new mexico democrat told the crowd that came out to see ms warren at a recent event in newton she is a woman who will win the white house ms warren has repeatedly said i will do everything and i love saying this a president can do all by herself mr buttigieg isn t emphasizing his sexuality instead he wraps it into broader messages about freedom the power of politics and the role that iowa plays in political history including in 2009 when the state supreme court made iowa the third state in the u s and the first in the midwest to legalize same sex marriage i am standing here in a state that 10 years ago sending a message from right here in the american heartland made it possible for my marriage to exist and with your help i might be standing in the state that will make history by making me the next nominee and next president of the united states mr buttigieg said at a recent campaign stop the strategy makes sense an analysis of likely iowa caucusgoers found that 40 of voters said mr buttigieg s homosexuality would make it difficult for him to win the presidency compared with 32 of voters who said gender bias hurts ms warren s chances the raw numbers would suggest that fewer people in iowa think being a woman makes it more difficult than being gay makes it to win and that difference is substantial said the study s author david redlawsk a political science professor at the university of delaware and co author of why iowa he said the evidence is clear that iowa voters see being gay as more of a barrier than being a woman mr buttigieg has been fading in iowa polls since the beginning of the year and sits in fourth place a little over two weeks before the caucuses according to the real clear politics average of recent polls ms warren also has been sliding some voters attribute her declining numbers to sexism there is the woman thing said joy olsen a 41 year old warren supporter misogyny is an issue still it is easy to come across voters backing ms warren not in spite of but because of her gender when the caucuses started i looked at the candidates and i instantly eliminated the men honestly said taylor blair a member of the iowa state university college democrats i like all the women who are in the race then i narrowed it down and i like warren because she is the most progressive mr blair said ms warren likely started emphasizing her gender in the hopes of tapping into the lingering frustration from 2016 when voters put it all on the line for hillary clinton i think a lot of people feel like after 2016 that there was unfinished business when it comes to electing the first woman president he said larry anderson another warren supporter described her gender as great plus in his decision making process i think the last election cycle proved that a woman could get enough votes to win and i think elizabeth is a stronger candidate than clinton was the 68 year old said the nomination race however could be decided by voters who are mulling over whether mr trump s no holds barred approach to politics could be too much for mr buttigieg at one point trump is going to come out and call him a fairy or something like that and that could work against him 75 year old rush holder said at a recent buttigieg rally in sioux city perry miller praised mr buttigieg after seeing him at a rally he likened the candidate s youth and vigor to that of john f kennedy the nation s first catholic president he is going to have trouble with the whole gay thing he warned a lot of people have trouble getting over that i personally don t the 60 year old said after attending a buttigieg rally how is it going to be introducing the first man in the white house i see that as a hurdle mr miller said i hope he can clear that hurdle but it is a high h
