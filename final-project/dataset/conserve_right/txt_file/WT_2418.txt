apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic when president trump pushes back against the impeachment hearings millions of his fans are delighted with his rapid response delivered while he tends the vital business of the white house and his 2020 reelection campaign however the democrats also are ramping up their aggression now deploying strategic carefully researched descriptors to convince americans that wrongdoing has occurred dems throw words at walls hoping something will stick quid pro quo bribery extortion abuse of power obstruction and witness intimidation are all getting a tryout the search for buzzwords proves the entire enterprise is 100 political writes new york post columnist michael goodwin it s a marketing thing top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk it turns out impeachment is actually about polling the washington post reported on friday that democrats have stopped using the term quid pro quo instead describing bribery as a more direct summation of trump s alleged conduct why the change you ask it turns out the democratic congressional campaign committee ran focus groups in battleground states in order to determine the most effective messaging writes pj media columnist matt margolis democrats are essentially deciding what to accuse president trump of doing based on polling in key battleground areas apparently trump s crimes aren t clear enough democrats need to run focus groups to figure out what language has the strongest impact says mr margolis all these fancy maneuvers and scare techniques however have not fazed the president who continues to take care of business without losing a beat and that is how it has been for the mr trump for a very long time let us revisit one of his thoughts that surfaced over three decades ago and still appears to be percolating in most cases i m very easy to get along with i m very good to people who are good to me but when people treat me badly or unfairly or try to take advantage of me my general attitude all my life has been to fight back very hard mr trump wrote in the art of the deal his bestselling book originally published in 1987 the risk is you ll make a bad situation worse and i certainly don t recommend this approach to everyone but my experience is that if you re fighting for something you believe in even if it means alienating some people along the way things usually work out for the best in the end mr trump advised the actual effect of impeachment oh dear this is not exactly what the democrats had in mind when they orchestrated impeachment hearings against president trump eight out of 10 voters 79 say the president is either not very likely or not likely at all to resign as a result of the impeachment process according to a new politico
