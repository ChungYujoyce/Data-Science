republican state attorneys general led by ohio attorney generaldave yost filed an amicus brief in support of former national security adviser michael flynn on monday fox news has learned the filing statedthat the court needed to grant the doj s motion to dismissthe case without commentaryimmediately because such punditry disrobes the judiciary of its cloak of impartiality the short brief also elaborated on the problems that the court created by inserting itself into the justice department s exercise of prosecutorial discretion on the recommendation of u s attorney jeff jensen who served as an fbi agent for more than a decade thejustice departmentearlier this month moved to drop its case against flynn the stunning development came after internal memos were released raising serious

d c district court judgeemmet sullivanissued an order last tuesday indicating he would accept amicus curiae or friend of the court submissions drawing immediate scrutinyand a plannedethics complaint against sullivan who had previously refused to hear amicus briefs in the case there was no reason to issue these orders because this court has no say in the federal government s decision not to prosecute the state attorneys general argued simply put the decision not to pursue a criminal conviction is vested in the executive branch alone and neither the legislature nor the judiciary has any role in the executive s making of that decision judge emmet sullivan has a reputation for punishing department of justice overreach including during the case against then alaska republican sen ted stevens ap in addition to yost the brief was signed by attorneys general from alabama alaska arkansas florida georgia indiana louisiana mississippi missouri oklahoma south carolina texas utah and west

would not be unprecedented for the government to successfully move to dismiss a case after securing a conviction in fact sullivan himself tossed the conviction of former alaska sen ted stevens in 2009 when it emerged the government had not produced a slew of exculpatory brady material on monday retired federal judge john gleeson who was appointed by sulivan to submit a brief arguing against thejustice department aposs motion to dismiss the flynn case asked for oral arguments to take place following the submission of written briefs gleeson suggested a deadline of june 10 for his initial brief to be followed by the justice department aposs response as well asgleeson aposs reply to that response and then oral arguments from both sides gleeson has openlycriticizedthe trump administration aposs handling of michael flynn aposs case raising concerns that he was selected toimproperly bolster sullivan aposs efforts to keep the flynn case alive even though both the government and defendant want it dismissed sullivan previously suggestedflynn may have committed treason in a bizarre 2018 courtroom outburst and seemingly confused key details about flynn aposs overseas
