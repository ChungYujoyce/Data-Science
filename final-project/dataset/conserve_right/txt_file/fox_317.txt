to enjoy all the benefits of our website in the uk the latest polls confirmthat voters are increasingly volatile and that the next general election is more unpredictable than it may appear get the new statesman s morning call email around the democratic world incumbent governments are enjoying huge increases in popularity both individual ministers and the ruling party as a whole there are a handful of exceptions that arefairly self explanatory in italy prime minister giuseppe conte has seen his own approval ratings climb but because he is notidentified withthe five star movement nor the centre left democrats who keep him in office neither party has enjoyed an uptick in their fortunes in the united states president donald trump continues to provide a real world control group his handling of the pandemic has been incredibly poor to any fair minded observer regardless of theirpolitics and he has enjoyed a much smaller rise in approval than politicians elsewhere as well asstate governors of both parties in japan whereprime ministershinzo abe s response has been similarly incoherent he too has seen his figures slump some people say that this makes opinion polls at this moment a product without a purpose essentially we know thatunless a government visibly sets itself on fire it ought to be enjoying a big boost in its approval right now added to the usual health warnings about election polling this far out the next uk general election isn tforfouryears there s a temptation to just declare all of this information junk and be done with it however i think there are still a couple of useful things about the polls both for observers of british politics and for politics more generally they tell us that we should avoid drawing too many specific conclusions because the centre left is doing so poorly around the globe there s an understandable desire to look at the few examples of semi success in south korea the left leaning parties won their first parliamentary majority in 16 years in new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern took office in a coalition and is running for re election in september i don t think we can draw any meaningful lessons for keir starmer from the success of presidentmoon jae in beyond be an incumbent in a political moment that creates favourable circumstances for them if ardern is re elected in september while polls continue to give big leads to incumbents around the world we should similarly be wary of suggestions that there is all that much to learn from that campaign from a strategic perspective similarly anyone writing long thinkpieces about what starmer is doing wrong or what johnson is doing right from an electoral perspective should at this point be ignored they do usefully reveal a couple of things about british politics though as we wrote repeatedly during the general election british voters are increasingly volatile and willing to shop around the parties we saw that both at a national level with the conservatives winning many seats they had never won before and also at a constituency level take redcar a solidly safe labour seat under different names from 1964 until 2005 atthe 2010 general election it went liberal democrat before being won by labour in 2015 and then the conservatives in 2019 on all three occasions the swing the change between parties was very large far beyond what we would have expected in elections in the 20thcentury with that in mind there s an open debate about whether the conservatives and the snp are doing well or badly to be polling at around 50 per cent of the vote in their respective theatres a figure that we associate with margaret thatcher and tony blair at the peak of their political powers in eras when people were far less willing to switch parties but that s unanswerable because we can t know how a different initial response to the crisis by the national and scottish governments would have been received byvoters what we can say is that it
