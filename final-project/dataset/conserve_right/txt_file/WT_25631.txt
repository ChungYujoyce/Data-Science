tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap house democrats took their first concrete steps in the impeachment investigation of president donald trump issuing subpoenas demanding documents from secretary of state mike pompeo and scheduling legal depositions for other state department officials at the end of a stormy week of revelation and recrimination house speaker nancy pelosi framed the impeachment inquiry as a somber moment for a divided nation this is no cause for any joy she said on msnbc top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender at the white house a senior administration official confirmed friday a key detail from the unidentified cia whistleblower who has accused trump of abusing the power of his office trump for his part insisted anew that his actions and words have been perfect and the whistleblower s complaint might well be the work of a partisan operative the white house acknowledged that a record of the trump phone call that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry had been sealed away in a highly classified system at the direction of trump s national security council lawyers separately trump adviser kellyanne conway told reporters that the whistleblower has protection under the law something trump himself had appeared to question earlier in the day he suggested then that his accuser isn t a whistleblower at all still at issue is why the rough transcript of trump s july 25 phone call with ukraine s president was put on lock down in the words of the whistleblower the cia officer said that diverting the record in an unusual way was evidence that white house officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the conversation the whistleblower complaint alleges that trump used his office to solicit interference from a foreign country to help himself in next year s u s election in the phone call days after ordering a freeze to some military assistance for ukraine trump prodded new ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy to dig for potentially damaging material on democratic rival joe biden and volunteered the assistance of both his personal attorney rudy giuliani and u s attorney general william barr pelosi refused to set a deadline for the probe but promised to act expeditiously the house intelligence committee could draw members back to washington next week pelosi said she was praying for the president adding i would say to democrats and republicans we have to put country before party at the white house it was a senior administration official who acknowledged that the rough transcript of trump s conversation with ukraine s zelenskiy had been moved to a highly classified system maintained by the national security council the official was granted anonymity friday to discuss sensitive matters white house attorneys had been made aware of concerns about trump s comments on the call even before the whistleblower sent his allegations to the intelligence community s inspector general those allegations made in mid august were released thursday under heavy pressure from house democrats one former official said memos of trump calls with foreign leaders had to be severely restricted after leaks in 2017 calls with saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman and russia s vladimir putin were among those whose distribution were kept to a minimum the official cautioned that administrations discuss sensitive matters with both nations and that the treatment shouldn t imply anything untoward on the call even some calls with us allies are also restricted due to discussions of classified topics the person spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the process on the ukraine matter trump was keeping up his full bore attack on the whistleblower and the unnamed white house officials cited in the complaint drawing a warning from pelosi against retaliation late thursday trump denounced people who might have talked to the whistleblower as close to a spy and suggested they engaged in treason an act punishable by death then on friday he said the person was sounding more and more like the so called whistleblower isn t a whistleblower at all he also alleged without evidence that information in the complaint has been proved to be so inaccurate pelosi told msnbc i m concerned about some of the president s comments about the whistleblower she said the house panels conducting the impeachment probe will make sure there s no retaliation against people who provided information in the case on thursday house democratic chairmen called trump s comments witness intimidation and suggested efforts by him to interfere with the potential witness could be unlawful trump s friday comment questioning the whistleblower s status seemed to foreshadow a possible effort to argue that legal protection laws don t apply to the person opening a new front in the president s defense but conway s statement seemed to make that less likely the intelligence community s inspector general found the whistleblower s complaint credible despite finding indications of the person s support for a different political candidate legal experts said that by following proper procedures and filing a complaint with the government rather than disclosing the information to the media the person is without question regarded as a whistleblower entitled to protections against being fired or criminally prosecuted this person clearly followed the exact path he was supposed to follow said debra d agostino a lawyer who represents whistleblowers there is no basis for not calling this person a whistleblower lawyers say it also doesn t matter for the purposes of being treated as a whistleblower if all of the allegations are borne out as entirely true or even if political motives or partisanship did factor into the decision to come forward giuliani already in the spotlight was scheduled to appear at a kremlin backed conference in armenia on tuesday but he said friday he would not be attending the agenda showed him speaking at a session on digital financial technologies russian president vladimir putin also was scheduled to participate in the conference republicans were straining under the uncertainty of being swept up in the most serious test yet of their alliance with the trump white house we owe people to take it seriously said sen marco rubio r fla a onetime trump rival who is now a member of the intelligence committee right now i have more questions than answers he said the complaint raises serious allegations and we need to determine whether they re credible or not a swift resolution to the impeachment inquiry may not be easy the intelligence committee is diving in just as lawmakers leave washington for a two week recess with the panel expected to work while away one person familiar with the committee s schedule said that members might return at the end of next week findings will eventually need to be turned over to rep jerrold nadler s judiciary committee which is compiling the work of five other panels into what is expected to be articles of impeachment the panel will need to find consensus meanwhile trump s reelection campaign took to accusing democrats of trying to steal the 2020 election in a new ad airing in a 10 million television and digital buy next week the ad also attacks democrat biden highlighting his efforts as vice president to make u s aid to ukraine contingent on that country firing a prosecutor believed to be corrupt the ad claims that the fired prosecutor was investigating the former vice president s son in fact the prosecutor had failed to pursue any major anti corruption investigations leaving ukraine s international donors deeply frustrated in pressing for the prosecutor s ouster biden was representing the official position of the u s government which was shared by other western allies and many in ukraine ap writers lisa mascaro laurie kellman mary clare
