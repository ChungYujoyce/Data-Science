if you re a regular reader this trend doesn t come as a surprise we ve been tracking and flagging it since the kavanaugh ordeal which galvanized legions of previously disengaged or underwhelmed gop leaning voters we ve demonstrated how that impact has continued to reverberate particularly in senate races and now the mainstream conventional wisdom appears to be catching up charlie cook who leads the vaunted cook political report is out with a new detailed analysis pointing to a clear uptick in republicans fortunes charlie cook one question that keeps coming back up is whether those who led the out of control demonstrations on capitol hill against the kavanaugh nomination have any understanding of how much damage they did to democrats https t co dfbkihumgo the most dramatic change over the last six weeks in the midterm election picture is clearly in the senate but the house situation has subtly changed as well not long ago the most likely outcome for the senate was either no net change at all or a shift of one seat so the senate would remain under gop control with the majority holding 50 52 seats today a republican net gain of a seat or two seems most likely moving the gop up to either 52 or 53 seats though a gain of three seats or no net change are entirely possible there remains some chance of democrats picking up two seats and a majority but those odds are long no better than 1 in 5 and seemingly getting longer once you saw republicans and conservative voters coming home and getting energized for the first time this election cycle on top of this lopsided senate map of seats overwhelmingly in gop friendly states democrats hopes went down precipitously in the house democrats remain heavily favored to capture a majority the change is that their chances of blowing the house wide open with a gain of 40 50 seats or more have diminished in the suburban oriented districts where most of the competitive house races are things remain extremely challenging for republicans a large gender gap driven by suburban college educated and younger women remains a very strong dynamic but the more rural and small town oriented districts those with substantial numbers of republicans conservatives and trump backers are now fully awake and engaged moving some of those districts back away from the edge of competitiveness republicans were looking quite vulnerable through the summer in districts that one would never guess they would have to worry about today democrats seem more in line to score a net gain of between 20 and 40 seats three weeks out the gop looks like it has a real opportunity to improve upon its current senate bare majority and has perhaps put itself in a position to mitigate expected losses in the house some of these polls are undoubtedly too close for comfort especially with the distinct possibility of undecideds stampeding toward the democrats at the last minute but they re vastly improved over the doomsday scenario some polling projected several months ago again this is not to say that republicans don t face some real struggles but things could be and have been markedly worse on the senate side the most endangered incumbent on either side is democrat heidi heitkamp of north dakota already trailing considerably in the polls heitkamp s campaign committed a truly dreadful unforced error publicly identifying a number of women some erroneously as survivors of assault against their consent cornered with concrete evidence of malfeasance heitkamp appeared on a conservative radio show in north dakota yesterday profusely apologizing for a colossal screw up heitkamp this is on me this has got my name on it the worse thing you can do is take away their privacy and i did exactly that and i need to personally apologize and say i was wrong there s no sugarcoating this this was a collosal error this comes on the heels of her no vote against justice kavanaugh which flew in the face of the overwhelming sentiment of her constituents and her explanations left a lot to be desired any hope she had of painting her opponent as insensitive toward female victims vanished when her own ad outed alleged victims without their permission meanwhile i always view new jersey senate races as fool s gold for republicans but it s clear that national democrats are getting anxious about scandal plagued bob menendez s status in the
