apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the public on tuesday will get its first look at army lt col alexander vindman in action and if he follows his closed door testimony he will knock his commander in chief while retelling his version of potentially damning conversations with a trump ambassador i m the director for ukraine col vindman told the joint house impeachment panel on oct 29 i m responsible for ukraine i m the most knowledgeable i m the authority for ukraine for the national security council and the white house top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey i m certainly not the president of the united states he said at another point when asked by a republican whether he intervened to discourage ukrainian officials from cooperating in a corruption investigation requested by president trump the president of the united states has the authority to do this i guess i don t know i didn t think it was right he said he has never met with mr trump but his written briefing gets forwarded from ambassador bolton to the president he was referring to then national security adviser john r bolton from his desk with the national security council across the driveway from the west wing the decorated army infantry officer witnessed diplomatic maneuvers he didn t like according to his released deposition transcript he readily shared his opinions with the house permanent select committee on intelligence and two other committees he complained of outside influencers interfering with his work he mentioned rudolph w giuliani mr trump s personal attorney the president assigned the former new york city mayor the special task of investigating the roles of former vice president joseph r biden and his son hunter in ukrainian business dealings mr biden is running to oppose mr trump in the 2020 election col vindman who was born in ukraine and speaks his native language also listed gordan sondland as an outsider mr sondland is a trump donor who won a bipartisan senate vote to serve as u s ambassador to the european union in brussels mr trump anointed him as an overseer of all things ukraine a move col vindman didn t like col vindman said mr sondland a rookie diplomat did not go through him before talking with mr bolton democrats on saturday evening released the transcript testimony of tim morrison who was col vindman s boss at the nsc for four months the former republican congressional staffer resigned on oct 31 mr morrison a nuclear weapons hawk served as nsc arms control director under mr bolton and in july became director of european affairs in summary mr morrison said he didn t always trust the colonel he said col vindman went around the chain of command to the point that he kept him off some official telephone calls i had concerns about col vindman s judgment he testified but mr morrison agreed with col vindman that mr sondland was on an unwanted parallel diplomatic track he also agreed with col vindman that the administration should not have tried to persuade the ukrainian government to agree to any type of investigation of the bidens or ukraine s suspected role in the 2016 u s presidential election the colonel also disapproved of the president s conversing with hungarian prime minister viktor orban a friend of russian president vladimir putin and critic of ukrainian leaders mr putin s troops invaded ukraine in 2014 and robbed it of crimea he also disapproved of mr trump s firing in may of u s ambassador to ukraine marie yovanovitch who testified friday in the impeachment inquiry i m aware of the fact that she was removed and i thought that was troubling col vindman testified col vindman his uniform brimming with medals as he entered the house committee s special compartmental information facility has won favorable coverage in the new york times and other liberal media as well as praise from democrats wanting to impeach mr trump when house foreign affairs committee chairman eliot l engel new york democrat questioned the officer he started by saying have you received commendations and awards for your prior service col vindman 44 then took the committee on a tour of his ribbons such as for service on the joint chiefs of staff for his time in moscow and ukraine and for his combat tour in iraq and a purple heart for wounds he sustained from an improvised explosive device there s an army meritorious service medal further back he said i m just going sequentially and then you know other various awards and decorations mr engel said he was appalled that republicans doubted the colonel s version of events it would have been much easier for you to have stayed out of this the congressman said your bravery in coming forward should be publicly commended by all of us in this room and by the entire country bidens and burisma mr engel and other democrats have reason to cheer the officer he was directly involved in the white house s pivotal events on july 10 and july 25 his testimony will be cited when democrats vote to impeach mr trump on july 10 a group of trump aides and ukrainian officials led by ukrainian national security adviser oleksandr danylyuk huddled at the white house a new president volodymyr zelensky and a parliament were in place mr zelensky wanted a meeting with mr trump a week later mr trump suspended a military aid package for ukraine the suspension was lifted sept 11 democrats accuse mr trump of withholding the aid to force an investigation into the bidens and alleged ukrainian interference in the 2016 election on behalf of hillary clinton mr trump denies that was the reason the aid was delayed in crucial testimony mr vindman contends that in a one on one discussion with mr sondland the ambassador told him point blank that ukraine must investigate he testified the conversation unfolded with sondland proceeding to kind of you know review what the deliverable would be in order to get the meeting and he talked about the investigation into the bidens and frankly i can t 100 recall because i didn t take notes of it but burisma i mean there was no ambiguity i guess in my mind burisma holdings is an oligarch owned ukrainian natural gas firm that state department diplomats deem corrupt the firm put hunter biden on the board of directors in 2014 at a time when his father vice president joseph r biden served as the obama administration s point man on ukraine after the russian invasion diplomats have told the house panel that the firm was under a ukrainian criminal investigation around that time and that the probe was dropped in 2016 in his closed door testimony mr sondland denied col vindman s account he is scheduled to appear in open session wednesday a day after his accuser appears next came the july 25 phone call between mr trump and mr zelensky col vindman was among five aides who listened in the white house situation room a whistleblower a democrat who worked with mr biden in 2015 and 2016 and stayed on the nsc staff until june 2017 filed a nine page complaint based on the call relayed to him by unnamed sources the cia analyst said mr trump pressured mr zelensky to open an investigation before military aid could arrive mr trump who released a transcript of the call said he made no such demand the aid money was released sept 11 without any ukrainian investigation after hearing the call col vindman was the first and likely the only aide to immediately file a complaint with the nsc legal counsel asked by republicans who saw nothing wrong with the call whether others felt the same way col vindman mentioned facial expressions on his boss mr morrison the only person that i occasionally would take a glance at would be my boss col vindman testified and i perceived at least that he was also potentially concerned and how did you perceive that he was concerned just by the look on his face yes col vindman answered mr morrison testified that he didn t believe the call was illegal according to a transcript released saturday he did back col vindman on mr sondland s biden burisma talking points he said the ambassador delivered the same message in september in warsaw to a ukrainian official col vindman while touting himself as the supreme ukraine authority could not remember the name of kyiv s charge d affaires who is serving as the highest ranking diplomat in washington i know the guy i met with him a few times his last name escapes me at the moment he said col vindman also erroneously credited president barack obama with sending the first lethal battlefield aid to ukraine in the form of advanced army javelin anti armor weapons in a hallmark decision it was mr trump who approved the transfer which took place in march 2018 at the time col vindman worked at the joint chiefs of staff as its russia specialist he arrived at the nsc in july 2018 sen ron johnson wisconsin republican told cnn i would take things that col vindman says with a grain of salt as well because in his testimony he said the obama administration provided javelin weapons they didn t it was march 2018 that 210 javelin weapons were finally approved in terms o
