be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion increasing the united states reliance on clean energy as touted by president obama yet again in this week s budget proposal would leave americans just as dependent on unreliable foreign suppliers as we are now on the organization of the petroleum exporting countries stranglehold on oil instead of a handful of mostly middle eastern states we would be dependent on a single nation for critical energy supplies china the threat to both national security and the u s economy is obvious to anyone who isn t blinded by environmentalist dogma the president s claim that his program of subsidies government grants and tax breaks for green energy technologies will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and thus improve the united states national security is wrong rather the greater our embrace of green energy technologies the worse off the united states likely will become geopolitically key components of every green energy technology wind turbines solar cells energy efficient lighting high tech batteries and other goods are made from a small class of minerals known as rare earth elements and other rare minerals despite their name these elements are rather abundant but at the moment and for the near future they are found in economically exploitable concentrations only in the people s republic of china with 96 percent of the global market china has a de facto monopoly on the trade in these rare elements top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century by contrast the world s oil market is diverse dozens of countries including the united states produce and export oil in 2009 the united states imported oil or oil products from 90 countries by comparison there is no other supplier of rare earth elements to turn to should china find it in its interest to restrict its supply to the market leaving china free to manipulate the market both price and supply at will we should not wean ourselves off of drill bits only to addict ourselves to batteries and magnets in recent months china has begun to use its virtual monopoly on rare earths to extract favorable political outcomes from foreign nations in september 2010 a chinese trawler collided with a japanese coast guard vessel in a disputed portion of the east china sea the captain of the fishing boat was arrested by the japanese when japan refused to release the captain china retaliated by first limiting and eventually halting exports of rare earth elements to japan japan eventually relented and sent the captain home the obama administration promotes solar panel production as one area that could see job growth under its push for green jobs production of photovoltaic cells relies on the rare element tellurium however the only tellurium mine that exists on earth is in china and china in part through its control of tellurium is increasingly dominating the market for solar manufacturing in 2003 china produced just 1 percent of the world s solar panels but by 2009 its share rose to 43 percent by contrast in 2003 u s production of solar panels accounted for 14 percent of the world total but now it stands at just 4 percent and because the rare earths neodymium and lanthanum are essential to the newest generation of batteries that power new hybrid and electric vehicles u s auto companies are in part placing their hope in revitalizing the domestic auto industry on china s continued goodwill wind turbines also require rare earth elements to make the neodymium iron boron magnets they use general electric one of the leading companies developing wind energy technologies purchases its entire supply of neodymium iron boron from china increasingly china is choosing to sell finished green products to the world rather than exporting its rare earths in raw form accordingly china has eliminated export tax rebates for rare earth elements while increasing the export taxes to as much as 25 percent furthermore china decreased its export quota by 40 percent between 2009 and 2010 sadly this dependence on china is driven purely by politics not consumer demand absent huge government subsidies grants and mandates green energy being more expensive and less reliable than traditional energy production would not be so much in demand and thus china would not be in the catbird seat the push to adopt rare earth powered energy technologies involves swapping one form of dependence for a much more restrictive one the old saying out of the frying pan into the fire comes to mind if the u s government stopped interfering in domestic energy production and ended all energy mandates and subsidies china s dominance of rare earths would become a non issue absent government support green energy technologies would largely fade from the scene until entrepreneurs figure out a way to make them cost competitive and more reliable nor would environmentalists have reason for complaint because fossil fuels would no longer receive subsidies either this would be a win win for both fiscal hawks and green doves h sterling burnett is a senior fellow with the national center for
