s a rush transcript from fox news sunday october 21 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace anchor i aposm chris wallace the u s alliance with saudi arabia in jeopardy as the country acknowledges that missing journalist is dead begin videotape president donald trump saudi arabia has been a great ally but what happened is unacceptable wallace but how to punish the kingdom if evidence shows the saudi royal family is behind the death of jamal khashoggi trump we haven apost finished our review i would prefer that we don apost use as retribution canceling 110 billion worth of work wallace we aposll discuss what happens to khashoggi and what it means for relations with saudi arabia with republican senator rand paul a longtime critic of u s policy in the middle east then there are 16 days until the midterm elections and republican control of congress is on the line rep martha mcsally r ariz thank you wallace we aposll look at one of this year aposs most competitive senate races in arizona and we aposll talk with congresswoman martha mcsally only on fox news sunday plus trump this will be an election of kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about president trump aposs closing message for the midterms and unidentified female thank you wallace after disaster strikes our power player of the week world famous chef jose andres steps in jose andres chef people are always in need of a hot meal and that aposs what we do wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington seventeen days after the disappearance of jamal khashoggi the saudi government is finally offering its account of what happened to him but much of the world is not buying it the saudis say khashoggi was killed in a fist fight in their consulate in istanbul they aposve arrested 18 people involved in the case and fired five top officials some with close ties to the saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman president trump says he finds the report credible but will work with congress to find ways to punish the saudi government joining me now from kentucky republican senator rand paul a key member of the senate foreign relations committee senator let aposs start with your reaction to the saudi account that khashoggi was killed by accident in a fist fight at the consulate and that the saudi crown prince had nothing to do with it do you believe the saudi account sen rand paul r ky absolutely not i think it aposs insulting to anyone who aposs analyzing this with any kind of intelligent background to think that oh a fist fight led to a dismemberment with a bone saw so no but i think we should put this brazen attack this brazen murder in context with saudi arabia saudi arabia has basically over the decades been the largest state sponsor of radical islam and violent jihad they sponsor thousands of madrassas that teach hatred of christians and jews and hindus around the world so this isn apost the first instance this is just another in the line of long instances of saudi insults to the civilized world wallace i aposm going to get to the larger relationship in a moment but i want to stay with this case at this point what do you think was the involvement of the saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman the king has absolved them and in fact has put mbs as he aposs known in charge of the overhaul of saudi intelligence paul i think it stretches credulity to believe the crown prince wasn apost involved in this and i think that aposs the way they aposre going to write this off and people in saudi arabia ought to be aware when you were told what to do you go and do it and then they will execute you and put all the blame on someone else there aposs no way 15 people were sent from saudi arabia to turkey to kill a dissident without the approval of the crown prince and that aposs why i say we have to be stronger than just saying oh we are going to sanction a few of these people and pretend like we aposre doing something i think we really need to discontinue our arms sales to saudi arabia and have a long and serious discussion about whether or not they want to be an ally or they want to be an enemy wallace well you say we got to get tougher president trump was asked about the arrest of 18 people involved in the case and the firing of five officials some of them with close ties to the crown prince here aposs what he had to say begin video clip trump i think it aposs a good first step it aposs a big step it aposs a lot of people a lot of people involved and i think it aposs a great first step reporter do you consider it a credible explanation trump i do i do end video clip wallace does president trump know something that you don apost senator or frankly do you think he aposs covering for the saudis paul i think the saudis are an authoritarian government they are directed from the top down and you don apost have people just going off and doing things on their own i feel certain that the crown prince was involved and that he directed this and that aposs why i think we cannot continue to have relations with him so i think is going to have to be replaced frankly but i think that sanctions don apost go far enough i think we need to look at the arm sale because this is not just about this journalist being killed it aposs about the war in yemen where tens of thousands of civilians are being killed it aposs about them spreading hatred of christians and jews and hindus throughout the world i mean thousands and thousands madrassas teaching radical violence against the west the saudis have not acted as our friend and they need to change their behavior wallace i understand that but i aposm asking you directly about the president aposs reaction he says he finds credible an account that you find incredible why do you think he aposs doing that paul exactly i don apost know the reasoning or can answer for you know the president aposs thought process on this i can only say i think many of us looking at the situation think this couldn apost happen in an authoritarian government without the crown prince being involved wallace all right let aposs talk now about punishment and what to do about it the president says he aposs going to work with congress to find a way to sanction the saudis but he made it clear one of the things he doesn apost want to do here he is begin video clip trump i would prefer that we don apost use as retribution canceling 110 billion worth of work which means 600 000 jobs end video clip wallace now last year long before all of this you came within four votes of blocking further arms sales to the saudis first of all what do you think of the chances that you can get those four votes and block them this year and what about the president aposs argument that this hundreds of thousands of american jobs paul i think if we were to have a vote in the next couple of weeks on whether or not to sell arms to saudi arabia we would win overwhelmingly and so i think the powers that be will try to prevent us from having that vote they have to announce a specific case of arms being sold and my prediction is they aposll avoid doing that as long as possible with regard to jobs i don apost think arms should ever be seen as a jobs program our arms our military arms the sophistication of our arms are part of our national defense these aren apost something that are just owned by private companies they are owned by the country and i think we should never sell arms to any country in less it aposs in national security interest i think the war in yemen actually increases our national risk it makes us less secure in the middle east it makes us more likely to be involved in another war in yemen so i think we should not be supplying the saudis with bombs they aposve been indiscriminately killing civilians just in the last month 50 schoolchildren were killed in the bombing of the school bus they killed 150 people at a funeral possession the saudis have not been acting in a just fashion yemen aposs one of the poorest planets on the earth millions of people there face starvation over a million people had cholera and the saudis continue to block their ports so no i don apost think that there aposs a national security reason for us to be involved in the war in yemen and that aposs where our arms are going so i would cut off arms sales it aposs the only thing the saudis will listen to wallace well an interesting figure russian president putin talked about this and he said that he believes that the u s has a double standard he noted that after the alleged poisoning of that russian spy in britain that the u s expelled 60 russian diplomats and imposed sanctions and he looks at the lack of action so far and says that aposs a double standard one does putin have a point and beyond blocking arms sales you say that you don apost think the white house is even going to offer them at this point what else should the u s do if anything to punish the saudis paul well i think there is a double standard and i think the saudis need to be treated as who they are in the context of who they are i don apost think they are a friendly ally they have been spreading hatred of our country for a decade after decade with regard to whether we sanction them or whether we have arms sales i think the arms sales actually will go on i think they will avoid announcing the arms sales to try to prevent us from blocking them so i aposm not saying that the trump administration will stop arms sales i think they will continue the arms sales and i think this is a danger that congress many in congress will act tough on this and they will pretend to do something which is sanctions but i aposm not calling for sanctions really against saudi arabia in general i don apost think we should quit trading with saudi arabia i think we should specifically quit aiding and abetting them in an aggressive war in yemen wallace you have been as we pointed out you have been a real skeptic of our relationship with saudi arabia for many years and you aposve certainly given evidence of that today but here aposs a counterargument from president trump he says that we depend on saudi arabia for cheap oil or cheaper oil he says we depend on saudi arabia as a potential counterweight to iran and its ambitions in the middle east and that we can we hope that saudi arabia will help us broker a peace deal between the palestinians and the israelis do you think he aposs wrong on all those fronts paul i think this is thousand year old war in the middle east between sunni and shia and saudi arabia is pitted up against iran the biggest thing that destabilize the middle east and i think the president agrees with me on this was the iraq war there was much more of a balance in the middle east at that time but if you look at military spending right now the saudis and the gulf sheikhdom that are their allies spend eight times more than iran and so there is an arms race but when we supply arms to saudi arabia iran responds so when we complain about the iranians having ballistic missiles that they are developing they are doing that in response to the arming of the saudis it aposs a bilateral arms race that goes on and on and so i wouldn apost continue it i don apost think we need the saudis the saudis need us much more than we need them we have incredible leverage their air force is entirely american planes they can apost last a couple of months without parts and mechanics to help them run their air force we train their pilots they are completely dependent on us we need to tell them to behave and if they aposre not going to behave and that includes cutting off the funding to all these schools that teach hatred of christians jews and hindus wallace i want to get and we aposre running out of time to one final subject it appears that president trump is about to pull out to tell the russians that we aposre going to pull out of the inf medium range missile treaty a treaty that ronald reagan signed with mikhail gorbachev back in 1987 here was the president yesterday afternoon begin video clip trump we are the ones who have stayed in the agreement and we have honored the agreement but russia has not unfortunately honored the agreement so we are going to terminate the agreement and we aposre going to fall out end video clip wallace i got about a minute left the president says he will stay in the treaty only if russia and china which was not a signatory to the inf treaty will abide by its terms your reaction to this sir paul i think it aposs a big big mistake to flippantly get out of this historic agreement that reagan and gorbachev signed this was a big part of reagan aposs legacy and we should not get rid of it it was an important step we went from 64 000 nuclear tipped missiles down to 15 000 it has been an historic agreement i think what we should do instead of getting out event is i aposve asked the president and i advised him privately and in public that he should appoint nuclear negotiators nuclear arms control negotiators to actually work with the soviets we have complaints that they are not in compliance they also have complaints that some of our missile launchers in europe are not in compliance let aposs have a rational discussion with experts on this and see if we can resolve it wallace you sent out a tweet that said you think this is one reason why john bolton should stay out of this why him personally paul i think john bolton is the one advising the president to get out of the inf treaty and i don apost think he recognizes the important achievement of reagan and gorbachev on this look i spent an hour with gorbachev a couple of months ago and they still regard this this reduction of nuclear arms and a disaster that would be nuclear war i think in a very sincere manner at least from gorbachev that reducing the arms was very important and i don apost want to see another nuclear arms race with russia or with any other country i aposm all for trying to sign an agreement with china but that would have to be a brand new agreement and there aposs no reason to end the agreement we have with russia wallace senator paul thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir paul thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the saudi account of what happened to jamal khashoggi and what it means for relations between our two countries commercial break begin video clip trump saudi arabia is our partner they are our ally against iran and against missiles and against what they aposre doing trying to take over the middle east end video clip wallace president trump standing by our alliance with saudi arabia that now faces a tough test going forward and it aposs time now for our sunday group former speaker of the house newt gingrich charles lane from the washington post former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and marc short former director of legislative affairs for president trump speaker gingrich what do you make of the saudi account of what happened to jamal khashoggi and who was responsible and how severely do you think we should punish the saudis newt gingrich former house speaker first of all their explanation is insultingly stupid i mean the idea that this guy walked in the room with 15 security people got in a fight and was accidentally killed and they happened to have apparently an ability to dismember him and get rid of him that happened to be there this is just stupid wallace so why is the president saying it aposs credible gingrich the president is trying to walk a tight rope between and i think it aposs a big problem not a small one on the one hand you don apost you don apost want to break the alliance with the saudis on the other hand you cannot teach a 33 year old crown prince that he can get away with things that have this outrageous and this stupid or he will be out of control for the next 40 years wallace so what would you do gingrich i think my guess is they will get to selective sanctions and they aposre going to be very clear about it i also think that i aposm guessing but my guess is that pompeo is saying pretty aggressively you guys have got to come up with the truth this is just this hurts the saudis to lie this stupidly wallace secretary of state pompeo met with the saudi crown prince this week and took some criticism for appearing overly friendly in such a serious situation here aposs what pompeo said when he returned to washington begin video clip mike pompeo secretary of state i think it aposs also important for us all to remember too we have a long since 1932 a long strategic relationship with or the kingdom of saudi arabia end video clip wallace congresswoman harman i want to address exactly the dilemma the conundrum that speaker gingrich was talking about on the one hand what apparently happened to khashoggi is unacceptable on the other hand we do have strategic interests with saudi arabia how do we balance all that former rep jane harman d calif well our foreign policy is based on values and interest values that we have are rule of law and freedom of the press interests that we have are having saudi arabia as an ally against iran aposs maligned behavior among other things and maybe helping jared kushner with his two state solution which doesn apost seem to be going very far between israel and palestine but at any rate murder i totally agree with newt murder and this reckless war in yemen are not either our values or our interest and i think that in addition to sanctions it would be good to talk to the king about perhaps moving mohammed bin salman mbs sideways for a while and putting an adult in charge of saudi arabia such as mohammed bin nayef the intelligence chief who was widely admired but now is under house arrest because of mbs aposs decision or even adel al jubeir the foreign minister who used to be the ambassador here who is again highly regarded and very wallace you think i mean you have a much better sense of this than i do do you think if the president were to go to the king and say that or to the ruling family and say that that we have a vote we can apply pressure harman i don apost think we have a vote but yes i think we can apply pressure and it is also true obviously that there are major financial transactions pending not just the aerospace firms but also with high tech firms i think the modernization program and i actually think khashoggi agreed with this was going in the right direction it was the excesses that are derailing it and i think saudi arabia wants and need a modern future so they better do a course correction here wallace marc let aposs talk about the realities in congress that used to be your job until very recently as the legislative affairs director for president trump as we were discussing with rand paul he came within four votes last year of blocking an arms sale to the saudis what you think of the prospects for any future arms sales in the foreseeable future and how tough do you think congress because a lot of republicans are talking tough on this too how tough do you think they aposre prepared to get with the saudis marc short former trump white house legislative affairs director i think the prospects of any future sales are quite dim but i actually think the prospects are greater than perhaps senator paul was indicating that congress should actually take proactive steps to unwind the most recent arms deal i think very little that transactions gone through i think you could see move by congress to move forward particularly if there aposs a vacuum from the administration responding quickly and responding authoritatively so i think that actually the risk there is actually much more significant than senator paul was saying as to what congress could do in the near term wallace and what about other sanctions short i think that aposs they go together chris because if the administration steps forward to take sanctions that will lower the pressure on congress to act but if the administration doesn apost do that then i think you aposll see a vacuum in which congress steps forward and looks to move more quickly perhaps even a soon as the lame duck session wallace chuck this is personal for you because jamal khashoggi was a colleague of yours at the washington post your reaction to the saudi account and to president trump aposs seeming acceptance of that saudi account so far charles lane the washington post well let aposs take the saudis apos accounts first it reminds me of that famous phrase from watergate the modified limited hangout this is what you do when you aposve been caught your cover has been blown and there aposs really no denying it anymore so you let a little bit of the truth out where you try to reshape a more plausible cover story remember they have been saying that jamal khashoggi left that consulate alive that had been there previous view of the matter so the story is as the speaker and everyone else here has said is not a credible story it aposs their desperate attempt to preserve the crown prince and his position and by the way they are even willing to sacrifice apparently some fairly senior officials at least to the extent of scape goating them and firing them but the trouble with president trump aposs reaction to this so far from my point of view has been that it aposs taken him a long time to declare that this was evil and stupid his first reaction was something like well you know it aposs not an american citizen and it aposs not on our soil and that was troublingly consistent with some things he said in the campaign about how you know we americans we kill a lot of people and so on he aposs got a lot he aposs dug himself a deep hole i aposm afraid on that point and i don apost think he aposs all the way out of it yet wallace marc short i agree with what the congresswoman was saying before that there aposs a lot they aposre trying to balance and i think the president is trying to give them a little bit of space today the president came out on the washington post and said he does not believe the account as to what they aposve said was a result of the fistfight he has acknowledged the incredulity of that but i do think as well that there aposs a lot that they aposre trying to balance here the iran funding hamas and hezbollah is killing westerners continually throughout the middle east and saudi arabia is our ally that is a challenge that we need to navigate the administration needs to step forward they need to be more aggressive or else congress will act i do believe that wallace i want to bring the congresswoman in here on that because i thought what senator paul said was very interesting which is that we overestimate the importance of saudi arabia and underestimate our leverage over them that if they if we buy oil from them they sell oil to us and as he pointed out their air force is completely based on american planes if we held up equipment and spare parts they aposd be grounded in a month harman well the feckless war in yemen which is the largest humanitarian catastrophe on the planet right now shows their incapacity as the fighting force despite our weapons which they have paid us for so i do think we have leverage i wanted to say though that khashoggi however his name is pronounced is about to be a journalist scholar at the wilson center he aposs highly regarded in town and the irony of all of this is that he was writing about the modernization program in a positive way he was critical of mbs aposs extreme behavior but positive about the program and they need people like him to applaud the direction they aposre going in and they need the united states wallace final thought gingrich look the russians tried to kill two people in great britain we join with britain we put in selective sanctions that were pretty severe i think establishing the principle the people can apost go around the world killing people is a good thing the president is going to have to find a way to have a big enough hammer that the selective and real that people can relax and say we are getting the right signal through to them or congress will react with an even bigger hammer in a way that could really damage the relationship wallace all right panel thank you all we aposll see you a little bit later in the program up next we aposre going to take a look at one of the closest senate races in the country the battle for the open seat in arizona we aposll talk with republican candidate and congresswoman martha mcsally about key issues in the contest including that migrant caravan headed for the u s commercial break wallace coming up a heated arizona race may determine which party controls the senate begin video clip rep martha mcsally r ariz u s senate candidate while we were in harm aposs way she was protesting our troops in a pink tutu rep kyrsten sinema d ariz u s senate candidate she aposs engaging in ridiculous attacks and smearing my campaign end video clip wallace we aposll sit down with republican candidate and congresswoman martha mcsally next commercial break wallace on election night just 16 days from now the battle for control of the senate may come down to the tight race for an open seat in arizona the realclearpolitics average of recent polls shows basically a dead heat republican martha mcsally leads democrat kyrsten sinema 46 percent to 45 3 the winner will be arizona aposs first female senator we invited both candidates to join us today coming kyrsten sinema declined but congresswoman mcsally joins us now from tucson and congresswoman welcome back to fox news sunday mcsally good morning chris thanks for having me on wallace you and sinema had a debate this week and the key moment came near the very end of the debate when you noted that back in 2003 your opponent was on a radio talk show and the host hypothetically talked about joining the taliban and kyrsten sinema said quote i don apost care if you want to do that and that led to this exchange in the debate begin video clip mcsally kyrsten i want to ask right now whether you aposre going to apologize to the veterans and me for saying it aposs ok to commit treason crosstalk sinema well martha has chosen to run a campaign like the one you aposre seeing right now where she is engaging in ridiculous attacks and smearing my campaign end video clip wallace congresswoman do you really think that kyrsten sinema was approving treason mcsally well it aposs her words chris it aposs totally out of step with american values when she clearly says in this radio interview she has no problem with an american going to join the taliban and look chris this is personal for those of us who serve and actually fought against the taliban i was a squadron commander over there with my a 10 squadron we were getting shot at by the taliban the taliban was killing americans and i aposll tell you the worst days we had at bagram air base when i was a commander was when an american gave their last breath fighting for our freedoms and fighting over there and was killed by someone from the taliban or their affiliates we would stop everything we aposre doing we would line up along the ramp as their flag draped casket came by and we would each then salute in silence you couldn apost hear a pin drop as we said goodbye to this american hero who was killed by the taliban so this is this is out of step with american values this is personal to those of us who went over there to fight and this just shows that she aposs disqualified to being a united states senator wallace i fully understand your your feelings and emotions about what you went through and of course we honor your service as the first female u s fighter pilot to ever see combat which is historic but to get back to the campaign sinema says look i had two brothers in the military one of them is still serving in the military she said this talk show host was going off presenting all kinds of hypothetical ideas and i was just trying to shut him down and get back to the fact she says that she opposed the iraq war which was just about to start in 2003 mcsally well chris she continues to make excuses she has yet to make an apology but look this is a pattern from my opponent right after 9 11 a moment when the country was unified in our healing and our mourning but also unified that we have got to go back go after the taliban who harbored al qaeda who killed 3 000 americans kyrsten sinema was protesting right after 9 11 any military action against terrorists she was protesting later in a pink tutu she was leading protests multiple protests inviting anarchists socialists others handing out flyers at her protest depicting american soldiers as skeletons and saying we are the ones conducting terror in the middle east so this is just a pattern of my opponent over many years where she has been a radical left activist a green party activist wallace right mcsally very much against our military and these are the facts they need to come out in his campaign compared to me who served 26 years in the military 325 combat hours fighting for our freedom wallace on the other hand she aposs taking some attacks making some attacks against you and i want to talk about one of them according to the latest fox news poll the top issue for voters around the country is health care and sinema is hitting you on that she notes that you voted for repeal and replace last year which under its terms would have allowed states to let it would have permitted states to allow insurance to be sold for people with preexisting conditions with higher premiums here is what sinema said about you in the debate begin video clip sinema the reality is that arizonans are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and martha voted to take that protection away end video clip wallace do you acknowledge that protection for people with preexisting conditions was significantly weaker under repeal and replace than it was under obamacare mcsally chris i am passionate about protecting people with preexisting conditions and forcing insurance companies to provide them health insurance i voted to make sure that they had that that coverage this is a classic out of the left all over the country the lies that they are perpetuating in order to play upon fear the reality is that obamacare right now is not covering people with preexisting conditions we can apost go back to what we were in the past we all know nobody who had diabetes or is a cancer survivor or asthma who couldn apost get access to health insurance but their intentions don apost equal policy outcomes i met an entrepreneur last week who decided to start a small business with a preexisting condition she aposs uncovered right now under obamacare so we are trying to move towards a system that provides more options more choice for people that lowers the cost wallace but congresswoman i mcsally that allows states to manage it and then i personally wallace congresswoman let me just jump in here mcsally right wallace because under repeal and replace the bill that you voted for if someone had a lapse in coverage of 63 days and of course a lot of these are cases of preexisting condition are people who don apost have insurance and then want to buy it if you had a lapse in coverage for 63 days states could force those people instead of buying it from an insurance company to buy it from a risk pool and that meant that the premiums would be higher that aposs exactly the kind of thing that obamacare tried to prevent mcsally yes chris what we were trying to do again is not have the federal government one size fits all top down approach while protecting people with preexisting conditions allowing states flexibility and then i advocated we have a 100 billion stability fund there i advocated for another 15 billion specifically for maternity and mental health and another 8 billion specifically to make sure that states are covering and supporting people with preexisting conditions again this is a complex issue we aposre not going to solve it all here this morning but we were trying to move away from the failures of obamacare towards something that actually provided more options at lower cost while protecting people with preexisting conditions again this is just a lie we aposre seeing all over the country playing on people aposs fears but i want the voters to know i aposm committed to protecting people with preexisting conditions i aposm fighting for it i fought for it and i voted for it and i will keep doing that in the senate wallace there was a rally yesterday that the president attended and spoke very much on your behalf at that rally he also talked about that caravan of thousands of migrants headed from honduras to the u s here he is begin video clip trump you think they aposre all wonderful people you got some bad people in those groups you got some tough people in those groups and i will tell you what this country doesn apost want them end video clip wallace congresswoman do you support the president aposs policy on migration even his threat to send troops to the southern border to shut it down to prevent that caravan from coming in mcsally well i share the president aposs frustration that the democrats are obstructing on this issue i represent a southern border district 80 miles of the border i chair the border security subcommittee and we have got fifth generation ranchers down there on the border right now dealing with a cartel activity continuing to traffic opioids and other drugs and human trafficking into our communities this is a public safety and a national security issue we also have like in the town of yuma the city of yuma we have got a number of people that are being trafficked by the cartels taking advantage of the loopholes in our laws so that they know they aposre going to be released right into the interior of the united states never to show up for their court date this is not going to work this doesn apost this isn apost working and my bill that i worked really closely with the white house on closed these loopholes only congress can do it wallace but mcsally so that this administration can enforce the law and make sure that we secure our borders wallace but congresswoman mcsally this is a unifying issue across arizona yes wallace but congresswoman before you supported what was known as the goodlatte bill you supported another bill in 2015 your opponent says that you aposre on all sides of this issue because in the bill you supported in 2015 you opposed defunding daca and in fact you supported a path to citizenship for the dreamers so what about the argument kyrsten sinema makes that you have been inconsistent on this issue mcsally chris you understand the legislative process i have been consistently leading on this issue as the border security subcommittee chair this is a difficult issue but when the president kicked daca to congress appropriately we worked together goodlatte mccaul labrador and myself to lead to identify a solution that secures the border closes these legal loopholes moves us more towards a merit based system and does something on daca this is what we worked on to bring to the floor unfortunately we couldn apost get it passed but we aposre going to keep working on it because the border still needs to be secured these loopholes still need to be closed and i aposm going to continue to lead on this when i aposm in the senate even though washington d c moves on the other topics we still have to address this issue wallace congresswoman mcsally thank you thanks for joining us and of course we will be following the returns from arizona on election night mcsally thanks a lot chris wallace up next we will bring back our sunday group to discuss the midterms now just two weeks away and the politics of that migration caravan from honduras commercial break begin video clip trump this will be an election of kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense that aposs what it aposs going to be end video clip wallace president trump now into his final midterm election blitz trying to fire up his base over what he thinks are the hot button issues and we aposre back now with the panel all right speaker gingrich what do you think of the president aposs strategy in these final weeks before the election the issues that he aposs hitting and the effort he aposs made you didn apost see it there but you know he aposs been on the campaign trail saying when you go to the voting booth pretend act as if i aposm on the ballot gingrich well normally i would say that that aposs not a good idea but i think in this environment with this president it aposs the only out and is the only way he can campaign he aposs he aposs that big a force he aposs that big a presence and the truth is he is mobilizing his base and he aposs giving them i mean when they say look this is jobs vs mobs there are 40 million people who pick that up and at coffee the next morning use it when he says this is about kavanaugh the campaign and the caravans there are 40 million people who pick it up the next day and use it wallace so what you aposre saying is it aposs going to be this election is going to be nationalized because of donald trump whether he says it or not gingrich yes if he had tried to hide the truth is from election night 2016 on this country has been in a national fight over who aposs going to run the country and i think that the kavanaugh event was really historically important because it both galvanized the right but also it reminded everyone this is a team sport you tester is not a moderate tester is going to vote for schumer and you go right down the list of every red state democrat and they can get up and say i aposm really different and the only question i have to ask them is you going to vote for schumer wallace a new fox poll this week asked voters what are their top issues what are they most concerned about here are the top results health care at 58 percent then the economy with 54 president trump with 51 and then immigration and supreme court nomination is tied at 46 percent these are the top issues extremely important to your vote chuck looking at that issue set which party do you think benefits both lane i aposm going to cop out and say both but i have an explanation it aposd be very interesting if you differentiated within each issue how the parties view them so republican voters would put immigration way at the top democratic voters would put health care way at the top so you see a lot of messaging all over the country on this issue of preexisting conditions you had that discussion with martha mcsally democrats well understand 80 percent even of republicans favor protection of preexisting conditions they got some elements to work with on that so they aposre pushing that very hard to get out their base this caravan i almost think that trump aposs campaign paid for the caravan because wallace oh wait wait wait let aposs not say that because they suggested the democrats did and lane i aposm just kidding but it aposs been a windfall wallace there aposs no kidding two weeks before the election lane sorry it aposs a windfall for him he aposs now incorporated into his campaign bottom line here is that both parties have settled on the strategy of base mobilization and they aposre using these issues that are hottest with their bases to achieve that purpose wallace all right well let aposs talk about the caravan which is headed from honduras and guatemala now a lot of them thousands of them on a bridge literally on a river between guatemala and mexico and president trump is trying to use that issue to fire up the base but according to the latest fox poll immigration not a clear winner for republicans when asked slightly different issue what should happen to illegal immigrants now working in the u s 22 percent say deport as many as possible 70 percent say set up a system for them to become legal so marc writ large how does the immigration issue play in this in this campaign short i think it aposs a huge winning issue for the president i think americans want border security and even to that last question the president offered a pathway to citizenship for the daca participants all he aposs asking for is democrats to come to the table on border security issues and so i think this is a huge winning issue for the president wallace what about family separation which was an explosion when it happened short sure it aposs an explosion but it aposs also policy that has plagued democratic administrations as well because congress has not passed laws that enabled an administration to actually have the tools to handle that situation your hands are tied because either you separate families and you allow and or you allow them to go free into the united states because the law says within 21 days the families have to be adjudicated and the courts are not able to adjudicate them that quickly wallace congresswoman harman yes well first abigail adams said remember the women on your list of priorities women are out there in force and women are on the ballot in almost 50 percent of the house races and 17 percent of the senate races and in arizona two women are are competing for senator and i think that this kavanaugh thing may fuel the base but it also will generate huge numbers of women i was elected in 1992 the year of the woman republican women voted for me in a lean republican district became republicans for harman and that aposs how i survived in 1994 when newt became the speaker and now we aposre friends go figure laughter harman but my point is that wallace well i don apost know you said that he hasn apost said that yet laughter gingrich definitely a friend harman on the caravan mike pence and john kelly when he was the department of homeland security secretary had a better idea they had a summit in miami in june of 2017 and the point of it was to provide help to governments in central america to combat corruption and to provide for business investment mexico was part of that conference and if they had done that wallace ok but i aposm asking you just politics of this caravan coming north and the president saying i aposm going to send u s troops to the border and shut down the border harman well i think it aposs red meat to his base but i think thoughtful people much prefer george w bush aposs approach to comprehensive immigration reform that i supported wallace but it failed harman yes i know it failed and we that aposs what we need to get back to is supporting failing governments so that they can keep their people there stopping the push factor and then also doing comprehensive immigration wallace but you would you agree that this caravan going up and let aposs say right now neither the republicans or the democrats had anything to do with it is a political plus for president trump trying to mobilize his base harman i think it mobilizes his base i think it aposs a human tragedy and a whole bunch of other people will be repelled by the fact that he thinks that it aposs good politics and doesn apost worry about the human rights issues involved wallace speaker gingrich well look i don apost think there are human rights issues when 4 000 or 5 000 people decided to attack the united states and that aposs what they aposre doing i mean these are people look they aposre carrying they aposre carrying flags from honduras crosstalk harman murdered in their own country gingrich oh baloney these are people who want a better future and they have harman right gingrich look if a mob came down the street and occupied your home because you have a nicer home than they do you wouldn apost say oh gosh i really feel sorry for you you would be pretty angry that they were occupying your home i think the average person look they aposre gallup did a survey 179 million people in latin america would like to come to united states now at what point do we draw a number and when you draw the number i don apost care how big it is nancy pelosi can say oh i will take 12 million fine is she then going to control the border is she then going to confront people harman i think we have to control our border i have never been against that crosstalk harman but i think using this issue i thought that was the question as an election campaign theme i think is very cynical short we wish there were more democrats like you in congress today because there aposs not been that partnership to actually secure the border now harman well i was in i was in for years gingrich i wish there were any democrats like you in the congress today wallace what does that mean laughter gingrich i mean they aposre all to the left they aposre virtually all to the left of where she was wallace do you agree with that i mean the party certainly has moved dramatically to the left harman i think both parties have lost the center and both parties are governed more from the further out i aposm not going to call them extreme and it aposs a huge loss for good governance i just remember in 1994 penny kasich i don apost know if you aposre involved in john kasich and tim penny then a democrat now an independent led an effort to provide for responsible budget cuts we got up to 100 billion including defense cuts and i represented a defense dependent district and it almost passed and then we all banded together with you and president clinton to pass a balanced budget amendment in 1997 that aposs how congress should work wallace who knew we were going to talk about penny kasich today wow laughter crosstalk wallace go ahead chuck lane well i was just going to jump in i mean one of the ironies of this arizona raised that we were focusing on for senate is that you two member current members of congress who are actually fairly middle of the road in the way they have conducted themselves in congress actually worked together on health care who are now at each other aposs throats in the most vituperative terms possible martha mcsally calling kyrsten sinema a traitor in a pink tutu or something and that just shows that even when people kind of have a moderate record they find themselves forced by the political circumstances to repudiate that and seem even more extreme than they actually have governed wallace all right i know you aposre not going to play ball but i aposm going to ask the other three here quickly starting with you marc who aposs going to win the house short i think that democrats are more likely to hold the house but i think if nancy pelosi is speaker with maxine waters and adam schiff are chairmen it aposs the best thing the world that could happen for the president aposs reelection in 2020 wallace congresswoman harman democrats by a small margin and i hope they have a vision for our future wallace but you don apost know harman i hope it aposs about a vision for future not just laughter wallace oh ok and speaker gingrich i think the odds are equally good that kevin mccarthy will be the next speaker and not nancy pelosi wallace there you go all right thank you and i left you lane i would play ball wallace ok who quickly lane i think the dems will get probably 223 seats wallace ok wow thanks panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week celebrity chef jose andres on feeding florida after hurricane michael and tending to people in need around the world commercial break wallace winning a michelin star is a lifetime achievement for most chefs but one man who has already done that is more focused now on helping people caught in natural disasters here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape jose andres celebrity chef we aposre chefs we feed people and people are always in need of a hot meal and that aposs what we do wallace voice over jose andres is a world famous shaft with more than 30 restaurants across the u s but this week he and his team are in the florida panhandle cooking tens of thousands of meals for people still digging out from hurricane michael andres unfortunately could be that the missing people are still somewhere here under the rubble but we do what we do which is cooking feeding water intelligence to make sure that everybody at least will have a hot plate of food wallace andres started what he called the world central kitchen after the devastating earthquake in haiti in 2010 ever since when there is a natural disaster they respond andres we were in the fires of california we went to hawaii after the volcano right now we have two teams in indonesia after the two earthquakes that hit that island wallace but his biggest food relief effort was in puerto rico last year after hurricane maria andres what we did really was at one point sending food to more than 900 places a day wallace on camera do you think that your operation made the difference between life and death for some people there andres the answer is yes chris so i do believe like what my little organization did and others i aposm sure it saved lives wallace voice over the numbers are staggering in the nine months after maria andres and 20 000 volunteers served 3 5 million meals as many as 150 000 a day andres when we bring hot food one shelter at a time one neighborhood at a time what you gather is intelligence wallace and that is the subject of his new book we fed an island the lessons he aposs learned about how to provide food relief he says chefs are good at managing chaos andres the people in the government are great people but if we give them sometimes a little more room to adapt we will do a much better job providing relief quicker and faster wallace will introduce you to jose andres back in 2004 when he turned his kitchens into laboratories producing something called molecular gastronomy andres you see and this is what we are looking crosstalk wallace on camera oh my god andres my guys are going to be watching these and they aposre going to tell me how we doing holding there wallace voice over but now andres spends much of his time away from his family and food empire on the front lines of natural disasters andres thank you guys wallace which raises the question what gives him more satisfaction creating some masterpiece or cooking paella for hundreds andres as john steinbeck said in his book the grapes of wrath he said wherever there is a fight so hungry people may eat i will
