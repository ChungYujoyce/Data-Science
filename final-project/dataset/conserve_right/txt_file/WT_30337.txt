tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn president trump signed an executive order thursday aimed at improving the medicare program for seniors hoping to redirect the 2020 campaign conversation from his failure to overhaul president obama s program to his step by step efforts to stamp out health crises and stiff arm democrats pushing government run care speaking in the villages florida a massive retirement community the president renewed his 2016 pledge not to touch medicare while in office as long as i am president no one will lay a hand on your medicare benefits he told a crowd of people who rely on the federal insurance program for americans 65 and older top stories gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid n y gov andrew cuomo s careless cruelty shows in coronavirus nursing home policy sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender officials said mr trump s order will increase seniors choices help them access their health data and expand telehealth services that allow patients and doctors to interact from afar it promotes medicare advantage plans which are run by private companies that contract with the government by offering to let enrollees share in savings from better health outcomes and it ensures that consumers aren t steered into the traditional fee for service program over medicare advantage democrats slammed the campaign style push noting mr trump s own budget proposals would curtail spending on medicare mr trump mainly used his speech to contrast his broader approach with democratic plans to expand coverage through ideas such as government run medicare for all which his administration views as a socialist push to upend health plans that millions of people know and enjoy these people on the other side these people are crazy by the way they want to take it away give you lousy healthcare mr trump said in freewheeling remarks that touched on supreme court justice brett m kavanaugh the 2020 democratic primary and open borders mr trump tried to find common ground with the senior crowd saying retirement looks pretty good i should be in this audience clapping he said but i didn t trust anybody to be standing here at the podium because i know what you have mr trump swept into office pledging to repeal obamacare and replace it with a health plan that offered insurance for everybody though his gop allies were unable to send a bill to his desk in 2017 the president settled for incremental changes he expanded access to cheaper bare bones coverage and pushing congress to zero out the individual mandate penalty for shirking insurance as part of congressional republicans broad tax overhaul mr trump says he would like to take another run at replacing the 2010 affordable care act though he is punting major decisions and votes until after the 2020 election if the republicans take back the house keep the senate keep the presidency we re going to have a fantastic plan he said the administration has shifted its rhetoric away from obamacare in recent months favoring mr trump s push to tackle surprise medical billing speed the approval of generic drugs and explore ways to safely import cheaper drugs from canada mr trump said he s being so bold that health care lobbyists might be behind the democrats impeachment bid i would be very surprised if the hoax didn t come a little bit from the people that we re taking on he said i wouldn t be surprised if it was from some of these industries that we take on like pharma democrats are working with mr trump on some of his health care efforts but say bigger action is needed liberals pushing a single payer system say their model will enhance the medicare program for seniors while extending government sponsored care to americans of all ages as millions continue to go uninsured or struggle with medical debt every single medicare for all and public option proposal put forward by members of congress would provide more americans more health care increasing the number of people with coverage lowering out of pocket costs and expanding benefits said maura calsyn managing director of health policy at the center for american progress a liberal think tank but trump officials argue government run programs would restrict choice rob millions of people of private insurance and weaken a program that s working for seniors seema verma administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services dubbed mr trump the great protector of medicare she said proposals such as medicare for all or a public option to compete with private plans are immoral and would demote american seniors to little better than second class status sensing the risky politics of single payer candidates such as former vice president joseph r biden are running on plans to patch up obamacare and enhance it mr trump is seizing on any vulnerability he can however pointing to some democrats push to subsidize health coverage for immigrants who are in the u s illegally they put them way ahead of american citizens like you who obey our laws
