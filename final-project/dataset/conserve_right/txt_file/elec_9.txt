 sign in loyalty stops at state line manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong for a west virginia democrat these days balancing the demands of local and national party politics can induce ideological schizophrenia the party controls the governor s mansion both of the state s u s senate seats and both houses of the state legislature but president obama is so politically toxic in the mountaineer state that a jailed felon won nine of the state s 55 counties and took 41 percent of the vote in the state s democratic presidential primary last month the stark divisions were on display again last week when three of the state s top democrats sen joe manchin iii rep nick j rahall ii and gov earl ray tomblin revealed that they would be elsewhere when the party convenes in charlotte n c in september to nominate mr obama for a second term top stories coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history australian researchers see virus design manipulation ann coulter turns on trump most disloyal actual retard that has ever set foot in the oval office mr rahall has said he backs president obama for re election but mr manchin and mr tomblin have not mr manchin a former governor who is running for a full six year term in november said in a statement that he was focused on bringing people together for the next generation not the next election tomblin campaign spokesman chris stadelman told the charleston daily mail last week that the governor has serious problems with both gov romney and president obama the governor feels that his time is best spent working in west virginia to move our state forward instead of attending a four day political rally in north carolina mr stadelman said james a white a political scientist at concord university in athens w va said in a telephone interview that the state democrats reaction reflects that the presidential race in west virginia is not going to be close and everybody knows that in 17 presidential elections starting in 1932 republicans carried west virginia just three times in the gop landslides of 1956 1972 and 1984 but in the past three elections republicans have carried the state with 56 percent of the vote in 2004 and in 2008 simon perry professor emeritus of political science at marshall university in huntington said the state s politics reflect voters quirks they generally think that local politicians know their needs while the president and national politicians in washington just do not understand them the reason that this happens is probably due to the fact that voters have little quarrel with the democratic party at the state level but at the national level it s totally different mr perry said mr white said he expects democrats to do well again at the state level in november although mr obama is given little chance against presumptive republican nominee mitt romney for the state s five electoral votes one big problem party officials say is that key parts of the party s national agenda energy health care and social issues play poorly in the state the coal industry is vital to the state economy and mr obama s efforts to promote alternative energy sources have been wildly unpopular mr tomblin faces gop businessman bill maloney while mr manchin will run against four time republican senatorial candidate john raese mr rahall the state s only democrat in the house will face state delegate rick snuffer maybe their data shows their races are going to be tighter and they re trying to win over the marginal voter by not going to the convention mr white said there is a sharp divide in the state over whether the politicians should show loyalty to their constituencies or loyalty to their parties mr perry said five term sen john d rockefeller iv a democrat has been far more muted about his disagreements with the white house and will be in charlotte in september i ve made no secret of the fact that i don t want to see mitt romney elected mr rockefeller said in a statement and i have never made a secret of the fact that i support our president and the entire democratic ticket top to bottom republicans have rushed to capitalize on the dichotomy state political observers say running ads repeatedly linking local democrats to mr obama and his policies mr white said one motivation of the gop strategy is to tamp down local democratic turnout and voter enthusiasm the fewer people who vote in this state if you are raese if you are maloney if you are snuffer that is a good thing mr white said mr maloney even argued that mr tomblin had missed an opportunity to publicly register his unhappiness with the president by not going to the convention earl ray tomblin has chosen to support barack obama by not going to his own convention to vote against the president mr maloney said barack obama and his job killing policies are hurting west virginians it is now clear that earl ray tomblin supports barack obama and his policies copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view comments click to hide
