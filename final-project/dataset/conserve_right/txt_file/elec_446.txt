sen ted cruz and donald trump at a rally in washington d c reuters like the titanic s architects realizing their fatal design flaw right around the first strains of nearer my god to thee republicans are waking up to the realization that their presidential primary scheme is more frankenstein than frank gehry to protect an establishment frontrunner against an insurgent the party frontloaded this year s primaries and caucuses going into march only 133 delegates had been allocated super tuesday added another 595 delegates by month s end 1 537 of 2 472 delegates will be gone the problem no one figured that for the first time in modern gop history the insurgent would wind up as the frontrunner which leads to the second problem republicans looking to stop donald trump are running out of opportunities to derail him so far 15 states have allocated delegates by march 22 another 15 will have gone to the polls leaving but 20 states between then and the first tuesday in june just 11 weeks to change the gop narrative returning to the titanic let s presume the republican ship hasn t taken on too much water and it s still a viable contest how then to stop trump my suggestion 1 keep the field populated to the proposition that the only way to beat trump is via a head to head contest don t buy the spin the latest nbc news surveymonkey weekly election poll played out such scenarios involving trump versus texas sen ted cruz and florida sen marco rubio the results rubio lost by six points cruz by 13 assuming rubio soldiers on past the march 15 vote in florida he and cruz need to strike an accord they don t attack each other their super pacs stick it to trump and they draw straws to decide who has to call jeb bush to ask for his super pac join in the trump bashing syndicated columnist and fox news contributor jonah goldberg takes this unholy alliance a step further suggesting a rubio cruz ticket ala reagan bush in 1980 i m not sure it s in cruz s dna to be so magnanimous since he leads rubio in states won and delegates earned trump may keep winning states moving forward but from here on it s a quantity not quality argument with the goal being 2 keep trump under 50 percent the number that matters most it s not states won but the 1 237 delegates needed to win the gop nomination of the 1 744 republican delegates left on the board after super tuesday 391 are in winner take all states the two most important florida and ohio on march 15 trump has to be stopped in one if not both to slow down the express at present he leads in both that leaves 1 353 delegates to be allocated either proportionally or by some hybrid scheme most crucial of all states where a 50 majority winner earns all the delegates texas has such a system before super tuesday not counting south carolina where trump won all 50 delegates he and cruz rubio split almost equally divided 65 delegates 31 for trump 32 for the senators if something similar occurs in the remaining proportional states with trump staying near his mid 30 s ceiling there s still a shot at wheeling and dealing in cleveland but before we get there we ll have a few 3 showdown states i mentioned ohio and florida as must have s for the anti trump forces here are three others to add to the list first up wisconsin s april 5 primary which comes after a two week break in the action and where last week s marquette law poll has trump up by 10 as the state with the nation s tenth largest catholic population it may be an opportune moment to revisit trump s rope a pope and don t forget wisconsin gov scott walker had some unkind words about the donald as he ended his presidential bid after that indiana s may 3 primary the hoosier state is home to america s most prophetic county seat by the first tuesday in may it s an indication of which way the political class leans indiana sen dan coats is no fan gov mike pence who s up for reelection this fall hasn t endorsed finally if there s still a race california and new jersey on june 7 again after a two week intermission establishment republicans would love nothing more than embarrassing new jersey gov christie on his home turf but it s a winner take all state in trump s backyard 51 delegates a more pragmatic strategy would be to go to california and take advantage of a system that awards delegates three apiece for each of the state s 53 congressional districts and from there 4 outmaneuver trump now outwit him later in cleveland let s suppose trump goes to cleveland close to but shy of a guaranteed first ballot victory the gop s last multi ballot convention 1948 if no one is elected on the first ballot all 2 472 delegates can vote for whomever s name had been placed in nomination which means to outwit trump in cleveland stack the deck with delegates willing to bail on trump once their commitment is over the gop s 437 pledged delegates 269 republican officeholders past and present plus 168 members of the republican national committee would be lowest hanging of anti trump fruit from there cruz and rubio delegates will have to unite if the gop is serious about stopping the insurrection it intervenes at the grassroots level and shops for voters not only willing to become delegates but open to the idea of switching candidates at the convention the political equivalent of changing horses midstream can trump still be stopped yes but it requires a lot of odd shaped pieces to fall in place now if you ll excuse me i m off to sink into a leather chair and enjoy a cigar and brandy while the violins play and the lifeboats are lowered
