tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn corey lewandowski has been consuming most of the oxygen in the republican senate race in new hampshire and he s not even a candidate yet the smash mouth political operative emerged from obscurity when he signed on as president trump s 2016 campaign manager and the gamble has paid off financially and now perhaps politically despite getting fired from the campaign and taking some darts from the more traditional wing of the gop mr lewandowski s loyalty to mr trump has earned him a rarefied status among the president s followers and given him a national profile that analysis say could excite voters and help him rake in tons of money for a bid against democratic sen jeanne shaheen see also corey lewandowski likely to clash with dems during testimony at impeachment hearing in a trump dominated republican party the only thing better than having the last name of trump would be having the last name of lewandowski said neil levesque executive director of the new hampshire institute of politics at saint anselm college during a break in his contentious hearing before the house judiciary committee mr lewandowski tweeted out the link to a new website aimed at boosting his senate hopes it prominently features a mr trump quote praising mr lewandowski michael dennehy a new hampshire based republican strategist said mr lewandowski truly is a mini me of donald trump mr lewandowski was back in the middle of the political action tuesday on capitol hill where he testified before the house judiciary committee over potential obstruction of justice by mr trump the showdown between mr lewandowski and congressional democrats provided the pugnacious 45 year old with a massive stage to flash the trademark swagger and brash and bombastic style that much like mr trump has made him among the most polarizing of political figures former new hampshire sen judd gregg drove home that point last month when he told the manchester union leader the state s largest newspaper that mr lewandowski is a thug and said it would be an outrage if he runs corey has both strong supporters and detractors here in new hampshire said stephen duprey a member of the republican national committee from new hampshire if he were to get into the race with the president s support he would be very difficult to beat in a primary and he would be a formidable opponent for sen shaheen he said early polls have shown that mr lewandowski would enter the gop primary race with a double digit lead over his rivals brig gen don bolduc former state house speaker bill o brien and bryant corky messner mr lewandowski has been test driving a possible campaign message casting ms shaheen as a radical liberal and weak on immigration and attacking her for opposing mr trump s supreme court picks he also is touting his connections with the white house and his fundraising prowess but whether he runs mrs shaheen still is favored to win reelection the 72 year old showed her political strength in 2014 when she won reelection even as republicans flipped control of the senate polls show she has a double digit lead over mr lewandowski in a hypothetical match up and had over 5 million in the bank at the end of june mr lewandowski though is likely to have a secret weapon in mr trump who praised him at a new hampshire rally last month saying he would make a fantastic senator other republicans shutter at the prospect corey is unfit for public office said former new hampshire gop chairman fergus cullen mr cullen said he doesn t understand why mr lewandowski would want to risk denting his image in a high profile senate race why would he put that gravy train at risk by running for senate he said he is cashing in right now mr dennehy said it is clear the republican establishment believes mr lewandowski has no place in electoral politics while allies of new hampshire gov chris sununu are concerned that he could be a drag on the state s entire gop ticket mr sununu s older brother john e sununu held the senate seat until mrs shaheen defeated him in 2008 then there are those who believe that lewandowski could actually help the republican ticket if he is the nominee by bringing more money into the state for republicans and contrasting himself to shaheen in a way that has never been done before mr dennehy said mr dennehy said he s warming to the idea of mr lewandowski running saying he could raise an obscene amount of money through his ties to mr trump and likely would take the fight to mrs shaheen in ways that others might consider off limits mr trump s first victory in the 2016 republican presidential primary came in new hampshire democratic nominee hillary clinton however won the state in the general election and
