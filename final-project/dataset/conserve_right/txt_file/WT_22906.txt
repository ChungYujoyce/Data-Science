apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion once again headlines are warning of a government shutdown if congress and the white house can t strike a deal on border security but this shutdown if it comes will be a public relations win for president donald trump why democrats reiterate demand reopen the government before negotiations on border security cnn blasted in a headline on jan 21 top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender pelosi says reopen government then we ll talk wrote kcby in a headline above an associated press story from jan 22 so trump did he reopened the government but border talks have been unproductive to say the least trump s call for funding has been denied and then democrats threw this in the mix just recently let s abolish ice the border committee democrats are behaving all of a sudden irrationally trump tweeted not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed wall they overrode recommendations of border patrol experts but they don t even want to take murderers into custody what s going on good question but the simple answer is this what s going on is democrats never had in mind any intent to secure america s borders they pretended to the press during the government shutdown as if trump were acting illogically and petulantly and sold the line that if only the president would pay these poor public servants and return federal operations to normal well then the democrats would come to the table to discuss immigration they haven t what s more they won t so this looming shutdown if it indeed comes will belong firmly in the fault category of democrats and only the farthest leftist of lefties will be able to paint it otherwise another way to state it the american people aren t stupid cheryl chumley can be reached at emailprotected or on twitter
