domestic attempt to assign blame for the virus which they alternatively claim was created in a lab was released to disrupt global trade or unleashed to undermine elections we ve seen unprecedented cooperation and action among the social media platforms governmentsand international organisations to combat the spread of malign information and yet it proliferates we cannot fact check our way out of this crisis because in the onslaught of covid 19 disinformation the most important weapon is not fakes it s fear and unlike toilet paper and pasta there s no shortage of it these days disinformation thrives on emotional manipulation and like the pandemic and the social distancing we are using to combat it the world needs informational distancing to slow the spread of the coronavirus infodemic there is a widespread misconception driven in part by president trump s insistence on using the term fake news that disinformation consists of entirely fabricated outlandish stories a 2019 pew research study found that half of americans believe that made up news and information is a very big problem in the country today ranking above violent crime and climate change to combat the problem 78 per cent of those surveyed said that they check the facts in news stories themselves but disinformation is never simply about fact vs fiction the key to its success is not the quality of the yarn disinformers spin the believability of the fake personae they use to amplify it or the effectiveness of the ads used to boost their posts it is human nature we are being

advertising that drove the bulk of the russian internet research agency s ira campaign the agency was able to garner such high engagement because it had spent years cultivating acommunity around emotionally charged politically divisive issues like police brutality immigration racism and gay rights as congressionally released ads and posts revealed much of the content shared by the ira early on in the 2016 presidential campaign was not fake or even outwardly malicious it consisted of positive posts to engender camaraderie between users around a particular issue as the election neared the

ithad deployed across europe for more than a decade capitalising on feelings of disenfranchisement among ethnic russians in estonia corruption in ukraine since the maidan revolution and worries about migration across western europe but never did it have such a fertile field in which to plant seeds of distrust and untruth than the coronavirus crisis everyone is fearful we are afraid we ll get sick or that our loved ones will traffic to social media platforms like facebook has ballooned as we seek human connection and any scrap of information we can find to knit together into a quilt of

filters and we cannot wash away the effects of emotional manipulation while we are in crisis mode as informational hygiene techniques suggest but we can put space between ourselves and the manipulators we should take similar precautions with both our physical and informational health recognising that disinformation runs on our feelings in short we must start practising informational distancing rather than allowing ourselves to be played by bad actors when we feel emotion rising we should step away from the screen and take a deep breath or ten by putting actual physical distance between ourselves and our devices we re not only allowing our emotions time to cool off we re interrupting the algorithmic tyranny on which disinformation runs keeping us scrolling through our neverending news feeds and recommendation rabbit holes and most importantly we ourselves are not amplifying disinformation by sharing it if after some distance we still find ourselves pondering those ten weird tips to beat covid 19 we should verify our information through a reliable non partisan professional source in the case of coronavirus that means doctors and scientists not politicians and pundits informational distancing takes work and it s only a small part of the information ecosystem that caused the coronavirus infodemic in the first place to truly flatten the informational curve we need the participation and cooperation of both traditional and social media to cover and amplify information in a responsible way most critically we need recognition from politicians that
