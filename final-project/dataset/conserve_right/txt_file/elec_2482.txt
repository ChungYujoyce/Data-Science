national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions the democratic establishment managed the nearly impossible in the course of less than two weeks it cut off bernie sanders at the pass and revived joe biden we don t live in an age of powerful political parties with commanding figures pulling the strings in backrooms no smoking allowed the presidential nominating process in particular is as open and democratic as it has ever been this makes the coordinated action of the latest interval of the democratic race even more astonishing center left parties around the western world have collapsed or been taken over by outsiders which made it believable that sanders would do the same here instead the center of the democratic party has held one reason it was so widely assumed sanders would take a significant delegate lead on super tuesday was that we had a direct analogue republicans nominated donald trump in 2016 when he jumped out to a lead by winning plurality victories against a fractured field if republicans couldn t unite to blunt trump why would democrats fare any better against sanders four years ago republicans loathed their party establishment and had turned their backs on their immediate past president george w bush sanders isn t plowing in as fertile ground jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription

war weren t popular with republicans whereas barack obama and his signature initiative obamacare are popular with democrats this made it possible for biden to run on restoration rather than revolution and find an audience especially in south carolina where many voters told exit pollsters they wanted a return to obama policies it also meant that as a general matter pillars of the party establishment hadn t been discredited the biggest moment in biden s comeback was the endorsement of a 14 term congressman and member of the congressional leadership named jim clyburn after biden s smashing south carolina victory the party fell in line quickly with candidates exiting and endorsing biden it was a collective action of the sort that republicans couldn t manage in 2016 this was in part because there was no one suitable to rally around jeb bush s association with the two past presidents of his party was a liability because it played into the charge of dynasty besides bush had the poor early showings of biden without a reservoir of support among a key base of voters it was ted cruz who was the only viable alternative to trump but no one wanted to come to his aid he wasn t a longtime party fixture considered fondly even by his competitors but an ambitious newcomer who had alienated his colleagues and frightened the establishment on top of this trump scrambled ideological categories and piqued the curiosity of elements of the gop old guard sanders in contrast catalyzed a straight left vs moderate fight and occasioned the uniform fear and loathing of the democratic establishment finally republicans wanted to throw caution to the wind the last two candidates identified with the establishment john mccain and mitt romney had lost and gop victories in midterm elections had delivered less than the party s base had expected it was a time for risks because really how could things get worse the mood of a swath of democrats is different extreme nervousness about messing up its opportunity to defeat trump what will be the upshot of the party s effort to stall sanders party establishments can fail two ways they can be ineffectual and they can be wrong republicans failed to stop trump at the same time that fears he couldn t win the election proved unfounded meanwhile democrats tilted the playing field toward hillary clinton and succeeded only in elevating a historically weak candidate this year the democratic establishment may yet again thwart sanders yet the party is throwing itself into the arms of a septuagenarian with serious performance issues we won t know until november if this is a smashing success or a grievous mistake born of desperation 2020 by king features syndicate get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020
