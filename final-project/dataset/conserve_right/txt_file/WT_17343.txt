much to bear even though no one around might have imagined that i remember there were days when the thought of addressing the media overwhelmed me she said imagine yourself in china standing before a crowd full of chinese people who are staring at you and you had to make a speech in chinese that s how i felt most intriguing though was when she talked about her goals for the year it was simply to be happier than she was last year don t we all want to be happy aren t we all doing whatever we do in order to be happy she said unexpectedly as soon as happiness became my goal i achieved more things than ever but a funny thing happened i started to want more that s when i really started to struggle a lot came into my mind i started to think too much i started to think about scores statistics not only of mine but others as well i found it especially challenging to deal with others expectations for me she said her family kept her grounded and then park paid tribute to her parents her fans and

presidents cup will be relying on fedex cup points to determine the u s team for the 2015 matches in south korea that means golf s strongest fields will not award as many points compared to previous years american players previously earned one point for every dollar in official pga tour earnings double the amount in the year of the presidents cup prize money at the majors was roughly 8 million this year while the world golf championships offered 8 75 million the players championship had a 9 5 million purse and the fedex cup playoff events were at 8 million the largest purse for a regular pga tour event was 6 7 million last year americans now get fedex cup points counted toward the president cup standings majors and the players offer 600 points to the winner the wgcs and fedex cup playoff events award 550 points while the rest of the pga tour events offer 500 points except for opposite field events which award 250 points then again winning majors never guaranteed a spot on the
