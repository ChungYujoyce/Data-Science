apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion nuclear armed pakistan is not a model of stability it just elected a new prime minister after a campaign that featured widespread violence and election day bombings the apparent loser has alleged vote rigging in favor of his opponent who was supported by the omnipresent pakistani army that s one half of the context in which the international monetary fund imf will soon consider another financial bailout for pakistan which has benefited from a dozen of them since the 1980s the other half is the fact that pakistan s economy is in shambles due to large scale corruption and a growing debt crisis the money it owes other nations and non pakistani entities is more than 30 percent of its gdp partly because of the extensive loans it has received from china to build parts of cpec the china pakistan economic corridor by which china is building roads power plants railroads and military bases in pakistan top

abortions for all including illegal aliens pakistan needs about another 3 billion in the next few months to avoid defaulting on loans from the imf the world bank and china the imf will almost certainly bail pakistan out of its financial troubles again but should it there are two reasons that weigh heavily against such an action the first is pakistan s continuing support of a variety of terrorist networks through its infamous inter service intelligence agency isi among the terrorist groups pakistan supports are al qadea the taliban also supported by russia and china and lashkar e taiba which massacred more than 160 people in mumbai india in 2008 osama bin laden hid for years in abbottabad pakistan it s inconceivable that isi wasn t responsible for his concealment the trump administration has terminated military aid to pakistan because it refuses to cease supporting terrorist networks with money fighters and intelligence information but there is no action we or any other nation can take to stop pakistan s religiously based support for terrorism why then shouldn t we block another imf bailout the second reason not to bail out pakistan is china s growing de facto colonization of pakistan through cpec according to a wall street journal report china is investing about 62 billion in pakistan to build infrastructure projects three years into the program according to that report about half of the cpec planned projects have begun china is conducting what some call debt trap diplomacy through which pakistan is becoming so indebted to china that it will be compelled to follow china s policies in southwest asia and beyond in fact the debt trap has already been sprung with the eager assistance of the pakistan s government isi and army gwadar is a large pakistani city on the arabian sea chinese officials have demanded that much of the nearby population be moved away for security reasons and to make room for thousands of chinese military and civilian people being brought in to construct large port facilities and eventually transform gwadar into a chinese naval base pakistan s government dependent on its army for whatever level of stability it can achieve will not suffer de facto colonization gladly despite pakistan s support of terrorism china s corrupting largesse will be able to satisfy the pakistani army and isi sufficiently to quell any thoughts of rebellion in june defense secretary james mattis said of china the ming dynasty appears to be their model albeit in a more muscular manner demanding other nations become tribute states kowtowing to beijing another imf bailout for pakistan would be a western contribution to china s transformation of pakistan into a tribute state in these circumstances the united states the largest contributor to imf needs to voice its opposition to another bailout of pakistan and try to prevent it we probably can t prevent it but we certainly need to try we have some leverage according to a 2016 report by the congressional budget office u s obligations to the imf were then 164 billion but as the cbo reported it is very difficult to account for the actual costs we incur nevertheless as the cbo wrote because of the risk of defaulted loans u s contributions to imf are at risk some will argue that denying pakistan another imf bailout would force it to borrow more from china accelerating its dependence on chinese largesse and power unfortunately that dependence is already established and whether imf grants another bailout or not won t change that instead denying another imf bailout would make pakistan s subservience more obvious to the pakistani population and government the attendant embarrassment to pakistan could create friction between it and china which is sufficient reason for another imf bailout to be blocked pakistan s immediate importance to us is the logistics route it has provided for supply our and our allies forces in afghanistan china s power over pakistan may cause future closures thus our policy toward china has to factor in the war in afghanistan india which borders both pakistan and china is the key but our policy toward china is unclear president trump s accelerating tariff war won t turn it into a fair trader far less an ally it would be far better for the president to speak out on the dangers of china s de facto colonization of pakistan and other nations if such action were coupled with a clear embrace of india comprised of a new trade agreement and the beginning of a defense alliance the president s policy could help contain china s ambitions jed babbin a deputy undersecretary of defense in the george h w bush administration is the author of in the words of ou
