to asia and increased support for alliances in the region will produce friction with china during a news conference monday in beijing with china s military chief gen fang fenghui chairman of the joint

historic alliances and there will be points when that creates friction he said alluding to china s growing assertiveness in pressuring asian nations to accept its disputed claims of maritime sovereignty over large areas of international waters and resource rich islets the four star general s comments were an unusual public admission that u s military relations with china remain rocky u s allies in asia have been pressing the pentagon to do more to counter china s growing military assertiveness in asia activities that they say are undermining a regional stability that has been assured

the expanding chinese military power that the pacific could accommodate both of us analysts say that statement reflects china s assertion that the u s military will no long be the dominant power in the region china s state controlled media omitted the remark about impending friction between the two militaries and sought to portray gen dempsey s visit in more flowery terms the often jingoistic global times an official communist party newspaper quoted gen fang on the visit saying your visit is an important event in the bilateral military exchange program we place great importance in it army
