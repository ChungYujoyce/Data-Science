company connected to the son of trump s potential 2020 democratic rival joe biden it is illegal to solicit or receive foreign help in a u s election among mckinley s concerns was the administration s failure to support ukrainian ambassador marie yovanovitch who was ousted in march on orders from trump mckinley who as a latin america expert was not specifically involved in ukraine was also frustrated that there had been no response to an august inspector general s report that found significant evidence of leadership and management problems including allegations from career employees that assistant secretary of state kevin moley and his former senior adviser marie stull retaliated or tried to retaliate against them as holdovers from the obama administration rep mark meadows r n c told reporters outside the closed door hearing that mckinley was complimentary about pompeo s role but did raise other issues i think most of this is a concern by a colleague for an ambassador that he held in high regard meadows said declining to provide more details of the closed session republicans are crying foul over the process of the impeachment inquiry but as house democrats press on with the investigation senate majority leader mitch mcconnell briefed republicans about the possible trial ahead mcconnell warned of a possible house impeachment vote by thanksgiving that would force a trial in the senate likely by christmas he used slides and history lessons during a private senate gop lunch in the capitol to talk about the process according to a person familiar with the meeting at

to democrats pelosi said later the president was having a meltdown senate democratic leader chuck schumer said he knows his house colleagues didn t run for office to conduct an impeachment investigation but he said the facts that are already in the public domain are so deeply troubling and must be taken very seriously another key figure in the impeachment investigation special envoy kurt volker returned to capitol hill on wednesday to review the transcript of his oct 3 testimony to investigators according to a person familiar with his appearance volker provided text messages to lawmakers that revealed an effort at the state department to push ukraine s leader into opening an investigation of the gas company burisma connected to biden s son hunter in return for a visit with trump that effort soon escalated into what one diplomat feared was a quid pro quo for u s military aid trump has denied that saying assistance to ukraine was delayed to pressure the country into addressing corruption another ambassador involved in those text message exchanges gordon sondland has been asked to appear thursday the testimony so far from the witnesses mainly officials from the state department and other foreign policy posts largely corroborates the account of the government whistleblower whose complaint first sparked the impeachment inquiry according to lawmakers attending the closed door interviews one witness said it appeared three amigos tied to the white house sondland volker and energy secretary rick perry had taken over foreign policy another quoted national security adviser john bolton as calling giuliani a hand grenade for his back channel efforts to get ukraine to investigate biden and biden s son hunter trump s july 25 phone call in which he pressed ukraine s president volodymr zelenskiy to investigate biden s family is at the center of the democrats inquiry pelosi despite intensifying calls from trump and republicans to hold a formal vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry showed no indication she would do so she said congress will continue its investigation as part of the constitution s system of checks and balances of the executive branch this is not a game for us this is deadly serious we re on a path that is taking us a path to the truth pelosi told reporters tuesday trump calls the impeachment inquiry an illegitimate process and has blocked officials from cooperating at the same time republicans are bracing for a vote and trial house gop whip steve scalise invited gop sen lindsey graham who was an impeachment manager decades ago during president bill clinton s impeachment to brief republican lawmakers on the process ahead rep adam schiff d calif the chairman of the house intelligence committee overseeing the probe has praised the state department officials for stepping forward under subpoena to shed light on the matter we have learned much of this thanks to the courageous testimony of the state department
