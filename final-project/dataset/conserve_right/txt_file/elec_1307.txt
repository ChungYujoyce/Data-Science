the candidates former vice president joe biden observed he was absolutely correct the event was a cnn town hall in los angeles thursday night where nine democratic candidates were interviewed about their stances on lgbt issues those who tuned in for the four and a half hour show were treated with few exceptions to each candidate answering variations of the same questions in the same ways what will they do about any continued discrimination against lgbt they ll fight against it and support the equality act what will they do about improving access to hiv drugs and preventative medication they ll go after those greedy pharmaceutical companies and all the drugs will be covered under their health care plans what will they do about hate crimes they ll unleash the department of justice against them and hate crimes will definitely be exempted from any push to make federal sentencing less punitive what will they do about other countries who treat arrest or execute lgbt people they ll withhold aid and possibly even trade what will they do about people who invoke their religious beliefs to justify discriminating against lgbt people they won t let them and they ll strip churches and nonprofits of their tax exempt status if they try what will they do about conversion therapy ban it what will they do about bullying in schools and teen suicide get rid of education secretary betsy devos seriously her name was invoked more frequently than donald trump s the too long didn t watch version of last night s summit tell us who did you wrong and we ll go punish them the moment that s produced the biggest waves in the media is when candidate beto o rourke promised to strip tax exempt status from churches and religious schools not just for actually discriminating against lgbt people but for simply speaking in opposition to same sex marriage the audience applauded and he added there can be no reward no benefit no tax break for anyone any institution or any organization that denies the full human rights and full civil rights of every single one of us here s the clip beto o rourke on religious institutions losing tax exempt status for opposing same sex marriage there can be no reward no benefit no tax break for anyone that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us equalitytownhall pic twitter com tjwvgqv5h0 cnn cnn october 11 2019 needless to say punishing churches for their positions not just their actions is thoroughly unquestionably unconstitutional it should be absolutely abhorrent to anyone concerned with freedom of speech or freedom of religion it shouldn t come as much of a surprise that the candidate who thinks he s somehow going to force americans to turn in their guns also has little grasp that his tax exemption plan will get him laughed out of court if you care about lgbt rights you should be glad o rourke doesn t have a shot the backlash against him as a nominee would be massive his response didn t go viral because it s worth praising it went viral because it s a horrifyingly bad idea that will lead to terrible government abuses but this is what you get when the country is locked in a culture war driven by a desire to punish people you disagree with and when millions of people believe that the president s role is to lead this war donald trump is a symptom not the cause of the problem almost every answer to every questioner featured a call for more federal involvement in people s lives thursday morning before the town hall three candidates sen elizabeth warren d mass sen kamala harris d calif and south bend mayor pete buttigieg all released lengthy plans offering not a chicken in every pot for lgbt americans but an entire chorus of federal bureaucrats lawyers and regulations overseeing every problem no candidate even gently suggested that any lgbt issue would best be handled locally and not by the inhabitant of the white house indeed when cnn s chris cuomo noted that the states not the federal government controlled many of these laws and regulations harris condescendingly explained that federal laws take precedence over state and local laws of course for harris or any of these candidates to fulfill promises like passing the equality act which every candidate onstage supported they ll have to sway congress biden and sen amy klobuchar d minn both called for voters to flip control of the senate to the democrats in order to make sure they can get these laws passed several candidates talked up the importance of controlling the next supreme court nominations all the candidates promised to overturn trump s executive orders pushing transgender troops out of military service and permitting some government contractors to discriminate against lgbt people but nobody wanted to consider the possibility that trump s ability to make such sweeping changes without oversight is an indication that the office of the president is itself too powerful members of the lgbt community should know better than this after decades of fighting to be treated as equal members of society we shouldn t be trying to put the boot of the federal government on the neck of anybody who is not violating our individual liberty not getting a wedding cake or not getting to teach at a catholic school is not enough to justify the boot ultimately the democratic candidates offered lgbt voters whatever they wanted so long as what they wanted was more meddling in people s lives this is not a path to peace or an end to this bipartisan culture wars it s an escalation those of us in the lgbt community who want less government involvement in our lives and want to be left alone to deal with cultural conflicts through voluntary engagement with our opponents we re all out of luck there was nobody at this town hall either among the candidates or the carefully vetted questioners to represent us advertisement next everything old is new again targeting pro revolutionary advocacy in 1952

that federal laws take precedence over state and local laws even immigration i don t think she thought this out too well that s different openborders immigrationaboveall vox has an article up attacking technological progress too lazy to link to it but it s on the front page yep a progressive is attacking the very idea of progress and i just knew right away that no matter what point this fucking idiot is trying to make his whole point will be to call for the government to come in and regulate what tech companies can and cannot do why is that people like the writers at vox always default to the same thing never mind i know why it is their god and they are worshipping ok rant over why is that people like the writers at vox always default to the same thing these are the people who doubled down on daenerys targaryen representing good government after she destroyed king s landing and announced her intent to consume the world in fire and blood the hilarious part is that vox s attempt to take down conservatives on youtube has led youtube to demonetizing or banning more lbgt channels than conservative ones this says it well the meaning of conservatism is not that it impedes movement forward and upward but that it impedes movement backwards and downwards to chaotic darkness and the return to a primitive state nikolai berdyaev too lazy to link to it but it s on the front page man you re lazy and not net neutrality but fed law should win in everything else also gas mileage standards but everything else and the roads go without saying so they ll punish any church that so much as criticizes gay marriage will they do the same to any mosque no why do religious organizations enjoy tax exempt status in the first place they are some of the biggest money raising operations in our country i think and their exemption from taxes is in this agnostic s opinion basically a scam not that i am a fan of taxation but fair is fair let s go after big pharma so they don t profit from illness and can t afford the unimaginable time and effort to work through fda regs to bring better hiv drugs to market always working at cross purposes why not drop taxes on everyone to make it fair why always punish through taxation and watch government leverage more revenue into more debt i earned 5000 last month by working online just for 5 to 8 hours on my laptop and this was so easy that i myself could not believe before working on this site if you too want to earn such a big money tehn come and join us click here googlejobscompany com democratic candidates promise lgbt voters they ll punish all the right people the clingers bigots in plain language have been punished gays for decades and longer lately they have taken to cloaking their intolerance in claims of superstition apparently thinking this improves their bigoted ways decent americans should be proud of enabling gays to leave the closet and inclining the bigots to figure they should find closets and build more snowflake coddling special havens hi gecko arty you k ow nothing of decent americans you are a traitor the clingers bigots in plain language have been punished gays for decades and longer oh as a gay man who has experienced plenty of discrimination i agree deplorable bigots like you kirkland should crawl back into your basements and not show their faces among decent americans again hey rev asshole when they ramp up the hate crime laws you ll probably get the electric chair you guys seem cranky finally figure which way the culture war has gone and which way it is headed you guys seem cranky oh believe me as a gay man who s experienced plenty of discrimination i get cranky when i encounter a bigot like you it s cute the rev hasn t figured out yet how hard the pendulum is swinging back in his face youth counterculture is mostly about making fun of woke cultists youth acceptance of the alphabet people has declined substantially in the last few years because of shit like this don t let the rev fool ya he s another parody account just a more hostile obl dude would have to be a joke to come to a libertarian site and speak in terms of permitting clingers to carry on and hold their own opinions for now as the rev reminds us he and the other betters will rescind this courtesy just as soon as they finish winning this culture war and replace those who disagree with them the rev is either a half decent attempt at comedy or sad bitter and delusional not to be taken seriously either way you sound like a genuine libertarian eistau a member of libertarians for tariffs and protectionism and libertarians for statist womb management and libertarians for government gay bashing and libertarians for special privileges for superstitious snowflakes and libertarians for torture and endless detention without trial and libertarians for bigoted authoritarian immigration policies and libertarians for big government micromanagement of ladyparts clinics and libertarians for trump and ted cruz and the republican party and libertarians for race targeting voter suppression carry on clinger haha that s the best ya got rev a bunch of silly assumptions about things i don t even care about haha yup comedy for sure but scratch the part about half decent don t change a thing old man carry on gays are a threat to our freedom i never thought this even last decade but we know that the same political party that supports the gays also opposes the second amendment the first amendment and possibly the fourth amendment either we punish the gays or they and their anti american allies punish us sadly tolerance is no longer possible libertarianism in one lesson i like how you stroll right past everyone here and declare this guy the spokesman for libertarians speaking of which last time i saw you around here you were expressing your eagerness to share reason s extensive history of holocaust denial but claimed you had to run off before you had time do you have time for today or do we need to wait longer given how often i read from other folks here that non discrimination laws is why they didn t support marriage equality or how being anti gay is good because libruls michael isn t exactly far out here he s just more blunt michael isn t exactly far out here he s just more blunt what makes you think he speaks as a libertarian most of the anti gay guys around here don t even claim to be libertarians and are here criticizing reason and libertarians for being too gay friendly most of those that dont support gay marriage here want government out of the marriage contract completely and want marriage upheld under contract laws only there are almost zero anti gay folks here again when asked if churches should lose their tax exempt status if they oppose same sex marriage beto o rourke said yes gays are not compatible with the united states of america they have become enemies of freedom i can pretty much guarantee you that your political position is a losing one because when it comes down to it americans actually like their gay relatives neighbors and friends and won t go back to criminalizing homosexuality republicans and libertarians should make it clear to all minorities that they are better off with liberty than with progressivism and socialism that s the only way forward more likely we will have to dispose of our socialists if we want to survive as a republic many ways to do that both violent and non violent but we know that the same political party that supports the gays also opposes the second amendment the first amendment and possibly the fourth amendment it s not the fault of the gays that democrats are trying to misuse their cause for political gain democrats have done sh t for gay rights in the past either we punish the gays or they and their anti american allies punish us honey dearest punishing the gays is only going to give democrats more power and by that logic shouldn t you also punish the blacks because the blacks are in the same boat vis a vis the democrats as the gays the right answer is to show the gays and the blacks that they are better off on the republican side because the democrats are a bunch of authoritarian pricks who want to make minorities into their dependent slaves and throw them under the bus when convenient silliness is not a virtue next post the wrong reverend will bring forth the holy fire for cleansing the offenders i can see the spittle spewing from your lips perhaps if you were to take a deep breath gather your thoughts and then post what you think using standard english instead of a barrage of insults you might be taken more seriously put em up against the wall the moment that s produced the biggest waves in the media is when candidate beto o rourke promised to strip tax exempt status from churches and religious schools not just for actually discriminating against lgbt people but for simply speaking in opposition to same sex marriage didn t i tell everyone what a rockstar this guy was in 2018 i suspect he really won his race against cruz and republican cheating made the difference libertariansforbeto also apparently elizabeth warren now supports taxpayer funded gender confirmation surgery for transgender prison inmates with this bold stance she may have broken her tie with kamala harris and emerged as my undisputed top choice for 2020 libertariansforwarren i think i preferred it when progressives like warren didn t use weasel words like taxpayer funded gender confirmation surgery and simply said what they meant government funded sterilization of the undesirable shes showing her bigotry she still refuses to fund amputations for those suffering from ableism you re quite the comedian no true libertarian would ever support this petulant child after decades of fighting to be treated as equal members of society we shouldn t be trying to put the boot of the federal government on the neck of anybody who is not violating our individual liberty nonsense making the other guys play by the rules they created is how it s done now stances on lgbt issues are there lgbt issues the t s have lots of issues tissues sometimes excess tissues everyone has issues weed likely easier stopgap than dressing like other gender just wake up it s now 2slgbtqqia and growing were gonna need a bigger alphabet the funny thing is that half the time extra letters are added out of sarcasm and half the time the extra letters are added by people who are completely serious it sounds to me like they spent a good amount of time shooting parts of donald trump s re election commercial bobby o rourke said he would remove tax exempt status from any religious institution that did not embrace lgbt so they re all really doubling down on this all faggots all the time and someone makes a post for the democrats commercials given how much pseudo anonymous posting is trolls from large organizations or even nations astroturfing beclowned posts opposed could be a secret strategy to discredit the other side by making them look idiotically mean that s a huge task to winnow out last of the shitlords isn t running for president one of these clowns is it would be funny to see a screenshot of shitlord writing faggot in a dnc add i actually don t give a shit one way or the other about homos i m just sick of the democrats trying to jam shit down our throats and up our assholes i m also being extremely sarcastic with you phrasing i m paraphrasing something an old guy i know once said about the democrats goddammit what is it with these idiots it s all faggots all the time with them anymore next thing they re gonna expect us to all start suckin cock haha yeah that describes the rev to a t committed to making progs look repugnant while pretending to be one good catch gay bashing right wingers are among my favorite culture war stompees open wider clingers more progress on the way your obsequious compliance is appreciated and has been for 70 some years you are the queer here the only church you are a reverend of is the church of buggerology for all this accusation of right wingers as gay bashers there s a funny little thing to keep in mind libertarian and conservative gays have a pretty much universal agreement that it s far easier for them to come out as gay to conservatives the response is usually that s icky but meh whatever floats your boat than it is to come out as conservative or libertarian to liberals what how can you do that you are dead to me just who are the bigots here gay bashing right wingers are among my favorite culture war stompees i see little difference between you and them you re both equally bigoted and ignorant from the federalist a transgender woman who was being introduced to ask a question of castro criticized cnn anchor nia mikayla henderson for mispronouncing her name i want to bring in shay diamond a singer songwriter from los angeles she currently supports mayor pete buttigieg shay what s your question henderson asked uhm it s shia diamond an irritated diamond clapped back put that on the record it s violence to misgender or to alter a name of a trans person so let s always get that right first lighten up shay only if they provide phonetic spellings of their name as someone with an eastern european surname somewhat heavy on consonants that shia needs to get over themself and have a bit of charity in spirit i d have a hard time not pronouncing the t in response to that do they think they are special my family both the german side and the norwegian side changed the spelling of their names because no one except other germans and scandinavians could pronounce them correctly yes they think they are extra special all that pandering will do that to an identity group mispronunciation is violence haha wow i would bet a lot of trans people cringed when they heard this especially the ones that have actually experienced violence because of who they are what a self obsessed twat that s what i worry about people see only people who appear to be bad parodies of the lbgt community and they think everyone is like that i ll be frank if that woman was a paid plant from an opposing political group she could not have done more harm to her cause than in her actions twat ummmm ok you do know that s violence right haha would you prefer cunt or bitch ms diamond how about dick or jerk i was leaning towards mr potatohead it s violence to misgender or to alter a name of a trans person and i d like to put it on the record that no it fucking isn t i saw some cringeworthy clips such as that one above so hard to watch i have to say every time they have one of these debates especially with moments like this i go trump isnt so bad they are going to bury themselves in this election with this nonsense and they will deserve it they will be standing there confused as they lose the rust belt yet again as those voters look at this kind of stuff and just shake their heads i truly could not have imagined that i would someday even consider casting a vote for trump and i still wouldn t if a decent candidate were a factor in the potus race e g john delaney but i am seriously thinking about casting a paper bag over my head trump vote rather than jumping into bed with any of the lunatic left goofballs it s bizarre but it is what we seem to have become a pox on both of the major political parties one can easily observe that trump has an excuse he s not a politician so he s not refined in the politician s ways i can t help but wonder what are the excuses for all these democratic candidates it s violence to misgender dear lord wtf it s pronounced throatwobbler mangrove monty python was so fucking far ahead of its time thou shalt not blaspheme against the great and powerful cher what will they do about hate crimes they ll unleash the department of justice against them and hate crimes will definitely be exempted from any push to make federal sentencing less punitive so reduce the sentences for crimes like murder and theft then increase the punishments for thought crimes seems legit what will they do about other countries who treat arrest or execute lgbt people they ll withhold aid and possibly even trade so we won t be trading with china or any muslim majority nations which by their own measure is a muslim ban also i ve been told for a few weeks now that withholding aid from foreign nations to influence domestic politics is impeachable also i ve been told for a few weeks now that withholding aid from foreign nations to influence domestic politics is impeachable my thoughts exactly also i ve been told for a few weeks now that withholding aid from foreign nations to influence domestic politics is impeachable for personal political gain that s a very important distinction instead using your power to punish people for thought crimes for personal gains seems totally legit that s the joke escher anything can be viewed as influencing domestic american politics or personal political gain even if you squint hard enough also i ve been told for a few weeks now that withholding aid from foreign nations to influence domestic politics is impeachable i was on board until this you know the two are not comparable what trump did is illegal and an obvious breach of public trust say it with me now the president cannot use government funds for his own reelection campaign he cannot use foreign policy for his own reelection campaign he cannot solicit campaign contributions of any kind from a foreign government the government works for the american people not trump 2020 llc and did he do any of that not according to the transcripts the president cannot use government funds for his own reelection campaign he hasn t he cannot use foreign policy for his own reelection campaign foreign policy is a cornerstone of any presidential campaign since the founding he cannot solicit campaign contributions of any kind from a foreign government again he hasn t thanks for making me defend the idiot trump with your even more idiotic post amen d pizzle when a badly flawed stage play is subsequently rewritten for casting of clowns in a circus i m out impeachment itself is being done for political gain you raging dumbfuck liberals arent even hiding it but saying it publicly this sounds like an update of the arguments against the civil rights acts racism will end by itself no need to protect civil rights free individuals don t get the choice to freely associate or disassociate with one another if that s the argument you want to make then gay rights are the least of your concern you need to go after the cra first that argument was correct then and it s correct now the racism that still exists today in america is in spite of the cra and the diminished racism drastically diminished i may add since the cra was due to cultural change not law besides wanting to end racism is racist i think a lot of whats perceived as racism today is really culturism if that s a thing and i think it s more suburban vs urban than white vs black the gap in culture arts language beliefs between the majority of people raised in urban environments and the majority of those raised in suburban or rural areas is widening for a multitude of reasons and this in my mind is illustrated in the images of my grandfathers youth he grew up italian american in the hill district of pittsburgh the hill was a heavily italian and african american community known as little harlem in its heyday because of its great jazz clubs and when i look back through his photos of these places what you notice is that whether black or white everyone is dresses the same at the clubs and restaurants black and white men have on suits and ties black and white women have on nice dresses and they all are at the same clubs listening to the same music it was a common culture but for numerous reasons that common ground has deteriorated it s an interesting study that ive looked into in pittsburgh a pretty good deal dizzle excellent there s a pittsburgh raised chef in savannah ga who is tresured for who he is and is a joy to be with no matter who you are or where you re from racial divides and differences just evaporate when you walk through his door for great food and fellowship he like i is a devotee of nancy wilson s music which plays often in the background now that i think of it she s african american but that has nothing at all to do with our mutual admiration of her http africanamericanchefshalloffame org 2017 01 07 chef joe randall announces work on the african american chefs hall of fame if you can find it to order online our local public tv network wqed also the home network of mr rogers neighborhood did a fantastic documentary on the hill district entitled wiley avenue days itd be a treat for you i bet i actually lived in the area for a few years after college and its pretty rough now like many urban neighborhoods but in its heyday it was glorious some quick hits gus greenlee became one of the richest black men in the country bootlegging and number running and eventually owned the pittsburgh crawfords negro league team and financed construction of his own ballpark also owned the crawford grill 1 and 2 the hill was called little harlem because it was considered the best jazz scene between nyc and chicago all the big players performed here and people like billy eckstine stanley turrentine and george benson are from there sports teams there specifically negro league ones dominated their competition winning numerous baseball and basketball championships on teams that now feature multiple hall of famers in their respective sports the crawfords at one point had satchel paige josh gibson judy johnson cool papa bell and oscar charleston all on the team all 5 are mlb hall of famers correct pandering and appealing to guilt grievance and victim hood is the biggest obstacle to better relations between races genders etc all brought to us by angry woke progs divide and conquer beto is expressing in clear terms what the progressive agenda has wanted for a long time the government punishing religious beliefs they do not approve of he is the only one desperate enough to stop softening the rhetoric o rourke s rhetoric is a true threat to principles of separation of of church and state communists like him should be in prison he is a poster man child for criminalizing the practice of marxism imprisoning political candidates for crimethink what could possibly go wrong the practice of marxism words have meanings no need for prison he s the guy we can keep pointing to every time the left spouts nonsense like no we don t intend to take your guns or no we don t intend to sic the irs on our political opponents or no we aren t a bunch of spoiled assholes beto is really confused why no one gives a shit about him anymore he thought he was like born for this man what will they do about people who invoke their religious beliefs to justify discriminating against lgbt people they won t let them and they ll strip churches and nonprofits of their tax exempt status if they try the idea that you can tax people based on their religious beliefs isn t just unconstitutional it s chock full of evil the idea that you can tax people based on their religious beliefs is already occurring the state decides if your religion is legitimate via tax policy right now today this the idea that you can tax people based on their religious beliefs is already occurring the state decides if your religion is legitimate via tax policy right now today are you agreeing with him or saying our current tax system isn t evil and chock full of irrational holes i said exactly what i meant what you read into such a simple statement is a product of your own imagination if i were in a debate on the subject i d say the following it s already happened which sort of disproves that it s considered unconstitutional by anyone who is empowered to judge constitutionality i d also point out evil is relative and subjective even while i happen to agree with him certainly i disagree with the state deciding the validity of religious beliefs but the fact remains they already are and have been for quite some time i also agree that s a problem but it s also nothing new or different this the problem is the way taxation happens in the first place that some businesses are exempt because the product they sell is religion is just part of the general clusterfuck what you read into such a simple statement is a product of your own imagination i didn t read anything in or imagine anything i asked a question you re talking past each other is it in opposition or do you have orthogonal messages the idea that you can tax people based on their religious beliefs is already occurring the state decides if your religion is legitimate via tax policy right now today even if the state deciding that not taxing churches were not necessary in order to protect the sanctity of freedom of establishment and freedom of religion injustices don t become any better for being perpetrated openly and often if anything that makes the injustices even worse i m not even sure that he believes any of it either i had assumed that all his extreme rhetoric was just a ploy to try to get back in the race can we finally label environmentalism and the entire tranny movement as the religion that they clearly are i mean they sure as hell aren t science there are other categories available besides religion and science magic i m not sure how else to describe a non falsifiable theory based on something besides science i can happily label christianity as a religion it has as much scientific rigor behind it as environmentalism and trannyism superstition poorly thought out beliefs ignorance unfounded assumptions politically corrupted science those are all good ones seems to me religions have something to do with the supernatural by definition your definition seems unworkably broad i don t think it s useful or in line with how words understood to include all non evidence based belief systems as religious some environmentalists certainly take a religious stance on things elevating nature to the status of a deity but not all voodoo i m sure there are plenty of d voters right now who honestly believe that being a catholic should disqualify anyone from serving on the supreme court huh i thought it was a requirement that you be catholic or jewish to be on the supreme court it is important to note that not all catholics are stale thinking broadly intolerant people who believe schools should teach nonsense somebody thought your school should teach nonsense actually in my experience dealing with and knowing many catholics practicing and non practicing and having married two of them stale thinking broadly intolerant people who believe schools should teach nonsense is actually the antithesis the absolute opposite of nearly every catholic i have known most people i have known no matter what their faith like myself have no problem separating religion from science nor dogma from law most people i have known no matter what their faith like myself have no problem separating religion from science nor dogma from law yeah that was actually tested from the nineties into the early 2010s religious folk regularly failed to separate dogma from law when it came to government recognition of same sex marriage that most religious folk today make that distinction is because they lost their fights and had to learn to reconcile not because they made that distinction initially false premise they didn t need to seperate dogma from law since the law was similar to their dogma you are correct in that there has been a shift in public opinion but i think there is more to it than resignation to reality but then again what do i know lol i can tell you one thing excepting to protect the individuals getting married i don t think the government should have any role in defining marriage at all as the well known catholic peter griffin once said hey if gays wanna get married and be miserable like the rest of us i say let em proof that catholics really don t care about gay marriage haha they ll strip churches and nonprofits of their tax exempt status if they try i was told i was a crazy conspiracist when i said this was a goal of progressives 30 years ago now it is a platform talking point i take no comfort in being right i remember that within days of the ussc decision that lawsuits were already being lodged against a kansas church for not allowing gay marriage on it s premises a bigger question is why churches get tax exempt status in the first place most are nonprofits which broadly speaking are also not taxed do you believe all nonprofits should be taxed actually if that were why churches lost tax exempt status i d be all for it the government should not be using tax policy to attempt to shape social values or behaviors do you believe all nonprofits should be taxed income should not be taxed if anything should be taxed it should be spending agreed no tax deductions for donating to a charity or to churches most tax exempt non profits are scams i think that tax exempt status should be based on a measurable value to society so if you operate a soup kitchen or other type charity you can be tax exempt if you are just saving souls i am a little less likely to think you get a tax deduction i would apply this across the board so if your organization physically works to clean the environment you get tax exemption if you work to change or enact environmental laws you don t get an exemption so in other words you fully embrace the notion that tax exemption should be a tool to force people to behave in ways that you personally approve of and that work towards your personal agenda and you would like the power to arbitrarily tax and suppress activities that you don t approve of even if they don t harm anyone gotcha close the italics after agenda it works either way what i said is i want quantifiable benefits such as we feed 100 people 3 times a weeks not we saved 500 souls from eternal damnation if you can measurable show me you saved 500 souls from damnation maybe a letter from st peter stating such i will change my mind what i said is i want quantifiable benefits would would of course be subjective you can quantify just about anything and in just about any way you want how is 300 meals per week for people subjective seem pretty clear to me you don t understand the function of church in the christian religion do you the saving of souls is the individuals choice not the churches actions the church is for education and fellowship i doubt you will find many christian churches very few in fact that don t do far more than religious services they do a ton of charity work while also assisting in mental health addiction trauma grief etc counseling many also work with suicide prevention programs run raise moneys for homeless shelters food banks etc even our small rural church has addiction counseling grief counseling etc and makes blankets for lutheran charities and raises money for lutheran social services many of their functions are much more difficult to quantify church members cook dinners for funerals so the family doesn t have to they give money and rides for people in need assist other members in need charity isn t always quantifiable i don t care about feeding 100 people any more than you care about saving 500 souls benefit to society is subjective bullshit of course he does progtards use government to control how people live their lives and the more the better they also believe their feelings should determine said policies who gets to decide what is good for the public some of the biggest charities in the world are churches retard who decides what is of value to society beto so politicians can hold it over their head to make them do what they want churches are not tax exempt because of their religious beliefs they are tax exempt because of their non profit status and not all churches are classified as 501 c 3 s and some churches have more than one non profit status for example 501 c 4 and not all parts of all churches which receive monies or donations are tax exempt a bigger question is why churches get tax exempt status in the first place in principle it goes all the way back to why puritans didn t want to be taxed to support the anglican church or the state it served people being taxed to pay for other people s religious beliefs violated their right to choose their own religion and their right to freely exercise the religion of their choice individuals and churches shouldn t be taxed to pay for things that violate their religious beliefs for the same reason that atheists shouldn t be taxed to pay for things that violate their beliefs i have a problem with the last part of this comment people are taxed for many things that may violate their beliefs all the time quakers are taxed and support the military even though they are pacifist moslems and jews are taxed for agricultural supports that may include pork subsidies or assistance to pork farmers mormons taxes may go for agricultural support for tobacco or alcohol jehovah s witnesses tax might support a hospital that performs blood transfusions the fact is that some groups want special privileges and feel that they get a say in being taxed while other groups don t get that privilege also remember that when same sex marriages were not legal churches that did perform same sex marriages and individual that supported same sex marriage did not get to say they were taxed and their believes were not recognized because tax policy is regulation and you know 1st amendment so democratic candidates are an expressed threat to multiple civil liberties openly stating their intention to unleash the coercive powers of the state upon anyone who disagrees wow i never saw that coming i m as shocked as the reason editorial board members of the lgbt community should know better than this after decades of fighting to be treated as equal members of society we shouldn t be trying to put the boot of the federal government on the neck of anybody who is not violating our individual liberty not getting a wedding cake or not getting to teach at a catholic school is not enough to justify the boot yeah they should know better but they don t and frankly that is what is even more frightening it is not enough to adopt a live and let live outlook on lgbt which is toleration now you must openly celebrate and revel in it it smacks of an animal farm orientation some animals have more rights than others that never works sorry but the law says one must tolerate not celebrate who is forcing you to celebrate well arguably compelling a baker to cater your celebration is an example of forcing people to celebrate it yeah i am not a fan of that there are quite a number of gay pride parades that eat up a good number of tax dollars whether i celebrate or not i get billed it s a pity that you re not in the same league as you lord and savior trump then you can get away with not paying your bills non sequitor much that was about the worst case of whataboutism i ve ever read since he didn t mention trump at all how was that even relevant tony go drink to your a drano adults are talking here you probably need to get to your second job manning a glory hole at the local bath house and cleaning up the loads haha rainbow crosswalks are awesome only 12k each a bargain in taxpayer funded pandering threatening punishment for not holding the correct views seems only a small step from forcing you to celebrate it us an all too often occurence in history that formerly marginalized groups do not take the alleviation of their circumstances as a chance to live and let live but a chance for revenge how the sub 1 will get revenge on the more than 99 will be amusing tolerance isn t infinite this is a key point that lgbt groups are missing in their efforts to rub evangelical noses in their santorum see urban dictionary if you re wondering any group that represents at best 3 of the population is completely dependent on the acceptance or acquiescence or apathy of the majority to maintain their status push hard enough and the majority might push back and it might not be pretty when they do exhibit a president donald trump evangelicals put aside their distaste for his personal life and crude rhetoric and voted en masse for him in order to prevent president lannister from pushing the gay agenda even further o rourke with his over the top pandering has now put two albatrosses around the neck of the eventual democrat nominee if she probably warren doesn t walk them back in her acceptance speech at the convention then she will guarantee another trump term this has nothing to do with formerly marginalized groups the people who claim to stand for lgbt rights today didn t do shit for lgbt rights neither did the democratic party these are progressive political hacks and self serving non profits who are viewing homosexuals as another victim group they can use for gaining power and making money there isn t even much of a gay community or bar scene anymore because it s not needed almost nobody in the us gives a f ck anymore whether you are straight or gay you re more likely to be discriminated against for being a redhead than a homosexual at least homosexuals have souls except for ginger homosexuals of course wait so gay gingers can t burn in hell soulless things go to purgatory when they are slain indeed that s why gay gingers are so much fun no guilt and no fear there isn t even much of a gay community or bar scene anymore because it s not needed almost nobody in the us gives a f ck anymore whether you are straight or gay noyb2 yes exactly nobody gives a shit in my own personal experience years ago in my youth i was uneasy with lgbt back in the 70 s and 80 s society was very different but then i entered the workforce and in the 90 s and early 00 s societal mores changed lgbt went from taboo to tolerated but just barely as i interacted with more lgbt people over time my unease sort of just went away it is probably like that for many who have a similar background to mine just observing people around me in public i feel we have moved past barely tolerated to irrelevant meaning i think most people just don t care and don t see it as relevant anymore in my line of business it is completely irrelevant when i attend services it is completely irrelevant when i go out to eat it is completely irrelevant when i am sick and need to see a doctor it is completely irrelevant when i hire people i could care less whether your are gay straight black brown whatever the criteria is can you do the job the point i am trying to make there just isn t a part of my life where lgbt is even relevant it just doesn t matter so it doesn t even occur to me to think about it to me that is full toleration i thought this was the goal that s what the left wanted in the 90s california i grew up in now if you don t see color you re literally hitler to me that is full toleration i thought this was the goal it is and your own experiences to the contrary majorities of lgbt folk still report being discriminated against in the workplace particularly in the more socially conservative parts of the country or to put it another way you don t hear about any anti irish discrimination cases why because no one cares but you do hear about anti gay discrimination cases and violence because people do care your experiences are not universal but they should be but we aren t there yet i live in an extremely conservative area and most folks don t give a fuck either yes i m sure all those claims of discrimination from people who just won t stand for their diminishing victim status are valid nobody asking for rights you don t already enjoy and nobody s really asking for your opinion to be honest if you re as tolerant of and indifferent to lgbt people as you say you are nothing they spend their free time doing should really affect you n est ce pas whether that s being politically active or having buttsex orgies it is not enough to adopt a live and let live outlook on lgbt when precisely have conservatives been on board with live and let live at the state level conservatives republicans are still fighting same sex marriage in weird and myriad ways making it hard for trans folk to transition both legally and medically blocking such simple things as a gsa at a public high school and so on federal level is only marginally better with trump s weird attacks on trans troops and the kids of gay couples and other stuff so c mon when have conservatives republicans actually been on board with live and let live they objected to lawrence v texas they objected to dadt repeal they objected to windsor v united states they objected to obergefel v hodges so your answer is to use the federal government to force people to like gays to force churches to go against their dogma how is that any more tolerant military service is about losing i individualism to support tour fellow troops it is why they shave heads go through boot etc transgenderism is focused on the self and the expression of the self it is counter to what boot camp attempts to teach likewise it is still a mental illness you will also be sent home from combat of anorexic or attempting to cut off body parts because you are an ableist this is backed by the largest study ever done on transgenderism by jhu that puts it down as a body dysmorphic issue just like ableism and anorexia what other mental diseases do you want to force people to celebrate we dont olay pretend with schitzos we dont tell anorexics to eat less we dont amputate legs from ableists what s the definition of an ableist are they a victim group now escher you ask a fair question i shall answer you asked when precisely have conservatives been on board with live and let live conservatives are no more a monolith than libertarians meaning there is a continuum of attitude belief with conservatives just as with libertarians some hate lgbt condemn them to hell for their lifestyle others truly do not care but escher if you are talking about team r in washington dc for the last 30 years i d have to answer you this way honestly my perception is very few team r politicians in the last three decades publicly professed a live and let live attitude let alone acted in a way politically that reflected a live and let live orientation when i say very few i mean less than 20 those who tuned in for the four and a half hour show were treated lol whose idea was it to devote four and a half hours to this that s 50 longer than the main debate that was supposed to cover all issues did any candidate dare decline to appear for that long it s so they don t have to talk too much about gay issues at the real debates which is fine with me the real debates is where they should be spending 90 of their time on gay issues nobody s really asking for your opinion to be honest haha yeah might as well get it out of the way so much pandering to do so little time the ss minnow was lost in considerably less time i don t care about other people s sex lives what will they do about improving access to hiv drugs and preventative medication so hiv is a gay thing now given the incidence of it in the gay community versus the number of reported gay people in the population yes in fairness lots of people don t know this or can t accept it as the truth my wife argued with me about gay people being allowed to donate blood without question and she honestly did not believe me about the incidence until i showed her studies on the subject notably she works for red cross which is an organization that has an entire wing for blood donation you d think that would be knowledge one would gain in that profession but then again she isn t involved with the blood wing not that she didn t have good points as well they do test blood donations for various infectious diseases so really there isn t as much point to restrict people based on lifestyle hiv isn t the only blood borne pathogen it s just one the really scary ones it s questionable how much utility we really get out of those restrictions especially given that those exclusions are easily lied about some of those restrictions have been pretty stupid like lifetime bar for donation if you have had a cancer that would have killed you inside of a year if it hadn t been completely cured they finally let me donate a month ago after having been treated for lymphoma nearly 10 years back but only red blood cells not whole blood according to my oncologist not only was i as unlikely to have lymphoma as any random person within a couple years the chemo actually knocked back my chances of leukemia compared to the general population but for life changing illnesses where the test isn t guaranteed to be 100 i can t fault caution cancer in particular might be a good reason to bar someone from donation since cancer is generally considered cured when the probability of it coming back exceeds the patients natural lifespan estimates when putting that blood into another person what is their natural lifespan estimate not that you re necessarily wrong about the statistics of your own situation on a long enough timeline everyone will probably get cancer so it s perhaps worth considering the specific probabilities either way congrats on beating it that s a rough thing oh and i should point out that a red blood cells lifespan is probably short enough not to cause significant long term risks for cancer in someone that receives that blood but i m not a doctor so i can t say for sure i want to say they live for around 100 days or so which wouldn t seem like a massive risk to me red blood cells have no nuclei they do not reproduce themselves in the bloodstream they are made in the bone marrow other types of blood cells may have cancer implications but i am not aware of of any ha a way better point thanks p and i ve been in a monogamous relationship with one guy for thirteen years and we re both negative the odds of us contracting hiv are less then the odds of a random guy who picks up chicks in a bar which is to say there s caution and then there s we don t actually care about the odds it would be trivially easy for the blood donation quiz to have a few follow up questions to the gay question regarding recent sexual encounters that would separate folks who participate in actual risky behavior from those who are boring the red cross is willing to do that it s the fda that says no anecdote is not data also there are plenty of relationships in which one partner is unaware of the other s infidelity isn t the issue that they test blood in batches to save money so if one is tainted they have to throw the whole batch out or is that not correct i couldn t say but it seems improbable that would be the case since i don t know how you could test individual donations as a batch i would guess by mixing samples from each together and then testing that maybe i m not sure what all the relevant factors are so i won t theorize i don t have a problem with them asking risk assessment questions personally since it will likely weed out some potentially infected supply it definitely won t weed out all infected supply though i think we agree there i d suspect that certain blood types say universal donors are probably looser guidelines that get tested on a per unit basis but who knows not all blood types are equally valuable i d suspect that certain blood types say universal donors are probably looser guidelines that get tested on a per unit basis but who knows not all blood types are equally valuable they aren t all equally valuable but you generally can t freeze whole blood and after about 42 days it s all equally valueless the time delay between typing and subsequently infectious disease testing is more costly than testing everything at once serum products can be frozen and tested later but typing isn t as broadly critical for them the time delay between typing and subsequently infectious disease testing is more costly than testing everything at once i m not sure i follow what you re saying here i m not sure i follow what you re saying here taking a day to type decide if it s worth pooling or not and then taking the next day to test pooled individual samples is more costly less efficient less effective than just blindly testing everything for type and disease content all at once decide if it s worth pooling or not literally pooling serum or figuratively pooling all the blood of a type not worthy of testing i can t believe they re batch testing blood blood donations aren t widgets produced on an assembly line whole blood they generally don t plasma and other blood products it depends nope they don t accept openly gay donors because the fda bans it cost isn t a consideration last i checked this isn t actually true gay men can donate blood with certain stipulations not that she didn t have good points as well they do test blood donations for various infectious diseases so really there isn t as much point to restrict people based on lifestyle hiv isn t the only blood borne pathogen it s just one the really scary ones it s questionable how much utility we really get out of those restrictions especially given that those exclusions are easily lied about this is a pretty low brow conclusion ever bought life insurance asking someone not to donate is virtually always cheaper than going through the donation and testing process and discovering they were lying some people apparently like your wife aren t aware of the prevalence of the disease and or it s implications in donation and collection moreover somewhat ancillary to donation if you ask and they lie and donate the responsibility for the current and future infections is theirs not yours asking someone not to donate is virtually always cheaper than going through the donation and testing process and discovering they were lying except notably they re going to do the second step regardless so cost is a moot point you d be a damn fool to rely on honest personal assessments of risk factors by the person donating blood except notably they re going to do the second step regardless so cost is a moot point unless the person opts not to donate then you ve saved on collection storage and testing costs it s only a problem for high risk liars as long as the overwhelming majority isn t both at high risk and ignorant or liars at least asking offers a potential savings of the collection materials storage and testing the only way it wouldn t is if the majority of the population were both high risk and knowingly or not lying unless the person opts not to donate if we re honest it s unclear what the specific savings would be given that some of the people who would be disqualified by the verbal screening won t have any infection at all likely even most of them can we go back to calling it gird a gay thing in that it s an issue the community cares about um always has been a gay thing in that it s something straights shouldn t worry about um never has been none of the above should have been an option and it s the option i choose they ll unleash the department of justice against them and hate crimes will definitely be exempted from any push to make federal sentencing less punitive what will they do about other countries who treat arrest or execute lgbt people they ll withhold aid and possibly even trade what will they do about people who invoke their religious beliefs to justify discriminating against lgbt people they won t let them and they ll strip churches and nonprofits of their tax exempt status if they try what will they do about conversion therapy ban it what will they do about bullying in schools and teen suicide get rid of education secretary betsy devos seriously her name was invoked more frequently than donald trump s criminal justice reform unless we don t like your opinions interfering in a foreign nation s political process totes ok conversion therapy 100 fine as long as we re injecting kids with hormones and performing life altering surgery to make them not gay if gay marriage opponents were smart they d have put people like this all over tv before the obergefell decision nobody can actually like people like this if gay marriage opponents were smart they d have put people like this all over tv before the obergefell decision if gay marriage opponents were smart they would have adopted the libertarian position that marriage is a private and religious issue and that government should keep its grubby corrupt hands off of it furthermore there were no such people before obergefell these kinds of radical idiotic political partisans came into existence after it was safe to speak out in favor of gay marriage heck gays and lesbians never asked to be stuck together with a whole bunch of other letters as a gay man i have no more in common with a man who wants to cut off his wiener than any straight man does lgbtq is itself a bizarre political construct and does not represent a single interest group it s always struck me as odd that transgender people are even in that basket in the first place unlike being gay or lesbian being a transgender person is a demonstrable delusion which is almost certainly a mental health issue by lumping them in with gay and lesbian people it inadvertently says that being gay or lesbian is also a mental health issue which doesn t seem true to me as an example i don t know any gay or lesbian people who have beliefs that are contrary to objective reality unless they also have a mental health disorder entirely separate from their sexual preferences well now they will claim that being trans isn t a mental disorder either which just seems absurd to me if being so unhappy about your body that you are willing to entertain radical physical modifications of your body isn t a problem i don t know what is i have plenty of sympathy for such people and if they really think sex reassignment is the best way to go it s none of my business but i don t think we do them any favors by encouraging them to reject other approaches to dealing with the problem at some point we are going to see a lot of lawsuits about this stuff i know they want to pretend like being trans sexual isn t a mental health issue but again it is demonstrably a real delusion is it possible for a man to know what it feels like to be a woman when they are demonstrably not a woman what does being a woman feel like exactly can it be described can it even be known to someone that isn t the thing itself one might just as well say that someone can not only know exactly what it s like to be a horse but that they can know with such precision to claim to be one it s absurd at face value good point by the same token no man or woman even knows what it feels like for anyone else to be a man or woman it s just politics to increase the numbers just wait til they add n for nambla and you ll be expected to defend shreek i can t in good conscience compare pedophiles to any of the categories that fall under that umbrella given that pedophiles are having sex with people who are considered unable to consent to sex thus there is an actual victim that can t be said of the lgbtqbbq folks unless they change that perception doesn t the whole 4 year old trans thing go a ways into declaring 4 year olds capable of consent those aren t comparable things it s an apples and oranges situation you re talking about the agency of the parents not the child and as far as changing the perception i think you ll find that even convicted murders and rapists look down on pedophiles and tend to stab them in prison that doesn t look much like social acceptance to me there are locales that will take the child from a parent who will not go along with their child s professed desire to change their gender i think neutering a child before they even hit puberty is horrifying but to the left it seems a small price to pay then again the scientist behind the entire tranny movement was a deplorable lump of shit who could not have died painfully enough it s always struck me as odd that transgender people are even in that basket in the first place any more odd than classifying millions of blacks who immigrated long after slavery as victims of slavery any more odd than classifying white americans as being responsible for slavery despite most of their ancestors coming to the us after slavery was ended any more odd than the classification of women as a minority face it intersectionality victim status and progressive classifications of people by race gender ethnicity etc make no sense here s a simple explanatory table of progressive thinking dark skin victim of racism and slavery light skin perpetrator of racism and slavery deviant sexual habits lgbtq victim of social conservatism non christian religious victim of christian discrimination christian perpetrator of discrimination and injustice based on social conservatism and religious discrimination i would indeed say that the transgender inclusion is actually more unusual since it s utterly unlike any of the other things in the basket it s in there are specious arguments one could make for the things you list that are at least grounded in some version of reality however distorted in the case of transgender there is no logical argument to be made other than it is a delusion delusions are typically mental health issues there are non harmful delusions we never landed on the moon green is lucky and then there are harmful delusions i need surgery to look like a sex i am not i need to take drugs unrelated to a specific health issue i should also note i don t believe every case of gender dysphoria is a harmful delusion but i ll also mention i have never met someone with that disorder that wasn t suffering from other mental health issues haha if you can see all this how can you say it makes no sense if it can be exploited it makes sense if it can be exploited it makes sense i suppose conmen fascists socialists and cult leaders just don t exist in your universe not nearly as much as yours for sure everything is so terrible and unfair haha gays and lesbians have never been asked to be stuck together either from what i can gather not a lot of common community there i can see some reason to it when gays were really being seriously discriminated against but there is no reason to lump all the alphabet soup of it together now except annoying activists need something to keep their phony baloney jobs going i find it really annoying how lgbtq has become the goto term i can only imagine that if i were gay it would be even more aggravating sharing a single characteristic does not make a community well being gay and being lesbian are essentially the same thing so it seems they have a hell of a lot more in common with each other than with transgender people or people who just like having sex with anything that breathes i also don t really understand what queer is even supposed to mean i m baffled why more gay activists do not bitch more about the lumping of the t with them a great many trannies by and large would grow up to be gay men women if not pumped full of drugs and the even sadder part is puberty blockers do little more than insure that the surgery would be impossible the doctors need some material to craft fake genitals out of and well no puberty usually equates to having very little material to craft anything out of i m thinking more of actual community gay men and lesbians don t hang out a lot from what i hear pretty different subcultures ah that makes a lot more sense i didn t realize what you meant gays and lesbians have never been asked to be stuck together either from what i can gather not a lot of common community there homosexuality in men and women is actually conceptually legally morally and socially quite similar which is why gays and lesbians have traditionally often cooperated and do have common social organizations but that was a voluntary historical collaboration these days progressives stick lgbtq together as all that icky deviant sexual stuff that social conservatives don t like i can see some reason to it when gays were really being seriously discriminated against but there is no reason to lump all the alphabet soup of it together now you mean besides not being a craven mercenary who thinks i got mine you re on your own is an ethical and moral viewpoint you mean besides not being a craven mercenary who thinks i got mine you re on your own is an ethical and moral viewpoint who do you think owes you something they re not giving you anyone who owes something without giving it a customer at a restaurant who doesn t pay the bill a person enjoying the costly benefits of civilization without paying their user fee anyone who owes something without giving it a customer at a restaurant who doesn t pay the bill yes we all understand what those english words mean thank you what do i owe you that you are not getting from me the poor a person enjoying the costly benefits of civilization without paying their user fee the costly benefits of civilization can be had for at most 5 of us gdp we know that because things used to work that way the other 45 of gdp that the government forcibly extracts is corruption corruption that you voice full throated support for you and an explanation on what part of my rebuttal was unclear you and an explanation on what part of my rebuttal was unclear oh what you said was clear what s not clear is what i owe you that you are not getting from me can you clarify any gay person is free to support the transgender cause what i object to is the desperation to keep playing the victim card as long as possible the activists no longer represent the interests of the people they claim to represent among the reasons i dislike it is that i think it is likely to be ultimately counterproductive to the cause of increasing the already broad social acceptance that has come about in the last several decades gee ya think now do race haha i have a friend mostly libertarian who was against gay marriage because he thought government should be involved he changed his opinion when i pointed out that freedom allows you to do what you want and it was government intervention that was preventing them from marrying government involvement is a minarchist position which fits into libertarianism the concept is that the nuclear family promotes a stable social unit that promotes ethics and social values while providing a natural social safety net this inocculates society from pathologies that demand large government to take care of the mess in so far as a stable family unit limits individuals dependence on government minarchists can support government promotion of that family unit through marriage i can t tell are you trying to argue against or for same sex marriage cause we ve known for years and years before obergefel that all the social goods from marriage your e talking about accrue in same sex marriages too do they i question whether non familial adoption and genetic donation are beneficial but i know that pandora s box is even a futile argument studies of the children of such unions have been all over the place on this so i m not certain the scientific data is there to support the jury s conclusion so my personal opinion will stick with the superiority of biological connections where all the rest being equal actually i lost site of the argument in my last comment the place where non familial adoption genetic donation and various formulations of same sex coupling family units is that they require more government to enforce not less there was a court case not to long ago where the biological father lost custody of his child to his gay partner after a divorce that kind of mess requires more government to shift through the details and enforce it on naturally uncooperative citizens i question whether non familial adoption and genetic donation are beneficial so are you saying adopting a child to whom you are not genetically related should be illegal how do you feel about abortion because if that s what you re arguing i m seeing a weak spot there was a court case not to long ago where the biological father lost custody of his child to his gay partner after a divorce that kind of mess requires more government to shift through the details and enforce it on naturally uncooperative citizens but if a biological father lost custody of his child to the child s step mother would that be okay i don t understand how requesting that government not specifically forbid something is requiring more government involvement nor do i understand in what universe you could call your argument for having the government restrict people s personal choices libertarian the place where non familial adoption genetic donation and various formulations of same sex coupling family units is that they require more government to enforce not less only if you compare them to mommy daddy and their biological children if you compare them to comparable het couples there s no difference so unless you re arguing against het couples doing that stuff this entire argument is a red herring in so far as a stable family unit limits individuals dependence on government minarchists can support government promotion of that family unit through marriage the chinese government called it likes the cut of your jib this is one of the primary reasons i objected to obergefel aside from the stop amending things from the bench objection you knew they wouldn t stop at merely permitting ssm that they would have to move on to punishing anybody opposed no victory by the left is ever compete until they ve crushed everybody who dissented from it winning is never enough social conservatives make the same assumption as progressives namely that it is the job of government to impose values on the people of course that s a zero sum game in other words social conservatives have gotten hoisted by their own petard don t like government defining marriage one way or another take the libertarian view that government should get out of marriage if you take any other view you get what you deserve the government wasn t defining marriage it was just rolling with the definition it had had throughout all of recorded history you know when the government defined marriage when the supreme court ruled in obergefel when the court decided they were going to change the meaning of a word the government had no role in defining to begin with the government wasn t defining marriage it was just rolling with the definition it had had throughout all of recorded history exactly there were no multiple wives in the bible bible approved marriages only one or more wives and some concubines one man and a pillar of salt we need to make that legal again our marriage laws used to best reflect roman marriage laws specifically those enacted in caesar augustus social reforms precipitating his golden age they were never derived from the old testament examples of marriage our marriage laws used to best reflect roman marriage laws specifically those enacted in caesar augustus social reforms precipitating his golden age and if they still reflected those laws particularly about the legal rights and responsibilities of a man s spouse gays would have stayed so far away you couldn t even see us with your horribly misogynistic marriages marriage had to become much more equal on it s own before gays were interested in marriage equality roman marriage was more equal than you think rome was not a modification of spartan culture but athenian and etruscan both were far more liberal with their women than we give credit for etruscans were matriarchal etruscans were matriarchal cite um spartan society in regards to women was far more liberal than athenian women were educated were free to own property in many cases had to conduct business because spartiates were forbidden from doing any business other than being soldiers athenian women were little more than slaves our marriage laws used to best reflect roman marriage laws specifically those enacted in caesar augustus social reforms precipitating his golden age nope our marriage laws are anglo saxon in origin coming to us via english common law roman marriage laws were very different from ours the government wasn t defining marriage it was just rolling with the definition it had had throughout all of recorded history what the government s definition derives from is irrelevant the fact is that government has a legal concept of marriage peppered throughout various laws and a gender specific version of that arguably violates equal protection hence after obergefell the legal term marriage now refers to something you might prefer to call domestic partnership other people called gay couples married long before obergefell my church for example has been marrying homosexual couples for a quarter of a century it happens all the time that legal terms deviate from their colloquial meaning sorry about that welcome to the real world let s not even get into the fact that throughout all of recorded history is wrong marriage existed before government glommed onto it so divorces would be easier government doesn t sanctify it so letting gays get married by government trashes nothing of your religious marriage so many religious equate government marriage as a god blessed union for some reason give to ceasar what is ceasar s and to god what is god s except that obergefell didn t update the definition of marriage to one that was sex neutral there are explicit call outs in the ruling to certain categories of sex neutral marriages that anthony kennedy didn t like so felt free to exclude it s still an arbitrary judgement of the government over what religious ceremonies will or will not be rewarded robert francis o rourke there can be no reward no benefit no tax break for anyone any institution or any organization that denies the full human rights and full civil rights of every single one of us also robert francis o rourke damn right we re going to take your guns if he doesn t believe he should be president why is he still running to say things that other candidates don t dare say and to make their far left positions appear more moderate that and he s an entitled narcissistic prick who likes attention beto church doctrine must align with state doctrine or else where have i heard that before the vatican china it is clear and obvious now gay people are a threat to civil rights to remain free we must persecute them hard there s a video on youtube with gilbert gottfried roasting george takei at a friar s roast it would make liberal heads explode thanks for the tip it s getting more and more difficult to find some good old fashioned gay bashing when you are looking for laughs george takei is a self righteous prick who stayed in the closet for most of his career and now tries to pretend that he s been some great defender of gay rights throughout his life takei is a hypocrite just like you kirkland haha yeah we know you re always looking for virtue signaling opportunities so genuine carry on old man you and your ilk are setting back tolerance for the benefit of being able to pat yourselves on the back well done don t change a thing ultimately the democratic candidates offered lgbt voters whatever they wanted no democratic candidates offered lgbt voters what democrats offer all identifiable minority groups a victim identity identity and special handouts i doubt most lgb voters give a damn oh my god can we have the rocking chair and the pipe smoking but you stop making mouth noises grandpa oh my god can we have the rocking chair and the pipe smoking but you stop making mouth noises grandpa oh tony tony dear your dementia is really getting to you it s you tony grandpa who s sitting in the rocking chair and smoking a pipe and it s you who is making those disgusting mouth noises meh i do have my problems with the way gay activism has transformed since my day used to be about thick skin sticks and stones humor now it s all about whining and demanding or it could be that s just a caricature spread by the forces of evil who can really say is there data on this cnn and the democrats running for president are the forces of evil sounds right actually that a typo or are you trying to argue that most lgb folks would happily jettison trans folk if so that s not supported at all republican lgb voters are pretty anti trans but the community as a whole is fine with trans folk don t see why they would be gay men women have literally nothing in common with trannies it s worse than having nothing in common the concept of transgenderism is directly opposed to the goal of sexual freedom that homosexuals have long been fighting for transgenderism holds that where sex differences are concerned ones thoughts and feelings must comport with ones physical form and outward appearance and that it s natural to feel extreme distress about any perceived mismatch that belief is sexism itself transsexual transitioning is the most extreme expression of sexism possible and i don t see why someone would be sexually interested in women so what you don t have to understand someone to respect their decisions i m also not obligated to humor them victorians had less rigid gender rules than trannies have the concept of a tomboy doesn t exist in the tranny community in fairness i ve never seen any evidence that the current crop of trans concerns that have been adopted by progressives actually have a source in the trans community if there is indeed such a thing which i m also not convinced there is are you trying to argue that most lgb folks would happily jettison trans folk most lgb folks would happily jettison trans folk have you completely missed the l vs t glbt civil war go look up terf there are also rising voices among the gs that genderism erases the concept of homosexuality by denying the physical reality of the sexes and that encouraging male to female transitioning of boys amounts to a genocide against gay men they re not yet easy to find yet though if you search you ll more easily find those speaking out to condemn them https medium com phaylen why are more gay men turning on transgender people 14612aa2d831 eliminate tax exempt status for all churches problem solved do you also eliminate it for secular charities that would certainly eliminate a lot of the corruption by non profits exempting churches entangles government and religion not exempting them entangles it more a church behind on its taxes might get its building seized at that point a law taxes is interfering with the free exercise thereof that s basically the shot across the bow of government on taxation of churches in one of the few relevant court cases politicians pretend it s tax exemption by their good graces but it s not exempting churches puts the government in the position of decided what is or is not a religion that s entangled as hell a church behind on its taxes might get its building seized just like anyone else who owns a building for any other purpose like a newspaper that doesn t pay its taxes or someone whose firearms are auctioned off due to bankruptcy equal treatment regardless of whether the government has decided that your activities constitute religion and churches that fall behind on their rent get kicked out what s the issue it removes the temptation for abuse of tax law to punish views of a religious group a government official dislikes it is preemptive kind of like how a religious test is not to be used as a reason to deny someone a position in government service is a provision in the main body of the constitution power to tax is power to destroy that s why federal buildings are exempt from any lower jurisdiction s taxation you separate religious buildings and groups into their own tax groups despite being by definition not for profit and any jurisdiction can set their own rules for taxation not all of the consequences would be to progressives liking needless to say punishing churches for their positions not just their actions is thoroughly unquestionably unconstitutional this is false since unconstitutional means whatever 5 of our robed priests says it means regardless of the text or meaning i can t see the roberts court going along with it this policy if enacted would probably get a 9 0 smackdown after 8 years of a president o rourke or buttigieg that might change it s not punishing churches to rescind tax exemption it s fairness regardless of their position on gay rights if you can tax people for selling widgets you can damn well tax them for selling bullshit it s not punishing churches to rescind tax exemption when you selectively rescind tax exemption it is who said anything about being selective beto you know the person the article mentions specifically he should go back to his guitar and saying fuck if selling bullshit were taxable we could eliminate the national debt by taxing the ipcc denying science is embarrassing it sure is if a narrowly selected set of high priests who ve been plied by billions in research grants say something is true then science demands you don t question it ever whatever you say pats your head because there s definitely no money in climate change denial not like the most profitable enterprises in the history of earth pshh because there s definitely no money in climate change denial please look up how much is spent by the global energy sector vs how much is spent by global governments on climate change research and propaganda please hey heartland institute had several hundred thousand dollars of income for their climate change denial program that s way more than the billions spent of climate and green energy research every year mostly by big oil not sure if you re being sarcastic poe s law and all but if you actually look at the numbers you ll find that the climate change denial complex at most is like two or three full time employees government spending is in the billions annually ask him why he thinks big oil is spending money to fix a problem that s a hoax same reason companies pretend that trannies are a real thing pc babee uh huh you are the only people on planet earth oil companies included that buy into blogger climate denial horseshit you should be ashamed of yourselves you are the only people on planet earth oil companies included that buy into blogger climate denial horseshit let s see last time i asked you this i think it was the 932nd time so i ll ask you for the 933rd time what is it you feel we are denying and instead of just saying consensus why don t you make an attempt to show that you know something about the science that i m unaware of you tell me what you believe that differs from what current science says then i ll be able to tell you back ask him why he thinks big oil is spending money to fix a problem that s a hoax why don t you ask me yourself is it because i wind up making you look like an ignoramus every time you attempt to discuss this with me directly and as an added bonus please be specific about how much you believe big oil is spending to fix a problem and please detail what specific actions they have determined need to be taken to fix a problem with all the science ing they ve been doing it may well be the most impressive conceit in world history that changing weather is not only caused by man but can be predicted and legislated into submission because there s definitely no money in climate change denial not like the most profitable enterprises in the history of earth pshh do you really want to compare the money in skepticism as opposed to acceptance of environmentalism a pittance got trump elected with the help of facebook propaganda is not that expensive the internet is where deniers get all their stupid fucked up nonsense and all they have to do is make sure to select only the random blogs that confirm their denialism blogs are cheap science is not and neither will fixing this problem especially the longer we wait to do it tell me more about hiding the decline please or why foia requests should be needed to get data for science i m dying to hear about it i know when einstein proposed relativity he used an autistic child to sell it and certainly didn t provide means of disproving it tony doesnt know jack shit about the science the most he can repeat is the oreskes or cook claim of 95 he doesnt know how either study was done or that both have been largely debunked tony s whole climate change belief is backed by those 2 social scientists incorrect your talking points are like 15 goddamn years old just read something anything that s credible one fucking article wikipedia even jesus christ you have to try really really fucking hard to be this dumb propaganda is not that expensive good you re starting to take your first steps now look up who spends more on propagandizing between governments and big oil how many genders are there depends on which language you re talking about in which language is there where tony pretends the science in the ipcc report is found in the political report and not the other reports because what most of tony thinks is contradicted by the ipcc report itself do you believe in taxing all nonprofits if not then yes it is punishing churches churches are not nonprofits is the point most nonprofits are not nonprofits how do you define non profit the broadest definition as i understand is that the board is volunteer you can have hospitals and social service agencies of both kinds anyways the only lasting effect this forum will have is elizabeth warren winning yet again with the help of a good zinger and biden talking about gay gay bath houses round the clock sex it s her turn i don t see how that s not a sexist comment you say that as if i gave a f ck about being called sexist by you or anybody else i no doubt hold lots of beliefs that you would consider sexist and racist why don t you take your pearl clutching to someone who might care like the clinton campaign staffers who wanted to use that phrase as a clinton campaign slogan the question is why it s relevant to senator warren it s hardly her turn in terms of insipid punditry so what gives no the question is why you called a hillary campaign slogan sexist the reason it applies to warren is because warren has the same dumb sense of entitlement as hillary her genitalia have nothing to do with it warren hillary without the charm warren who seems fundamentally opposed to basic truth her the zinger that was set up by one of her supporters and they claim media isnt in the bag for democrats cox the person asking that question is a max donor and coordinated with warren s office not getting a wedding cake or not getting to teach at a catholic school is not enough to justify the boot say it about black people and see if it still sounds cool not getting a maga cake from the lesbian cupcake shop or the white supremacist not getting to teach at the black college is not enough to justify the boot there is always a boot you just want to put it on gay people s throats instead of shop owners you think that makes you morally superior what it makes you is equally statist only douchier or else you explain to me what happens when an undesirable shows up and demands normal service against the owner s strong objection there is always a boot you just want to put it on gay people s throats instead of shop owners no hun a shop owner refusing to do business with a nasty little homosexual like you is not putting the boot on you it s just a shop owner exercising his freedom of association and his property rights and i say that as a gay man myself you whining like a stuck pick and calling for the democratic socialist party to send in the big men with big guns however is asking to put the boot on someone s throat okay but the shop owner gets to call the cops and have them drag me out for trespassing right that s actual cops with actual guns unlike the metaphorical ones you say i m wanting to impose only if for some reason you refuse to leave when asked one might think and the customer won t bring a lawsuit if he s not discriminated against if we re just doing the honors system why does only the customer have to be honorable non sequitur i pointed out no one was threatening guns for someone being gay even in your scenario they re beating threatened for refusing to leave private property yeah we dealt with this in the 60s a store open to the public may be private property but even in your own home you aren t permitted to break the law that s a non sequitur we could see it was a non sequitur you didn t need to label it if you can t see the difference between ending government mandated segregation and doing away with freedom of association entirely i don t think there s anything i can say to make you think but you want to bring back government mandated segregation that s specifically what you re arguing in favor of you can t weasel your way out of that reality by saying it ll all happen by the honors system no armed government thugs will drag black people from lunch counters that is the freedom you are unequivocally endorsing bringing back to this country no tony we re arguing for freedom of association you re arguing for forced race based association the shop owner has a right to discriminate against you and not serve you you do not have a right to be on his property you do not have a right to his services i do if the government says i do i do if the government says i do tony please try to keep up obviously the government can give you a legal right to demand service from a shopkeeper that s so obvious that it doesn t even need stating the government can likewise also give concentration camp guards the legal right to gas homosexuals as they did in germany obviously we re not talking about legal rights here we re talking about intrinsic human or moral rights and no you do not have an intrinsic human or moral right to the service or property of other people when legal rights and moral human rights contradict each other we have an injustice and that s what we have with anti discrimination laws but apart from moral issues the more fundamental problem with anti discrimination laws is that they don t work and in fact harm the groups they are ostensibly helping anti discrimination laws are a political gimmick and a form of rent seeking by big corporations intrinsic rights are things tyrants say i have i prefer putting pen to paper thank you very much again there is nothing dishonorable about refusing to serve gays straights christians atheists jews palestinians blacks whites greeks swedes conservatives republicans progressives socialists democracts fascists well that s included in progressives i suppose or anybody else people have a right not to serve people for any reason or no reason at all you tend to make emotional arguments more than anything else let s put your ideology into practice black owned cake shop black customer orders black power cake if they make it have white customer order white power cake if they refuse it looks like a lawsuit to me if i was a lawyer i would set this up myself for the payday see what doors you open up you re an idealist in a world that isn t ideal yeah that s already been tested you can refuse specific wording and messages you can not categorically refuse the customer based on a protected class that bit of precedent that they can refuse a message is why phillip s lawyers pushed the whole the cake is a message line so hard because if the cake is a message regardless of decoration then you can claim you re not refusing the class of customer you re refusing the specific message if the cake is in and of itself not a message then you re refusing the customer based on protected class not message compare with azucar bakery where the baker was willing to bake the cake but kept fighting with the customer over the exact text and symbols to put on the cake all of which is to say any baker can refuse white power or black power and their decision to do one but not the other is not a legal problem for that matter even if the cake is the message refusing a white supremacist but not other whites is permissible because white supremacist is not a protected class that bit of precedent that they can refuse a message is why phillip s lawyers pushed the whole the cake is a message line so hard because if the cake is a message regardless of decoration then you can claim you re not refusing the class of customer you re refusing the specific message if the cake is in and of itself not a message then you re refusing the customer based on protected class not message do i need to remind you that phillips never denied them business he sold them cakes in the past he turned down a special cake request based on his moral and religious beliefs he never not once said i won t sell to a gay person this is something that really isn t even in dispute well you should be able to refuse any customer for any reason these nondiscrimination laws are b s they are an attempt by progressives to distract from the fact that it was progressive legislation not private discrimination that denied minorities the ability to live normal and equal lives phillip s served gays for over a decade dumbfuck he did not serve gay weddings marriage is a sacrament in his religion he also turned down satanists and others due to religion why do you always lie about the issue you can not categorically refuse the customer based on a protected class white people are a protected class just the same as blacks are by providing a cake celebrating race to one and not the other could be argued as discrimination based on race black supremacists exist in the same manner as white supremacists imagine a baker providing white power cakes to white customers and refusing black power cakes to black customers he ll gladly sell them a white power cake though protected class haha isn t that the real problem different rules for different folks far more than cakes but protecting classes is far more important than equality too funny better scenario the infamous racist candice owen s orders a trump 2020 cake she s hot no i want gay shop owners to be able to refuse business to people they find distasteful the fact that you can t seem to be able to view that many moves ahead in a game that s essentially dumbed down version of checkers makes me wonder how you function during the day let alone earn a living wage seeing as there s no serious effort anywhere to repeal any part of the cra i think it s a bit disingenuous to claim that move is anywhere ahead there are however movements to constantly redefine what the cra actually says and applies to without corresponding efforts to actually change the law not everything that doesn t sound cool needs to be punished by government almighty if i stand in my own front yard practicing booger beam blowing snot with one nostril onto my own grass but in the sight of passing strangers that s not cool should i be punished by government almighty for that when government almighty gets done outlawing all supposedly not cool things and mandating all cool things i will have no personal freedom left it the simplest of thought experiments so try to keep up interracial couples not getting a wedding cake or black people not being allowed to teach at catholic schools is not enough to justify the boot you have to agree with that if you agree with the original sentiment that would make you a good libertarian probably don t go wobbly on me any unwarranted discrimination against gays and blacks if it is irrational based on who they are as opposed to specific personal bad behavior on their part is bad not good i will personally punish discrimators by not buying from them and not socially interacting with them if i can avoid it and by talking badly about them to my friends but i object to my taxes being used to punish them we have too much of that sort of thing going on already we need to expand not contract the category of that which sensible people will say about it this that s not right it s not ethical or moral but it s not government s business example divorce is bad shall we outlaw it me personally i approve of laws for now at least mandating non discrimination at hotels and eateries and for sure at the emergency room for gays and blacks alike but not gay cake baking just in the name of peace let s carve out exceptions for support of gay weddings peace is precious less fighting more compromises i will personally not shop at the cake baker refusers and talk bad about them and then i quit enough fighting how about some more peace through compromises but i can t put aside the fact that the implication of your position is that gay people are dragged out of shops for being gay which is something that current law won t permit for races religions sex disability status and what have you you want to single gay people out if you want to vastly scale back civil rights for everyone else that s certainly a libertarian position but as i have explained it requires no less the use of state force than my position does so i guess may the best man win but i can t put aside the fact that the implication of your position is that gay people are dragged out of shops for being gay you can pretty much get fired for anything so if they want to fire you for being gay they will just fire you for doing a bad job it may take them an extra 2 months of watching over you and documenting everything it s incredibly simple to get around two managers can claim you told them to fuck off you say you didn t do any such thing their lawyer claims you re just saying that to keep your job think about it it solves nothing and makes you a liability laws don t make people change it just makes them change their strategies this would be more persuassive if there was any serious effort anywhere to repeal non discrimination in employment laws the fact that there isn t makes it obvious that despite this being a common claim it is not a sincere one as it works equally against the status quo as it does to expanding the status quo i like how your defense of limited protections is democrats passing limited protections in the past do you think the argument it was done before is libertarian or something no tony gay people are being dragged out of shops for the same reason straight people are if they are told to leave and refuse and i have zero problem with a shopkeeper telling me to leave because i m gay what reason in the world would i have to want to support a shopkeeper who is homophobic why do you want to force me a gay man to support anti gay shopkeepers i just think sexual orientation should be treated under the law the same way race religion and disability status are but i m not a utopian fucktard and i like many of the advancements of freedom and civilization that we have manifested in this world i just think sexual orientation should be treated under the law the same way race religion and disability status are well i do too in the sense that non discrimination policies should be abolished for all those categories but i m not willing to fall on my sword as a gay man and have civil rights legislation do to gays and lesbians what it did to blacks religious organizations and the disabled civil rights legislation is bad news it s harmful it s destructive of communities individuals and work and business relations do not want so what evidence have you examined that demonstrates this harm i m honestly willing to be informed well for one look for the social progress of minority communities before and after the cra there are also plenty of studies that show that after the institution of affirmative action people started assuming that minorities are less capable than non minorities and were hired because institutions need to fill their quotas you can also think this through if a homophobic employer wants to fire me for being gay without anti discrimination laws they re simply going to tell me with anti discrimination laws they are going to make up a reason or keep me back in my career while i keep working for them just firing me so that i can go work for a non homophobic employer is far preferable for me if i am out at work with anti discrimination policies my employer will work on eggshells figuring out whether any particular action might violate some law it s poison to a working relationship furthermore i don t know whether you even have a job but if you work in a competitive professional field suing for violation of anti discrimination policies is the end of one s career most places will simply not hire you afterwards it s not worth it the main people who benefit from anti discrimination policies are underperforming employees and ambulance chasers i just think sexual orientation should be treated under the law the same way race religion and disability status are you can t really prove sexual orientation same with trans and think of the uproar if in order to be protected as a trans person it requires a doctor to state you have gender dysphoria disabled have to do that it s like being a baltimore raven s fan or a juggalo people have to take your word on it you can provide the court with a picture of you having a dick in your mouth giving a thumbs up and it doesn t prove that you re gay just that you ve had a dick in your mouth what if i m sexually attracted to cardboard people are like that with balloons it s all subjective and it can change at the drop of a hat disability sex and race aren t like that religion yeah but that s a constitution thingy do giving protections is just a way for politicians to grandstand about how good they are and meanwhile the public just continues to discriminate less openly so now it s harder to prove but you can prove your religion my mom gets a disability placard because of a heart ailment how does she prove that you are worried about some really stupid shit as he said if you were paying attention religion is already protected in the constitution an important difference setting aside religion political affiliation is that sexual orientation identity as commonly understood is not immutable anybody can pick up or drop homosexuality as a shield at any time you want special status we get it being a victim is a badge of honor one day maybe you ll be an individual doubtful grievance is intoxicating haha you right wing morons are absolutely nothing but grievance except you whine constantly about the stupidest crap imaginable gay wedding support is typically creative and or religious forcing the gay cake baker is much like forcing the ghost writer to support a customer wanting a pro nazi book written or if i do art paintings contractually for customers should i not be able to refuse to do an obviously adoring painting of hitler i don t agree with anti gay sentiments but let s just make some peace here is what i am saying give peace a chance the below is a repeat of earlier comments of mine but i think it is very highly relevant short version up top ralph waldo emerson who said the state must follow and not lead the character and progress of the citizen here is the full blown quote from ralph waldo emerson republics abound in young civilians who believe that the laws make the city that grave modifications of the policy and modes of living and employments of the population that commerce education and religion may be voted in or out and that any measure though it were absurd may be imposed on a people if only you can get sufficient voices to make it a law but the wise know that foolish legislation is a rope of sand which perishes in the twisting that the state must follow and not lead the character and progress of the citizen that the form of government which prevails is the expression of what cultivation exists in the population which permits it the law is only a memorandum another relevant emerson quote all men plume themselves on the improvement of society and no man improves so anyway suppose that government almighty goes too far and mandates no meat diets which many people disagree with just like the war on drugs today then there will be underground makeshift amateurish animal killing and butchering shops where the animals will be treated far less humanely than they are today thank you do gooders you will not be able to let your cat or dog wander through the bushes in your own back yard for fear of meat hungry lawbreaking pet snatchers but meat hungry lawbreaking pet snatchers would make an most excellent name for a garage band it the simplest of thought experiments so try to keep up i m sure it is coming from a simpleton such as you interracial couples not getting a wedding cake or black people not being allowed to teach at catholic schools is not enough to justify the boot you have to agree with that if you agree with the original sentiment that would make you a good libertarian probably ok simpleton try it again in english this time if you are asking whether catholic schools can not hire gays because they are gay i absolutely agree that choice is theirs to make don t go wobbly on me try to get at least iq 50 on us no he s pretty clearly asking how you feel about race based discrimination he isn t being subtle it was primarily progressives and leftists that used the power of government to deny interracial couple minorities and homosexuals equal rights now that we finally have managed to overcome this legacy the american left is pretending that they are our savior instead of being the perpetrators of injustice let me guess you think because racist southerners once had d s after their names that means that progressives were behind all the slavery and jim crow and oppression despite the completely nonsensical nature of that claim stunning historical analysis conservative white southerners are as pure as white snow just as long as they had that r still are the r means good trump good orange man good not at all i believe that progressives were responsible for segregation racism and eugenics because i actually read the primary literature not only is that a historical fact it also makes sense progressives even today advocate dividing people up by race and treat them differently while conservatives and classical liberals want simple equality under the law being black is not really the same thing as enjoying odd sex acts democratic candidates promise lgbt voters they ll punish all the right people democrats want to punish me for not baking cakes that i don t want to bake and for not wanting government almighty making my charity choices for me and wanting to burn petrol instead of getting my power from windmills that kill birds and bats and cause local ground level heating via air mixing from high level hotter air thereby contributing to global warming but it is correct global warming and they want to punish me for defending myself if need be with a gun republicans want to punish me for buying stuff made in china or giving a bite of food to illegal sub humans w o asking for papers please first cause that s aiding and abetting horrible law breakers and of course republicans want to punish me for killing fertilized egg cells even if they belong to me but only the politically correct ones meaning the human ones if we do not want to be punished for stupid things we need to vote libertarian are you under some impression that republicans don t support non discrimination laws huge numbers of republicans want to force me to discriminate against immigrants and especially against the so called illegal sub humans they want to punish me for buying chinese made goods and many of them frankly don t like immigration legal or illegal recent reason com articles have clearly shown this over the last few years it has gotten to the point that we need to look over our shoulders to see if any ice police are present before opening a door or pressing an elevator button for a stranger w o asking fort papers please first lest we get busted for aiding and abetting an illegal sub human xenophobia rules the days for many republicans that s nice and all but i m specifically reacting to how you listed democrats want to punish me for not baking cakes that i don t want to bake in your compare contrast thus implying that you think republicans don t want to do the same fact is republicans are fine with non discrimination laws even as they apply to bakers they just don t want gay people covered but you shouldn t confuse their anti gay bias with them not wanting bakers covered by non discrimination laws your point is well taken anti gay bias belongs to republicans far more so than to democrats i would split hairs with you though and claim that in general democrats are more kindly disposed towards 492 072 103 page laws precisely dictating who can or must do what for whom with the obvious fore mentioned exceptions like abortion also republicans are knuckle draggers about getting rid of the stupid war on drugs which i forgot about anti gay bias belongs to republicans far more so than to democrats true but not my point my point is and remains there is no major political party that doesn t want to punish you for refusing to make cakes the only question is which groups are protected and there s actually very little disagreement between the two parties there is no major political party that doesn t want to punish you for refusing to make cakes and there s actually very little disagreement between the two parties that s why many of us here are libertarians and don t support either major party well somewhat democrats seem quite fond of muslims and islam s view on gays is well problematic actually islam s views on sex overlap quite a bit with those of contemporary feminists democrats want to punish me for not baking cakes that i don t want to bake if you refuse you re going to get tons of shit for it so just take the job and totally fuck up the cake have peanut butter and jelly on the inside the most you ll get is a bad yelp review this is going to be one forum where you re going to hear very little disagreement between the candidates former vice president joe biden observed he was absolutely correct this is going to be one forum where you re going to hear all of us pander to the same voting bloc former vice president joe biden observed yeah it was probably boring but on the flip side we have a republican president actively arguing against lgbt rights at every opportunity from re instating dadt for trans soldiers to giving exemptions on non discrimination policies for religious charities to discriminate to randomly denying that gay couples are married for the purpose of their foreign born children and so on you know all those anti gay actions that you shackford continues to ignore when they happen what about the rights of schizophrenics to serve in the u s armed forces honestly curious since it seems that it s claimed to be a civil right to join the military should there be medical exemptions in reality there already are has been for a long time medical reasons why one cannot join the military enlisted troops also get aptitude tests which are essentially iq tests iq tests are forbidden for civilian employers period it is the usual case of government almighty having one set of rules for themselves and a totally different set of rules for themselves some of it makes sense government monopoly on violence is still needed imho stringent tests for government employment ok we are probably not doing enough of that as is much of the rest makes little sense when it general category of whatever is forbidden to private employers that is and it took laborious effort before the armed forces could conclude with their studies that gay members don t harm military effectiveness and they made sure to make it look laborious lest the knuckledraggers get their knuckles stuck in the whiny bitch mud byodb i really don t need the reminders for why i am not and will never a libertarian but thank you for demonstrating all the same i d hate to think my bias is irrational if 03 of the population over half of which will kill themselves but only after they ve consumed millions of dollars worth of medical services can t join the armed forces then we re living in anti gay tyranny here people i m sure a big strong faggot like yourself was all set to go sign up too shucks huh i d hate to think my bias is irrational no your bias is still bias and it s still irrational escher has to ignore the fact that gender dysphoria is at least for the moment considered a mental health issue basically they want to steal a base and skip over that issue just like basically everyone else when talking about this issue i do notice that my question regarding are there medical exemptions to the right to join the military wasn t answered why anyone would think that sending people with mental health issues into murder training that leaves even fairly stable people in shambles is anyone s guess but on the flip side we have a republican president actively arguing against lgbt rights at every opportunity from re instating dadt for trans soldiers this is more in line with banning diabetics and anorexics than banning gays o giving exemptions on non discrimination policies for religious charities to discriminate charities are not a public accommodation to randomly denying that gay couples are married for the purpose of their foreign born children and so on why is that wrong we have a republican president who wants to treat lgbt people as equals rather than treating us as fragile little creatures who need the benevolent special protection of government i think the progressives policies vis a vis lgbt folks are reprehensible i don t need or want anti discrimination legislation i should also add that i find it offensive for you to lump together gay lesbian bisexual and transgender rights to begin with transgender individuals have a medical problem as the fact that they require surgery to correct it shows you gays and lesbians are generally happy with who they are don t require and don t want medical treatment and just want to be left alone in case anyone doesn t understand what we are saying here we being me the ralph waldo emerson in my pocket if i passed a law saying that one may no longer burn witches for killing our calves and babies and making our crops fail just because they are witches using witchcraft people would laugh at me we got over witch burning a long time ago so those laws aren t needed any more we ve gotten over totally overt anti black people bias to the point where we might start ditching those laws as well in their place enforce truth in adverting laws do not put up a sign in your shop saying all races welcome here and then act to the contrary to your sign for lack of a non discrimination sign and for bad behavior most people today would punish such a shop enough boycotts work more tolerance for gays is newer than more tolerance for blacks give it time in due time cake baking laws will be as un needed as witch protection laws are today ralph waldo emerson was right let the state follow the progress of the citizens and not vice versa vice versa causes waaay too much fighting and waaay too much stupid if the laws are unnecessary then nobody s freedom is being infringed by them remaining in place just doing a bit of statutory tidying up yes pretty much so too many laws too much confusion carry on bro i somehow feel that petitioners whose interest is to boot gay people from shops will have more political influence than the legislative maria kondo lobby if you can refrain from sucking cock for a few minutes while you re in somebody else s place of business you should be all good tony you poor aids ridden faggot tony i m a gay man i strongly oppose anti discrimination laws protecting me because they are harmful just look at what they have done to african americans people oppose these laws because they are bad laws not because they want to boot gay people from shops what have they done to african americans let them shop at the same places white people can without being dragged out and beaten changed a few white hearts and minds in the process oh dear the humanity god you re still here and still dumb as shit https konmari com i had to look it up japan is crowded they live in little rabbit hutches by american standards i am glad to live in america in a low real estate area at that i can afford to be a slob about scattering my belongings about almost randomly w o regard to tidy organization ok i finally get it what you were saying less is more laws wise but axe grinders gotta grind axes no tony that s incorrect anti discrimination laws infringe my rights as a gay man to engage in free contracting with my employer and with businesses anti discrimination laws harm me as a gay man anti discrimination laws harm small businesses because they cause massive risks of lawsuits and compliance costs even if the business doesn t violate them anti discrimination laws are morally wrong and economically harmful and as a gay man i do not want to be covered by them at all claiming that they protect me as a gay man is either ignorant or dishonest and when a democrat gets into office and implements all of these policies and begins actually jailing religious objectors we can look forward to another big welp that s unfortunate but what are ya gonna do from shackford and reason trump s a conman a crook and a grifter who only believes if we can assign to him any thoughts in himself these on the other hand are true blue ideologues who want to use the state to impose their vision of the good society both are dangerous but when the conman is gone his damage is mostly done the ideologue s damaging acts laws and statutes survive far after they are gone for all his faults tweet convulsions and self aggrandizing trump generally has a fairly straightforward traditional middle of the road political vision of america business friendly low taxes equality under the law good national security and secure borders i don t see him doing a lot of damage to the us unlike obama whose destructive legacy will take decades to reverse yea let s elect one of the psychopath dems it should be absolutely abhorrent to anyone concerned with freedom of speech or freedom of religion well that would exclude all the candidates abhor all you want the current zeitgeist is severely anti freedom i don t think any of these candidates or their supporters want to live in a free society all churches should lose tax exempt status if my c corp has to pay taxes then so should pedophile rings with funny hats ok let s then just get rid of tax exempt period you re cherry picking your special interest groups fuck off just get rid of them all yes catholics are not christians and don t get me started about one of your former leaders of hrc terry bean there s already systems in place to punish wrongdoing why remove
