ersecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion in his state of the union address of january 2002 president george w bush coined the phrase axis of evil however in his second term he apparently forgot about it president obama may never use this term but make no mistake the axis of evil is alive and well iran north korea and now possibly venezuela are on the verge of obtaining nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them on nov 12 north korea revealed that it may have in operation 2 000 centrifuges which have the capacity to produce enough highly enriched uranium to make the plutonium necessary for a number of nuclear weapons every year in reality we don t have sufficient intelligence to know the north s actual nuclear potential however we do know it has been working for more than three decades to acquire both nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them of course with china s help we do know that north korea acquired from russia the technology to make an intermediate range nuclear missile the bm 25 musudan with sufficient range to strike okinawa and probably guam according to the revealed wikileaks documents u s intelligence learned that north korea had sold at least 19 of these missiles to iran top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal

made another startling revelation according to one defector north korean dictator kim jong ii had ordered a new program to build nuclear warhead armed torpedoes and mines which could be operational by 2012 based on past practice i am confident once they are operational they will be sold to iran and possibly others the cabal of iran s mahmoud ahmadinejad and venezuela s hugo chavez can no longer be ignored venezuela s supporting role in iran s nuclear program has been known for years by our intelligence community we know that the two rogue regimes have been cooperating on nuclear technology for several years their collusion was formalized in an agreement nov 13 2008 to cooperate in the field of nuclear technology it is clear that through various trade agreements iran has circumvented u n sanctions by establishing both economic and banking relations as well as establishing a strategic base in venezuela manned by the iranian revolutionary guards according to the german daily die welt iranian missiles with a range of up to 930 miles will be deployed to the base which could strike major southern u s cities it is interesting that following the new round of sanctions against iran russia decided not to sell five battalions of sophisticated s 300 pmu 1 air defense systems to iran but instead is negotiating a deal for the sale of those systems to venezuela it shouldn t take too long for some of them to show up in iran though it s not politically correct to say so the fact is that china remains as much at the center of the axis of evil as when mr bush coined the term china s diplomatic support has for decades shielded north korea and iran from effective sanctions for their nuclear programs china s technology has been made available at critical times to help both their nuclear and missile programs next month chinese leader hu jintao will visit washington and be hosted by president obama at a state dinner as he apparently has demanded nothing less we will be showing mr hu our highest level of respect and hospitality all the while it remains the policy of his government to arm our most sadistic enemies with nuclear weapons which they in turn will have little hesitation to give to islamic terrorists only too eager to use them against the united states this is far from bringing us closer to a world without nuclear weapons mr obama s new start if ratified will only succeed in reducing america s nuclear weapons while at the same time increasing the threat to the united states from the rogue regimes that make up the axis of evil it is mind boggling that we waste our precious military and economic resources in afghanistan a country that from a strategic viewpoint should be at the bottom of our list of concerns instead of addressing the rogue regimes that represent a real threat to this country it is not too far afield to see a machiavellian mindset that lets us see a certain amount of success in afghanistan to keep us tied down there for years to come instead of addressing a rising threat the only way to avoid a fate that could include nuclear attack against our homeland from multiple axes or the necessity of fighting multiple wars against nuclear armed rogue states is to accept that we must to seek near term regime change in those soon to be nuclear armed states now time is not on our side retired navy adm james a lyons was commander
