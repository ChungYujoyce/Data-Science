new york trump s turnout triumph president trump as expected handily won new hampshire s republican primary as he had no serious challenger but what s raising eyebrows are the total of votes he got in a noncompetitive race trump secured more than 120 000 votes in the granite state as fox news tyler olson reported that s more than double what incumbent president barack obama got in the state s 2012 primary when he managed to win 49 080 total votes it also dwarfs the total of other incumbent presidents then president george w bush received 53 962 votes in the largely uncontested gop primary in new hampshire in 2004 and in 1996 incumbent president bill clinton received 76 797 votes in new hampshire apos s primary why did this happen it follows a coordinated effort by the republican national committee and the trump campaign to drive up turnout for trump in new hampshire something the other incumbent presidents didn apos t do trump himself revved up his supporters at a packed and fiery rally in manchester n h on monday the eve of the state apos s primary but it also is an indication that the republican base is all in on trump as he prepares to face the democrats eventual nominee in
