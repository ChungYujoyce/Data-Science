national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge another day another hillary clinton bombshell disclosure this time the scandal comes from disgraced former congressman anthony weiner s laptop computer bringing more suggestions of clinton s sloppy attitude about u s intelligence law meanwhile seemingly every day wikileaks produces more evidence of the clinton foundation leveraging the clinton state department for pay for play profiteering at this point clinton has trumped former president richard nixon s skullduggery but without the offset of nixon s foreign policy accomplishments even before the most recent scandals clinton s campaign had an eerie resemblance to the nixon playbook compare the election of 2016 to the election of 1972 the favored nixon re election juggernaut dubbed creep or the the committee for the re election of the president squeezed corporations and wealthy individuals for millions in donations in much the same way that clinton s multi million dollar cash machine has vastly outspent her opponent donald trump the watergate tapes later revealed an entirely cynical nixon campaign team and a hard nosed white house cadre led by h r haldeman and john ehrlichman plus a host of lesser toadies such as the conniving john dean they all took for granted that washington functioned on a quid pro quo and pay for play basis in that regard the clinton campaign under chairman john podesta the new haldeman has become nixonian to the core thanks to podesta s ruthlessness the wikileaks podesta e mail trove reveals that hillary s consultants have no moral compass they lampoon latinos as needy catholics are written off as being stuck in medieval times aides bartered with plutocrats for secretary of state clinton s face time on the basis of cash donations a primary debate question was tipped off by cnn contributor and democratic operative donna brazile the nickname tricky dick referred to nixon s perceived anything goes campaign style and his flexibility on issues creep s plumbers staged break ins to look for leaked information petty activists supposedly tried to disrupt rallies for nixon s 1972 opponent george mcgovern clinton is using similar tactics in the ambush tapes of project veritas clinton s for hire thugs bragged on film of provoking violence at trump rallies and bringing in voters by bus to cast illegal ballots the anti communist and free marketer nixon turned out to be a wheeler dealer who had no problem wooing communist china or imposing socialist wage and price controls from hacked e mails it is clear that hillary s positions on fracking trade deals the keystone xl pipeline immigration and foreign policy hinged on whatever best served her political self interest most loyal aides who served nixon ended up disgraced jailed or humiliated does anyone think that podesta cheryl mills or huma abedin the fixers so prominent in the wikileaks scandal will have a political future given their aiding and abetting of clinton knavery and profiteering we know that nixon lied about what he had known about the cover up of the watergate break in and now we know from the wikileaks e mail dumps and the fbi investigation that clinton likewise has never told the truth about her e mail server the clinton foundation s pay for play schemes or the catalysts for the benghazi killings nixon always attacked the messenger in hopes of discrediting the message and now clinton is going after fbi director james comey nixon professed that he never knew the sordid details of his campaign s dirty tricks clinton has resorted to the same defense with regard to the shady activities of the now disgraced subordinates who resigned after being caught trying to disrupt trump rallies stonewalling was a nixon specialty clinton told fbi investigators 27 times that she could not remember key details about the e mail scandal a democratic operative from a political action committee bragged on tape that clinton herself liked the operative s idea of having protestors decked out in donald duck costumes provoke trump supporters at his rallies in the end it was the candidate hillary clinton the future president of the united states who wanted ducks on the ground the operative said on tape abedin wrote in an e mail to podesta and clinton aide robby mook that the idea of accepting 12 million to speak at an event held by a moroccan government owned mining company which had received a 92 million loan guarantee from the u s financed export import bank was clinton s this was hrc s idea our office approached the moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request a clinton family advisor described shakedown efforts to reap millions of dollars for former president bill clinton as being the work of bill clinton inc there remains however one disconnect nixon covered up misdeeds long enough to be re elected in a 1972 landslide only later to resign before his looming impeachment when even his administration flunkies could no longer mask his past misdeeds would an elected president hillary clinton eventually meet the same fate this time around there is not the same sort of investigative reporting that there was in 1973 1974 much of the media is backing rather than investigating clinton does the death of independent journalism ensure that clinton s hubris will never earn a nixonian comeuppance or at least not until after the election get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national
