opinion analysis opinion scott walker is the new flavor of the week the new dish on the republican menu he brought crowds to their feet in iowa over the weekend and placed first in an important regional poll to identify favorites for 2016 for someone derided by the smart guys as dull and unexciting the governor of wisconsin is suddenly the flash and splash of midwinter such flash and splash synthetic by definition is usually the work of pundits dulled by the lethargy of january the most useless of the months eager to find something new and entirely different top stories cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces you are not going to die from covid 19 ann coulter turns on trump most disloyal actual retard that has ever set foot in the oval office but january ennui pundits suffering lassitude of their own always often throw in something french in the third paragraph sometimes uncovers the real thing and mr walker looks like authentic voters both republican and democrat seem to be bored with the pale and stale the old and not so bold mitt romney jeb bush chris christie mike huckabee and the gang worthies all are from a movie sent from netflix hillary clinton the freshest face the democrats can find only reminds everyone of scandals some more sordid than others from the previous century the latest iowa poll taken for the des moines register and bloomberg news shows mr walker leading the republican pack with 14 percent that might not seem an exciting number but it was more than anyone else got and it s up from 4 percent in october more to the point he got his bounce after a speech to the iowa freedom summit of 1 200 important social conservatives meeting in des moines the governor fed them the red meat in an account of his dueling with organized labor in the recall election that he survived with ease enacting tax cuts pushing abortion restrictions and telling of threats to his family during the recall campaign no one dozed off and he won a thundering standing ovation the disappointment in the iowa poll was the showing of jeb bush who so far hasn t translated his fundraising east coast establishment credentials into grassroots support in the republican heartland his 8 percent in the iowa poll was not only barely half of the walker tally but he trailed rand paul and mike huckabee for fourth place he rivals hillary as the butt of dynasty jokes sen dianne feinstein of california a democrat whose speechwriters are not particularly famous for their wit and humor gave her this one that rocked the alfalfa dinner saturday
