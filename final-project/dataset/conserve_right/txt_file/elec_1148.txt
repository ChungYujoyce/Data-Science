 sign in unending train of abuses and usurpations manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion in november 2010 i was sent to congress on a wave of discontent with president obama and his hyperpartisan hard left agenda with this clear repudiation behind him and a republican house majority suddenly standing before him mr obama was handed an opportunity to adjust course and reclaim the confidence of the american electorate instead he took a different approach if you can t lead em ignore em president obama set himself against the expressed will of the american people and resolved to end run and overrun their elected representatives so began the imperial presidency as a conservative freshman in congress one expects policy disagreements with a liberal president i also expected a productive if sometimes pitched exchange of ideas between the legislative and executive branches what happened instead was an all out executive power play a rejection of substantive democratic dialogue with his colleagues on the other side of the aisle in a co equal branch of government of course the president attempted to avoid responsibility for this destructive choice in the familiar way he projected it at his opposition but this only added deception to the destruction top stories coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history australian researchers see virus design manipulation postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud consider when mr obama announced that the federal government would cease enforcing important policies against illegal immigration s b 1070 arizona s immigration law sought nothing more than to compensate for the obama administration s long standing failure to comply with pre existing federal immigration law he sued arizona to stop the state from enforcing federal immigration policy and lost an important part of that suit by unanimous judgment of the supreme court then the day of the ruling mr obama announced that the federal government would cease to cooperate in the 287 g task force a pragmatic state federal partnership designed to assist local law enforcement in dealing with apprehended illegal immigrants not only does this approach encourage further illegal immigration it is an attack on our system of laws and the separation of powers that lies at the heart of our constitution the moment national security is ignored in pursuit of partisan executive ambition you know america has entered the era of the imperial president an earlier sign of mr obama s arrogance came in february 2011 he announced then that the department of justice would not defend the defense of marriage act in court even though it s a federal law passed with bipartisan support and signed by president clinton i wholeheartedly support traditional marriage as between one man and one woman but the issue here is not confined to the sanctity of marriage once again it is mr obama s willingness to flout established laws for political gain and convenience mr obama also has placed his imperious nature on display overseas in his role as commander in chief last year after weeks of dithering he decided to engage in what his advisers creatively termed kinetic military action in libya american engagement in libya was a difficult decision that divided the american people and congress alike but mr obama didn t seem to care members of both parties were appalled when he authorized military action without congressional approval in the current context of international upheaval and armed conflict in syria the potential implications of mr obama s actions were quite serious whether he is commanding the environmental protection agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions or implementing net neutrality via the federal communications commission mr obama continues to circumvent congress and treat the constitution s balance of powers with wanton disregard he also has demonstrated an astounding contempt for the constitutionally mandated process of senate review of presidential appointees in an effort to sneak through an unpopular partisan czar for his newly created regulatory behemoth the consumer financial protection bureau mr obama made a recess appointment or so he claimed unfortunately his claim was blatantly false as the senate was in the midst of a pro forma session as a senator mr obama habitually decried recess appointments yet as president with his eyes fixed on the expansion and politically expedient exercise of his own power he has not only hypocritically embraced recess appointments but unconstitutionally redefined the term mr obama s imperial temperament was revealed again during his shameless exchange with then russian president dmitry medvedev thinking they were off microphone at a photo opportunity he plaintively asked mr medvedev to give him space regarding missile defense until after the november election in that moment mr obama undermined before russia and the entire world the unity of the american people and their government considering the strategic significance of missile defense this was one of the worst displays of presidential duplicity in history once again revealing mr obama s proclivity for placing himself and his political objectives ahead of the people their constitution and their security it ought to give every american pause about exactly what this president might attempt to do were he given a second term in the meanwhile voters are still waiting for our intrepid press corps to demand of the president exactly what he intends to give the russians on missile defense that must be concealed from the american people until after he has been re elected it s time we put partisan differences aside and unite in defense of limited government and executive restraint we must put an end to the era of the imperial presidency in order to save america we must save the nation from president obama rep benjamin quayle is an arizona republican manage newsletters copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint
