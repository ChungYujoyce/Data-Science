with breaking news a gunman opened fire at a synagogue in the southern california on the last day of passover one person is dead and three are injured including an 8 year old girl it happened as president trump was headed to wisconsin for a political rally where he addressed the violence kevin corke has the latest from the white house kevin kevin corke correspondent chris the president forcefully condemned that attack and that suburban san diego synagogue just the latest assault on america aposs jewish community and that actually comes as the president aposs record on race is being questioned by one of his potential 2020 opponents begin videotape corke hours after a gunman opened fire at a synagogue in suburban san diego president trump denounced the attack at a campaign style rally in green bay trump we forcefully condemn the evil of anti semitism and hate corke his remarks coming a day after mr trump again defended his comments about quote very fine people on both sides when describing those who attended 2017 aposs racially charged protest in charlottesville virginia trump i was talking to people that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to robert e lee corke that defense prompted by former vice president joe biden aposs launch video for latest bid joe biden d presidential candidate the president of the united states assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it corke meanwhile for the further you know my third year in a row president trump skipped the annual white house correspondents dinner in washington choosing instead to roast his potential 2020 foes amid a sea of red hats in green bay trump can you imagine sleepy joe crazy bernie i think pocahontas she is finished she is out end videotape corke white house officials tell fox news that on the heels of that strong gdp report last week we should expect the president to turn his attention to trade this week pointing to the fact that the trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin are heading to beijing to ramp up trade negotiations chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks for that white house national security advisor john bolton is here to talk foreign policy but ambassador before we get to that i don apost want to ask about that terrible shooting near san diego last night what more if anything can you tell us about the shooter and any possible links to other groups or to other hate crimes john bolton national security adviser well it was an atrocious and utterly inexcusable action i think the president spoke very forcefully on it at this point we don apost know anything more than what law enforcement has already announced publicly we don apost see a connection to other groups it was a hate crime no doubt about it but the investigation will continue we aposll see what happens wallace all right ambassador bolton please stay with us the ambassador is here for an exclusive interview because there was foreign policy news this week on several fronts on friday we traveled to new york to sit down with iran aposs foreign minister and discuss his contention that what he calls the b team including mr mr bolton is trying to provoke a war between iran and the u s mr bolton agreed to join us to watch the interview and then respond we begin with javad zarif begin videotape wallace foreign minister zarif welcome to fox news sunday mohammad javad zarif iranian foreign minister good to be with you wallace you say there is a small group of american and mideast officials who are trying to steer president trump into a conflict with iran who and why zarif well i base my statement on their own statements mr netanyahu has said time and again that he encouraged president trump to designate iranian revolutionary guard as a terrorist organization he has said that he was the sole opposition to the jcpoa wallace the nuclear deal zarif the nuclear deal and he encouraged the united states to leave that deal mr bolton has said publicly before he became national security advisor in a rally that was organized by an iranian terrorist organization that was on the list of terror groups by the united states state department and mr bolton was on the payroll that he would celebrate the 40th anniversary of the islamic revolution in tehran with a terrorist organization he aposs on the record after receiving 50 000 from them to say that he has set it again as national security advisor wallace so you think it aposs israel bolton mohammed bin salman zarif saudi arabia and united arab emirates wallace all trying to exercise regime change zarif at least at least they want they have all shown an interest in and dragging the united states into a conflict i do not believe that president trump wants to do that i believe president trump ran on a campaign promise of not bringing the united states into another work but i believe president trump aposs intention to put pressure the policy of maximum pressure on iran in order to bring iran to its knees so that we would succumb to pressure is doomed to failure and i think these four individuals know this wallace the u s has just announced that it is ending waivers for countries five countries that were continuing to buy oil from iran do you see that as part of the effort to bring iran to its knees and do you have an understanding with the two buyers china and turkey that they aposre going to ignore the u s and continue to buy your oil zarif well the intention of the united states has put as much pressure as it can on the iranian people you know that we had huge floods that affected almost the entire country in the united states through its banking regulations prevented even iranian expatriates to assist their countrymen because they couldn apost send any money wallace what about oil zarif so it aposs a policy that is directed against iranian people they want to put iranian people under enough pressure and this is been said by both mr bolton as well as secretary pompeo that they want to put pressure on the iranian people so that they would take action against the government they are wrong in their analysis they are wrong in their hope and illusions it would put pressure on the iranian people the outcome of that pressure the consequence of that pressure is that it would make iranians more determined to resist that pressure on your second question nobody is happy with the fact that the united states is trying to impose its will on the rest of the international community you know that this is coercion pure and simple people are not happy china is not happy turkey is not happy russia is not happy france is not happy u s allies are not happy that this is happening and they say that they will find ways of resisting it how they will do it it aposs up to them and it aposs up to them looking at their own future whether they want to have their lives ruled by the united states wallace but mr foreign minister you make it sound as if iran is the victim in all of this president trump says that iran has been a bad actor for decades begin video clip trump iran aposs leaders sow chaos death and destruction they do not respect their neighbors or borders or the sovereign rights of nations end video clip wallace the irgc has killed more than 600 american soldiers in iraq iran spends almost a billion dollars a year supporting terrorist organizations like hezbollah and hamas and the u s says you are violating u n resolution 2231 in continuing to test ballistic missiles they say you aposre not the victim here you aposre the villain zarif first of all let aposs start from the last the united states is the country that left the nuclear deal 2231 is a resolution that has two annexes first annex is the entire jcpoa which president trump decided to withdraw from i don apost think that would put iran in the bad light and the united states in the good category of law abiding secondly 2231 aposs language on missiles is very clear it says that iran will not develop missiles that are designed to be capable of carrying nuclear weapons we do not design any of our missiles wallace but you just tried to launch a missile to put a satellite into space zarif yes crosstalk wallace they say that aposs a missile that aposs designed zarif it aposs designed to put a satellite into space wallace it also is a ballistic missile zarif no it aposs not it aposs a ballistic missile but it aposs not designed to carry a nuclear weapon and the security council resolution is very clear i negotiated it so i know what aposs in it president trump has hardly read that resolution so let aposs go to the second one irgc has never killed americans irgc is there to fight terrorism yesterday in iraq there was a commemoration of 300 irgc personnel who were killed alongside the iraqis in fighting isis president trump himself said during the debate i think it was the debate that you moderated that iran is killing isis in response to hillary clinton crosstalk wallace do you deny that you have provided weapons to pro iranian militia that end up in the death of 608 americans zarif i mean that aposs a new charge that the united states and it aposs a very dangerous accusation because i believe the b team wants to actually push the united states lure president trump into a confrontation that he doesn apost want now let aposs deal with the other issue you talk about money president trump himself has said that you spend 7 trillion in our region we are in our own region the united states came to our region spends 7 trillion and the only outcome of that was that we have more terror we have more insecurity we have more instability people in our region are making the determination that the presence of the united states is inherently destabilizing i think president trump agrees with that wallace when the moderates so called moderates like yourself and president rouhani took over the idea was you aposre going to have outreach to the west and iran aposs economy would benefit since the u s has pulled out of the iran nuclear deal iran aposs economy has gone into recession you try to resign in fact in february in large part we are told because you felt the hardliners were keeping you out of diplomacy here aposs my question are the so called moderates are you losing your struggle for power in iran to the hardliners and what happens if the hardliners take back control what will happen to u s relations zarif i think when president trump came to office there were a bigger purge of the people who worked in the national security council than there has ever been a purge in iran people have different views in iran and these different views are presented to the public and they vote for them they vote for moderates they vote for people with different views so that aposs the policy process but you should be used to i mean the difference between president crosstalk wallace there is a difference between the republicans and democrats between the moderates and hardliners are you losing to the hardliners zarif the point is engagement is not producing results in iran president trump has made sure that the people of iran would not believe in engagement we approached the international community in good faith we reached an agreement with the international community with the united states six other powers president trump just because he disliked president obama just left that agreement without having read it and people of iran started to feel and started to see that engagement does not have dividends that aposs a very bad message not only that you are sending to the people of iran but you aposre sending to the rest of the world that they should not rely on the signature of the president of the united states so it aposs just the message that the united states is not reliable maybe he believes in america first but america cannot be first in a globally insecure environment we all need to work together in a global environment that is safe and you can only live in a safe global environment if you respect yourself by respecting your signature wallace mr foreign minister thank you zarif good to be with you end videotape wallace and when we come back we aposll get reaction to the foreign minister in an exclusive interview with white house national security advisor john bolton only on fox news sunday commercial break wallace you just heard iran aposs top diplomat charge the president aposs national security advisor is working with key leaders in the middle east to bring about regime change in iran and joining us now to respond john bolton ambassador as you just heard foreign minister zarif says you aposre part of the b team a small group of leaders you in the u s others in the middle east bibi netanyahu bin salman bin zayed who are working to try to steer president trump into a conflict with iran your response john bolton national security adviser well he also said in another interview he wished he were working with the 18 you know in the past few days the north koreans have also called me dim sighted the cubans have said i aposm a pathological liar i say i aposve had a pretty good week wallace and your response to his allegation though that you and some middle east leaders are trying to foment a conflict between the u s and iran bolton you know it aposs completely ridiculous i think with that interview showed was a carefully prepared propaganda script by the iranians this is their effort to try and sow disinformation in the american body politic the fact is the president of foster aposs policy on the run has been clear while before i arrived in the administration it is to put maximum pressure on the regime to get it to change its behavior and i think it aposs working and i think that aposs what they aposre worried about wallace well zarif is right about one thing in 2017 as he said you did give a speech to mek an opposition group which at one point not now but at one point was listed as a terrorist group in which you talked about regime change in iran and celebrating in tehran with mek in 2019 this year which is the what 40th anniversary of the overthrow of the islamic revolution which raises the question do you really i know when pompeo was asked this secretary of state pompeo he also says no we really want behavior change do you think this regime is capable of behavior change bolton well i think we aposll have to see let me just say on mek do you know who took the mek off the u s list of foreign terrorist organizations hillary clinton that well known right wing republican look the fact is that the iranian regime continues to oppress its own people it continues to be the world aposs largest financer of international terrorism it continues to pursue ballistic missiles the only real purpose of which is to deliver nuclear weapons when they get that capability there aposs no doubt this regime is a threat in the region and globally and that aposs why we think the pressure campaign has had a significant impact on their ability to carry these tasks out if they want to get together and speak with the president he said almost exactly a year ago when french president emmanuel macron came to washington and he told him we were going to get out of the iran nuclear deal that he wanted to see our negotiation over all of these things the nuclear program the ballistic missile program the support for terrorism and iran aposs other malign behavior when they aposre ready to talk the president would be ready to talk wallace i understand all of that but honestly don apost you want to see regime change isn apost that the only way to get an iran that isn apost a threat to the neighborhood ph you just laid out a real deal in particular why it aposs such a bad actor in the region bolton yes well look the people of iran i think deserve a better government there aposs absolutely no doubt about it the trouble is it aposs not just a theological dictatorship it aposs the military dictatorship too that aposs a very difficult circumstance we aposll see what happens is the economic pressure continues to grow wallace well let aposs talk about the economic pressure because zarif says that despite the administration announcement this week that you are ending the waiver on five nations that were still buying oil from iran and that as of i guess it aposs may 2nd that the waiver is over the ban goes into effect he says that china and turkey are saying that they aposre going to continue to buy oil from iran bolton well we aposll see what happens i think it aposs been clear for a year now from the time president trump announced he was getting out of the iran deal that we were going to return to sanctions and impose pressure on the regime there and it aposs had a very significant effect and by iran aposs own estimates the end of these waivers will have an even more significant effect i aposm touched that zarif is worried that our allies are sometimes impatient with us on this point but as i say we aposve made clear our objective is the elimination of iran aposs nuclear program making sure it aposs ballistic missile program is under control europe is the region most threatened right now by iran aposs ballistic missile capabilities so we have worked for the past year that i aposve been in the administration very closely with all of our european allies and i think that glimmer of disagreement that zarif said is mostly in his own eye wallace well let me just ask you about that because at least publicly both turkey and china have said they are not going to be pushed around they aposre not going to be forced by the u s to stop buying oil have you gotten some kind of private insurance bolton look there have been statements by chinese companies that have been importing iranian oil that they are going to stop i met as did mike pompeo with the turkish foreign minister some weeks back who was already talking about the steps they were going to take to avoid buying iranian oil we aposll see how it plays out we made our position clear wallace ok let aposs turn to north korea president trump said friday said that talks to get north korea to fully denuclearize are still on track here he is begin video clip donald trump president i think there aposs a lot of excitement towards getting a deal done with north korea end video clip wallace but north korean leader kim jong un held a summit with russian president putin this week afterwards putin said that kim wants security guarantees for his regime not just from the u s but a bunch of other nations and that in terms of denuclearization that kim wants a step by step approach some denuclearization in return for some relief on sanctions are either of those acceptable to the u s bolton well the idea of taking one step on each side was what kim proposed in hanoi president trump responded with what he called the big deal to try and persuade kim jong un to walk through the door he had opened in singapore last year to a much brighter economic future for north korea that door is still open the president is still ready to have a third summit when the time is right wallace but the president ended up breaking off the summit because kim wouldn apost agree to much greater denuclearization is a step by step approach any more attractive to the president now bolton i think if you look at the past policies the answer to that is no the past policies that have tried a step by step approach have all failed kim or his father have gotten economic relief and then somehow have never gotten around to that commitment to denuclearize they aposve now made five times expressly in the past 25 years wallace all right putin also suggested a return to multilateral six party talks which is what the u s has been engaged in with north korea south korea china other countries in the region in the past would the president go along with that or does he still think one on one diplomacy with kim is the best approach bolton well i think he still looks for the possibility of a third summit with kim he feels pretty strongly about it he said repeatedly he thinks he has a good relationship with kim jong un and the six party approach failed in the past that doesn apost mean we don apost consult as the president just did on friday very closely with prime minister abe of japan we consult with the russians the chinese obviously the south koreans president moon jae in was here just a few weeks ago so it aposs not like they are excluded but i think it aposs not just what our preference is i think kim jong un at least up until now has wanted the one on one contact with the united states which is what he has gotten wallace do you think vladimir putin is being helpful in this process or do you think he aposs looking out for russia and trying to get them back into the conversation bolton i think vladimir putin always looks out for russia which is exactly what you would expect a russian leader to do and exactly what you would expect an american leader to do wallace is it being unhelpful though bolton well i think both russia and china could tighten up their enforcement of the sanctions i think they aposve been pretty good about it in recent months but i think they could always tighten up that would help keep the pressure on north korea which after all is what brought them to negotiate with president trump to begin with but i think president putin would love to see the possibility of a rail link between russia and south korea not north korea there aposs not much trade there but i think he sees advantages and i have no doubt he is pursuing them i think that aposs very typical of putin he knows exactly what rush aposs interests are and he goes after them wallace there was 0 i like to think i aposm pretty sophisticated but there was a shocking report even to me this week that before north korea released otto warmbier that they demanded that the u s pay 2 million for his medical care even though he seemed to suffer greatly once he was taken prisoner there here aposs what the president said about that begin video clip trump we did not pay money for our great otto there was no money paid there was a fake news report that money was paid end video clip wallace a few quick questions did north korea demand money for the release of otto warmbier bolton it appears that they did this occurred before i came into the administration but that aposs my understanding yes wallace did the u s official who was there to get him out of the country joseph yun did he sign a document pledging the money in order to get him out bolton that is what i aposm told yes wallace and i guess the bottom line question is did the u s pay any money to north korea however it was disguised after he was released bolton absolutely not and i think that aposs the key point the president has been very successful in getting for 20 plus hostages released from imprisonment around the world and hasn apost paid anything for any of them wallace so basically we signed the document fully intending not to honor it bolton well i don apost know the circumstances i think when people leave government sometimes their recollection of things that happened inside tend to be a little bit different from what actually happened but i it aposs very clear to me from my looking into it in the past few days no money was paid that is clear wallace ambassador bolton thank you thanks for coming in today always good to talk with you bolton glad to be with you wallace up next former vice president biden enters the race and takes off the gloves to go after president trump we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the democratic contest and how much the latest economic numbers will help the president in 2020 commercial break wallace coming up president trump says he will fight democrats over investigations in congress begin video clip trump we finish no collusion no obstruction right and then i get out the first day they are saying let aposs do it again and i said that aposs enough end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the high stakes subpoena battle commercial break begin video clip biden if we give donald trump eight years in the white house he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation who we are and i cannot stand by and watch that happen end video clip wallace presidential candidate joe biden in his announcement video warning of the dangers of a two term trump presidency and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove columnist for the hill juan williams former dnc chair donna brazile welcome to fox news sunday donna brazile contributor thanks chris and former republican congressman jason chaffetz well karl let me start with you what did you think what do you think of biden aposs rollout so far his message and the 6 3 million he raised in the first 24 hours which just slightly beat all of the other candidates in the democratic race karl rove contributor well i thought the message is emblematic of why in the six polls since march 20th he is leading president trump by an average of eight points it was a message where he was more conventional democrat and basically said to the people who are going to decide this selection american independent voters i aposm going to restore a sense of calm and normalcy to the white house on the other hand you know it was a good announcement we had the the the video we now do this all by video we all do this now by e mail the surprise was that he had access to the obama fundraising list and even though it is now ancient in internet times it aposs going on six years old he raised a bundle of money which was one of the questions see he the old fashioned bundler you know getting checks 2 800 is he going to be able to compete in an in an age in which you get 40 and 50 contributions over the internet and and that that played out having said that the polls say that he leads the democratic primary but the washington post abc poll had an interesting thing they said name a candidate you could before for for the democratic nomination for president and 54 percent couldn apost come up with a name which means this thing is wide open he starts the leader but this thing is wide open wallace well and in addition while he and bernie have 100 percent name recognition some of the other candidates have much less lower name recognition juan let me start pick up with you one big difference for biden i thought was while almost all of the other democrats got into the race and talked about their policies their plans for the future biden cast himself entirely as the alternative to trump and that they you can apost the country can apost take four more years of donald trump and he aposs the answer juan williams political analyst well electability aposs the number one issue for democrats who can beat trump and as karl just said the polls right now i think there was a hill harrisx ph poll this week had biden as the one candidate right now with the lead over trump it aposs way early but again that gives you a sense of why democrats might react positively to the idea and i think from from biden aposs perspective this type kind of takes him above the fray with other democrats the kind of you know intramural elbow throwing and says you know what let aposs focus on what really matters here the general election and i aposm the guy that can beat donald trump i will add this that donald trump this week came out and said sleepy joe he aposs not the sharpest drawer in the knife knife in a drawer right and you think to yourself well joe biden aposs been around i mean six terms in the senate vice president of the united states obviously good enough for barack obama to put on the ticket and win with and yet so these things aren apost true but i think that wallace and like that has that has stopped the president williams but but i think when charlottesville then when it comes to the video and he uses charlottesville effectively i think it aposs evidence that somebody smart aposs playing on the biden team because what we see is trump on the defensive having to defend robert e lee that aposs kind of tough wallace all right well biden was also on the defensive a bit and i want to talk about that because his first big tv appearance was on the view on friday and a lot of time was spent re litigating the 1991 clarence thomas anita hill hearing in which joe biden was the chairman of the senate judiciary committee here aposs a clip from the view begin video clip biden i am sorry she was treated the way she was treated i wish we could have figured out a better way to get this thing done if you go back and look what i said and didn apost say i i i don apost think i treated her badly end video clip wallace donna biden it turns out called anita hill earlier this month to talk about that event and she put out the fact that she was not satisfied with the conversation the surprise to me was that he didn apost call her for more than 25 years you would think he would have had made this call two decades ago instead of two weeks ago brazile well he understands that this is a far different democratic party than the party he first engaged at the presidential level in 1988 by the way we were on the same team with the dukakis campaign things have changed jason chaffetz contributor i aposve learned i aposve learned to read and write inaudible brazile that aposs right maybe you lost your spirit but that aposs ok but there aposs also a different party from the one that barack obama won in 2008 so joe biden has to run in lanes the lane that gives him a lot of momentum and resources as karl rove pointed out but also a lane that has a a a younger generation of americans and the me too movement matters in the democratic primary and the fact that he called anita hill professor hill and by the way she deserved to have her moment of truth but he must show that he has learned from that period of time if if not he aposs going to have a hard time not only galvanizing those in the middle of the democratic primary but also those on the left where all the energy is wallace congressman chaffetz some would argue that bien aposs entry was not the biggest political story this week that the biggest political story was the economic news and the fact that that growth in the first quarter for 2019 was 3 2 percent gdp growth much bigger than all the economists had had projected and that it seemed to really damp down talk about a recession in 2020 that those are very impressive numbers chaffetz they aposre impressive numbers and it aposs the best case for donald trump that the economy is zooming that people feel comfortable and more safe there are there are opportunities and jobs and job growth i mean the economy really is the strong point for donald trump you can do the tweets and all this other noise that are out there but when people feel good at home they aposre going to stick with the person who has the white house and when when when biden can apost even get somebody to come you know to a rally and donald trump is there in wisconsin with tens of thousands of people wallace he hasn apost had a rally yet what are you talking about chaffetz because i don apost think he can actually get a crowd and i think donald trump aposs magic has always been his ability to to galvanize wallace shouldn apost we wait and see what actually happens chaffetz in his first week he was going to you know that he was going to go to several places and he didn apost do that and for him to say that he called president obama and said please don apost endorse me i don apost think anybody aposs buying that wallace ok i just one last question on the economy we aposve got to move on juan exactly to the congressman aposs point if the economy stays this strong can anybody beat donald trump williams oh yes there aposs a wide road open it aposs and the reason is simple the stock market is doing great gdp is doing great as you just pointed out but that aposs for people who have money to invest for people who own companies big business remember the tax cut was supposed to be donald trump wallace inaudible 3 8 percent unemployment williams listen the reality is and you know jamie dimon at goldman sachs points out in a newsletter to shareholders this month that aposs something like 40 percent of americans don apost make more than 15 an hour economic anxiety among the middle class on housing issues student loans health care is tremendous so even as we talk about the economy booming for the very wealthy in this country the economic anxiety is opening the door to elizabeth warren saying here aposs how we deal with burdening the burden of student loan debt wallace ok williams here aposs how we deal with health care costs in the country wallace a lot easier to make that case if growth is 1 8 percent not 3 2 williams if your family aposs feeling it but if you a family and you aren apost feeling it you aposre anxious wallace we have to take a break here panel when we come back democrats keep investigating the president after the mueller report but mr trump says he aposs ready to take them to court commercial break begin video clip trump corruption at the highest level a disgrace spying surveillance trying for an overthrow and we caught them we caught them end video clip wallace president trump accusing his opponents of attempting a coup to overturn his victory in the 2016 election and we aposre back now with the panel karl i understand the president aposs outrage the russia investigation put a cloud over his presidency for the first two years and apparently there was no collusion but as a political matter does it make sense for him to keep hitting the mueller report as much as he did this past week or should he move on to other issues rove well count me in the move on category he aposs first of all he aposs never going to be able to fully move on because the democrats will not move on there are going to be investigations conducted by judiciary by intelligence by oversight by financial services we can watch all of those democrat chairman obscure any chance of the democrats having a positive message coming out of the house for 2020 and he aposs going to get drawn into that but but let aposs go back to the economy the president aposs doing well on the economy and not only is he doing well on the economy but in the new washington post abc poll six out of every ten independent say i aposm done with a whole impeachment thing so he aposs got a chance to use the economy to grab those people who look those independents who looked at the mueller report and concluded the president no collusion and and and and and no no effort no obstruction and let aposs go let aposs go pay attention to things that matter to my family and my community wallace donna i don apost usually ask you to give political advice to donald trump but the fact is this is an issue that does animate his base who feel very strongly that this was an attempted coup by the deep state brazile well since i aposve spent a lot of time dealing with this issue not just politically but emotionally because i became chair for the second time as a result of the hacking of of our democracy and so my advice to the president is acknowledge what happened and then begin to wallace well he said what do you mean acknowledge what happened he says it didn apost happen brazile acknowledge acknowledge the russians wallace ok brazile you know came after our wallace interference brazile our country and then spend the next 18 months helping to to defend our country against future attacks and make sure that this never happens again the the problem with the president is that he can apost turn the page because he aposs caught right in the middle of of one of the biggest historical blunders i think of all times and that is a foreign a hostile foreign country came after us and the president aposs sitting here thinking about himself and not the the country he took the oath to defend wallace but well wait wait i mean what about the argument that it was obama who failed to defend the country in 2016 he was president not donald trump brazile president obama of course went to mr putin during that summit in china and said stop it he also imposed sanctions rove i aposm sure that scared putin brazile no no he imposed sanctions rove i aposm really sure that scared putin yes no he changed immediately brazile he began to he he got the homeland security department to to wallace but it happened on his watch is my point brazile of course it happened on his watch because the russians were hell bent on attacking our country wallace ok i want to i want to move on because if the president isn apost too interested in moving on as karl pointed out neither are democrats who want to keep investigating the president who indicates he aposs going to fight every subpoena and take them to court here was some of that back and forth this week begin video clip trump we aposre fighting all the subpoenas look these aren apost like impartial people the democrats are trying to win 2020 rep elijah cummings d md it aposs impossible to hold him accountable if we don apost get any information and he aposs trampling on the constitution no doubt about it end video clip wallace congressman chaffetz i know you think that house democrats are playing politics here but the fact is that at some point maybe it will be apos21 maybe apos25 whenever there is going to be a president who aposs a democrat in the white house do you worry at all that by this president refusing every subpoena every request for a document every request for a witness that it does it aposs going to do damage to congressional oversight chaffetz well i used to chair that committee i issued dozens of subpoenas against president obama and his administration most were just viewed as suggestions little to no response so this is a new phenomenon for the democrats to take this position i do think the democrats in their quest this power grab have overstepped their hands to try to get don mcgahn the general counseling in to try to get stephen miller in wallace the white house counsel chaffetz the white house counsel yes to try to get them to come before the committee the president aposs clearly has executive privilege so they can flail about that but they aposre aiming at the wrong targets and they aposre overshooting their hand and they know they can apost win but they want the rhetorical point of say oh see we aposre trying to get these people to come before congress and they won apost you know darn well there aposs no general counsel for a president who aposs going to testify before congress wallace do you think that the president aposs stonewalled though as he said there i aposm going to fight all the subpoenas is that him overstepping chaffetz i no because i think the fight that you see within oversight trying to get the security chief to come in they issued a subpoena but the white house has signaled that they want him to come in involuntarily and there aposs a difference because if he comes in involuntarily he can have counsel with him but the oversight chairman has said no you can apost come in involuntarily you have to come in under subpoena wallace no no no they apparently have agreed now rove yes that aposs right wallace carl kline who is the white chaffetz but do you see how we started this wallace yes right chaffetz and wallace but carl let me just quickly say carl kline who is the white house personnel director and elijah cummings wants him in there to talk about the security clearances and they aposve now agreed he aposs going to come in voluntarily testify and that aposs going to be a transcribed interview chaffetz and i do think that that is a legitimate role of oversight but you can see how they first shot and they started with two weeks of stories out there saying well they won apost respond and you played a clip from elijah cummings but the reality is they aposre overshooting their hand they aposve got to shoot for the right folks and then there are legitimate things that you can do oversight on wallace where do you come down on this juan williams it aposs so clear that the law is on the congress apos side congress in the constitution of these united states is an equal branch of government and they have oversight responsibilities i aposm sitting next to congressman chaffetz who issued subpoenas and successfully got subpoenas from the u s justice department under eric holder on fast and furious in fact holder was chaffetz no we didn apost williams yes you did and later holder was held in contempt of congress for fight for fighting you chaffetz ten years after the fact williams but i aposm chaffetz congress still doesn apost have those documents williams oh stop but i aposm saying that what you get chaffetz it aposs true williams what you get here is a situation where the president says this is partisan this is a coup this is not legitimate but the law is very clear now he can try and slow walk this and just make it so difficult that they don apost get anything before the election cycle kicks in and the like but essentially what he is doing is undermining our democratic principles chaffetz no i think there is a legitimate role for oversight but if you aposre going to sight fast and furious they still don apost have those documents williams well i could cite benghazi lois lerner how many times you talk about partisan chaffetz you don apost think those were legitimate investigations williams no i this is much more legitimate are you kidding me chaffetz people died in those cases williams that was no all i aposm saying to you is that was partisan that aposs the definition of a partisan attack and this is not wallace well to end any discussion of partisanship let aposs bring in karl rove no but i do want to i do want to ask you this because you actually had to deal with these issues inside the white house in bush 43 what aposs the right answer here rove once again i aposm forced to set the record straight that it is try an attempt by juan to establish it look the president aposs going to win some of these issues he aposs going to lose some of these issues he aposs going to win it when they have as jason pointed out overreach by trying to get people in the white house staff but this is all going to be litigated out and the belief that the president is doing something unconstitutional or antidemocratic by saying no no no i aposm not going to respond to these and agree to do all of these he aposs got a right to object and let aposs resolve this in the courts let aposs lower the temperature the president is not doing anything unconstitutional the congress is not doing anything unconstitutional but the the constant pressure between the two branches is going to be litigated out in court where it belongs wallace but but when you talk about litigating it out in court that aposs going to just push it past 2020 rove it it may or may not in all likelihood these things are going to be resolved quickly one way or the other quickly in in meaning meaning in a matter of months not a matter of years brazile but meanwhile the attorney general has gone up to capitol hill this week hopefully mr mueller will go up at some point that is going to give congress i think enough information for them to figure out if this should go further wallace interestingly enough bill barr the attorney general says he won apost testify before house judiciary because jerry nadler is setting groundless which we don apost quite understand yet and he says i aposm not going to go talk to them if those of the ground rules so to be continued this panel will not however be continued see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the master guitar maker who may have invented the latest in spy technology commercial break wallace it aposs not easy to have fans ranging from world famous musicians to a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff it takes someone special like our power player of the week begin videotape paul reed smith founder prs guitars and digital harmonic i aposm rotating parts in my head graphically like a video game and the entire thing with digital harmonics is all math and it was all invented graphically wallace voice over paul reed smith is explaining the remarkable work he does in two different worlds guitars and high tech he aposs a big success at both wallace on camera everyone from carlos santana to u s special operations command wants your products why smith they need a tool to do a job so they can have clarity to make good decisions it aposs the same thing it aposs a tool to do a job wallace voice over let aposs start with guitars because that aposs where smith started prs is now the third biggest electric guitar manufacturer in the u s behind only fender and gibson he showed us one of his top end models wallace on camera don apost wreck your guitar smith i aposm not wrecking anything i aposm not wrecking anything look how beautiful this is wallace oh my oh my smith so when it gets it it aposs clear coated it almost explodes with color wallace voice over smith not only makes them he plays them wallace on camera you aposre telling me that aposs mathematics smith look it aposs art and math mixed and and woodworking and spraying and finishing but for me i aposm rotating the part in my head i can see it wallace voice over which brings us to the second part of our story almost 20 years ago smith and his father who was a retired navy mathematician were working on a synthesizer that turns digital data into sound they discovered they could make it do a lot more than that amplifying information you can apost hear or see smith so here aposs an x ray that aposs done with low radiation it aposs very very hazy all right and we were able to dig the information out of that file so that doctors can see what aposs going on in there and here it is wallace on camera now i can see smith because of our math wallace voice over smith set up digital harmonic in 2015 it now has almost 100 registered and pending trademarks and almost two dozen patents and they keep testing its limits smith for example we sent up a drone at night ok and then we are putting it through the algorithm machine learning is deciding what to do with this thing wallace on camera whoa smith and you can see detailed you just can apost see her the fascinating part for me is it aposs in color it aposs not in black and white wallace well the fascinating thing for me is you can see houses here that you didn apost know existed smith the trees and cars and all kinds of things that aren apost there wallace voice over if you still don apost understand how it works don apost worry neither did i wallace on camera how can the computer see it smith because it looks at all the numbers and says oh that one aposs higher wallace so it aposs math smith it aposs math it aposs graphic math it aposs almost like tic tac toe and chess wallace is it fair to say that the u s military and the intelligence community are interested in what you do smith i think the intelligence community is very interested wallace voice over which brings up one final question wallace on camera which is more satisfying for you the music or the high tech smith that aposs not fair you watching carlos santana play on stage playing a prs sorry that aposs good i aposm looking at information that i know no one aposs ever seen before that aposs good too you
