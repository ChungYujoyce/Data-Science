apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap truth often takes a beating when president donald trump talks about his administration s response to the coronavirus and the subsequent death toll in the u s this past week was no exception over the weekend the president claimed strong marks for himself for the handling of the pandemic after imposing a very early ban of people from china it actually wasn t a total ban and had plenty of gaps in containment one of the government s top health officials has described the china restrictions as too little too late trump also asserted that the united states is on par with germany in keeping down covid 19 deaths which is not the case in mortality reports and he s brushed off projections that deaths in his country will double from earlier forecasts misrepresenting how the numbers were calculated top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches these distortions emerged over the past week alongside his relentless bragging about the u s testing system which failed in the crucial early weeks and remains globally subpar a look at trump s remarks also covering his former national security adviser michael flynn travel restrictions trump we are getting great marks for the handling of the coronavirus pandemic especially the very early ban of people from china the infectious source entering the usa tweet sunday the facts this is one of trump s favorite exaggerations asserting that travel restrictions he imposed on china in late january had averted much of the virus entry into the u s in fact trump didn t ban all the people infected with coronavirus from entering the u s from china there were many gaps in containment and initial delays in testing leading to the u s rising to no 1 globally in the number of people infected by covid 19 his order temporarily barred entry by foreign nationals who had traveled in china within the previous 14 days with exceptions for the immediate family of u s citizens and permanent residents as well as american citizens in addition dr anne schuchat the no 2 official at the u s centers for disease control and prevention told the associated press earlier this month the federal government was slow to understand how much coronavirus was spreading from europe which helped drive the acceleration of outbreaks across the u s in late february trump didn t announce travel restrictions for many european countries until mid march the extensive travel from europe once europe was having outbreaks really accelerated our importations and the rapid spread she told the ap i think the timing of our travel alerts should have been earlier trump compare that to the obama sleepy joe disaster known as h1n1 swine flu poor marks didn t have a clue tweet sunday the facts his suggestion that former president barack obama and his vice president joe biden were oblivious and did nothing during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic initially called swine flu is wrong then the centers for disease control and prevention s flu surveillance network actually sounded the alarm spotting two children in california who were the first diagnosed cases of the new flu strain about two weeks later the obama administration declared a public health emergency and cdc began releasing anti flu drugs from the national stockpile to help hospitals get ready in contrast trump declared a state of emergency in early march seven weeks after the first u s case of covid 19 was announced death counts trump on pandemic deaths now germany we re very close to germany we have a very good relationship with germany germany has done very good they have a very low mortality rate like we do we have a low mortality rate also remarks thursday in meeting with gov greg abbott r texas the facts the u s is not in germany s league in this regard the u s is experiencing far more reported covid 19 deaths as a proportion of its population than is germany the u s has reported covid 19 deaths at a rate of 234 per 1 million people for germany that rate is 90 deaths per million the u s surpasses many other countries in reported deaths per million too and it leads the world in deaths from the virus overall because countries track covid 19 deaths somewhat differently exact conclusions can t be reached when comparing nations the mortality rate is a different measure from deaths per million it refers to what percentage of people who get the disease die from it the answer is as yet unknown and there are several reasons for that first the count changes every day as new infections and deaths are recorded more important every country is testing differently knowing the real denominator the true number of people who become infected is key to determining what portion of them die some countries the u s among them have had trouble making enough tests available a test shortage means the sickest get tested first even with a good supply of tests someone who s otherwise healthy and has mild symptoms may not be tested and thus go uncounted trump and frankly if you took new york out of the equation we would really have a low mortality rate remarks with abbott the facts new york being part of the u s cannot be subtracted from it to make the numbers look better it s true that new york has experienced far more covid 19 deaths than has any other state trump asked about a white house endorsed model showing 134 000 deaths from the coronavirus by august doubling its previous prediction those projections are with no mitigation we are doing mitigation remarks to reporters tuesday the facts that s incorrect the projections last monday by the institute for health metrics and evaluation do take into account social distancing and other mitigation which have begun to be loosened in several states at trump s urging on sunday the institute revised its estimates upward again to 137 000 the institute based at the university of washington said both sets of estimates reflect the recent reopening of many states and relaxing of social distancing restrictions its initial estimates assumed longer stay at home orders lasting through may what s driving the change is simply put the rise in mobility dr christopher murray the institute s director told cbs face the nation on sunday we re seeing in some states you know a 20 percentage point increase in just 10 days in mobility and that will translate into more human contact more transmission more than 30 states have taken steps this month to ease stay at home orders our model now assumes that mandates that are currently still in place and have not been scheduled to be relaxed will stay in place through at least august 4 the institute said on its website officials on the white house coronavirus task force have praised the institute s work and cited its research in their briefings flynn trump on the justice department s move to drop the criminal case against former national security adviser michael flynn he was targeted by the obama administration and he was targeted in order to try and take down a president and what they ve done is a disgrace remarks thursday the facts he s suggesting partisan democratic politics were completely behind flynn s investigation that isn t so it is true that the investigation into ties between russia and the trump campaign and into russia in particular began during the obama administration but it continued well into trump s own administration the investigation into flynn was taken over by a special counsel who was appointed by rod rosenstein trump s own deputy attorney general the internal fbi correspondence that has emerged in the last two weeks also doesn t reveal agents saying that the goal of the investigation was to take down a president virus testing trump in any event we have great testing capacity and have performed 6 5 million tests which is more than every country in the world combined tweet on may 4 the facts the claim that the u s has performed tests more than every country in the world combined was not remotely true when he said it and it s no closer to the truth now the u s has tested far fewer than all other countries combined it also lags dozens of countries in testing its population proportionally together just three countries russia germany and italy had reported more tests than the u s when trump tweeted that remains the case as of late friday the u s had reported conducting more than 8 3 million tests since the pandemic began that compared with more than 18 7 million tests by the other countries in the top 10 of the testing count the u s was followed by russia germany italy spain britain india france turkey and united arab emirates children covid 19 trump with young children and children we d like to see the schools open early next season and on time it s incredible how the it s very unique how the children aren t affected but people that have problems and older people are can be very badly hurt injured or die from this problem remarks with native american leaders tuesday in phoenix trump you see how well children seem to do it s incredible we realize how strong children are right remarks with nurses wednesday trump it affects older people it infects if you have any problem heart diabetes even a little weak heart a little diabetes a little this thing is vicious and it can take you out and it can take you out very strongly but children do very well remarks may 3 on fox news the facts his suggestion that children are in the clear is false to say they do very well with the disease is more accurate based on what is known so far his implication that the risk is limited to the old and sick is incorrect it s true kids get sick less often than do adults and tend to be less ill when they do get sick but his statements overlook severe covid 19 illnesses and at least several deaths of children in the u s and they gloss over the fact that kids can spread disease without showing symptoms themselves the centers for disease control and prevention studied the pandemic s effect on different ages in the u s early on and reviewed preliminary research in china where the coronavirus started it said social distancing is important for children too for their own safety and that of others whereas most covid 19 cases in children are not severe serious covid 19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group the cdc study says at the beginning of april the cdc analyzed nearly 150 000 laboratory confirmed u s covid 19 cases and found nearly 2 600 children with the disease since then the number of confirmed cases overall in the u s has rocketed making the april findings very preliminary the pediatric cases that were found at the time though relatively few spanned all ages of childhood the median age of children sick with covid 19 was 11 more than 5 perhaps as many as 20 required hospitalization people 18 to 64 were by far the largest age group sickened by the virus 76 of the confirmed cases studied by the cdc covid 19 was not and is not limited to the oldest people even if they are the most vulnerable age group associated press writers eric tucker lauran neergaard and meghan hoyer
