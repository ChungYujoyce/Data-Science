year investigation into trump s campaign is over it s being transformed into a rallying cry and a weapon for the president s re election campaign the pall of the two year probe lifted sunday when attorney general william barr released a summary of mueller s findings that said the wide ranging investigation found no evidence of collusion by trump s 2016 campaign with the russian government barr

oval office next to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu those people will certainly be looked at even before mueller s conclusions were revealed it was clear that trump saw the end of the investigation as a political opportunity as the president s lawyers debated legal strategy trump aides and political allies developed a plan to turn the end of the probe into the launching pad for a new round of attacks on the president s foes and a moment to reinvigorate his supporters in the run up to the 2020 campaign trump surrogates rushed to take a victory lap depict the probe as a failed coup and rub the results in the face of democrats many of whom had spent months promising that mueller would turn up more you ve made a great victim of donald trump here trump counsellor kellyanne conway said monday morning trump s campaign moved quickly to raise money off the mueller news with a text message to supporters stating dems raised millions off a lie now we fight back the team s plans going forward are more expansive according to seven aides and allies involved with the effort most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private deliberations while trump s base has long been suspicious of mueller the president s team believes independents and moderate democrats who backed him in the last election but have since soured may return to the fold if convinced he was unfairly targeted some republicans who had mused about a primary challenge to trump if mueller returned a smoking gun may now stay on the sidelines

changed former massachusetts gov bill weld though said monday in new hampshire that i wasn t really counting on the president getting caught in the soup and was still considering a bid major talking points for democrats who had pinned great hopes on mueller may have vanished and some swing voters wary at the prospect of endless investigations and talk of impeachment may prove more sympathetic to the president the president and his allies will now link the report with the investigations launched by house democrats and try to make the case that in the wake of mueller s findings further probes are partisan overreach i think they can t move forward until they apologize trump lawyer rudy giuliani told the associated press he singled out rep adam schiff chairman of the house intelligence committee and said the congressman s investigation would have no credibility because he had deemed trump treasonous and promised clear evidence of collusion that didn t materialize if there are people who contrived this investigation who made up this collusion maybe they themselves should be investigated giuliani said sen lindsey graham r s c echoed that sentiment making clear that republicans

had claimed on their networks that there had been evidence of collusion with russia at this point there must be introspection from the media who facilitated the reckless statements and a serious evaluation of how such guests are considered and handled in the future murtaugh wrote democrats have pointed out that mueller found evidence for and against obstruction and have demanded to see his full report the president s allies also intend to use the moment to heighten attacks on the media which many trump supporters believe unjustly fanned the flames of the special counsel s probe in an effort to bring down the president they aim to highlight specific news organizations and in some cases individual reporters and paint them as biased and untrustworthy according to two presidential
