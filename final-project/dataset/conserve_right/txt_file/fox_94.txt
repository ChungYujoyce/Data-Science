player of the week exiled iranian journalist masih alinejad this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday october 13 2019 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace there are now reports turkish backed forces are executing kurdish fighters and civilians while president trump declares he is an island of one for pulling back u s troops in northern syria begin videotape donald trump president the kurds are tending to leave and that aposs good let them have their borders but i don apost think our soldiers should be there for the next 50 years regarding a border wallace the president aposs move opens the way for turkish forces to launch an assault against the kurds the key american ally in the fight against isis mark esper defense secretary we have not abandoned them nobody green lighted this operation by turkey just the opposite we pushed back very hard at all levels wallace we aposll discuss the fallout with secretary of defense mark esper live in his first sunday show appearance and we aposll discuss the bipartisan push to punish turkey for its actions with senator chris van hollen then democrats launch a new impeachment offensive after the white house refuses to cooperate trump they know they can apost win the 2020 election so they are pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the latest developments and where are prospects for impeachment stand now and our power player of the week an exiled journalist fighting for women aposs rights back in her homeland unidentified female i had two options to stay in iran and keep silent or leave iran and be loud wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington there are now reports turkish backed militias are committing atrocities against the kurds as part of the turkish invasion of northern syria eyewitnesses backed up by videos say militias are executing kurdish fighters and civilians and there is also evidence the turks are hitting prisons holding thousands of isis fighters allowing some to escape in a moment we aposll talk with the secretary of defense mark esper but first let aposs get the latest from steve harrigan who is live inside syria steve steve harrigan correspondent chris reports of those possible atrocities are spreading like wildfire here across syria and when you cross over the border you can really just sense people aposs fear i heard a kurdish official tell a journalist you aposre never going to find a driver to take you around at that price not with all the bombs falling from the sky not with what they aposre doing to people some disturbing video emerging of what may be fox has been unable to verify its authenticity a turkish backed arab militia fighter executing a kurdish fighter along the side of the road as the fighter shoots the kurd he shouts feel me feel me there are also reports denied by the turkish backed era militia that they have assassinated a female kurdish political party leader once again the turks denying that as far as the bigger picture here goes we are in day five of this military offensive no sign of a slowdown turkey aposs president erdogan pushing ahead with military action from the sky and from shelling you can see plumes of smoke rise up from those towns as far as the action goes on the ground they aposve taken control of a major city in syria they aposve taken control of major highways too so the kurdish fighters are in real danger of being cut off from each other this despite worldwide criticism of turkey aposs operation there aposs a real concern among a number of world leaders that this operation could lead to the resurgence of the islamic state in this area kurdish officials say they can apost fight the turkish army and guard isis prisoners at the same time they say more than 700 isis supporters escaped from a camp just this weekend as far as the u s position goes they have threatened sanctions but not enforced any financial sanctions as of yet the kurds some leaders say they are deeply disappointed in the u s they feel like an ally has stabbed them in the back others still hope for a u s no fly zone chris back to you wallace steve harrigan reporting live from syria steve thank you joining us now the secretary of defense mark esper for his first sunday show appearance mr secretary welcome to fox news sunday mark esper secretary of defense chris thank you for having me on today wallace i have to assume you aposre just as distressed as i am by hearing steve harrigan aposs reports stories that turkish backed militias are executing civilians and kurdish fighters reports that the turks are hitting prisons and that hundreds of either isis fighters or their supporters are escaping how much of that can you confirm esper it aposs terrible i aposve heard the same reports it gets worse by the hour chris these are all the exact things that we have communicated to president erdogan and his ministers i spoke to my counterpart a few days ago i sent him a memo on friday night a formal response warned them that if they do this incursion which we oppose we will see everything from the release of isis prisoners to humanitarian catastrophe it will damage u s relations with turkey their staying in nato all of this is playing out exactly as we predicted and we again urge president erdogan to stop and go back to the status quo ante wallace so what is the u s what is the pentagon as the primary the military force there what are you going to do about it what are you going to do to stop this esper well this is part of the terrible situation that turkey has put us in and again despite our protestations we now know we believe that the turks now intend to go further south than originally expected and to go both west and east which would increase their zone from beyond a 30 kilometer depth and nearly 440 kilometers wide at the same time we aposve learned in the last 24 hours that it looks like the sdf is cutting a deal with the syrians and russians wallace yes we should say sdf does or the esper syrian forces ph wallace syrian democracy forces esper defense forces that aposs right they aposre cutting a deal and now what we aposre facing is u s forces in a trapped between a syrian russian army moving north to take on the turkish army that is moving south it puts us in a terrible position and the protection and safety of our service members comes first to me i spoke with the national security team yesterday we all talked on the phone i talked to the president and he is concerned and so last night he directed that we begin a deliberate withdraw of u s forces from the northern part of syria wallace now how many people are we talking about how quickly are they going to move out esper we aposre talking less than a thousand i can apost give you a timeline because it changes hourly we want to make sure that we do so in a very safe deliberate manner that we de conflict things as we go with our with those folks on the ground in the immediate area wallace but i aposm not quite sure i understand so the turks and their militias are committing atrocities against the kurds who are our allies the kurds are asking us for help but we aposre going to pull out and allow the kurds to go to the russians and the syrians that doesn apost seem to make much sense esper well look the united states first of all doesn apost have the forces on hand to stop and invasion of turkey that is 15 000 strong if you will proceeded by airstrikes and artillery and mechanized forces you got to keep in mind too that look we didn apost sign up to fight turkey a longstanding nato ally on behalf of the sdf again this is a terrible situation that aposs why in the little over two months that i aposve been on the job this has probably been the number one issue that i aposve dealt with week after week with our turkish counterparts we aposve done everything we can to dissuade them from doing this we will we thought we were making very good progress on the so called safety zone in northern syria a way to keep the forces separated and to ensure we can keep both these good partners at odds ends but as you know chris this conflict has its roots that goes back 200 years and in fact in the in the last few years since we began this relationship with the with the kurds to take on isis the turks protested it from the beginning this is now their third incursion into syria in the last few years to do this wallace but you emphasized on friday that we stand by our kurdish allies who fought with us died 11 000 of them died in the fight against isis here you are sir on friday begin video clip esper we have not abandoned the kurds now let me be clear about that we have not abandoned them nobody greenlighted this operation by turkey just the opposite we push back very hard at all levels for the turks not to commence this operation end video clip wallace but secretary esper the u s had 50 special operations forces along the border acting as a tripwire if you will to keep the turks from coming across the border we were their protection for the kurds after president trump talked to president erdogan last sunday president trump decided to pull those troops out and the turks invaded isn apost that the definition of abandoning the kurds esper yes i think you got the sequencing in the reverse order the first thing that we understood i aposve understood from my counterpart secretary pompeo from his and certainly from president erdogan is they were fully committed to doing this regardless of what we did we thought it was prudent it was my recommendation i know the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff agreed as well we should not put u s forces in between a turkish advance we aposre talking less than 50 more like two dozen there is no way they could stop 15 000 turks from proceeding south wallace but you had talked to the your counterpart the turkish defense minister several days before the presidential phone call and you had said to him make let aposs make the safety zone work where the turks and u s work together to keep this border and keep the turks on one side of the border and the kurds on the other side of the border then the president has his phone call with president erdogan and you say well there aposs nothing we can do one did erdogan say i aposm going to come in anyway yes or no esper the it was clear to me that president erdogan was committed to coming in he informed us that he was coming in he didn apost ask permission he it was clear to me that he was coming in wallace but do you think that with 50 u s troops on the border acting as a tripwire and with u s complete air superiority over the border do you really believe that president erdogan and the turks were going to just come through the border perhaps create a conflict with the united states if we had stood firm esper well i think it aposs how you define standing firm first of all as i said 50 service members are not going to stop a turkish advance and i aposm not one to wallace but wait ph esper well let me finish to classify them as a trip wire and sacrifice them if you will wallace well you only sacrifice them if turkey goes ahead sir if turkey says you know we aposre not going to take on the u s we aposre not going to take on u s fighters overhead maybe we would aposve stopped them esper i don apost believe so i think they were fully committed that was what i took from my conversations with my counterpart the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff took from his secretary pompeo form his look the fact is also chris we are not going to go to war another war in the middle east against turkey which is a longstanding nato ally that has fought alongside us from korea all the way through afghanistan that aposs not what we signed up for wallace well do they seem like much of an ally now turkey esper no i think turkey the arch of their behavior over the past several years has been terrible i mean they are spinning out of the western orbit if you will we see them purchasing russian arms culling up to president putin we see them doing all these things that frankly concern us that with regard to the direction they are heading wallace but you say they it concerns us the reaction is that the president is going to pull all of our troops out of that region and although he has talked about sanctions and authorized secretary mnuchin to impose sanctions there aposs been no action esper well we aposll what happens you know like i said this all these developments have happened in the last 24 actually more like the last 14 hours if you will the national security team will be talking today about it we still have been holding out hope that we can get to erdogan and tell him to stop what he aposs doing return to the border and let aposs work on the safety zone the mechanism those talks are still by the way underway right now we want to get to that point and settle this situation now and stabilize it so we can get back on the right path wallace and meanwhile what do you say to the head of the sdf our allies the people who fought and died to help us beat isis mazlum kobane abdi the head of the kurdish army said today you are leaving us to be slaughtered what do you say to him sir esper i would say what we aposve been saying because we stay in contact with him we are doing everything we can to get the turks to stop this egregious behavior get them to go back across the line and stop and that aposs our message to them at this point in time wallace president trump says that he is just keeping a campaign promise here he is begin video clip trump we want to bring our troops back home and i got elected on that if you go back and look at our speeches i would say we want to bring our troops back home from these endless wars end video clip wallace but while we are in the process of pulling troops at least back in syria maybe not out of syria though the president has talked about that you just announced on friday the president is going to send another 1 800 troops into saudi arabia so are we trying to get out of the middle east are we trying to get out of endless wars or not esper well we do have the aspiration to relocate our forces to move back in certain regions of the world so that we can reposition them to deal with the real strategic challenges we face that is number one china and number two russia in this case with iran we know that their malign behavior over the last 40 years continues to create instability throughout the entire middle east to include northern syria so in that regard we want to make sure that we have sufficient forces on the ground first to help defend our partners saudi arabia and the uae and secondly to deter further iranian provocative behavior that could lead to a conflict we are not looking to a conflict in the middle east and not with iran but as i said to them they should not mistake our restraint for weakness if they do and do something that would strike our interests of our allies we will respond wallace i got two minutes left i aposm going to ask you two questions about i aposm sure a subject you aposre dying to talk about which is impeachment house democrats have subpoenaed you personally that you as the secretary of defense turn over all documents related to decisions being made about authorization and then the decision to withhold military aide to ukraine will you comply by the deadline to for the house subpoena which is this tuesday two days from today esper well you know we will do everything we can to respond to their inquiry chris my general counsel a week or two ago sent out a note as we often do in these situations to the key members in the pentagon to say retain your documents and institute other controls so again we will respond as we can wallace you say we will respond as we can you aposre not making a firm commitment that you will meet the deadline of tuesday esper well i don apost know i don apost know the status of what that document preparation is i don apost know what restrictions we may have internally with regard to releasing them the white house has a say on the release of documents as well there are a number of things that play into this wallace finally last may the president aposs phone call with zelensky was in july but last may two months before the undersecretary of defense certified to congress that ukraine had made major efforts in fighting corruption and certified to congress that the pentagon was in fact going to release all military aide that had been approved by congress to the ukrainians did president trump ever explain to you why he had decided to go against the pentagon aposs decision and to hold up the aide esper chris i have nothing to share with you on this as you know i came into office in late july and since that time as we looked at this issue periodically the dod aposs focus has been on three things what is the importance the value of the aide to ukraine to deter russian behavior defend themselves number two are they making progress on corruption which is of keen interest to the congress and then number three how are we getting other nato allies european partners to also help assist the ukrainians the key point is this we got most of the money out on time as required and at no point in time was u s national security harmed wallace secretary esper thank you thanks for coming in please come back sir esper thank you chris wallace up next the fallout from president trump aposs decision to pull out u s troops in a bipartisan measure that would be a major rebuke of the president aposs policies in syria commercial break wallace president trump is facing a fierce backlash from both republicans and democrats over his decision to pull u s troops from the syrian border allowing turkey to attack our kurdish allies there this week when congress returns from recess lawmakers plan to take up a bipartisan bill that would slap tough sanctions on turkey joining me now democratic senator chris van hollen who has written that bill along with republican lindsey graham senator you just heard secretary esper talking about the fact that the president has ordered him to pull u s troops all of the u s troops out of northern syria basically to leave the kurds on their own and that we understand that they have made a deal cut a deal the kurds have with assad aposs forces in syria and the russians and they aposre going to go them for protection against the turks your reaction sen chris van hollen d md well chris what we aposre seeing on the ground right now is absolutely sickening it aposs absolutely shameful that president trump allowed turkey to begin killing the syrian kurds who are our allies in the fight against isis and that aposs why you have this big bipartisan uproar you have isis right now being the big winner because the syrian kurds were our most effective partner in going after isis now they aposre going to have a comeback that aposs what secretary mattis former secretary of defense just said you just heard the current secretary of defense essentially say the trump administration is doing nothing they aposre asking turkey oh please please stop what you aposre doing that is nothing so that aposs why you aposre going to see a strong bipartisan response from the congress first of all we want to insist that president trump actually step up and do something he said he was going to destroy the turkish economy if erdogan did this kind of thing and yet he aposs doing absolutely nothing if fact this administration sided with russia and opposed a resolution at the united nations security council a statement condemning turkey aposs actions so congress is going to first call upon the president to do the right thing but we since we can apost count on that we will have this bipartisan legislation that will impose very stiff sanctions on turkey until they stop their aggression and withdraw their forces wallace now treasury secretary mnuchin on friday said that president trump had authorized him not that he had imposed but authorized him at some point to impose tough sanctions on against turkey here is the secretary of this treasury begin video clip steve mnuchin treasury secretary these are very powerful sanctions we hope we don apost have to use them but we can shut down the turkish economy if we need to end video clip wallace so i guess the question is when are they going to do that van hollen for god sakes what are they waiting for right people are being killed right now our syrian kurdish allies are being killed right now it looks like many of the isis detainees there are about 10 000 fighters are now possibly going to be able to escape there are reports this morning that isis sympathizers have already escaped thousands of them and here you have secretary mnuchin saying oh well we aposll think about it maybe we aposll do something president trump tweeting that he aposs going to destroy their economy they look ridiculous right now so that aposs why it aposs important that the congress move forward on this front i don apost know what this administration aposs waiting for all they aposre doing is talking while people are being killed wallace so let aposs talk about you and lindsay graham a pretty staunch democrat and a very staunch republican are writing putting together your own set of sanctions but as we say while this is going on and i understand you aposre the congress comes back from recess tomorrow the kurds are being slaughtered as you say isis supporters and fighters are leaving have you gotten a commitment form senate majority leader mitch mcconnell one that he is going to take this up and two schedule it for a quick vote because the longer you wait the longer the turks are there to do their worst in northern syria van hollen well you aposre right chris we believe momentum is building for the congress to act since this president has shown a total unwillingness to do something in the face of this slaughter you aposre already seeing bipartisan movement in the senate the bill you discussed you aposre also seeing bipartisan legislation in the house coming together so the key is to act quickly as you say time is of the essence but you know when congress wants to act quickly it can so the senate could take this bill up pass it send it to the house and then send it to the president aposs deck the president who said he wanted to destroy the turkish economy if they did this kind of thing and so we need to move very quickly because wallace but have you gotten any commitment from mitch mcconnell that they are going to move quickly van hollen to my knowledge mitch mcconnell has not yet committed to that which is why it aposs very important that members of the senate on a bipartisan basis call upon him to do that i do understand that in the house you have a strong bipartisan group also pushing for sanctions because everyday that it goes on isis s the winner i mean these are the guys who pose the biggest terrorist threat to the united states in the world they aposre celebrating what aposs happening here and so i do believe congress will muster the bipartisan will to do something quickly wallace i want to ask you two quick questions in the time we have left about the other big story in washington which is impeachment you have now since the zelensky phone call rough transcript was released you have now called for supported the house impeachment inquiry from what you have seen so far do you believe that there is sufficient evidence that the president should be removed from office van hollen well chris what we aposve seen from this president in that transcript and other actions is a president who was abusing his power using the power of the office of the presidency to try to get a foreign government the ukraine to interfere on his behalf in an american election and the evidence is also mounting that he withheld vital u s military assistance to ukraine that they need to stop russian aggression in my view that is an impeachable offense but but the hearings will have to collect the evidence and the president and the white house will have an opportunity to put forward any exculpatory evidence they want so i won apost reach any final conclusion until all the evidence is in but the evidence that is in is very damming of the president aposs actions wallace and finally van hollen so and the fact that they refuse the fact chris that they refused to present the information you asked the secretary about documents about the ukraine arms sales the fact that they refused to present more information suggests that they don apost have any exculpatory evidence wallace and very briefly even if all 47 democrats were in the senate to vote to remove the president you would still need 20 republicans to get to the super majority of 67 at this point and again briefly do you see any chance that 20 republicans are going to jump ship senate republicans jump ship on the president and vote to remove him van hollen chris i aposm not going to prejudge anything because there aposs still a lot of evidence to come in the evidence about this administration withholding very important military assistance to ukraine while the president tried through is lawyer giuliani and others to try to get ukraine to interfere on president trump aposs behalf in an election as that evidence comes in i hope people will take a very close look at it and ask themselves what would they have been doing and saying if president obama had done something like that wallace senator van hollen thank you thanks for your time today van hollen thank you wallace always good to talk with you sir van hollen you too wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the split between president trump and congressional republicans over the turkish offensive against the kurds plus what would you like to ask the panel about the president aposs decision to pull back the troops in syria just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up as turkey invades syria president trump defends his decision to pull u s troops from the border begin video clip trump we don apost have any soldiers there because we left we won we left take a victory united states end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what it all means for stability in the region commercial break begin video clip donald trump president we had a big victory we left the area i don apost think the american people want to see us go back in with our military go back into that area again sen lindsey graham r s c i know that every military person has told him don apost do this and this is the pre 9 11 mentality that paved the way for 9 11 end video clip wallace president trump aposs staunch supporter senator lindsey graham breaking with the president over his decision to pull back u s troops in northern syria allowing a turkish offensive against our kurdish allies and it aposs time now for our sunday group jason riley of the wall street journal charles lane from the washington post former dnc chair donna brazile and guy benson of fox news radio jason i am not often or easily shocked here at the anchor chair on sunday mornings but i have to say that the conjunction of reports that the that the turkish backed militia are committing atrocities and slaughtering executing kurdish civilians and soldiers the fact that isis fighters are escaping that the president has decided to pull all u s forces out of northern syria and allow the kurds to make common cause with the assad regime and russians i find that shocking jason riley contributor i think a lot of people find it shocking chris the defense secretary said that our biggest strategic interests were china and russia two big important powerful countries that are currently watching a couple ten pact dictators in turkey and syria thumb their nose at the united states call the shots in terms of what turkey is going to do tell us what they are going to do as the defense secretary said i i find that that shocking as well and the big concern here of course is we aposre abandoning allies in the kurds these are the people they were the ground came we had the air support we supported the intelligence but they took the casualties thousands of casualties and they are now going to turn out of self preservation to russia and syria if we are not going to back them and the other problem here chris is that you know isis is dispersed right now but they are not defeated and they will reconstitute if they have a safe place to do that that is another problem with us leaving syria wallace the other question i have guy on this is that the defense secretary mark esper says turkey was going to do this anyway they were going to come across the border and invade we had troops not a lot but we had some troops on the border we had u s fighters patrolling the area they say they thought that erdogan the turkish president meant business do you really think he was going to take on the u s defy the u s and move in guy benson townhall com no there is this sense that we got from the secretary that the u s was just impotent in this situation well turkey was going to do what they were going to do and we had nothing that we really had at our fingertips to stop them no options and i just find that hard to believe i think many americans find it hard to believe it we don apost have to say let aposs go to war with turkey without saying behind the scenes if you do this the first boot on the ground there aposs going to be a massive consequence there will be military consequences there will be economic consequences i don apost know if that was said but it sounds like it was not and i just keep coming back to this quote it was a tweet from the president just a few days ago on the situation quote anything that i and my great and unmatched wisdom consider to be off limits talking about what turkey might do i will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of turkey i think many conservatives were rightly deeply critical of president obama on a red line in syria this wasn apost a specific red line but he said if they go out of bounds they aposre in huge trouble the question that i have this morning is what aposs the definition of out of bounds if not what we aposre seeing right now wallace there is another side to this story and it the president and many of his supporters are advancing it and that is we ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on the issue of the president pulling back u s troops and allowing turkey to invade we got this on facebook from karen margrave the middle east has been fighting each other since biblical times mostly over religion and oil how will sacrificing american lives change anything donna how do you answer karen particularly in the context of president trump and the decisions he has made with regard to turkey and the kurds donna brazile contributor i agree that we aposve been in endless wars in the middle east for a long time and we will likely be in the middle east for much longer but this is a disaster of the president aposs own making there are serious consequences of withdrawing from syria we know that we know that this could lead to the reemergence of isis or resurgence of isis we know that it will likely lead to more conflict in the region the president made a huge mistake and i think to this coming week that both the house and the senate needs to come together and decide what if any actions they will take to prevent turkey from doing more damage to our interests in the region wallace there is a larger policy question here and that is what the role of the u s military should be here is president trump on that this week begin video clip donald trump president we aposre like a police force over there we aposre policing we aposre not fighting we aposre policing we aposre not a police force we aposre the greatest military force ever assembled end video clip wallace but we have deployed u s troops around the world for more than half a century in a sense not to fight wars thirty five thousand u s troops right now in germany 26 000 right now in south korea 55 000 in japan chuck what president trump calls a police force has been a decision that if the u s puts troops on borders as tripwires if you will that sometimes oftentimes in some these cases for decades it prevents wars charles lane the washington post we have in the greater middle east about 60 000 troops there aposre in places of lot of americans probably don apost even realize they are like oman and qatar and and as you say they aposre there for sort of a general securities function what we aposre learning out of this situation is that many people who before his election regarded donald trump as some sort of dealmaker or pragmatist kind of got it wrong he is deeply ideological about this point that we are overcommitted overseas people take advantage of us and advantage of our troop presence and don apost pay for it and all we get out of it is money and lives lost and that aposs a big part of the america first ideology that he deeply believes and what he aposs learning is that that simple grid when you try to impose it over a complicated situation like this it doesn apost always work because he simultaneously promised we aposll wipe out isis and we aposll end the endless wars and we aposre learning today that you can apost really have both of those things wallace well and and we i we aposve got to wrap this up quickly because i want to move on to the next segment but almost hate to talk about the political impact of this when you aposre talking about people aposs lives and atrocities and isis getting out jason but the president believes that you know he made this campaign promise to his supporters i want to get out of these wars and i think he believes there are an awful lot of voters out there who are not going to be upset but are going to be happy to see u s forces not fighting in other people aposs land riley they are he did make the promise and we all understand the sentiment but u s foreign policy has to respond to the world as it is not as we want it to be and these conflicts many of which he inherited of course will not get better in the absence if we just stick to our own business stick to our own knitting that is not how the world works we know if there aposs a vacuum bad guys will fill it particularly in this part of the world and if there aposs more mayhem over there if there aposs more bedlam if we see beheadings and executions that is not going to help donald trump politically here at home wallace all right panel we have to take a break here but when we come back the latest on the democrats apos impeachment inquiry and is the president aposs lawyer rudy giuliani now in trouble commercial break begin video clip trump you aposre running a country i just don apost think that you can have all of these people testifying about every conversation you aposve had end video clip wallace the president announcing this week an end to any cooperation with the house impeachment inquiry but in the last few days mr trump is being urged to cut ties with his personal lawyer rudy giuliani amid reports the mayor is now under investigation for his work in ukraine let aposs get the latest from kevin corke at the white house kevin kevin corke correspondent chris asked this weekend whether or not he was still the president aposs attorney rudy giuliani told fox news yes but there were new questions about just how long that might be the case begin videotape trump i stand behind rudy giuliani absolutely corke voice over in six words president trump put to rest any speculation that he aposs turning his back on his private attorney rudy giuliani and while no one knows for certain the new york times reports the former new york city mayor is now squarely at the center of an impeachment probe thanks to his ties to two foreign nationals lev parnas and igor fruman arrested and charged with campaign finance violations stemming from what prosecutors alleged was a pressure campaign to investigate democrats geoffrey berman u s attorney for the southern district the defendants broke the law to gain political influence while avoiding disclosure of who is actually making the donations and where the money was coming from corke meanwhile former ukrainian ambassador marie yovanovitch who was recalled abruptly back in may gave a closed door deposition to three congressional committees investigating whether there are grounds to impeach the president in her prepared remarks yovanovitch accused the state department of bringing her back to washington because of disinformation spread by people including the president aposs attorney this just ahead of a week when even more officials are expected to testify including u s ambassador to the eu gordon sondland and fiona hill who was until recently president trump aposs top eight on russia and europe end videotape corke sources tell the washington post that sondland is expected to tell congressional lawmakers that the content of a text denying a quid pro quo with ukraine came directly after a phone call from president trump himself although he is also expected to tell them chris he aposs not sure if that aposs true or not wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks and we aposre back now with the panel well perhaps the biggest development and there were a lot this week with the arrest of those two associates and there you see them of rudy giuliani on campaign finance charges now the new york times reports federal prosecutors are investigating whether giuliani failed to disclose he was lobbying for in the u s on behalf of foreign officials here was president trump being asked about giuliani on friday begin video clip question is rudy giuliani still your personal attorney trump well i don apost know i haven apost spoken to rudy i spoke to him yesterday briefly he aposs a very good attorney and he has been my attorney yes sure end video clip wallace yes sure so guy the president did call in last night and say yes giuliani is still his attorney and he is a quote fine a great gentleman that was the quote but it doesn apost seem that there aposs ringing vote of confidence do you see a potential break in the trump giuliani alliance benson well i just watched that clip again and the first time i saw it my ears perked up because the tense of verbs sometimes matters when someone is signaling or telegraphing where they might be going so instead of saying rudy is my attorney he said rudy has been my attorney i said uh oh that could not be good for rudy and look i aposll tell you this speaking to every single right leaning person and republican over the last few weeks frankly almost unanimously they aposre all saying rudy aposs a liability for the president he aposs all over tv constantly he aposs contradicting himself he sometimes seems a little bit sort of crazed in in some of his responses and now with this whole thing with the friends of rudy getting arrested this is a series of headlines that is not helpful to his client who happens to be the president of the united states wallace yes chuck i want to pick up on that because you know there has been criticism were drama critics of giuliani aposs performance but with the arrest of these two people and with new reports and you got it from the ambassador to ukraine yovanovitch who was called back that it seems that the president and and giuliani were running their own off the books foreign policy their their own operation in ukraine outside and apart from the administration how big a liability potentially is that to the president lane well when the president says he stands absolutely behind rudy giuliani rudy giuliani probably ought to think about all the other people the president has said he stands behind you know including the kurds today and actually that is quite often in our history been the prelude to dumping him there is a problem i think giuliani is a liability both substantively and for all the optics reasons that guy talked about and now he is himself under a criminal investigation it aposs kind of awkward to have your personal attorney in that position but let aposs not forget these two guys go back a long way if if donald trump could be said to have a close best friend it might be rudy giuliani going all the way back to new york and so rudy knows a lot and maybe too much to be cut loose just like that so i would be surprised if in the very short term before it absolutely becomes necessary the president has to cut him loose but definitely a lot of people want him to wallace and let me turn to another part of the developments this week jason the president is pushing the argument about executive powers as far it seems as any president ever has in the various court cases he says he has immunity from investigation immunity from prosecution while he aposs president and now this week he announced a complete halt in to any cooperation with congress and his lawyer the white house counsel said this is unconstitutional and it aposs simply an attempt to overturn an election do you think i mean on the one hand if you say i don apost have to cooperate with the court aposs and i don apost have to cooperate with congress do you think he can make that stick riley i think some of the argument laid out in that document by the attorney are wallace the white house counsel riley counsel make more hold more weight than others or potentially hold more weight than others with the court we know the constitution gives the congress wide berth to define high crimes and misdemeanors it can be whatever essentially they wanted it to but there are sort of traditions that have been followed when it comes to impeachment inquiries whether it was a democratic congress going after nixon or a republican congress going after bill clinton and that was that you have an entire house vote on the formal inquiry to begin and it gives a sort of bipartisan sheen to the proceedings and the current speaker of the house nancy pelosi has ducked doing that she aposs avoided doing that i think partly to protect some of her members that come from trump district and partly because she knows she aposll get barely any if any republicans to support this which will expose it as the partisan exercise that it is but i think the white house is smart to litigate this to death because the longer they do and the closer we get to november of next year the more voters will say why do we need to impeach let aposs just go to the polls and decide if this amounts to something donald trump should lose his job over wallace and then there are the president aposs attacks on some of his critics and rivals in which he is using increasingly using language some of which we cannot put on the air here take a look at and we are going to put this on the air take a look at this exchange from this week begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate we all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and shoot someone and get away with it it aposs no joke he aposs shooting holes in the constitution and we cannot let him get away with it trump he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss barack obama aposs ass end video clip wallace so you know some of the chattering class in the beltway is going to get their knickers in a twist about this but you aposve got to know and it played well with that crowd that a lot of the president aposs supporters like the bluntness of those attacks and that was one of the ones we could put on tv brazile and you know the president is going to continue to rally his base to his defense and avoid looking at what is really at stake the house is gathering evidence that evidence will be presented in articles of impeachment the senate will be able to look at this evidence and they will proceed to be the jury i think the president should figure out what is his best strategy is is obstructing congress stonewalling the congress when the house has sole discretion the constitution gives the power to the house the people aposs house to make this decision the president can go around name calling all he wants but nancy pelosi is focused on abiding by the constitution and making sure that her committees come up with the evidence that will be presented to the american people and the senate will act as jurors wallace i aposve got less than a minute guy the president one of the things he didn apost like this week he attacked fox news about is our latest poll which i have to say another thing i was shocked about 51 percent now support not just impeachment but removal now the president and there are other polls that say different things do you think though that public opinion is moving against the president at this point benson yes it has been so far but there aposs a long way to go in this process and i think the fact that to your point that the democrats and speaker pelosi has not called for a full vote that aposs an issue and all of this operating in secrecy are they going to try to impeach a president in secret i think that aposs going to rub a lot of voters the wrong way if they continue down that path wallace ok thank you panel see you next sunday we aposll have plenty of time to discuss this up next our power player of the week the political activist mobilizing women to fight back against iran aposs leaders commercial break wallace when we interviewed iran aposs president rouhani at the u n two weeks ago we focused on the foreign policy differences between his country and the u s but there are also serious questions about what goes on inside iran here is our power player of the week begin videotape masih alinejad iranian journalist and activist we are banned from singing we are banned from dancing we are banned from showing our hair wallace voice over masih alinejad is talking about laws in iran that bar women from so called indecent behavior alinejad when you go to iran and stand up for your own dignity wallace now living in brooklyn she spent the last ten years mobilizing women in her home country to fight for their freedom alinejad when i fight against compulsory ph hijab ph i aposm not fighting against a small piece of cloth i aposm fighting against one of the main pillar of a religious dictatorship wallace hijab is part of the islamic dress code women must cover their head in public or risk imprisonment five years ago masih started a website called my stealthy freedom urging women to share pictures of their defiance alinejad i got bombarded by photos and videos from women inside iran holding headscarves waving it in public and saying this is our true self wallace on camera and what happens to women in iran who take off the hijab who wave the scarf who sing or dance in public what kind of risk are they taking alinejad being a woman means that you risk your life every day wallace voice over but she didn apost stop there in 2017 she launched white wednesday urging men and women to wear that color in protest the videos people sent became much bolder masih says 29 people were arrested in one day last year these two sisters were each sentenced to 15 years in prison unidentified female through translator we are nasrin sotoudoh ph we are sepidoh gholian ph we are the voice of women who are in prison for saying no to forced hijab alinejad they know the risk they know the danger but they are like the women of suffragettes they want freedom and they are ready to pay the price wallace which brings us to masih aposs story she grew up in a traditional family in northern iran but she always wondered why she couldn apost enjoy the same freedom as her brother alinejad i started my own revolution from my family aposs kitchen wallace by 2009 she was a journalist but iranian officials didn apost like her constant questioning alinejad i had two options to stay in iran and keep silent or leave iran and be loud wallace the revolutionary court has certainly heard her this summer they banned any interaction with masih alinejad they call me hostile government ph they call me a whore they call me a prostitute they call me what the agent of cia mi 6 they even called me the agent of president trump wallace that isn apost the worst of it authorities interrogated her mother and arrested her brother and her father stopped talking to her alinejad i don apost want to actually show them that they can break us wallace on camera making this break with your family with tradition it comes at a cost alinejad you know it aposs not easy i haven apost seen my family for ten years it aposs not easy wallace voice over but there is no chance masih or supporters back in iran will stop fighting alinejad that is why i have to be strong otherwise you know they
