apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the state department is thwarting efforts to deport immigrants to china guinea liberia and other countries that are reluctant to take back their own citizens convicted of crimes forcing immigration agents to release often violent criminals back onto the streets u s government documents show the homeland security department s deportation agency has filed several petitions asking the state department to take steps to punish recalcitrant countries including the ultimate punishment of denying visas to visitors from those countries but the department has failed to follow through on the plain language in federal law saying it doesn t want to anger foreign governments by withholding the visas in the meantime u s immigration and customs enforcement is forced to release the immigrants many of whom commit further serious crimes the recidivism rate is 30 percent or higher for criminal aliens released from detention top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches and the backlog is growing some 35 000 immigrants with criminal records are awaiting deportation back to cuba while the number of migrants awaiting deportation to china stands at 1 900 ice said in documents provided to the house oversight and government reform committee after questioning by chairman jason chaffetz utah republican and ranking democrat elijah e cummings of maryland the two lawmakers are demanding that the state department explain why it has refused to deny visas or block funding to recalcitrant countries as the law requires the state department declined to answer a series of questions from the washington times instead it released a response that insisted the department tried to work with homeland security on a case by case basis taking into account all of the factors surrounding each circumstance the issue came to a head last year when jean jacques a haitian man who served time for attempted murder but whose home country refused to take him back was released and then went on to kill a young woman in connecticut haiti claimed it wasn t sure of jacques citizenship connecticut lawmakers demanded an investigation into the incident and then said all sides need to do more to get other countries to live up to their obligations we have points of leverage that we can use it doesn t have to rely simply on our persuasive power we can deny visas we can suspend aid sen richard blumenthal connecticut democrat told homeland security secretary jeh johnson at a hearing last week senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley iowa republican expressed his own frustration with what he called inadequacy of the administration s efforts in a letter to mr johnson late last month he hinted that he would consider removing the executive branch s discretion on whether to impose the visa penalties on recalcitrant countries if the situation does not improve lives are being lost the public s safety is at risk and american families are suffering mr grassley wrote it cannot continue mr johnson insisted he is doing what he can but said it is up to the state department to apply the most powerful tools very clearly this is a work in progress and at some point i m going to advocate that we use the ultimate sanction available to us which is to deny visas to these countries if we don t see more progress he said analysts disagree with mr johnson federal law says homeland security shall deny visas once mr johnson invokes section 243 d of the immigration and nationality act and that he should use that power and force the state department to comply blocking of visas has been used only once by the george w bush administration in 2001 guyana was refusing to take back its citizens and a backlog of some 113 guyanese were awaiting deportation the state department stopped issuing visas to guyanese government officials and their families and guyana quickly yielded within two months 112 of the backlogged aliens had been cleared to be shipped back a 99 percent success rate blunt weapon still that episode has done little to sway the state department which says visa denial is too blunt the department of state believes continued close interagency cooperation and coordinated approaches both in washington and at posts overseas form the best strategy to make progress on repatriations said nicole thompson a spokeswoman considerations of visa restrictions are not made lightly and are made in close coordination with other agencies ice tried to get things moving with a 2011 memorandum of understanding to promote better cooperation with the state department it established a series of steps including joint meetings with foreign countries ambassadors and issuing demarches which are essentially diplomatic warnings two demarches have been issued in the past 18 months one to algeria and one to iraq both sent in march 2015 cuba is the worst offender according to ice with some 35 000 convicted criminals ice would like to deport but which havana refuses to take back cuban authorities even rejected an offer to deport just 10 percent of those criminals a year the obama administration last year agreed to extend more normalized relations to cuba but did not make repatriation a priority ice was left out of those negotiations and the issue was never solved that leaves the u s with few options last year the homeland security department threatened to block an increase in cuban student and exchange program visas but relented hoping it would earn better cooperation from cuba so far it hasn t dhs and ice have exhausted standard diplomatic approaches and seek alternative measures that fall within the purview of the state department ice director sarah saldana said in an april letter to the state department she has written similar letters on guinea china and liberia which are also among the worst of the 23 countries ice deems uncooperative in deportations another 62 countries are on ice s watch list but whose records aren t considered bad enough to be labeled uncooperative haiti which refused to accept jacques the man who killed the woman in connecticut is not on the worst offenders list because it generally accepts deportees ice said a monthly charter flight returns haitians and haitian consular officials are helping conduct interviews to take their people back in the case of china ice thought it had a breakthrough last year after mr johnson raised the issue of cooperation with gao shengkun the chinese minister of public security and the two sides agreed to regular charter flights to ship chinese criminals home after two flights were scheduled the chinese balked saying the u s misunderstood the agreement and that it was the ministry of foreign affairs not public safety that must be involved in deportations as of may some 1 900 convicts were awaiting deportation with some of the requests dating as far back as 2008 jessica vaughan policy studies director at the center for immigration studies said ice often gets blamed but the issues need to be solved at a higher level they keep getting blown off by the state department she said this is a situation where it needs to be raised to a higher level and someone needs to show some lead
