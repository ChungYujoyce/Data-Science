tion should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump heads into the conservative political action conference this week enjoying some of the best approval ratings of his presidency and poised to get a major shot in the arm from thousands of conservative activists who are working overtime to air mr trump s grievances and excommunicate republicans who step out of line fresh off a trip to india and dealing with the escalating coronavirus outbreak mr trump will be back in his comfort zone when he closes out the annual conservative conference saturday with adulation from cheering supporters as his would be democratic opponents tear each other apart for the right to face him in november if the roof is still on the gaylord center when we leave i might be surprised said charlie gerow a top official with the american conservative union which puts on the annual gathering in suburban maryland i think you will see an enthusiasm level at cpac unparalleled in our history i really do top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed alan gottlieb said that even though he s an acu board member he s staying in nearby alexandria virginia because demand for rooms was so high he doubted that everyone who wants to see mr trump speak will be physically able to get into the room as soon as possible those lines are going to be around the block so to speak i m kind of ecstatic about it said mr gottlieb founder of the second amendment foundation mr trump has made appearances at cpac over the years but had been viewed somewhat skeptically by the younger more libertarian leaning crowd before he took office in 2017 he even got booed one year when he took a shot at former republican rep ron paul in 2016 he skipped the event entirely in the midst of the presidential race when there was a dispute over his speaking slot but since the 2016 election mr trump s takeover of the republican party and the conservative movement is no more evident than at cpac which now serves as an annual pep rally for mr trump engineered by supporters made washington famous during his administration last year he delivered a stemwinding speech fresh off a summit with north korean leader kim jong un that clocked in at more than two hours mr trump kicked it off by embracing an american flag onstage last year trump was amazing at cpac mr gottlieb said i mean nobody s ever going to forget just the picture of him holding the american flag when he first walked out it was electrifying in addition to mr trump this year s event is set to feature appearances from a host of administration officials including vice president mike pence white house counselor kellyanne conway and secretary of state mike pompeo attendees also will hear from the people who are instrumental to mr trump s reelection campaign including campaign manager brad parscale former white house spokeswoman mercedes schlapp and donald trump jr and kimberly guilfoyle one of the new power couples in mr trump s washington but the event won attention last month when acu chairman matt schlapp publicly announced that sen mitt romney would not be invited after the utah republican crossed the president to vote in support of witness testimony in mr trump s impeachment trial mr romney ended up being the only republican in the senate who voted to convict mr trump on one of the two impeachment articles abuse of power although both articles failed mr schlapp said he would fear for mr romney s safety at the event and mr gerow said it was absolutely the right move i can tell you that the attendees are applauding it full throated he said appearing at cpac has become essentially a requirement for republicans running for president or eyeing a white house bid mr romney the republicans 2012 presidential nominee has not appeared at the conference since 2013 mr romney s office declined to comment on the disinvitation the conference also will feature a multipart program on the coup a reference to the probe of russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and the democratic response that culminated in impeachment that part of the program will include appearances from mr trump s top defenders in congress on the russia and ukraine issues they include reps doug collins of georgia and devin nunes of california the top republicans on the house judiciary and intelligence committees respectively as well as conservative reps jim jordan of ohio and mark meadows of north carolina cpac also will feature a play with actors dean cain and kristy swanson called fbi lovebirds undercovers which is based on the derogatory text messages about mr trump exchanged by former fbi officials peter strzok and lisa page as well as their testimony from congressional hearings the president and his allies have pointed to the fbi s probe of russian interference in the 2016 campaign as proof of a deep state coup working against him he has frequently targeted mr strzok and ms page as prime offenders mr romney s disinvitation and the lineup of speakers exemplify the extent to which members of the never trump movement and republicans willing to publicly cross the president have become less prominent in recent years terry schilling another acu board member said the never trump elite conservative movement has never been less relevant of course cpac is going to be supportive of president trump because the conservative movement is supportive of president trump said mr schilling executive director of the american principles project sure there are these elitist conservatives who are part of the never trump movement but they re failing right now mr schilling said cpac has become more serious about having policy discussions in recent years and that he s looking forward to a panel on big tech and the government s role in protecting people s civil rights online what cpac is doing is just recognizing where the conservative movement as a whole is heading and where the country is heading and these guys are just lagging behind everyone else mr schilling said donald trump jr with house minority leader kevin mccarthy and sen josh hawley of missouri are scheduled to participate in a panel called what s the right path forward on big tech friday morning other scheduled discussions include socialism wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies everything you wanted to know about russiagate but were afraid to ask and rampaging through america the le
