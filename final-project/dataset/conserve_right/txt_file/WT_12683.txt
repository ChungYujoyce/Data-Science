apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic amid growing tensions between china and taiwan over beijing s decision to sharply increase aircraft flights along the center of the taiwan strait the pentagon is preparing to transfer stinger anti aircraft missiles to the taiwanese military in the coming months taiwan s defense ministry announced jan 22 that it will take delivery later this year of some 250 fim 92 stinger missiles the shoulder fired stinger is considered a highly effective surface to air missile that uses an infrared homing system to track and hit aircraft the missiles are part of a 453 million arms package that was approved in 2015 other items include a torpedo life extension package and standard missile 2 spare modules top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender the pentagon announced jan 25 that it awarded a 92 million contact to raytheon the stinger manufacturer as part of military sales to taiwan and poland the announcement did not mention the funds were for stinger missiles the stingers however are being delivered as china and taiwan are embroiled in a dispute over the recent decision by beijing to begin regular commercial and military flights along the center of the taiwan strait using a commercial aviation route known as m503 unilaterally initiating use of controversial aviation routes is a provocation that undermines regional security taiwanese president tsai ing wen said in a statement jan 7 taiwan diplomats said the chinese move was designed to force taipei s military to expend valuable defense resources in responding to the flights by scrambling interceptor jets each time a commercial jet passes through the air route officially the reason taiwan is opposing the chinese flights as many as 20 a day is that the airspace already is crowded and additional chinese jets will jeopardize air safety the real reason according to taiwan diplomats is china s strategy of coercion and sharp power measures between soft diplomacy and hard military action to pressure on the rival island state beijing regards as its territory triggering numerous taiwan jet interceptor flights to the midline of the 100 mile strait is designed to stress taiwan s aging air force the diplomats said taipei has expressed interest in buying new u s f 16 jets or the newer f 35 jet to bolster its forces the pentagon said in its latest annual report that the balance of forces across the strait has shifted in china s favor amid deployments of missile and air forces on the mainland near taiwan taiwan has been a de factor independent nation since the remnant of nationalist forces fled to the island from the mainland in the late 1940s at the end the civil war against the communists that consolidated power in beijing in 1949 state department spokesman justin higgins said the department is concerned that beijing has modified the use of civil aviation flight routes in the strait without consulting taiwan we oppose unilateral actions by either side to alter the status quo across the strait he said issues related to civil aviation and safety in the taiwan strait should be decided through dialogue between both sides in announcing the arms transfer a taiwanese defense official told reporters in taipei that the missiles will be used by the navy and marine corps infantry battalions but it is the naval use of the stingers that is likely to trigger reaction from beijing according to the taiwan defense official the stingers will be deployed on the navy s guang hua vi class fast attack boats and tuo jiang class corvettes deployment of the missiles on those craft would signal beijing that taiwan has the capability to defend its airspace along the m503 flight path with stinger missiles the flight route is used mainly by commercial aircraft from china however china has used the route for warplanes thus increasing the risk that a flight along the route could be misinterpreted as a threat house memo said to id fbi leakers an intelligence source tells

new smaller warheads that when delivered on precision guided missiles can have impacts similar to larger strategic warheads we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal hopefully never having to use it but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression president trump said tuesday in his state of the union speech mr trump contrasted his harder line view of nuclear arms with the anti nuclear policies of former president obama saying perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons unfortunately we are not there yet the final version of the nuclear review will be released in the next two weeks according to defense officials the leaked draft was published in the huffington post jan 11 prompting state chinese media to denounce the forthcoming shift in american strategic policies people s liberation army affiliated experts told china s state owned media that

commentary was that china should sharply increase its own nuclear weapons buildup in response typical of the reaction was retired rear adm yin zhu who told state television the u s development of low
