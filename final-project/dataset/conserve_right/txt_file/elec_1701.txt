clinton was officially declared the winner in the iowa caucuses tuesday afternoon but not before sen bernard sanders outperformed expectations and reset the democratic presidential primary putting a serious dent in mrs clinton s aura of inevitability mrs clinton held a slim lead of 49 8 percent of delegates awarded to mr sanders 49 6 percent with 100 percent of iowa precincts reporting the

former maryland gov martin o malley has been awarded 7 68 state delegate equivalents and uncommitted has been awarded 46 state delegate equivalents andy mcguire iowa democratic party chairman said in a statement tuesday see also hillary clinton picks up handful of delegates in iowa via coin toss o malley came in a distant third with less than 1 percent of delegates and announced he was suspending his campaign on the heels of a dismal showing for mrs clinton the close result renewed some of the sting of 2008 when she lost the state to then sen barack obama and went on to lose the nomination to him in a race that lasted through june she followed her 2008 loss here with a come from behind victory in new hampshire but that will be tougher to duplicate this year with mr sanders who has represented neighboring vermont in washington for decades holding a commanding lead in polling there see also bernie sanders says iowa gives campaign a kick start iowa awards its delegates proportionally at the precinct level and the state party does not actually report vote totals for each candidate speaking at her campaign headquarters in des moines mrs clinton said she was breathing a big sigh of relief a hint at the crushing defeat she suffered here eight years ago she also said she s now looking forward to a one on one debate with mr sanders it is rare that we have the opportunity that we do now to have a real contest of ideas to really think hard about what the democratic party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like if we do our part to build it she said i am honored to stand in the long line of american reformers who make up our minds that the status quo is not good enough that standing still is not an option and that brings people together to find ways that will improve the lives of americans hillary for america s iowa state director matt paul said in a tuesday morning statement hillary clinton has won the iowa caucus after thorough reporting and analysis of results there is no uncertainty and secretary clinton has clearly won the most national and state delegates statistically there is no outstanding information that could change the results and no way that senator sanders can overcome secretary clinton s advantage calling the race a virtual tie mr sanders said he succeeded by battling the juggernaut clinton campaign to a razor thin finish in iowa and hit the anti establishment notes that have made him the darling of liberals nine months ago we came to this beautiful state we had no political organization we had no money we had no name recognition and we were taking on the most powerful organization in the united states of america he said in a speech at his campaign headquarters delivered just after mrs clinton left the stage i think the people have sent a very profound message to the political establishment and to the economic establishment and by the way to the media establishment he continued that is given the enormous crises facing our country it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics mrs clinton has clung to president obama during this campaign on a host of issues from foreign policy to health care to gun control many iowa democrats approved of that strategy and said they weren t ready for the lurch even further to the left that mr sanders would represent some seemed to buy into mrs clinton s claim that mr sanders policy proposals especially his 1 38 trillion per year universal health care plan would result in tax increases on the middle class i just like her and i don t like bernie sanders he s going to raise taxes he s said so i m going to raise taxes and who s going to pay for it we are said mike regan caucusing in council bluffs on the western side of the state unless he can get trump to pay for it entrance polls found mrs clinton with a slight lead over mr sanders among female voters 53 percent to 43 percent with mr sanders winning among male voters by the exact same margin according to entrance polls from the wall street journal polling also gave mrs clinton the edge among older voters she won 68 percent of voters over 65 compared to 26 percent for mr sanders by contrast mr sanders dominated among younger voters capturing 84 percent of voters ages 17 to 29 compared to just 13 percent for the former secretary of state nearly three in five democrats said they wanted to continue mr obama s policies and mrs clinton overwhelmingly won those voters those who wanted a more liberal direction meanwhile went to mr sanders fred turnbaugh wearing a navy ball cap and a give em hell bernie lapel pin on his jeans jacket while caucusing at franklin elementary school in council bluffs said he appreciated the vermont senator s allegiance to blue collar workers i ve always liked the way he s pro worker and takes care of the middle class mr turnbaugh said his wife diana turnbaugh also swung for mr sanders but said she would also support mrs clinton if she wins the nomination if it s a big landslide i don t have a problem with her either ms turnbaugh said she said she s looking for mr sanders to improve medicare i m on medicare and the obamacare insurance just ruined me other caucusgoers said they appreciated mrs clinton s position on social issues such as same sex marriage alisha delsignore called the former secretary of state very solid i have gay parents so i like her position on those issues said ms delsignore plus she s a woman her husband nick delsignore also backed mrs clinton in part because he worried about what he described as mr sanders lack of experience some of his positions just aren t as laid out said mr delsignore who wore a sanders t shirt while some voters have misgivings about mr sanders his performance thus far has been impressive and he s survived while other democratic candidates have fallen by the wayside the democratic field started with five candidates but former virginia sen jim webb and former rhode island gov lincoln chafee dropped out soon after the first debate in which they both turned in lackluster performances despite low poll numbers throughout the race mr o malley persevered through the iowa caucuses the former maryland governor had tried to position himself as the progressive alternative to mrs clinton but liberal voters clearly favored mr sanders though he never gained traction mr o malley said his performance in the primary process was beneficial both for himself and for the democratic party together we all stood up for working people for new americans for the future of the earth and the safety of our children we put these issues at the front of our party s agenda these are the issues that serve the best interests of our nation he said in a statement the road has been long but our course has been true a great many people have put their time and talents into my campaign and i thank each of you from the bottom of my heart whoever our nominee is we must all hold strong together moving forward mr sanders appears poised for a major win next week in new hampshire mr sanders is crushing mrs clinton in the polls in new hampshire with a university of massachusetts lowell 7 news poll released monday giving him the support of 61 percent of democratic voters while mrs clinton pulled in just 30 percent like mr obama in 2008 mr sanders has energized young democrats especially those who identify as progressives polls show young voters overwhelmingly back the vermont senator while mrs clinton holds a commanding lead among older voters but there also are deeper problems for mrs clinton and her quest for the democratic nomination surveys consistently have shown that democrats consider mr sanders much more honest and trustworthy than mrs clinton the perception of dishonesty which the clinton campaign has been unable to shake has grown amid revelations classified information passed through the private email account mrs clinton used while secretary of state mrs clinton has tried to curry favor among democrats by positioning herself as the heir apparent to mr obama she s praised the president s actions on financial regulation foreign policy and health care all while trying to position mr sanders as a candidate willing to tear apart pieces of mr obama s legacy mrs clinton has said such an approach is a mistake and would undo all the progress made in the years since the affordable care act mr obama s signature domestic achievement became law mr sanders has shot back against those attacks and argues his plan would build on obamacare not destroy it copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view comments click to hide terms of use privacy
