rightfully seek solutions from the private sector last week the hoover institution s russ roberts asked his many twitter followers to help create a list of voluntary non coercive actions taking place right now to reduce covid 19 spread or impact the answers are too inspiring not to share first many of roberts followers shared a list the benefits offered by their employers that help to alleviate workers financial hardships or ensure their health is protected for instance walmart target gap and many other firms announced that they will provide up to two weeks of paid leave to every worker who is sick or taking care of sick family members even companies that rely on self employed contractors are stepping during this crisis uber for example emailed its customers to inform them that any driver or delivery person who is diagnosed with covid 19 or is individually asked to self isolate by a public health authority will receive financial assistance for up to 14 days while their account is on hold adding we ve already helped drivers in some affected areas and we re working to quickly implement this worldwide second the fast rising prices of some items like hand sanitizers frustrate many but these price hikes are also a vital signal to manufacturers that these products are in especially high demand high enough that it s worth it for companies that usually don t make these goods to shift their resources toward producing them in china facemasks are now produced by auto electronic and energy companies a group of citizens in hong kong set up a surgical mask factory to increase supplies which tempers price hikes but roberts followers also highlight examples of companies innovating to fill other shortage gaps for example shine distillery and grill in portland oregon is now turning its alcohol waste into hand sanitizer which the owner then gives away the durham distillery in north carolina is also donating its homemade sanitizer to local hospitality businesses big guys

once people get back to normal activities by next weekend it would be more expensive to hire new employees than pay good employees two weeks sick leave moral hazard instead of bailouts is the solution not surprised norma folk do extraordinary things maybe people who are running around making people more nervous should shut up and do something productive and helpful this is it progressives simply do not believe that humans care about each other or that they will help each other without government almighty dictating it their base assumption is that people are too naive to know when others are in
