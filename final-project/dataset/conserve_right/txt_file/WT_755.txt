apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap president donald trump is telling a skewed story when he boasts about workers who ve seen their personal retirement savings nearly double under his administration gains in the overall stock market are only half of what he implied trump made the assertion at his new hampshire rally monday where he also tried to snatch victory from defeat by claiming a shutout victory in the house impeachment vote which he actually lost trump on workers 401 k investments up 90 up 104 is there anybody doing badly with the 401 k don t put up your hand i don t believe you the 401 k s they re up 90 95 top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk the facts that s misleading at best there have indeed been 401 k increases of 100 or more since 2017 but those were largely among workers with fewer than four years at their job according to the employee benefits research institute the increases are big for recent and younger employees because they generally start with meager savings the gains come in part from workers setting aside money from their own paychecks and contributions from their employers not just market returns in that circumstance it s unremarkable to see a 1 000 401 k account double in a year for example when a young worker and perhaps the employer is paying into it older workers with more than 20 years on the job have seen gains of roughly 50 over three years in their retirement accounts thanks both to contributions from paychecks and market gains moreover the s p 500 the broadest measure of the u s stock market was up 47 6 from trump s inauguration through monday s close some 401 k averages are problematic for trump s claims to be generating prosperity because many workers lack the savings for a comfortable retirement the median account balance was 22 217 in 2018 in 401 k and similar plans for which investment giant vanguard was the recordkeeper that s down from 26 331 in 2017 trump on impeachment it wasn t even close i want to thank our republican senators and our republican house members they were tremendous in the house we won 196 to nothing and then we got three democrats the facts by that measure the san francisco 49ers won the super bowl 20 0 they actually lost it 31 20 to the kansas city chiefs if you only count your own score you win every vote and every game the house impeached trump on a 230 197 vote on the first article outlining abuse of power charges and a 229 198 vote on the second article covering obstruction of congress that s because most of the majority democrats backed impeachment trump went on to say in the senate other than romney we had we got 52 to nothing again he ignores votes from the democrats trump was acquitted of impeachment charges after senators in the republican controlled senate narrowly rejected democratic demands to summon witnesses and extend the trial the senate acquitted trump by votes of 52 48 on abuse of power and 53 47 on obstructing congress utah sen mitt romney was the only republican to vote for conviction doing so on the abuse of power charge this story has been corrected to show when the median account balance in a group of 401 k and similar funds declined from 26 331 to 22 217 that happened from 2017 to 2018 not 2018 2019 editor s note a look at the veracity of claims by political figures associated press writers christopher rugaber and cal woodward contributed to this report find ap fact checks at http apne ws 2kbx8
