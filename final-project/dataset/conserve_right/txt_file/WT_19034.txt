apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap amid a battlefield stalemate in afghanistan the u s military has stopped releasing information often cited to measure progress in america s longest war calling it of little value in fighting the taliban insurgency the move fits a trend of less information being released about the war in recent years often at the insistence of the afghan government which had previously stopped the u s military from disclosing the number of afghans killed in battle as well as overall attrition within the afghan army the latest clampdown also aligns with president trump s complaint that the u s gives away too much war information although there is no evidence that this had any influence on the latest decision top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots a government watchdog agency that monitors the u s war effort now in its 18th year said in a report to congress on wednesday that the u s military command in kabul is no longer producing district control data which shows the number of afghan districts and the percentage of their population controlled by the government compared to the taliban the last time the command released this information in january it showed that afghan government control was stagnant or slipping it said the share of the population under afghan government control or influence a figure that was largely unchanged from may 2017 to july 2018 at about 65 percent had dropped in october 2018 to 63 5 percent the government s control or influence of districts fell nearly 2 percentage points to 53 8 percent less than two years ago a top american commander in afghanistan called population control most telling gen john nicholson told reporters in november 2017 that he wanted to see the figure then about two thirds increase to at least 80 percent with the taliban holding only about 10 percent and the rest contested and this we believe is the critical mass necessary to drive the enemy to irrelevance nicholson said then nicholson s successor gen scott miller believes there already are enough such assessments available to the public including one produced by intelligence agencies we are focused on setting the conditions for a political settlement to safeguard our national interests col david m butler a spokesman for miller said in an email exchange tuesday the district stability assessment that was previously provided by dod was redundant and did little to serve our mission of protecting our citizens and allies the war is at a sensitive juncture with the trump administration making a hard push to get peace talks started between the taliban and the afghan government the taliban recently launched a spring military offensive and have refused to directly talk to kabul representatives viewing the government as a u s puppet in its report the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction or sigar said miller s command offered a further explanation for no longer producing the district control data asserting there was uncertainty in the way the data were produced and saying the assessments that underlie them are to a degree subjective the command said they no longer saw decision making value in these data the sigar report said in remarks to reporters last week john sopko the special inspector general criticized what he called a trend toward less openness by the military authorities who are advising training and assisting afghan security forces i don t think it makes sense sopko said the afghan people know which districts are controlled by the taliban the taliban obviously know which districts they control our military knows it everybody in afghanistan knows it the only people who don t know what s going on are the people who are paying for all of this and that s the american taxpayer in january trump sharply criticized his own administration for disclosing information that he said aids enemy forces some ig goes over there who are mostly appointed by president obama but we ll have ours too and he goes over there and they do a report on every single thing that s happening and they release it to the public trump told reporters what kind of stuff is this we re fighting wars and they re doing reports and releasing it to the public now the public means the enemy the enemy reads those reports they study every line of it trump then turned to the acting defense secretary patrick shanahan and said i don t want it to happen anymore mr secretary the war in afghanistan is largely forgotten in much of america as is the enormous continuing financial cost this year the pentagon budget includes 4 9 billion to provide the afghan army and police with everything from equipment and supplies to salaries and food that is one piece of a wider array of reconstruction assistance the u s government has provided since the war began in 2001 totaling 132 billion overall the u s has spent 737 billion on the war and
