final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news sunday host i aposm chris wallace talk of a possible white house shake up over the domestic abuse scandal while president trump signs of budget busting spending bill begin videotape wallace we aposll discuss what the deal means to the nation aposs debt the stock market and the coming debate over the dreamers with white house budget director mick mulvaney who is being talked about as a possible replacement for chief of staff then the deficit hawks in congress feel betrayed by a republican president and congressional leaders sen rand paul r kentucky a country cannot go on forever spending money this way rep jim jordan r ohio freedom caucus in the past decade this is the second largest discretionary spending increase second only to obama aposs stimulus package so you know how obnoxious that was wallace we aposll ask ohio congressman jim jordan whether his hard line house freedom caucus is out of business donald trump president of the united states well we wish him well wallace plus backlash to president trump aposs defense of a senior staffer accused of abuse by two ex wives trump as you probably know he says he aposs innocent corey lewandowski former trump campaign manager there aposs no question they could have handled it better wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel if white house mishandling of the rob porter affair will cost other officials their jobs and our power player of the week the keeper of a trove of nazi art glorifying adolf hitler few people will ever get to see do you ever feel like you are in that huge warehouse at the end of indiana jones all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington this was always going to be a big week for white house budget director mick mulvaney with the release of the president aposs spending plan for next year but that has been overtaken by events first congress passed and mr trump signed a two year spending plan that adds hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit and now the white house is dealing with its mishandling of domestic abuse allegations against former staff secretary rob porter and there aposs talk the president may be looking to replace chief of staff general john kelly among the names being floated budget director mick mulvaney and welcome back to fox news sunday mick mulvaney white house budget director good morning thanks very much for having me back wallace yes i aposm sure you are delighted about that introduction mulvaney you forgot about the shutdown last weekend too so crosstalk wallace yes that aposs true has the president or anyone around him talk to about replacing general kelly as white house chief of staff mulvaney absolutely not and i think all the stories about replacing general kelly are mostly being fed by people who are unhappy that they aposve lost access to the president under general kelly aposs leadership as chief of staff so no i aposm extraordinarily pleased with the job the chief has been doing everybody in the west wing is the president is as well i think the talk about the chief aposs departure is much ado about nothing wallace have you talked with general kelly about his status his standing mulvaney absolutely not and again that aposs because i don apost think it aposs an issue keep in mind working in the west wing and reading about it in the newspaper watching on television could not be more different the place is very stable very quiet so all the media hype about disarray is just that wallace when you suggest that these stories are being fed by people who lost access because general kelly has imposed order you seem to be suggesting it aposs being fed by people inside the west wing mulvaney no keep in mind before the general got there just about anybody could get access to the west wing so there aposs a bunch of people who are not inside the white house who were also upset that he has controlled it in a way that has made is much more productive keep in mind since the chief has come on we aposve managed to pass the tax bill the economy is going again isis is defeated there aposs a lot of good things that have been happening since the chief is there i think the president sees that the results speak for themselves wallace let aposs talk about the bigger underlying issue there and i promise we aposll move on to your day job you ran a congressional office you now know run a major governmental agency what is your policy on dealing with allegations of domestic abuse against our staff mulvaney that we don apost tolerate it at all keep in mind it aposs never come up it aposs never come up maybe i aposm just fortunate with the people that i surround myself with fortunate the people that are higher it aposs never come up to me in business it aposs never come up to me and my congressional staff and it aposs never come up to me as my position as the director of office of management and budget wallace but you say you don apost tolerate it at all what does that mean mulvaney you simply don apost you don apost tolerate it you cannot have domestic you can put trust in people who would do that to their spouse of either gender so we have a zero tolerance policy for it wallace i want to ask you about that zero tolerance because president trump has been criticized for his response to the rob porter scandal here aposs what he said on friday take a look begin video clip trump we certainly wish them well it aposs obviously a tough time for him he did a very good job when he was in the white house and we hope he has a wonderful career and hopefully he will have a great career ahead of him end video clip wallace and the president we did this yesterday people aposs lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation is there no such thing any longer as due process there was no mention of zero tolerance in fact at no point either friday or saturday did the president even mention the two ex wives who claimed that they were victims of abuse mulvaney go back and watch what happened this week and i think it aposs a very normal reaction to the circumstance someone who we know and trust and work with rob porter came to the president of united states and chief of staff and said look i aposm being accused of these things they are not true for the president and the chief of staff to give that person the benefit of the doubt is probably a very normal and human reaction if your cameraman came to you and said look i aposm going to be accused of something but it aposs not true you aposd be likely to try to want to give that person benefit of the doubt until they were proven wrong as soon as rob porter was proven wrong and it was proven that he was not telling the truth when the photos came on wednesday he was gone almost immediately so wallace i really don apost want to keep on this mulvaney right wallace but even after he was gone the president still has not said anything about zero tolerance he still hasn apost mentioned that the lives of the two women who were the subjects of abuse that they those lives have been shattered too mulvaney what i think you saw there were a couple of different things i think the tweet can be applied to a bunch of different people in fact when i saw the tweet i know rob porter wasn apost mentioned i wondered if the president was talking about his friend steve wynn who has been accused and essentially condemned without any due process what you also saw there from the president is a certain sadness that somebody that he liked had let him down wallace all right let aposs go to your day job let aposs talk money on friday the president signed a bipartisan plan passed by congress that will add 400 billion in new spending deficit spending to the budget over the next two years here aposs how our next guest your former colleague in the house freedom caucus jim jordan reacted begin video clip jordan this is probably the second largest spending increase second only to obama aposs stimulus package so you know how obnoxious that was so this is not what we aposre elected to do end video clip wallace is congressman jordan wrong mulvaney no he aposs not he aposs just not recognizing the realities that we deal with the reality is that the president wanted to defend the nation the president aposs first priority he said this during the campaign he said this since he was elected he said it at the other night at the state of the union was to defend the nation we really thought we could cut a deal with the democrats that would increase defense spending in order to defend the nation they said that publicly they wanted to work with us on that but when the doors closed what happened was they would not give us a single dollar worth of additional defense spending without giving us additional money for welfare spending and that aposs just the world we live in people think we can do what we want to in washington because republicans control the house the senate and the white house but the truth of the matter is because of the 60 vote rule in the senate we need democrat support and democrats would not support our increase in defense spending without that dramatic increase in social welfare programs wallace during your confirmation hearing for this job back in january of 2017 you criticized the obama presidency for overspending here you are begin video clip mulvaney i believe as a matter of principle that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later i also know that fundamental changes are necessary in the way washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy end video clip wallace but under this new plan with a new spending the deficit will rise from 439 billion in 2015 under obama to a projected 1 2 trillion in 2019 and trillion dollar deficits for the years after that there aposs always a reason in other words you aposre saying well it aposs the democrats apos fault obama might have said it was the republicans apos fault in the recession bottom line isn apost president trump the big spender now mulvaney go to your premise your premise is that we aposre going to have larger deficits this year which is absolutely true but then you also say we aposre going to have larger deficits forever and ever and ever wallace well 2019 next year mulvaney right wallace one point two trillion is the protection mulvaney and that aposs correct and i think that aposs probably close to being accurate again we haven apost had a chance to completely integrate the numbers from the bill that passed a couple days ago to what we are working on last week but the truth of the matter is that when we roll out the budget on monday which is tomorrow now you aposre going to get a chance to see how we can avoid that future the budget does bend the trajectory down it does move us back towards balance it does get us away from trillion dollar deficits just because this deal was signed does not mean the future is written in stone we do have a chance still to change this trajectory and that aposs what the budget will show tomorrow wallace well you know i sympathize with you because you were writing a federal budget that aposs a complicated thing it was going to be released tomorrow and now on friday the president signs a bill which adds 400 billion in spending over two years will this new budget that you aposll release tomorrow reflect what congress had just passed and the president had just signed mulvaney this may be the most complicated budget anyone aposs ever going to do tomorrow what we aposre going to be doing chris is we aposre going to be doing an update to our 2018 budget which we released back in the spring in order to bring it in line with a spending deal that was passed last week then we aposre also going to be updating mick mulvaney white house budget director then we aposre also going to be updating our 2019 budget keep in mind we started doing that last september to also bring it in line and the argument chris wallace fox news host which will reflect the mulvaney both of them yes the 2018 and 2019 budgets it aposs been a very busy week at omb what we aposre doing is is saying look you don apost have to spend all of these money these are spending caps they aposre not spending floors so you don apost have to spend all that so we are going to show how you can run the government without spending all of that wallace but you know ph mulvaney and that will be our 2019 budget but if you aposre going to spend it which is exactly what we think congress is going to do here aposs how you should spend it and that will be our 2018 budget so take the money that the democrats want to put to these social programs and move it to things like infrastructure move it to things like opioid relief move it to things that are in line with the president aposs priorities so that if it does get spent at least it get spent to the right places wallace in your first budget the one for 2018 for this year that you introduced last year yes it aposs complicated you called for major spending cuts on the domestic side let aposs put them up on the screen 28 percent less for the state department and foreign aid 31 percent cut for the epa 18 percent less for the national institutes of health but under the congressional compromise all of those agencies get more money not less money so in the sense haven apost the trump mulvaney spending priorities for this year and last haven apost they been rejected by congress mulvaney no and keep in mind i don apost want to get too far deep in the weeds but the bill that passed last week is not a spending bill it aposs not an appropriations bill it will simply set the caps set the spending limit wallace there was some detail in it as to what the spending will be mulvaney there is but you are still going to see some reductions in our proposals to the state department you still are going to see some reductions in our proposals to the epa there aposs still going to be the president aposs priorities as we seek to spend the money consistently with our priorities not with the priorities that were reflected most by the democrats in congress wallace now in this new budget that you aposre going to be putting out tomorrow will you allocate some of the money that was going to go to dhs as a down payment on president trump aposs border wall mulvaney yes in fact a couple different things last year in the 2018 budget we asked for some money for the wall i think it was about 1 6 billion we aposre asking for about 3 billion i think this year for the wall but we aposre also putting in a contingency in this 2018 what we call this pivot as we try and pivot off of the old budget onto the new to reflect the spending priorities or the spending bill that just passed is enough money to build a whole wall or actually most of it assuming that daca gets done so what i aposm saying in a very confusing way is that we are assuming in our 2018 proposal that a daca deal is done and that the border wall is funded wallace so and is that 20 billion mulvaney it aposs 25 and i think we do half of that this year and half of that next year wallace the stock markets i don apost have to tell you have been going crazy over the last 10 days we aposve seen the two biggest point drops not percentage drops but point drops in history over a thousand points two days and we aposre now in correction territory down 10 percent from the high a couple of weeks ago one of the big concerns is that the economy is in danger of overheating that we aposre going to have inflation that we aposre going to have higher interest rates that that aposs going to tamp down growth under this new spending plan that congress has passed and the president has signed we are talking about deficits next year 5 percent of gdp which is usually only happens during war or recession isn apost it dangerous to have a 5 percent gdp deficit as a percentage of gdp when you aposre talking about an economy that aposs going at great guns mulvaney certainly there aposs a risk that interest rates will spike and there aposs a concern i think what you saw last week when you started these wild gyrations in the stock market keep in mind though chris that that thousand point drop i think we had of monday of last was only the 99th largest reduction on a percentage basis so even though that thousand points sounds like it aposs fairly dramatic in a history of things it aposs not that large of a swing but i think what triggered that was not the fact that we were overheating the economy but that we were borrowing too much money the treasury had reached out to some of the primary dealers last week to wallace but now you aposre going to have to borrow more money mulvaney to anticipate the additional the additional debt i think the one thing we keep coming back to though is we fundamentally changed the structure of the economy this is not a fiscal stimulus it aposs not a sugar high it aposs not the same thing as what president obama did i aposm now talking about the tax bill we have fundamentally changed the structure of the american economy to where we think we can change the long term trends of our growth possibilities the long term trends of the economy and that we have that sustained growth that could maintain wallace i just have to pick up when you because now you are also adding 400 billion in new spending and a trillion dollar deficit next year which only increases government borrowing you say that could make interest rates spike mulvaney it absolutely could keep in mind though that we are also looking now at a healthier economy than even we expected the when we rolled out the budget last year we were accused of being way too overly optimistic on our growth rates for this year and for next and we aposre already below what we aposre actually achieving you saw the atlanta fed come out last week and i think predict growth over 5 percent in this quarter so if we can keep the economy humming and generate more money for you and me and for everybody else the government takes in more money and that aposs how we hope to be able to keep the debt under control wallace director mulvaney thank you thanks for coming in today it aposs always a pleasure to talk with you sir mulvaney thank you wallace up next one of the founders of the house freedom caucus congressman jim jordan is the era of spending restraint now over commercial break wallace ever since the rise of the tea party in 2010 congressional republicans have talked about shrinking the size of the federal government but all that seemed forgotten this week with passage of a budget deal with 400 billion of new spending joining us now congressman jim jordan a founder of the house freedom caucus and still a deficit hawk which has become something of an endangered species on capitol hill congressman welcome back rep jim jordan r ohio house freedom caucus co founder good to be with you wallace some people are suggesting that this bipartisan spending deal means that the era of spending restraint in the tea party is over when you have big majorities of republicans in both the house and the senate approving this kind of a bill and a republican president signing it are those folks right jordan well here aposs what i know chris this was not consistent with what the american people elected us to do not consistent with what we told them we were going to do and in your first segment with mick look he said we don apost have 60 votes in the senate to get some things done and i aposm all for changing the senate rules but the last time i checked democrats don apost have 60 votes in the senate either and last time i checked there aposs more republicans in the senate than there are democrats more republicans in the house than there are democrats and there aposs a republican in the white house so this deal which increased spending 300 billion second largest spending increased in a decade second only to the stimulus was not what we said we would do and we aposre going to have to fight harder now as the freedom caucus and conservatives to get things back on track wallace when you say that there are more republicans than democrats and a republican in white house are you saying in effect the democrats won and the republicans caved jordan no i aposm saying the swamp won and the american taxpayer lost and here aposs the frustrating thing we were so poised to win three weeks ago we sent a bill to the senate chuck schumer shut down the government didn apost pay our troops because he said amnesty was more important earlier last week the house sent the same bill the exact same bill to the jordan earlier last week the house sent the same bill the exact same bill to the senate except we did one thing different we funded the military for the entire year and instead of standing firm our leadership said no no no let aposs do what washington always does let aposs just spend more on everything let aposs just grow government give into the democrats instead of fighting and stand firm and do what the people elected us to do they gave into the democrats and we got this boondoggle that we passed i didn apost vote for it but that passed on friday morning wallace well you talk tough but some folks are now saying that this deal puts the house freedom caucus that you and mick mulvaney helped start put you guys out of business let me put up the reasons that they suggest you lose the debt ceiling for the next two years as a weapon to demand policy changes with this to your agreement you can no longer use the threat of a government shutdown and with no budget resolution this year you won apost be able to use reconciliation to get a major initiative through the senate with just 51 votes honestly congressman with this agreement haven apost you and deficit hawks like you and the house freedom caucus lost your leverage to shrink government spending jordan well i think i think who lost in this deal was the american taxpayer the crosstalk wallace no no but i understand the talking point but i aposm saying jordan no no crosstalk wallace hasn apost this made the house freedom caucus a lot less effective in your ability to force change jordan first of all it aposs not a talking point it aposs the truth second people have been trying to write off the freedom caucus since the last election i remember right up to the last election said oh the freedom caucus is gone now because republicans i think we aposve been the most effective caucus and certainly the most talked about caucus on capitol hill the last year and a half and i would argue our chairman frankly is probably the member closest to the president closer than probably any other member in the house or the senate so they can only say they aposre going to write us off but what i know is we got a big debate coming the debate on immigration and the freedom caucus is going to be in the middle of that and the speaker of the house promised the freedom caucus promised conservatives in the house that he would put the goodlatte legislation the legislation that is consistent with the mandate of the 2016 election that he would whip that bring that to the floor and we would have that crosstalk wallace that aposs a hard line immigration package jordan it aposs the package that aposs consistent with the election it says build the border security wall end chain migration stop sanctuary city policy do all those things that the american people want us to do and then also deal with the daca situation so it prioritizes things in the right manner and it focuses on what the people elected us to do let aposs pass that legislation and that aposs the big fight coming that aposs what we aposre going to be weighing in and trying to accomplish wallace all right before we get to immigration and we will i want to ask you a little bit more about the spending package because house speaker paul ryan defends the compromise that he helped get through here he is begin video clip rep paul ryan r wis speaker of the house this is a bipartisan bill just like leader schumer said you get some things you like you give the other side things they like that aposs what bipartisan compromise is all about and i think on the net this is a very good solution end video clip wallace on net a very good solution do you still have full confidence in house speaker paul ryan or is it time for him to leave jordan well here aposs what i know spending bills start in the house of representatives the person most responsible for the spending bill is the speaker of the house he could have stood firm for the position that we passed earlier in the week the position that our conference then supported i wish he would have done that so do i think the speaker has problems yes i do particularly now as we head into this big immigration debate just a few years ago he was viewed as the fiscal the leader of fiscal responsibility in our party and now he presides over a bill that increases spending 300 billion a trillion dollar deficit when we were so poised to win this fight of course he aposs got problems but the key is let aposs see what happens next on the immigration issue wallace you say he aposs got problems congressman is it time for a change jordan well you know look we aposll have that debate at the appropriate time you asked if he has if he has if there aposs concerns with the speaker i think there are big concerns because he just presided over one of the biggest spending increases in the history of this country at a time when we were elected to do just the opposite wallace let aposs turn to immigration the senate takes up daca this week trying to find some solutions some compromise and what they are talking about and also what the president is talking about is a package that includes now you put the tough part first the president and some republicans say that it all comes together that you aposre going to have a path to citizenship for the dreamers in 10 to 12 years you aposre going to have tougher border enforcement on our southern border and also tougher enforcement both legal and illegal immigration would you support that package jordan i aposll support a package consistent with what the voters said i mean look the voters don apost trust that washington is going to do the right thing on immigration and they are tired of this oh we aposll give some kind of amnesty to folks who came here illegally and we promise promise promise will do something to secure the border they aposre sick of that play what they want is border security first so build a border security wall end the chain migration get rid of this crazy visa lottery do things in a way that make good common sanctuary city policy get rid of those do those things first and then we aposll deal with the daca situation that is consistent with the mandate of the 2016 election and frankly consistent with what the president and what republicans campaigned on wallace but i aposm asking you jordan and that is consistent with goodlatte aposs legislation that aposs why we want to pass that wallace i aposm asking you a direct question because that isn apost where this compromise seems headed in the senate they are talking about doing them all at once the path to citizenship and these other things all at the same time not enforcement first jordan yes and you wallace can you accept all of those as a package jordan of course of course not the freedom caucus won apost support that i don apost think of the majority of the house of representatives will support that and speaker ryan knows that he can apost put a bell on the floor unless the majority of the house republicans are supportive of that measure wallace so you aposre saying if all of these things come together as a package daca you know deal for the dreamers and the tougher enforcement that aposs unacceptable to you and you believe the majority of republicans jordan i aposm you asked me about the senate bill what aposs being proposed in the senate is not going to be acceptable to conservatives in the house i guarantee because it aposs not going to be acceptable to the american people if they do legislation like what is chairman goodlatte aposs legislation that aposs been worked on by him congressman labrador senator or excuse me congressman mccaul you stick with that kind of legislation you will see conservatives support that because again chris it aposs consistent with what the american people elected us to do in 2016 wallace let me ask about that because you aposve made that point several times what the american people elected you to do and with the republican majority in 2016 do you think that the passage of the spending bill and depending on what happens on immigration could this hurt republicans in the 2018 midterms in other words the folks that felt well the conservative voters if we elect a republican house or a republican senate and republican president we aposre going to get conservative policies do you think some of them just may stay home if they see congress jordan heck yes heck yes i mean come on when you get elected to do the right thing in immigration and a bill talking about in the senate may be passing that aposs not going to that aposs going to hurt i think turnout and going to you know the people are going to be pleased with that and then when you increase spending 300 billion just grow government run a trillion dollar deficit heck yes that can hurt us that aposs why that aposs why we aposre so focused on making sure this immigration bill gets done right that aposs why we fought the spending bill as hard as we did last week wallace i got one more question for you and i got less than a minute friday evening the president sent a democratic memo on fisa and the fbi back to the house saying there aposs too much sensitive intelligence in it jordan yes wallace democrats have to rewrite it how do you answer folks who say well you know the president just ignored the criticisms from the fbi when it came to the republican memo but now he aposs using their objections to jordan yes wallace delay the democratic memo jordan the president was in no win situation the way schiff constructed the memo if he redacts it or doesn apost release it oh he aposs not for transparency if he releases it he aposd actually jeopardize the sources methods and potentially lives of americans and others who helped in our intelligence community he aposs in a tough situation but that wasn apost the big news this week the big news is this week was the text message from lisa page to peter strzok where she said potus referring to president obama potus wants to know everything we aposre doing and the significance of that chris was when it came july 5th they let clinton off no charges brought against clinton end of july peter strzok opens the russia investigation peter strzok the same agent who ran the clinton investigation and then september 2nd you have this text message which says potus wants to know everything we aposre doing peter strzok the guy who ran the clinton investigation wallace yes jordan ran the russia investigation that aposs the real takeaway this week on the whole russian matter wallace all right we aposre going to have to dig down into that we aposll have you back it aposs always interesting to talk to you congressman jordan thank you jordan thank you wallace thank you for your time please come back sir jordan i will take care wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the democratic fbi memo the president refused to release plus what would you like to ask the panel about how the white house handled the rob porter domestic abuse scandal just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up vice president pence tries to counter the north korean charm offensive at the winter olympics begin video clip mike pence vice president of the united states the united states of america will soon unveil the toughest and most aggressive round of economic sanctions on north korea ever end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel whether kim jong un can drive a wedge between the u s and south korea commercial break begin video clip corey lewandowski former trump campaign manager the general is there to put in policies and processes and procedures and in this case those didn apost work and we need to find out why david bossie fox news contributor i believe that this president has confidence in john kelly i will say that the process here failed i don apost know who where the buck stops on the process end video clip wallace former top trump campaign advisors corey lewandowski and david bossie who still have the president aposs ear wasting no time pinning the blame for the rob porter scandal on white house chief of staff john kelly and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz fox mews analyst marie harf rachael bade who covers congress for politico and guy benson of townhall com well congressman as someone who aposs seen how washington works how do you explain the way the white house has handled or mishandled the rob porter scandal and do you think that general kelly aposs job is in real jeopardy or do you think these leaks that the president is mentioning other names is just a way of him showing kelly whose boss jason chaffetz fox news contributor i think they still have a lot of confidence in general kelly i do think mick mulvaney if it came to that would be a great chief of staff but nonetheless even the white house spokesperson said earlier this week that they had mishandled this i do think the white house should have an accounting let aposs understand who has a security clearance and who doesn apost and if you have to take a timeout and go take another job but in the inner sanctum the closest people to the president cannot be operating with proximity to top secret classified information without a security clearance i think it aposs pretty black and white wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on twitter from brett schuchat who writes given the last year with high profile harassment and assault why wouldn apost chief of staff kelly and white house counsel don mcgahn have put porter on paid leave until accusations fully investigated was the white house deaf and blind to high profile assault stories marie how do you answer brett marie harf fox news analyst well i think that the white house was a little blind here and this isn apost the first time they aposve dealt with this you know steve bannon worked at the white house he had been accused in the past of assaulting his wife as well so this is a process story in part but it aposs also a principle story they have known for months about these allegations both wives ex wives went to the fbi gave them accounts it was only when it became a public relations problem and the photos came out that the white house actually acted so i would say in this country right now we are going through a moment where sexual harassment and sexual assault are really been a topic of discussion they aposre being handled in a much more serious way and the white house really feels like it aposs behind the eight ball here in how they handled this and i think john kelly has some answering to do for it wallace guy let me pick up on that with you because it we aposve got the president here who on friday after porter is gone after they aposve dealt with the quote public relations problem is saying well i feel sad for porter that he aposs going to have a great career and then the tweet on saturday in which he says you know we need due process here and people aposs lives are being destroyed by allegations no mention of the two ex wives guy benson fox news contributor yes well the statement from the president was one of regret on behalf of porter oh it aposs been a tough time for him we wish him the very best in his career nary a word about the alleged victims of which there are three and i aposm sympathetic to this argument that just because an allegation exists that someone should lose their job and have their life shattered but in this case you have to use reason and evidence and we know this is three women there aposs a photo of a blackened eye there aposs a police report there is a restraining order and the fbi was not giving this man a security clearance for a reason there aposs a pile of evidence and to sort of elide all of that the way that the president did in his statement i think did a disservice to this ongoing fiasco at the white house on this issue wallace let aposs turn to another subject because the president sent the democrats back there fisa memo saying that it still reveals too much intelligence sensitive intelligence that clearly set off some partisan sniping take a look begin video clip anthony scaramucci former white house communications director i love the fact that the president aposs out there explain directly to the american people this is what they sent me this is why i can apost put it out eric swalwell d california congressman i aposm skeptical of most things the president says because he is consistently inconsistent and consistently obstructive end video clip wallace but rachael while democrats are suspicious that the president is using the secret intelligence excuse to block the memo they also seem eager willing to work with the fbi and the justice department to clear up any concern so they can get their memo out rachael bade politico yes that aposs right it sounds like republicans on the hill are at least saying they are supportive of releasing this memo at some point in time paul ryan has said he wants it to be out there for transparencies sake and i think republicans are worried that if they don apost release this memo or the president blocks them from doing so that it will just undercut their entire purpose for writing the initial memo which was to highlight what they say was potential civil liberty obstruction civil liberty infringing on civil liberties of americans so i do think it aposs going to go through at some point the fbi also said they needed to redact certain information so i think democrats are willing to look at that and then they aposre going to of course send it back up to the white house if the president rejects it then i think you aposll see even more partisan bickering but i think until then we aposre going to see them working together to get it out wallace what about the argument that the democrats in a sense set the president up that they purposely put stuff in there they knew was unacceptable because it would make the president look like he was blocking it for political reasons when in fact the fbi and justice department say there is too much sensitive material there bade yes it was sort of amazing even before the memo came out we heard partisan sniping on this from both sides which just shows you how incredibly partisan this committee has actually become the memo is actually longer it aposs ten pages instead of four and it sounds like the fbi again said some of this stuff we don apost want out there so democrats are going to try to work with them on that get that part out and then try to release it from there now again if the white house rejects it for a second time then we very well will see this argument heat up wallace congressman as somebody who aposs worked in these areas as the chairman of the house oversight committee do you think the democratic memo eventually gets released and to some degree talking about picking up on rachael about the partisanship has house intel lost its credibility because of all this partisan wrangling chaffetz you want to see them come and be more united than they have been in the past but i just i just don apost believe adam schiff the flailing that he has gone through about the ramifications of the four page memo none of that turned out to be true so i do want to wallace and let aposs just remind people that he said that that this memo revealed government secrets and sources and methods and when we read it the only thing that it potentially revealed was the fact that there had been a fisa warrant granted to carter page now that aposs classified but everybody in the world knew about it chaffetz and so he lost a lot of credibility now we do need the democratic memo out there probably the most compelling piece of information to come out though will be the inspector general michael horowitz when the 450 people that he has working on that an obama appointee approved by the senate when they come out with the ig report i think that aposs going to be the most compelling to america wallace guy final word here i mean has what credibility does house intel have left when you have these two competing the parties are just totally divided on this whole issue and even what the investigation is about benson very little credibility right nunes is not trusted by the democrats at all schiff is not trusted by the republicans schiff does have a credibility problem to the congressman aposs point and the question is did they put poison pills in the memo to create this pr issue for the president i hope that you aposre right rachael that the doj fbi and schiff get in the same room figure out what to redact and get the memo out that aposs the best course of action harf i think they will i think they will bade trump ph built a wall apparently this week between the republican and the democratic staffers on the harf devin nunes did bade correct harf right bade devin nunes did and so again just wallace yes this isn apost the staff they ph all you can sit in one big room bade right wallace and now they literally have put a wall between them so he can build a wall cross talk benson yes built a wall wallace all right we have to take a break here when we come back here the stock market aposs wild week what aposs behind the correction and will it hurt the economy commercial break wallace the sister of north korean dictator kim jong un attending the winter olympics and inviting south korean president moon to meet with her brother back in pyongyang later this year and we aposre back now with the panel well marie as a state department official you dealt with north korea they aposre clearly engaged at these winter olympics in a charm offensive and at the opening ceremony you can see there there was president vice president pence ph and right over his shoulder in the second row was kim aposs younger sister who aposs also a top advisor are they succeeding in their effort which is pretty obvious to try to drive a wedge between the u s and south korea harf well i think it aposs worth keeping in mind that if there is some conflict if we cannot solve this diplomatically it is the south koreans who will bear the brunt of this conflict if it were to happen so just from a human interest perspective seeing the athletes from the north and the south march in together i actually think was a reminder of the stakes here and i think the north or excuse me the south koreans have been concerned about some of the inconsistencies coming out of the trump administration about negotiations whether they aposre still on the table what the pre conditions could be so i think the north and the south have put out there a possible way to start talking to avoid conflict we shouldn apost be naive but the trump administration really needs to you know narrow their focus on what their policy is on what they aposre looking for out of negotiations because our allies are pretty scared by some of this talk of preemptive strike of a bloody nose ph strike that scares them because they will bear the brunt of that conflict wallace but guy the point of the trump policy to put pressure on north korea and to isolate them the reason for all this is because they want to seek kim stop his nuclear program stop the missiles stop the nuclear tests if you get south korea saying well we don apost need that you can keep your nukes that has a real implication not only for south korea but for the world benson it could and i think what the trump administration would argue is that the previous administration aposs approach and frankly others had been virtually the same for years and has not paid dividends to put it kindly and being more unpredictable is actually what is needed in this circumstance i also briefly want to go back to your point about this charm offensive by pyongyang at the olympics it is distressing and bewildering to me watching how much our media seems to be buying into it the swooning and the gushing over the cheer squad that is cheering under threat of death you know for their families and this sister of a vicious killer giving side eye to the vice president a lot of people saying oh you know she aposs slaying she aposs stealing the spotlight we should not be buying into north korean propaganda wallace but here aposs what the only point that i disagree with you saying that this is media creation i watched the opening ceremony at they had a north korean and south korean athletes two of them going up the stairs with the flame to deliver it to the final person who lit the flame i mean the south koreans are buying into that that has real implications in terms of the south korean u s alliance benson that aposs fine that aposs fine my concern is the celebration of kim aposs sister and talking about oh isn apost aren apost these cheerleaders cute to me that aposs dangerous because this is a brutal regime and it seems like they are putting out chum in the water and there are people in out media willing to eat it up and we shouldn apost wallace how concerned are you congressman chaffetz about the danger of north korea splitting south korea off and thereby weakening the alliance we aposre trying to create of the world against the kim regime and its nuclear ambitions chaffetz we obviously want peace and we want some prosperity but we aposve also got to make sure that they don apost get the nuclear capability and so you have to be able to do both and again president moon who aposs still fairly new into this position is a great partner to the united states you also saw vice president pence sitting next to the prime minister of japan and a very important symbol there as well wallace all right the other big news this week was the wild ride on wall street take a look begin video clip unidentified male the dow is down more than a thousand points now officially in correction territory end video clip wallace last week we saw two separate thousand point drops the two biggest point drops not percentage drops but point drops in history which makes me wonder rachael with all the concern that we saw in those drops about the economy overheating rising inflation rising interest rates was there any talk in congress as they were passing his huge spending bill which is going to add hundreds of billions of dollars more in deficits was there any talk that this only adds to that problem bade yes absolutely particularly from conservatives jim jordan as you just interviewed conservatives are not happy with this deal at all i mean obviously this is a 300 billion increase in spending a whole debt ceiling increased for a year increasing the national debt by more than a trillion dollars potentially over 20 trillion which it is currently look conservatives are not happy with this at all this is not something they want to campaign on back home there was some republicans who voted for this just because they didn apost want to vote against military spending and they were wallace well when you say some republicans it was a majority bade that aposs right wallace in was 167 169 republicans in the house and a majority of republicans in the senate and that aposs what i aposm wondering i mean did they express no concern about what they were approving bade you know a lot of them were not happy that they had to take this vote and leadership has been using the same sort of justification that mulvaney gave you this in morning which is we needed to bolster the military and there was only one way to get it we had to increase spending for democratic priorities in order to do this as well and so a lot of them did so reluctantly but we aposll see how much it hurts the next election wallace congressman chaffetz what happened to your party the party of fiscal restraint chaffetz they blew up they put a torch to the mantle of fiscal discipline that is long gone you know there aposs been a lot of talk about a parade around here they should be doing a parade for chuck schumer because he took them to the cleaners i mean he really did listen he got every spending priority that he wanted nothing was cut if took reconciliation the most powerful tool that the republicans had off the table and it aposs just unbelievable to me that we were spending this much money nobody campaigned on that and there is going to be a political price taken particularly in the primaries wallace so so explained to me as somebody who was in congress until recently why i mean i understand the argument well you need 60 votes in the senate which means you needed nine democrats to come along why did republicans do it i mean they did have the majority in the house in the senate and they had a republican president and they went along chaffetz look at the trajectory over the last few days it just happened in a couple of days i mean at least rand paul was trying to have at least a little bit of a semblance of a debate on one of the most massive things that the congress does in this spending it aposs absolutely unbelievable to me i just i can apost even fathom the idea that if we had gone into the election saying we aposre going to raise spending and we aposre going to go back to trillion dollar deficits none of these republicans would have gotten elected we love our military but we aposre in the majority in the house the senate and we have the presidency and we have this kind of deficit it aposs unbelievable wallace i aposve got less than a minute left guy let aposs talk about the election i brought this up with jim jordan what impact does this have on the 2018 midterms you aposve got conservative voters out there who were promised certain things if they elected a republican government they did and this is what they get benson i think there will be some tea party leaning republicans who are wondering where did the tea party go and will it emerge again when there aposs a democrat in the white house and if that aposs the case will it be convincing and i think the republicans have done themselves harm wallace i mean that aposs the interesting thing some people are seeing the only way you get hard republican on spending is to have a democrat as president bade that aposs how it feels to a democrat i should say wallace yes elect a elect a democrat and cut the deficit bade exactly wallace thanks panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the army aposs art collection including powerful nazi propaganda from world war ii under lock and key commercial break wallace one of the highlights of this job is to get to see historic treasure trove not open to the public and to share them with all of you a few days ago the army opened its doors to show us one of those collections here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape charles bowery u s army center of military history they used it to enhance in their view toward the sanctity of the nazi way of life wallace voice over charles bowery is the chief of army history and we met at a huge warehouse at fort belvoir outside washington that holds thousands of pieces of military art and artifacts the battle standard of an african american regiment in the civil war a taliban motorcycle norman rockwell illustrations from world war ii wallace on camera do you ever feel like you aposre in that huge warehouse at the end of indiana jones bowery we make that joke all the time wallace voice over but we were there to see the army aposs stash of nazi propaganda 586 pieces seized during hitler aposs fall and sent back to the u s unidentified male hitler aposs retreat at berchtesgaden the luxurious mountain residents wallace the man in charge of the operation gordon bilki ph who was appointed by president roosevelt wallace on camera why was it so important to remove this art from germany post war bowery they believed that the presence of these pieces in german society could be essentially a powder keg that could kick off additional incidents of the rise of nazism wallace voice over pieces like this 1937 painting in the beginning was the word bowery the piece is very intentionally titled to mirror the first verse of the book of john in the bible and it very clearly equates adolf hitler with john the baptist wallace on camera it aposs an almost god like figure and his disciples bowery that aposs correct wallace voice over the army seized another work called the standard bearer bowery it portrays adolf hitler as a medieval night he aposs carrying a nazi flag he aposs mounted on a horse and he is prepared to lead his people into battle wallace on camera now what is this hole their bowery an american soldier took his rifle bayonet and he punched through the eye of hitler as a direct message wallace voice over the army found this huge bust of hitler in the eagles nest unidentified male where the nazi furor ph held meetings of triumph in the mountains of bavaria wallace a grand hall he used for key meetings bowery the monumental scale of it conveys his personal power and the fact that this was a cult of personality that he led through individual magnetism wallace perhaps most fascinating are these watercolors painted by hitler as an aspiring art student and then a soldier in world war i long before his rise to power bowery one of the comments on his early evaluations of his work was that while he was pretty good at depicting buildings and structures he was not so good at depicting human life wallace but chances are you will never get to see any of these works in person the army keeps them locked up in its mammoth storage facility wallace on camera is there concern that some of these pieces could be used as a rallying point for neo nazis here in this country bowery that aposs the heart of the tight control that we maintain over the collection wallace it could be potentially dangerous bowery the term i like to use is powerful end videotape wallace the army is building a national museum near fort belvoir to open in 2020 that will house many of the m
