ed for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion joseph stalin once said if i could control the medium of the american motion picture i would need nothing else to convert the entire world to communism the chinese government is taking those words to heart china s communist party claims that efforts should be made to manifest core socialist values in internet publicity culture and service president xi jinping has vowed to strengthen china s soft power and build its capacity in international communication in his words the stories of china should be well told voices of china well spread and characteristics of china well explained the country now spends 10 billion every year on external propaganda chinese officials are intent on spreading favorable spins of the chinese communist government from repression of its citizens to its aggressive foreign policy and military buildup agenda top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed how are they doing it in part by buying u s film studios and movie theater chains which the government accountability office gao recently agreed to review in depth it comes at a crucial time china s foot soldier is dalian wanda a chinese firm closely aligned to the communist party in 2012 wanda bought amc entertainment the second largest movie theater chain in the country for 2 6 billion it purchased legendary entertainment the producer of the dark knight trilogy for an even heftier 3 5 billion in january wanda owned amc now plans to buy carmike cinemas for 1 2 billion forming the country s largest chain with 8 380 screens in more than 600 theaters the company has also shown interest in buying at least a portion of lionsgate corp and paramount pictures if not some of hollywood s big six studios wanda s founder and chairman wang jianlin is not shy about his ambitions or his ties to the chinese government a former communist deputy and china s wealthiest man mr wang strives to turn wanda into a juggernaut in the movie industry through high dollar mergers and acquisitions that grant him greater control of major production and distribution channels ownership of amc theaters for example will allow mr wang to promote his country s motion pictures to american moviegoers and to depress viewing of films and treatments he may not want viewed by american audiences before wanda s takeover the company s cinemas showed no chinese films yet now put on double digit productions every year as mr wang puts it amc s boss is chinese so more chinese films should be in their theaters where possible and he has used the chinese government s soft power policy to his advantage calling it very beneficial to wanda s bottom line mr wang has steered at least 1 1 billion in government subsidies to wanda he has sold company stakes to relatives of some of china s most powerful politicians and business executives including the business partner of former prime minister wen jiabao s daughter and relatives of two members of the politburo the communist party s principal policymaking committee qi qiaoqiao the elder sister of president xi jinping was also an early wanda investor mr wang s motto says it all stay close to the government and distant from politics the cozy relationship blurs the line between wanda s interests and the communist party s while the company gains greater market share through mergers and acquisitions it also gains the opportunity to alter movie scripts prerelease and prevent certain films from being shown at wanda owned theaters if chinese officials lobby for it it s not a stretch pixels the 2015 action comedy flick initially depicted aliens blasting a hole in the great wall the scene was removed entirely from the final version of the movie similarly the 2012 remake of red dawn originally featured chinese soldiers invading an american town but filmmakers changed the invaders into north koreans without even receiving a formal complaint from beijing wanda recently bankrolled the 25 million production budget of southpaw becoming the first chinese firm to solely finance an american movie and it left fingerprints everywhere according to david glasser who helped produce and market the film wanda was involved it wasn t just a silent investment mr glasser went even further they were on the set and involved in production postproduction marketing everything what prevents mr wang s company from removing a scene critical of china s aggressive military posturing in the south china sea or keeping such a movie out of its american theaters fortunately congress is aware of china s subtle power play the promised gao review came in response to a request from 18 bipartisan members of congress to investigate mr wang s dealmaking and the effects of chinese propagandizing through state supported companies rep john culberson texas republican also asked the department of justice to launch a review of the foreign agents registration act to see if the foreign propaganda influence over american media was being sufficiently addressed wang jainlin the wanda ceo will be in hollywood this week on a public relations tour promoting his government s offer to subsidize american film making in china congress should heed stalin s words it may be a bridge too far for the communist chinese to achieve these control goals however there will be a lot of mischief experienced while they try richard berman is the president of berman and company a public affairs firm in washi
