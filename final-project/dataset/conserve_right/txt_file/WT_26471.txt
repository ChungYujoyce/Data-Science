tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn there was a time on capitol hill when democrats accused republicans of being cowardly because they did not stand up to president trump both as a candidate and eventually as president the washington post cited the gop s cowardice problem over a year ago as did salon which asked when did the gop add cowardice to its platform earlier this year house judiciary chairman adam schiff declared there was an epidemic of cowardice among republicans who did not push back against mr trump such criticism appears to have had an effect on the grand old party and it could cost them republican voters have noticed and are vexed by gop lawmakers who appear to appease democrats by not standing fast with president trump as he faces impeachment these republicans are taking the inaction personally it s completely ticking me off now i m to the point where i want to start calling my senator and say i m not going vote for you unless you promise to do this to the next democratic president i m done with what s happening to trump on a chronic basis one listener told rush limbaugh on tuesday top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian

racial minorities the major networks maintain silence in hopes that their socially corrosive lies will stick until november 2020 at least three significant events demonstrate how the big media bury trump s bridge building and thus keep the u s in a divided racially explosive rage writes national review columnist deroy murdock he cites mr trump s salute last month to 50 000 immigrants from india and americans of indian descent a significant event which received no coverage whatsoever from nbc cbs and abc which instead focused on a movie a lost dog and football respectively mr trump also appeared at the 2019 historically black colleges and universities week conference in september here too all three evening news shows entombed this story mr murdock said noting that abc covered the dallas cowboys cheerleaders doubling their pay cbs featured the medical benefits of naps while nbc showcased a 9 year old ohioan who was lunch shamed at school the columnist was also annoyed by the media s absence following mr trump s call to end anti semitism during a national day of prayer ceremony at the white house this year none of the three big networks spared a moment to report on the president rallying the republic against anti semitism says mr murdock rather than give americans all this news and confirm that president trump is neither anti immigrant nor anti black nor anti
