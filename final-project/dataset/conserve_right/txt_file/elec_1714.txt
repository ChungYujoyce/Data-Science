uhh hillary clinton nearly lost the 2016 democratic nomination to sen bernie sanders and now we know she personally does not like the vermont socialist either ahead of a new documentary about her failed 2016 campaign clinton confirmed in an interview with the hollywood reporter that she is not a bernie bro a phrase used to refer to sanders supporters in the documentary clinton says of sanders he was in congress for years he had one senator support him nobody likes him nobody wants to work with him he got nothing done he was a career politician it s all just baloney and i feel so bad that people got sucked into it when asked if her assessment still holds today clinton told the hollywood reporter yes it does in fact clinton declined to say whether she would endorse sanders and campaign on his behalf if he secures the democratic nomination later this year instead she slammed sanders and his campaign culture googletag cmd push function googletag display div gpt ad in content 300x250 102 i m not going to go there yet we re still in a very vigorous primary season i will say however that it s not only him it s the culture around him it s his leadership team it s his prominent supporters it s his online bernie bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors particularly the women clinton said i really hope people are paying attention to that because it should be worrisome that he has permitted this culture not only permitted he seems to really be very much supporting it she continued i think that that s a pattern that people should take into account when they make their decisions responding to allegations that sanders privately told sen elizabeth warren d mass that she would not be elected president because she is a woman clinton ripped into sanders and likened him to president donald trump i just think people need to pay attention because we want hopefully to elect a president who s going to try to bring us together and not either turn a blind eye or actually reward the kind of insulting attacking demeaning degrading behavior that we ve seen from this current administration clinton said the documentary on clinton s campaign which will stream on hulu will be released on march 6
