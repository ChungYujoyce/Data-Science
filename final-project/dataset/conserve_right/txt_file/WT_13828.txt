travel period when hundreds of millions of people return to their hometowns for the most important family holiday of the year during the weeks long period authorities emphasize safety on the road and

amplified harm and risk to the public resulting in such casualties li said of the driver li said the incident also points to the need for increased safety awareness in china where gas canisters and other highly dangerous objects are sometimes transported on flatbed tricycles even in major cities such as beijing it indicates how urgent it is for the government to step up promotion of public safety knowledge and awareness li said hours after the crash shanghai police posted a social media message warning drivers to never ever smoke or toss cigarette butts in proximity of flammable objects
