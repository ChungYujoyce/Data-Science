from a virus increased by more than 1 300 in just the last 24 hours but president trump says the country must prepare for even worse with this warning begin video clip trump this will be probably the toughest week between this week and next week and there will be a lot of deaths unfortunately end video clip wallace here are the latest developments forty one states and the district of columbia now issuing stay at home orders and new guidance from the cdc encouraging people to wear a face mask outside even though president trump says he won apost in a moment we aposll speak with the surgeon general dr jerome adams but first let aposs bring mark meredith reporting from the white house with the latest from the front lines mark mark meredith fox news correspondent chris the president aposs task force says it aposs focused on places like detroit chicago and new orleans cities where covid 19 cases are on the rise and the president is ordering at least 1 000 medical personnel to new york to fight the virus begin videotape unidentified female every day when i go to work i feel like a sheep going to slaughter meredith america aposs medical community faces a grim reality as the coronavirus spreads nationwide many fear there aposs not enough equipment staff or supplies to save lives unidentified female we are demanding from this hospital the protections that we need meredith new york aposs governor says he aposs shifting resources to help hospitals most in need cuomo i aposm not going to let people die because we didn apost redistribute ventilators the national guard are going to be deployed to pick up these ventilators which are all across the state and deploy them to places where we need them meredith in new york state alone at least 3 500 people have died and the president says the worst is yet to come trump we are getting to the point where it aposs going to really be some very bad numbers meredith the government is increasing its supply of hydroxychloroquine a drug normally used to treat malaria but health experts stress there aposs no guarantee the drug will save lives tiffany pinckney former covid 19 patient it is definitely overwhelming to know that in my blood there may be answers meredith people once infected are now helping researchers test treatments the fda is examining the use of plasma from recovered patients to treat the sick end videotape meredith the cdc is now urging americans to use a cloth face mask while out on the public but the president said on friday chris he does not plan to use one himself chris wallace mark meredith reporting from the white house mark thanks wallace and joining us now the u s surgeon general vice admiral jerome adams dr adams the u s is now reporting 30 000 new cases a day and i want to put up a chart that shows the curve of cases in italy and china which have leveled up and are now going down and the curve on the far right there here in the u s which is still in the early ages and still headed up sharply given the course of the disease in china and italy and that we are weeks and months behind them how bad is this epidemic going to be in america and how long will it last dr jerome adams u s surgeon general well it aposs tragically fitting that we aposre talking at the beginning of holy week because this is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most americans apos lives quite frankly this is going to be our pearl harbor moment our 9 11 moment only it aposs not going to be localized it aposs going to be happening all over the country and i want america to understand that but i also want them to understand that the public along with the state and the federal government have a power to change the trajectory of this epidemic you mentioned italy and spain they had a very very hard time and they aposre still having a hard time but they seem to have reached their peak and are coming back down on the other side and you say weeks months behind i would actually push back a little bit when you look at their trajectory from about a month ago is when they really started to lean into their aggressive mitigation efforts their really aggressive mitigation efforts and so i want americans to understand that as hard as this week is going to be there is a light at the end of the tunnel if everyone does their part for the next 30 days we aposre seeing washington actually where this started doing a much better job california aposs trajectory has leveled off and so there is hope but we aposve got to all do our part wallace let aposs talk about mitigation because the president aposs top health advisers including you say the most important thing we can do all of us is to stay at home and yet there are still nine states there are still nine states with millions of americans that still have not issued stay at home orders president trump was asked about that this week here he is begin video clip president donald j trump i inaudible talk to the governors the governors know what they aposre doing they aposve been doing a great job i guess we aposre close to 90 percent anyway and states that we aposre talking about are not in jeopardy no i would leave it to the governors end video clip wallace but dr adams the coronavirus is not a state issue it doesn apost follow or respect state borders dr fauci says he believes that there should be a national stay at home order is he wrong adams well chris it aposs important to understand that most people across the country are doing the right thing over 90 percent of the country is staying at home and a good proportion more than average are staying at home even in those nine states but the last time you and i talked it was about opioids people don apost know but i aposve run a state department of health i aposve been involved in health for years and diseases don apost respect state lines but we live in a country where we have a system of federalism and when it comes to opioids states have different rules and regulations and laws regarding treatment regarding syringe service programs as you and i have talked about i actually put out a report on tobacco cessation earlier this year and we know that states have different laws there and more people will die even in the worst projections from cigarette smoking in this country than are going to die from from coronavirus this year and so we always are struggling with truing to get information out to guide people that we know will help them be healthy with states apos rights but it aposs why we put out these three days to stop the spread guidelines these are essentially our national stay at home order and we aposre working with governors to figure out their needs their desires one more important point the nine states that haven apost yet done shelter in place orders are states that actually produce a large amount of our food so they aposre struggling with issues concerning what how they can provide for the rest of the country to be able to stay at home but right now my what i would say to those governors is if you can apost give us a month give us what you can give us a week give us whatever you can to stay at home during this particularly tough time when we aposre going to be hitting our peak over the next next seven to 10 days wallace but doctor but dr adams there aposs a big difference between opioids and cigarettes which are something that people decide to use or not to use and the coronavirus which people catch it aposs not an individual choice and you know when president trump says that he aposs a wartime president during world war ii fdr didn apost say well it aposs up to each state to decide what to do he mobilized the nation again why not a national stay at home order the coronavirus doesn apost recognize states apos rights so does the federal analogy really work here adams well chris i know we could go forever in coronavirus time but i would remind people that it was just a week ago when the idea of a federal quarantine for the new york city area was being floated and governor cuomo said that would be like declaring war on the state the governors are intensely protective of their right and rightly so to be able to decide what aposs best for their states and we aposre going to do everything we can as scientists and as physicians as medical professionals to help them understand what we think the right thing is for them to do and so i just want everyone to know that from a national perspective the surgeon general was saying no matter where you are stay at home at least give us a week or two if you can we want you to do it for 30 days but even in those nine states give us what you can so we can get this peak and start to come down on the other side wallace dr adams for days president trump has been talking about hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for people with the coronavirus but yesterday in his briefing he took it even further take a look begin video clip trump what do you have to lose in some cases they aposre in bad shape what do you have to lose i may take it and i aposll have to ask my doctors about that but i may take it end video clip wallace dr adams as the nation aposs top public health official are you comfortable with people taking an unproven untested drug even people who don apost actually have the virus adams well here aposs what we aposve advised the president and here aposs what i aposve heard him say consistently when people are in a tragic situation where they they aposre in the hospital or a loved one aposs in the hospital with covid 19 we want them to be able to have a conversation with their health care provider about everything that they could possibly do to save their life there are some accounts some stories out there regarding hydroxychloroquine helping and we know it aposs been available for years so we feel a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug even though this is being used at much higher dosages and so we just want to be able to facilitate physicians and patients having that conversation that aposs what i tell people that aposs what i aposve heard the president tell people wallace finally and i aposve got about a minute left here dr adams the cdc now recommends that people use face coverings in public and in fact your cdc video in which you show people how to make a mask themselves that they can wear but president trump was clear that he is not going to be following that guidance take a look here sir begin video clip trump i think wearing a face mask as i greet presidents prime ministers dictators kings queens i don apost know somehow i don apost see it for myself end video clip wallace does that statement by the president send a mixed message about taking this recommendation seriously adams well if you look at the cdc guidelines they actually emphasize that number one they aposre voluntary and number two and the most important part of this is they aposre not a substitute for social distancing i was at the white house yesterday i aposm going there immediately after this and the white house doctors and secret service are taking pains to make sure everyone is social distancing in regards to the president and the vice president and each other and so the president is making a choice that aposs appropriate for him what i want americans to know is if you aposre going out in public and you aposre going to be closer than six feet to other people you can use a cloth facial covering and here aposs mine that i made very easy to use and it protects you from me we want people to understand you aposre wearing this not to protect yourself you aposre using it to protect your neighbor and that aposs what this week is going to be all about people staying at home to protect their neighbor people wearing cloth facial coverings if they have to go our in public to protect their neighbor this is going to be a test of our resolve it aposs going to be the test of our lives but i am confident that we can come out on the other side based on the data and based on what i know about the american people wallace dr adams thank you thanks for your time during these very busy days please come back sir adams thank you wallace up next bill gates who has spent billions on public health and who warned the world five years ago about the threat from a pandemic commercial break wallace i want to play a clip for you that aposs been viewed more than 26 million times begin video clip gates if anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades it aposs most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war not missiles but microbes end video clip wallace that was bill gates back in 2015 five years ago warning about precisely the kind of threat we aposre all facing right now since then gates has been doing everything he can to prevent a pandemic two months ago the gates foundation committed 100 million to fight the coronavirus earlier i sat down with bill gates to discuss what we need to do now begin videotape wallace bill it took four months to reach half a million cases around the world and just seven days to add another half million cases so how dangerous how fearsome is this virus and how do you see this epidemic playing out in the u s gates well this is a nightmare scenario because human to human transmissible respiratory viruses can grow exponentially and you know if we had kept on going to work traveling like we were you know that curve would never bend until you have the majority of the people infected and then a massive number seeking hospital care and lots and lots of death so you know we had to use quarantine which is an old thing back from the days of the plague as our primary tool fortunately if we use that well enough we should towards the end of this month start to see those numbers level off and then if we continue country wide and we aposre testing the right people to understand what aposs going on which is not the case yet those numbers will start to go down and then we can look at some degree of opening back up wallace president trump aposs top health advisors are talking about somewhere between 100 000 and 240 000 deaths over the next two months does that sound about right to you in terms of the lethality and the length of the outbreak here in the u s gates well if we do the social distancing properly we should be able to get out of this with the death number well short of that it aposs very important that those numbers are out there because a lot of people are still thinking hey this is like normal not waking up every day to a completely new reality and so i was very glad that those models are out there you know dr fauci is doing a very good job of saying the numbers are what count here and you know the various models that we and imperial university do show that without is dramatic behavior change you could even get worse than that but i do think if we get the testing fixed we get all 50 states involved we aposll be below that of course we aposll pay a huge economic price in order to achieve that wallace you say that if we do everything right now in terms of testing and shutting the country down that we should have only one wave of this virus why are you so confident because a lot of people aren apost so sure that we aposre not going to have a recurrence when we get another flu season next fall gates well we don apost know how seasonal this virus is you know it would probably be good for the northern hemisphere if the force of infection goes down when we get into spring and summer and you know give us some time to get both the drugs and advance the vaccine it is fair to say things won apost go back to truly normal until we have a vaccine that we aposve gotten out to basically the entire world and so you know the best people at the foundation were all about high volume vaccines and are working with many many manufacturers not only on the safety net but getting that billions of dose capacity and so like china there will be a partial opening up which some jobs will resume school will resume but we aposll have to be very very careful not to have the rebound until the vaccine comes wallace now you talk about the foundation all the way back on february 5th the gates foundation committed 100 million to fight this virus but you point out the fact that the our government like a lot of other governments was very slow to respond really another two months we might have lost how much did that cost us in terms of the spread of this disease that one or two months that we lost gates well there are countries like taiwan who are exemplary saw the problem and really got the testing community wide testing done very well they prioritize who got tested and so they won apost either have the disease burden or the economic effect that other countries will have china by late january had taken it seriously and so their ability to get the cases come down has been dramatic south korea has done that and so there are lessons that we aposre learning from and you know we aposre all in this together we aposve got to get rid of coronavirus from the entire world you know the u s we can see how tough it is here likely it will be even worse in the developing countries who as yet don apost have nearly as many cases wallace how do you think the federal and the state governments are responding now and would you prefer to see it all being handled on a national level whether it aposs stay at home orders or testing or the supply chain would you prefer to see this all being handled on a national centralized level rather than state by state gates well when you have finite resources you need to allocate them to where there is the most certainly the because people move around the country we have to have the shutdown or else you aposll have exponential growth that will spread back into other parts of the country in terms of testing people have gotten confused and think it aposs just about numbers the key is that you have a response to the test in less than 24 hours and that you aposre prioritizing the right people and so although the numbers are going up we aposre not yet focusing in on that you know medical personnel or somebody who aposs keeping the electronic network or the food distribution working and being able to save somebody who test very quickly test their contacts and so you know i do think you know that allocation prioritization of testing will be a key tactic for us to get into good shape wallace and at that needs to be done at a national level not a state level gates that aposs right i mean you have some states that it just happens a number of pcr machines in that state are very few and you wouldn apost think hey that aposs the way they should be done also the outbreak you know is bigger in some areas and so therefore that drives the testing demand likewise the ventilator demand i mean this is all very ad hoc because we never did a full blown simulation there were a few things done but it aposs not like war where we do war games all the time we have people standing by resources standing by in a dramatic level you know we aposre kind of figuring this out as we go which you know people are rising to the occasion and you know it aposs fantastic to see that but you know every day we can see that case number is still going up wallace when you gave that famous ted talk five years ago you laid out a lot of the things that were starting to do now like research and development on new tests and r d on vaccines but so many countries around the world including the u s back in 2015 largely ignored your warnings why do you think that was gates well there aposs it aposs hard to put money into something where you don apost know if it aposs going to happen we do for fires because you know we aposve seen that over time we do for war in fact 600 billion a year in that case what would have been required you know is nothing like that the ability to make a test super quickly the ability to know a library of drugs that would work for this an ability to have the vaccine very quickly i am sure after this which is just such a gigantic impact that we will put that money in but between 2015 and 2020 less than 5 percent of what should have been done was done but people didn apost get that this is the biggest single threat that could disrupt our way of life which you know even having predicted that as a risk i aposm really stunned at how you know tough it is to go through this you know the medical cost the economic cost the psychological cost everybody aposs lives have been completely upended and that aposs not just the united states it aposs almost the entire world wallace well let me ask you personally about that bill and melinda gates i think it aposs fair to say are not your typical american family but how has this virus this epidemic how is it upended your life and how personally are you dealing with and processing what we are going through now gates well i aposm you know a lot more isolated the meetings are our on a software microsoft teams you know even friends that i would normally go see you know we aposre doing videoconferencing which seems a bit unusual you know there aposs a lot of anxiety about you know how far does this go we have employees of the foundation who feel a bit isolate you know because there just in our apartment some with their kids there feel it aposs very crowded so how do we help people deal with this you know a lot of people are rising to the occasion but you know for me you know my life is just completely different i wake up every morning and think is this real or was it something i had a nightmare about wallace and like all the rest of us i mean do you get scared sometimes and if so about what gates well this isn apost the worst case that is the 1 percent or so case fatality rate when your medical system is not overloaded if this was smallpox that would be like 30 percent so this is super super bad but you know we will eventually get a vaccine even before then if we do the right things we aposll be able to open up significant parts of the economy and you know so once you aposre in the crisis you aposre just doing your best to deal with it i aposm sure you know once we get past this we will look back understand what we could have done differently and make sure that we aposre not letting it happen again particularly because it could be even worse in terms of the fatality rate wallace bill gates next time you give one of these speeches i hope i trust people will listen thank you so much gates thank you end videotape wallace up next the nation aposs governors hunt for life saving equipment as coronavirus cases spike in their states we aposll sit down with michigan governor gretchen whitmer that aposs next commercial break chris wallace fox news anchor coming up we aposll talk with michigan governor gretchen whitmer about the toll of the coronavirus on her state begin video clip gov gretchen whitmer d mi we know that we are in for a tough three four five six weeks we are far from out of the emergency that we find ourselves in end video clip wallace we aposll ask whitmer what her state needs most next commercial break wallace while the new york city area is now getting hit hardest by the coronavirus one of the big questions is what sections of this country will get hammered next joining us now is michigan governor gretchen whitmer whose state is showing a lot of warning signs governor let aposs start by putting up the latest numbers from michigan more than 14 000 cases of the virus now in your state that aposs the third most of any state in the country and 540 deaths and somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of those are in the detroit area we keep hearing that detroit is going to be the next hot spot how badly do you expect to get hit there and for how long gov gretchen whitmer d mi well what we do know is that it aposs growing exponentially and we aposre seeing that it is not it doesn apost discriminate based on city lines state line party line this is something that is aggressively growing in all age groups all across our most populous part of the state which is southeast michigan we know that we aposve got hospitals that are already at capacity we don apost have enough personal protection equipment and that aposs precisely what my call to action has been to stay home i executed that order almost two weeks ago we aposre asking people to stay home and do their part and we aposre asking everyone to chip in to help us get more ppe for our front line responders wallace so let me pick up on that last point how close is your health care system especially in the southeast part of the state around detroit how close is it to getting overwhelmed how close are you to the edge in tests and ventilators and personal protective equipment whitmer yes so you know we don apost have enough tests and i know that aposs not unique to michigan it is an issue across the country in order to really have a handle on how many people have had covid 19 and how prevalent it is we really need to do be doing much more robust testing right now we aposve got a number of hospitals that are already at capacity we aposre setting up an off site field hospital at tcf working with the army corps of engineers and the vice president who aposs been very helpful and we aposre really grateful for that but we know right now that we are going day to day to day in on terms of having the n95 masks gowns gloves for our front line and that aposs i think where we aposre spending so much of our energy trying to get more out of the stockpile trying to contract with anyone where we can get these materials have michigan businesses ramping up production wallace president trump says that the federal government the national stockpile is the second line of defense that it aposs basically up to the states to prepare for these emergencies here he is on that begin video clip donald trump president of the united states the states should be building we aposre a backup we aposre not an orderly clerk we aposre a backup and we aposve done an unbelievable job end video clip wallace and the feds the president said yesterday just sent 300 ventilators to michigan so does the president have a point about where the prime responsibility here lies whitmer well let me start with this i aposm grateful for the help that we aposve gotten the 300 ventilators will save 300 lives maybe 600 if we can use one vent for two people like doctors are working on here in michigan but i will say this not having a national strategy where there is one policy for the country as opposed to a patchwork based on whomever the governor is is something that i think is creating a more porous situation where covid 19 will go longer and more people will get sick and and sadly more lives may get lost and that aposs precisely why i think we all have to do our jobs we are not one another aposs enemy the enemy is covid 19 and it has to be all hands on deck from the federal level to the state level to the local level and that aposs precisely what we aposre trying to do because covid 19 as i said doesn apost discriminate on party line or state line and that aposs why we have to have a national strategy and we all have to be working on the same team wallace i want to pick up on that in a second but first of all i want to ask you about another aspect of this crisis and that is the economic crisis michigan is getting hit hard in that side too and 311 000 people filed for new unemployment claims just this last week if this goes on the staying at home businesses closed down if it goes on through april if it goes on into may how close is your state to economic collapse whitmer well i mean there aposs no question this is we aposll all going to have economic suffering because of covid 19 that aposs not unique to one part of the country or another but what i can say is that the longer we aposre combating this the harder it aposs going to be on our economy and that aposs why we aposve acted swiftly and aggressively to have a policy that hopefully shortens the amount of time that we aposre confronting covid 19 lessons the number of people that get sick and it lessens the number of fatalities but we need that kind of a response in a in a broader sense across the country because the longer this goes on the harder it aposs going to be on all of our economies i do have a lot of people that are out of work now a lot of businesses that may not open yet again and all these decisions weigh heavily on me but at the end of the day i know i aposve got to listen to the epidemiologists and the scientists and the brilliant minds who can tell us what the trajectory looks like and the shorter we make it the better for our health and the better for our economy wallace i want to pick up on something you said earlier talking about the patchwork national response you and president trump have had a dust up over his policies in the last few weeks here aposs some of the things that you have said about him you aposve called the president aposs policies excuse me patchwork inconsistent and lackadaisical and not surprisingly he aposs fired back at you begin video clip donald trump president of the united states all she does is she has no idea what aposs going on and all she does is say oh it aposs the federal government aposs fault and we aposve taken such great care of michigan end video clip wallace you he has also called you governor half whitmer now you say you don apost want to waste time on fighting with the president but you have been critical saying that things like testing like stay at home orders like use of the defense production act it has to be done more on a national level than on a state by state basis whitmer i think that aposs true and i think that aposs a fair analysis none of the comments that i aposve made have been a personal attack in nature i don apost do that kind of thing i got elected in a state that voted for president trump or 2016 and then voted overwhelmingly for me i won by almost ten points in 2018 i don apost wage those kind of political attacks what i do though is i speak truth to power and the fact of the matter is it aposs not a national patchwork policy it aposs patchwork because we aposre leaving it to the governors if we had a national strategy i think it would be better for us in the long run and that is just i think an analysis of the science and the facts and what aposs going on across our country and i think that you know that aposs a fair thing to observe i aposve spoken with the president i aposve spoken with the vice president many times the army corps fema and we aposre grateful for any federal partnership we can get i aposm doing my job and part of my job is telling people what i aposve learned what i think we can do better and what we are going to continue to do to protect people wallace i aposve got and i don apost want to spend a lot of time on this i aposve only got i aposve got less than a minute but it joe biden now says that you aposre on his short list of possible running mates is there some politics being played here both you towards the president and the president towards you whitmer you know not on my part i can just tell you this i didn apost ask to be thrust into the national spotlight i you know don apost don apost like attacks frankly but at the end of the day my job i aposve been on this job for 15 months my job is to do everything i can do to protect the 10 million people in michigan that means locking arms with everyone who is going to be an ally and welcoming all people that want to be helpful and that aposs where we aposre asking for help nationally michigan is a hot spot we need assistance and i aposm grateful for any partnership at the federal level or any partnerships with businesses that want to help out because we desperately need ppe lives on the line here wallace governor whitmer thank you thanks for joining us we wish you and your state of michigan all the best in the coming days up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the huge federal response to the epidemic and the political battle over how those trillions of your dollars will be spent commercial break begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d ca it aposs called a house select committee on the coronavirus crisis we need to ensure those dollars are spent carefully and effectively donald trump president of the united states this witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt and in the end the people doing the witch hunt have been losing and they aposve been losing by a lot end video clip wallace house speaker nancy pelosi setting up a new oversight committee which president trump promptly dismissed as more partisan politics and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz former democratic congresswoman jane harman and guy benson of fox news radio congressman chaffetz what aposs wrong with speaker pelosi setting up a committee on the coronavirus congress has passed 2 trillion in taxpayer money to throw at to hopefully respond to the virus doesn apost some congressional oversight make sense jason chaffetz fox news contributor and former congressman r ut well there should be congressional oversight but there already is an oversight committee i used to chair it there are also other committees like financial services and others this seems premature it seems like an aggressive move if you will to give some additional powers before they aposve been able to even execute and start on this and i remind people that the 9 11 commission i think started something like a year after 9 11 actually happened so yes to oversight but we already have an oversight committee it aposs the second largest committee and all of congress and it spends nearly 10 million and yet pelosi wants to have another committee already it doesn apost make sense wallace congresswoman harman speaker pelosi said the other day as president trump fiddles americans are dying and one could argue that washington was so caught up in february with the impeachment trial that that slowed the response to the coronavirus so can you understand why president trump wouldn apost exactly welcome a congressional committee another congressional committee set up by nancy pelosi jane harman director wilson center and former congresswoman d ca i suppose i can understand it but what aposs important is that the 2 trillion rescue package which blows a hole for generations in our deficit and debt be managed properly and that aposs what she aposs trying to do yes there is an oversight committee chaired by carolyn maloney who was elected to congress when i was in 1992 and she aposs very able but pelosi aposs trying to focus on a way to tunnel all the brain cells on this one problem whether she aposll succeed i don apost know but it is important that there be oversight 500 billion in this 2 trillion bill are managed by the treasury department and they may go to cronies wallace right harman hopefully they won apost but as pelosi says where there aposs a lot of money there can be a lot of mischief and it matters that this money get out fast and it get to the people who need it and just one more point chris the blame game is not helpful this virus isn apost targeting us about by our political registration just as terrorism doesn apost and there was a terror attack in france today five people were killed or wounded by some crazy guy carrying a knife and we better be watching what aposs going on in the world at the same time as we are making this relief package work wallace well we let aposs talk about some of the subjects i just mentioned impeachment and speaking of that late friday president trump notified congress that he is firing michael atkinson who is the former now former inspector general of the intelligence community and yesterday president trump left no doubt about why he did it begin video clip donald trump president of the united states he took this terrible inaccurate whistle blower report right and he brought it to congress end video clip wallace guy i guess it was just a matter of time before president trump fired atkinson wasn apost it guy benson townhall com and the guy benson show definitely this was not a surprising development it was also announced and deployed in the middle of this crisis so i think under other circumstances it would probably be the biggest story in washington this weekend instead it aposs sort of getting short shrift i think it aposs interesting because your seeing predictable responses mostly along party lines but not completely senator susan collins from maine has been critical of the decision the inspector general from the doj michael horowitz also critical of this decision although it aposs interesting that we aposre talking about inspector aposs general broadly to the previous topic on the panel in addition to having the house oversight committee already in existence there are also inspectors general to oversee the 2 trillion in the response of the administration part of the reason why i think congressman chaffetz is right this smells a bit of politics wallace well speaking of politics let aposs talk about the presidential election because primaries are being moved back the democratic convention has now been moved from july until august at the earliest and there is talk about whether there could be changes because of the november election if this goes on whether there might need to be more or exclusively mail in voting president trump was asked about at this week begin video clip donald trump president of the united states know because i think a lot of people cheat with mail in voting i think people should vote with i d voter i d it shouldn apost be mail in voting it should be you go to a booth and you probably display yourself end video clip wallace congressman chaffetz you know that there are going to be some democrats and certainly joe biden who appears now that he aposs going to be the democratic nominee who are going to accuse the president and republicans of voter suppression there chaffetz well that aposs not true donald trump is exactly right voter all submission of this via mail is is just ripe for fraud and abuse nancy pelosi introduced hr 1 it was her first bill of the 116 congress and i remind people that mitch mcconnell said that this was purely a power grab she wants to nationalize these elections i do believe that you should present yourself and identification to be able to vote and there aposs a way to pull that off and start working on now no doubt elections are going to be different but you should authenticate the vote that aposs what you have to do and when you go to mail in ballots you can authenticate it to the same degree you could if you present yourself in person harman yes yes can i respond wallace congresswoman harman your thoughts about mail in voting harman couldn apost disagree more i come from california 40 million voters statewide mail voting i aposve done it myself since leaving congress because i aposm basically based in washington where i run the wilson center still proud to be up california resident oregon washington have this you could do it in spots in the high density cities there are seven months between now and the election states better get on it and the other point to mention is that although jason is right that by the constitution states regulate the time and manner of elections the national government through the department of health and the dhs has been helping states manage cyber intrusions in their voting systems and states are taking the help so the federal government could be very helpful here and we need to have a fair and free election not just for president but for a third of the senate and the entire house wallace guy you get the final comment and less than a minute your thoughts about mail in voting i mean it does go on in a lot of states around the country what if we were to go more exclusively to that if social distancing is still an issue come november benson well i think ballot harvesting is one of the concerns here when it comes to election integrity i aposm in favor of contingency planning i think we haven apost seen that in congress were members still can apost vote remotely in the middle of an emergency i think that aposs nuts frankly so looking ahead to november yes let aposs be careful let aposs think about this potentially as a one time solution for some states but it should not be dictated top down from washington and there should be real safeguards on fraud wallace i have a feeling this is a debate that aposs going to continue but not today thank you panel harman thank you wallace see you next sunday up next millions of us have been put in isolation but that doesn apost mean we aposre alone so many are taking to the internet to make music and to lift spirits and we aposll show you when we come right back commercial break wallace america together it aposs about getting through this crisis and looking out for each other so where we usually bring you our power player of the week we aposre instead going
