sunday congressional candidates are charging into their final 24 hours of campaigning before polls open tuesday with each side claiming the edge though the last burst of polling would appear to show republicans with an advantage in key races republicans need to pick up six seats on tuesday to gain the majority in the senate democrats would need 17 pick ups to do the same in the house though that is considered highly unlikely republicans rather seem poised to build their majority in that chamber by at least a few seats on tuesday meanwhile 36 gubernatorial races are playing out across the nation many of them competitive on sunday democrats and republicans got their last opportunities to make midterm arguments before big audiences in new hampshire hillary clinton headlined a rally for sen jeanne shaheen a fellow democrat who is in a tough re election battle against republican and former massachusetts sen scott brown clinton who is weighing a 2016 presidential bid charged that republicans are running a campaign of fear fear is the last resort for those who have run out of ideas and hope she said earlier in the day former gop presidential nominee and massachusetts gov mitt romney told voters that a vote for senate democrats would only prolong president obama s failing policies including those on health care the economy education and stopping islamic state militants this is really the last chance for americans to pass judgment on president obama romney told fox news sunday while the elections will determine winners in all 435 house districts and in 36 governors apos seats the national focus is largely on the senate where republicans need to net six seats to control the majority in the congress that convenes in january the gop already controls the house and a senate takeover could dramatically change obama apos s last two years in office according to a nbc marist poll released sunday republicans are either leading in the key senate races in georgia kentucky and louisiana or will likely win runoff elections in addition a des moines register poll released saturday showed the republican nominee in iowa joni ernst now has a 7 point lead over democratic challenger rep bruce braley most polls have shown until now that the four races have essentially been deadlocked in kentucky senate majority leader mitch mcconnell appears to be pulling away from democratic challenger alison lundergan grimes reaching the critical 50 percent mark with grimes now at 41 percent in georgia republican nominee david perdue is now ahead of democrat michelle nunn 48 to 44 percent which suggests perdue could get 50 percent of the vote on tuesday and avoid a runoff democrats saw an opportunity early in the election cycle to gain a seat in the traditionally gop territory but perdue has like other gop senate candidates effectively portrayed his democratic incumbent opponent as a rubber stamp for obama president barack obama said his policies are on the ballot and in georgia those policies go by the name of michelle nunn perdue said in a sunday debate nunn mockingly told perdue he sounds like he apos s running against the president you apos re running against me david she added in louisiana three term incumbent democratic sen mary landrieu has 44 percent of the vote in a three way race with gop rep bill cassidy at 36 percent and republican rob maness at 15 percent however in the likely scenario that landrieu gets less than 50 percent of the vote and advances with the second finisher cassidy he would likely get most of maness votes and ultimately win most all of the campaigns apos costly voter turnout operations were in full swing this weekend as each side worked to convince its supporters to get to the polls on tuesday large percentages of younger voters and minorities groups that typically support democrats are expected to sit out the elections altogether elections that don apos t feature presidential races traditionally feature low turnout none of the last four midterm elections drew more than 38 percent of the voting age population earlyvoting has been strong however at least 16 4 million people have voted so far across 31 states according to earlyvoting data monitored by the associated press arkansas florida georgia iowa louisiana maryland montana north carolina and wisconsin already surpassed their 2010 advance totals and the parties have won roughly equal percentages of ballots already cast the problem democrats have is that their message isn apos t working and our ground game is whipping their ground game republican national committee chairman reince priebus told abc s this week asserting early voting advantages in colorado arkansas and iowa the democrats are going to have a terrible night he continued and it apos s because barack obama apos s policies and debbie wasserman schultz apos s policies and senate majority leader harry reid apos s policies are on the ballot wasserman schultz
