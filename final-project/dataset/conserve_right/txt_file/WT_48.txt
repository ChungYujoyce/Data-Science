elections ballots sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender in the roughly 60 page brief the house detailed its inquiry into the president s july 25 phone call with the ukrainian president where mr trump asked for a probe into a political rival former vice president joseph r biden the lawmakers argue mr trump defied subpoenas during their inquiry as he did in past efforts to obstruct the special counsel s investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election president trump abused the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in our elections for his own personal political gain thereby jeopardizing our national security the integrity of our elections and our democracy the impeachment managers said in a joint statement house democrats also argued that mr trump s request for an investigation into ukraine meddling in the 2016 election would benefit him by adding legitimacy to his presidency they argued that an investigation of ukraine meddling would obscure the fact that russia interfered in the 2016 election ukraine s announcement of that investigation would bolster the perceived legitimacy of his presidency and therefore his political standing going into the 2020 race said the document the filing comes after house speaker nancy pelosi held on to the articles of impeachment for about a month after her chamber voted down party line to impeach mr trump for obstruction of congress and abuse of power the brief also included new evidence gathered during that impasse as it referenced the government accountability office s

whistleblower is known to have met with mr schiff s staff for guidance before making the complaint a rough transcript of the call the white house released in late september did not show the president present a quid pro quo deal for the investigations but democrats said the threat was understood and part of an ongoing pressure campaign of shadow foreign policy conducted by mr trump s private lawyer former new york mayor rudolph w giuliani new evidence the house democrats obtained since passing the two articles of impeachment in a party line vote dec 18 detail mr giuliani s activities in ukraine but does not significantly change what was already known the articles rely heavily on testimony from gordon sondland the ambassador to the european union who said he offered a prized white house visit for the newly elected mr zelensky in exchange for his announcement of the investigations but mr sondland said he presumed that was what mr trump wanted in his only conversation with the president about it mr trump told him that there was no quid pro quo he testified none of the witnesses in the impeachment inquiry linked the holdup of military assistance to the investigations or provided a reason for the holdup the aid was delayed for about two months before the money started to flow to ukraine on sept 11 two days after the inspector general of the intelligence community informed congress of the whistleblower complaint mr trump has acknowledged that he wanted an investigation into alleged corruption involving the bidens and ukraine interference in the 2016 election interest increased in mr biden s actions in ukraine after he recently boasted of forcing ukraine to fire the country s chief prosecutor in spring 2016 he said he threatened to block a 1 billion u s loan
