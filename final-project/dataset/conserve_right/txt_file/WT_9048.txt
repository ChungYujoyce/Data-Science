fast growing no 2 have exposed washington s fears about technology security and influence u s political leaders have derided china s government over policies in protest riddled hong kong at detention

america slept the chinese communist party has emerged as an immediate and growing threat to our prosperity our freedoms and our security sen marco rubio r fla said in a speech to the national defense university last week now the chinese even have the world s biggest diplomatic arsenal to draw from china s diplomatic network including embassies consulates and other posts has overtaken that of the united states according to the lowy institute a sydney based think tank beijing has 276 diplomatic posts worldwide topping washington s declining deployment by three posts the institute found china s growing diplomatic presence comes as beijing is trying to expand its international footprint in places like resource rich africa or the strategic south china sea and to compete economically with western countries including with its much ballyhooed belt and road initiative that seeks to expand chinese economic clout in places like africa and asia china s campaign to increase its influence on the global stage comes as the trump administration retreats from multilateral diplomacy trump has pulled the united states out of the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization and the u n supported human rights council and this month the u s squeezed the world trade organization s appeals court out of action his administration has announced a u s pullout from the paris climate accord and shredded multilateral trade pacts it s part of a broader diplomatic retrenchment that has led to the loss of nearly 200 foreign service posts at american embassies and consulates abroad we ve entered an era in which diplomacy matters more than ever on an intensely competitive international landscape said william burns president of the carnegie endowment for international peace and a former deputy secretary of state who has been highly critical of trump s foreign policy china realizes that and is rapidly expanding its diplomatic capacity the u s by contrast seems intent on unilateral diplomatic disarmament the u s pullback has been particularly felt in geneva a hub of u n backed multilateralism more than 2 1 2 years into trump s tenure the u s finally brought in a new ambassador to u n institutions in geneva only last month meanwhile china s deployment has grown complete with a months long renovation to its wto offices on the bucolic geneva lakefront trump s administration has initiated staffing draw downs in afghanistan and iraq in particular recalling diplomats from those countries to washington but not sending them out to other overseas missions according to the american foreign service association the union that represents u s diplomats this the first time that any country has had more global presence than the united states and it s a concern said union president eric rubin if we re going to meet the challenge of a rising china we need to represent ourselves aggressively and with resources overseas in african nations like angola mozambique tanzania and uganda u s diplomats report being outnumbered five to one by their chinese counterparts according to a union presentation to the house foreign affairs committee since trump took office in 2017 at least five small nations in latin america and the pacific panama the dominican republic el salvador kiribati and the solomon islands have rejected intense u s lobbying and cut diplomatic ties with taiwan in order to recognize china which often promises them major investments of the kind that secretary of state mike pompeo has warned against and countries in europe and elsewhere have been reluctant to heed u s admonitions to cut chinese telecommunications giant huawei out of their advanced communications networks the u s says huawei equipment is suspect subject to intrusion by the chinese communist party and has warned nations including nato allies that they could be stripped of intelligence cooperation with the united states if they grant the company a role in their national grids huawei denies the u s allegations there was a time when china was considered a potentially benevolent rising power nearly a generation ago the communist country was welcomed into the capitalist dominated wto in geneva now u s officials complain that china has taken advantage of the trade body and isn t playing by its rules that adds to the suspicion even as beijing insists it respects and abides by the rules based international system in 2019 we have seen a change in how the rest of the world sees china said steve tsang director of the soas china institute at the university of london from xinjiang to huawei to now hong kong china is no longer seen as the rising benign giant but it is being seen as whoops we need to get worried about it but in some areas like its efforts to fight climate change china is scoring political points abroad while trump s policies on the environment have drawn widespread scorn china s communist party has long believed in its monopoly on truth history and narrative at home tsang said now with fake news a buzzword that belief may be ripe for export chinese diplomats have claimed that china holds no political prisoners and insist the xinjiang centers which have been widely criticized for locking up muslim uighurs and others were only there to provide vocational training and save them from religious radicalism if donald trump can say anything he wants whatever that happens to be without too much regard to whether it s factually correct or not why would the communist party of china not feel that they ve been vindicated he said therefore xi jinping s idea of seizing the narrative is the right thing you don t have to get worried about facts chinese authorities have used advertising pitches news conferences tv and radio interviews social media including on the chinese foreign ministry s new twitter account and other messaging to promote beijing s positions and push back against criticism barely a day goes by without chinese officials speaking out in some part of the globe the chinese foreign ministry s web site lists 67 chinese language pages of statements speeches newspaper columns and other communications by chinese diplomats and other officials since may alone they blend tough talk self defense and self congratulation china s ambassador in poland has decried unilateralist u s trade
