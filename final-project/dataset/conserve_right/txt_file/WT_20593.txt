illegal aliens once you re a proven liar there is no way to win back your credibility it s lost forever gone with the wind a liar is a liar is a liar so when michael cohen president trump s former personal attorney appeared wednesday before the house oversight and reform committee took an oath to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help him god any viewer tuned in to c span had to wonder is he lying right now for those who question my motives for being here today i understand cohen said in his opening statement in which he said president trump is a racist and a con man directly addressing the elephant in the room he said i have lied but i am not a liar i have done bad things but i am not a bad man but that s not what a court of law ruled in august cohen was found guilty pleaded guilty in fact to five counts of tax fraud and one count of making false statements to a bank in november cohen was charged with lying to congress he pleaded guilty to that charge too so there s not much question that cohen is a liar on may 6 he s going to prison for three years in large part for being a liar but he had faced 70 years behind bars on the charges which also included campaign finance violations instead he s met with special counsel robert mueller seven times and when asked in wednesday s hearing about what he hoped to achieve by turning on his former boss he said for once being quite honest that maybe just maybe his prison sentence would be reduced republicans on the committee were brutal but at least honest how can we believe anything you say rep carol miller of west virginia said to cohen the answer is we can t he s going to prison for lying to congress said rep mark green of tennessee let that sink in he s going to prison for lying to congress and he s the star witness for the majority party nothing he says has any credibility mr green said no one can see this guy as credible he will say whatever he wants to accomplish his own personal goals he s a fake witness and his presence here is a travesty i don t believe michael cohen is capable of telling the truth said rep james comer of kentucky said rep paul gosar of arizona he doesn t know fact from fiction he cited the old adage our moms taught us liar liar pants on fire and rep jody hice of georgia put cohen through the shredder mr cohen you claimed that you lied but you re not a liar just to set the record straight if you lied you are a liar by definition mr hice also offered congratulations to cohen for being the first person convicted for lying to congress to testify before congress even after taking the oath cohen couldn t help himself rep jim jordan of ohio asked cohen you started the campaign for president of the united states for donald trump cohen replied i certainly did sir shouldtrumprun com 2011 it was my idea i saw a document in the newspaper that said who would you vote for in 2012 six percent of the people turned around and said they d vote for donald trump so i brought it into his office and i said mr trump take a look at this wouldn t that be great and that is where it all started in his testimony cohen delivered a few bombshells saying mr trump paid him back for money he spent to pay off women who claimed they had past sexual affairs with the billionaire businessman he also said mr trump knew that an adviser roger stone was working with julian assange and wikileaks on the release of emails from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton and the democratic national committee and he said he lied to congress in his last appearance about a proposed trump tower in moscow negotiations for which he claimed went on as mr trump ran for president in two weird asides cohen also alleged that mr trump once ordered him to send threatening letters to the president s old schools to make sure they didn t release his grades or sat scores and that he had a bidder buy a portrait of mr trump so it would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon but on the most important question of the hearing whether mr trump colluded with russia to swing the 2016 election his way cohen said questions have been raised about whether i know of direct evidence that mr trump or his campaign colluded with russia i do not i want to be clear but i have my suspicions well that s good enough from a convicted liar isn t it it is for democrats anyway joseph curl covered the white house and politics for a decade for the washington times he can be reached at emailprotected and on twitter j
