democratic leader about the road map cohen laid out for investigating the president and we aposll ask our sunday panel who from trump aposs inner circle democrats will zero in on next rep adam schiff d calif we have to look at these on a case by case basis we are going to try to do as much as we can wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington president trump is coming off a rough week and the collapse of his summit with kim jong un is just part of it on capitol hill michael cohen called his former boss a criminal the new york times reports the president ordered a top secret security clearance for son in law jared kushner over his staff aposs objections and there aposs outrage over the president saying he believes the north korean leader aposs claim he didn apost know about the savage treatment of otto warmbier in a moment we aposll speak with national security advisor john bolton who was in the final session in vietnam between the president and kim but first here aposs chief congressional correspondent mike emanuel on mr trump aposs rocky ride begin videotape trump basically they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn apost do that that mike emanuel chief congressional correspondent president trump walked away from negotiations with kim jong un in vietnam cutting their second summit short in the end each side gave conflicting accounts of its terms for denuclearization in north korea trump they were willing to denuke a large portion of the areas that we wanted but we couldn apost give up all of the sanctions for that ri yong ho north korean foreign minister through translator what we proposed was not the removal of all sanctions but their partial removal emanuel half a world away in washington unidentified male do you swear or affirm that emanuel his former attorney michael cohen testified in front of congress calling the president a racist and a con man cohen over time i saw his true character revealed emanuel cohen admitted he did not know of any direct evidence that the trump campaign colluded with russia but said mr trump had potentially committed criminal activities since becoming president president trump disputed cohen aposs testimony in a series of tweets claiming that cohen reportedly shopped the book which directly contradicts his testimony calling it a love letter to trump house intelligence committee chair adam schiff said cohen will be back next wednesday for more closed door testimony schiff he was fully cooperative and answered all of our questions emanuel the committee will also publicly question a promoter of the trump tower moscow project felix sater meanwhile the house oversight committee chair elijah cummings had suggested his panel will reach out to the president aposs children and trump organization finance chief allen weisselberg for potential testimony chris end videotape wallace mike thank you joining me now just back from vietnam is the president aposs national security advisor john bolton ambassador welcome back to fox news sunday crosstalk wallace well following the failed summit in vietnam where does diplomacy stand between the u s and north korea what is president trump looking for and what is he willing to give john bolton national security adviser well i don apost agree at all that it was a failed summit i think the obligation of the president of the united states is to defend and advance american national security interest and i think he did that by rejecting a bad deal and by trying again to persuade kim jong un to take the big deal that really could make a difference for north korea as the president said sometimes you have to walk away and i think he made a very important point to north korea and to other countries around the world about negotiating with him he aposs not desperate for a deal not with north korea not with anybody if it aposs contrary to american national interest wallace well i want to pick up on that though because apparently it had become clear in the negotiations over the preceding weeks and finally days before hanoi that the north koreans were asking for a much greater sanctions relief in the president was willing to give under those circumstances did it make sense to even hold the summit bolton well you never know what the north koreans are actually going to come with or if they aposre going to adhere to it a big part of the problem here in all these discussions were the experts are saying well the north koreans will give a part of their program and the u s will release some of the economic sanctions that has bedeviled prior administrations if the problem of incommensurability that we are talking about things that don apost have common measurements and what north korea has done consistently in the past is promised to denuclearize and then by the way not do it to get economic benefits which provide their economy a lifeline get them out of the trouble they are in and then allow them to go back to the nuclear program that kind of mistake is exactly what president trump said he would not permit in his administration and he did not do it wallace you didn apost really answer my first question i aposm now realizing which is where do things stand and what does the president what does he want and what aposs he willing to give bolton what he has said from the beginning that north korea if it makes a strategic decision to denuclearize can have a prospect of a very very bright economic future the president held the door open for north korea and singapore they didn apost walk through he held it open for them again in hanoi they didn apost walk through it he is ready to hold it open again no fixed date for a third summit but he aposs turned traditional diplomacy on its head and after all in the case of north korea why not traditional diplomacy has failed in the last three administrations wallace you would agree that it aposs failed so far with you too bolton well after eight months i mean he aposs got a record of 24 years of failure to stop north korea for making progress on its nuclear program wallace but would you agree that so far this move with kim has failed bolton i don apost think we are in any worse shape than they were in past demonstrations i think in fact we are in a stronger position because the maximum pressure campaign as it aposs been called of putting tighter economic sanctions on north korea and enforcing those sanctions more effectively is what brought them to this point and that program of maximum pressure will continue and i think have a real impact on kim jong un wallace i want to ask you about exactly that because before singapore the president said that he would not accept north korea as a nuclear power and here aposs what you told me last april begin video clip wallace is there any possibility that the u s would accept north korea as a nuclear power and allow them to keep some of their infrastructure bolton i don apost see how that aposs possible end video clip wallace but this week the president kept saying over and over again there aposs no rush for north korea to give up its nuclear weapons to give up its missiles the key is no testing and according to intelligence reports u s intelligence reports in the last year while they have not tested north korea has produced enough nuclear fuel for five to seven more nuclear weapons so i guess the question is in effect despite what you said despite with the president said aren apost you accepting north korea as a nuclear power and haven apost you in fact given a big concession which is that in return for no testing you aposve agreed to cancel major joint exercises with the south koreans bolton i don apost think the president sees it that way at all the objective of making sure that north korea denuclearizes is still the policy of the administration and i think wallace then why does he say no rush bolton that the fact is that at the moment the leverage is on the side of the united states the economic sanctions continued to take hold there aposs no doubt over a protracted period of time that the time does work in favor of the proliferator but i think our judgment right now is that time works in the favor of the president aposs position as north korea sees the effective of these sanctions taking greater effect wallace and just briefly can you give us a little of the mood music you aposre in that meeting you aposre at that table you and the president and the secretary of state and the white house chief of staff mick mulvaney at the same time with kim and the other people how did it fall apart who said what bolton i don apost think it fell apart i think crosstalk wallace how did they end up leaving bolton well they left on good terms and i think that was part of what the president wanted he has wallace you can look at this picture were they at that meeting who said what bolton look there were several meanings that would take a long time but i can tell you this the president stressed to kim jong un he thought progress had been made he thought that there were still negotiations that were possible i would say the north koreans were very disappointed we didn apost buy their bad deal you know that aposs life in the big city wallace did kim say anything i mean you remember famously gorbachev and reagan and gorbachev said what more could i have said and reagan said you could have said yes on sdi in iceland any moment like that bolton well i think there were several the president kept saying take what he called the big deal denuclearization make a decision give up the nuclear chemical and biological weapons give up the ballistic missiles he handed kim jong un a piece of paper actually two one in korean and one english that laid out what we expected there and in exchange for that you get this well placed piece of real estate as the president charges it from his business experience that could have an extraordinary economic future wallace what did kim say bolton he walked away from it wallace all right meanwhile the president seemed to absolve kim jong un of any responsibility in the torture and death of otto warmbier take a look begin video clip donald trump president in those prisons and those camps you have a lot of people and some really bad things happened to otto some really really bad things but he tells me he tells me that he didn apost know about it and i will take him at his word end video clip wallace well the warmbier family was shocked at that and so were top republicans begin video clip sen cory gardner r colo the blood of otto warmbier is on the hands of kim jong un end video clip wallace and the warmbiers issue this statement kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son otto kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity no excuses or lavish praise can change that question why did the president take kim aposs word that he didn apost know bolton look the president has been very clear both in public and i aposve heard him in private in the oval office that he considers what happened to otto warmbier to be despicable and barbaric and i think he made that clear in hanoi and made it clear subsequently i think the best thing crosstalk wallace let me just interrupt for a second he says i mean i aposm just going to read you the quote back again that we just played he kim tells me that he didn apost know it and i will take about his work bolton yes wallace why did he say that bolton you know what he aposs trying to convey is that he aposs got a difficult line to walk to negotiate with kim jong un and at the same time demand what i think north korea would find very much in its own best interests give us a complete accounting of who was responsible for what happened to otto warmbier that would go a long way to improving relations wallace but this is not the first time that the president has taken the word of an autocrat over outside evidence bolton it aposs not taking the word he said i aposm going to take when he says i aposm going to take him at his word it doesn apost mean that he accepted as reality it means that he accepts that aposs what kim jong un said wallace so when he says i take him at his word it doesn apost mean that he believes kim jong un bolton well that aposs what he said i think one way to prove that is to give the united states a complete accounting wallace ok regardless of it this is not the first time president has sided with an autocrat over outside evidence here aposs what the president said about the murder the saudi murder of jamal khashoggi begin video clip trump i hate the crime i hate what aposs done i hate the cover up and i will tell you this the crown prince hates it more than i do and they have vehemently denied it end video clip wallace and here is the president at the helsinki summit with putin on whether russia interfered in the 2016 election begin video clip trump i have great confidence in my intelligence people but i will tell you that president putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today end video clip wallace why does the president trust putin and mbs and kim over u s intelligence bolton i don apost think that aposs what he aposs saying and again if you take the case of khashoggi he and others in the administration have said repeatedly we want from saudi arabia a complete top to bottom explanation of what happened wallace it aposs been months and you haven apost gotten it and the senate has been calling for stricter sanctions and you guys are opposing it it certainly would happen in the case of putin he specifically said u s intelligence says this but putin says no bolton and fundamentally in the case of all three of those countries we aposve got to pursue american national interests and that involves matters much weightier much more important than some of these statements by the leaders look foreign leaders who are friends of ours lie to our face as well this is nothing new in international relations wallace but forgive me and you go back to the reagan years too as do i ronald reagan when he was dealing with mikhail gorbachev over the most sensitive issues continue to call him out on human rights and the abuses in the soviet gulags he didn apost shy away from confronting gorbachev with the tough issues bolton and i don apost think president trump has either certainly as you heard even in the tapes you played again on the khashoggi thing or on otto warmbier he aposs decried the acts that we are concerned about as barbaric wallace ok there are reporters i got to say there aposs a lot of stuff to talk to you about today two more issues one there are reports none denied so far the president trump ordered the white house to give a top secret security clearance to jared kushner over the objections of the white house chief of staff john kelly over the white house counsel don mcgahn and over the cia as national security advisor do you have any concerns about jared kushner having access to the nation aposs top secrets bolton i don apost have any concerns i deal with jared all the time on the middle east peace process in a number of other issues i trust him i have no idea what the story is on the security clearance it aposs not something that falls within my area of responsibility but if asked do i trust jared kushner the answer is yes wallace you do not think is a security risk bolton i do not wallace other question on that though will the white house meet a deadline tomorrow to turn over to the house all documents that they are seeking on white house security clearances bolton well you know i aposm involved in that since they have some nonsensical ideas about me which i will one day be free to discuss as a private citizen but as a white house official all i can say is the white house counsel in the department of justice are handling that and whether i like it or not i will leave it to them wallace meaning what when you say whether you like it bolton what they are going to respond to the congress wallace do you do you know whether they are going to turn over the papers or not bolton i don apost know i think it aposs up to them as i say if i were a private citizen i aposd have a lot to say about this wallace well laughter wallace you know me too well it aposs like you aposve dangled a piece of meat in front of me do you think that congress doesn apost have a right to that information bolton i think look i think i aposve been from my days at the justice department a strong proponent of executive privilege and the ability of the executive branch to function free from unwarranted congressional interference so if by chance that aposs a stance that the white house counsel and the justice department take i aposll be fine with that as a matter of constitutional law i aposm just saying if i were unfettered by my official response abilities i aposd be delighted to take on these allegations about me wallace ok final question venezuela for all the declarations from you and from other top white house officials and the quote is maduro must go the fact is he continues to hold onto power there was this big face off last week about humanitarian aid coming in or not they were able to block it generally speaking with some defections the generals in the military are standing by him one what you do next to try to force him out and two if the opposition leader juan guaido returns to venezuela and the next day or so and is arrested what will the u s response be bolton look the opposition is very united i think maduro made a big mistake by trying to block the aid and let aposs be clear it wasn apost so much of the regular venezuelan military that blocked the aid coming across the borders it was the colectivos these bands of motorcycle gangs organized and trained and financed by cuba that aposs really one of the big problems in venezuela which in parts of latin america they call cubazuela because of the influence of the cubans that we need to get rid of now let me just say with respect to the military there are countless conversations going on below the surface as to where the military will go i think maduro aposs position is very precarious we want to see a peaceful transition of power wallace if guaido was arrested what will the u s response be bolton well i we aposre going to we are going to watch what happens i think we warned maduro and his henchmen and the cubans very clearly but the opposition is united in ways unprecedented over the last 20 years and if maduro took that step i think it would just hasten the day that he leaves wallace ambassador bolton thank you thanks for answering all questions always good to talk with you sir bolton glad to be with you wallace up next we will bring in our center group to discuss the fallout from the trump kim summit plus what would you like to ask the panel about president trump demanding top secret clearance for jared kushner just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump we actually had papers ready to be signed but it just wasn apost appropriate i want to do it right i aposd much rather do it right than do it fast end video clip wallace president trump on why he did not strike a deal with kim jong un at the vietnam summit and it aposs time now for our sunday group the cofounder of the web magazine the federalist ben domenech marie harf co host of benson and harf on fox news radio former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and fox news correspondent gillian turner well congresswoman harman there are reports before the two leaders ever got together in vietnam and i talked about this with john bolton that the north koreans were demanding a lot more in terms of sanctions relief than the white house was ever willing to give two questions basically that i asked ambassador bolton one should the summit have ever been held and two does its failure how much does it setback u s north korean relations jane harman d calif former congresswoman well should have been held now no it wasn apost ready and bolton is right that over three administrations the efforts to negotiate a good deal with north korea have failed does it hurt u s north korean relations i don apost really think so i think if you look at it in terms of north korea they won i mean here is kim on his 2 000 mile trek on his train going to a state visit in vietnam after the summit and now going back in meeting with xi jinping and he keeps all his nukes and he is an operator on the world stage so and he aposs got a closer relationship with china then he used to have so i aposd call that a win for kim and i don apost see how that hurts his view of us it does hurt us on the world stage people are looking at this and i think it makes our leverage even les than it has been in other parts of the world wallace yes i want to pick up on that with you ben and specifically were terms of u s north korean relations because what the president walked away from the summit it does appear that he is softening his terms originally they were talking about no concessions until north korea gives up everything and now they seem to be saying well this was too big and ask what we would give up some things corresponding measures it aposs called in return for some progress on denuclearization ben domenech the federalist first chris just to be clear the north koreans are never going to give up their nuclear program it is they aposre never going to fully denuclearize and that aposs something that i think that the intelligence community has very much agreed on and i aposm not always in agreement with them but i think in this case it aposs very true second i think that the frame of this whole sort of conversation around this summit was a little bit inaccurate from the get go all of the analysis going and was warning against the idea that the president was going to be willing to agree to a bad deal just in order to have it win in terms of the frame of what this was viewed out on the world stage and here at home i think clearly this sort of surprised a number of people who went in there expecting that the president would give up a lot as opposed to doing what he did which was walk away which i think was the right decision in this context i do consider the congresswoman to be correct when she says this is a temporary win for kim but i think in the grander scheme of things we would have been much more hurt by a bad deal in this instance than taking a step back and saying let aposs come at this again particularly after withdrawal from the inf we have the ability to potentially deploy a lot different sort of material around that region than we did when we were part of that agreement wallace material is one way of saying intermediate ranged nuclear missiles domenech yes wallace ok we asked you for questions for the panel and on another issue the issue of president trump reportedly ordering his staff to give jared kushner a top secret clearance brian castaldo tweeted this what does jared actually bring to the table that demands he have a security clearance marie how do you answer brian both on the question of the security clearance and on kushner aposs performance on the international stage marie harf co host benson harf well there aposs nothing that jared kushner brings to the table in terms of substantive expertise or history or knowledge of these issues that require he have a clearance and work on these issues the president does have the ability to say jared you are my guy on middle east peace i want you to work on that the president also has the authority to give him a security clearance over the expressed wishes of the intelligence community but it raises two questions the first is should the president have done that he had the authority but was it in the u s national security interest to do so congress is investigating that right now and hopefully they will get some answers the second question it raises is why the president and other people keep lying about it publicly that is a problem i think for national security interest and just for the president aposs credibility wallace and when you say that we should point out the president denied an interview in the new york times that he had done anything to interfere or to push kushner aposs security clearance and so did ivanka trump harf exactly so for those of us who have gone through the tedious process of documenting every foreign contact of filling out these security clearance forms there aposs a reason they are adjudicated the way they are and we need from donald trump and his administration a clear answer why jared is so needed to have this clearance that they overrode the cia aposs concerns about jared and his foreign contacts wallace what about the argument hey on the president i got elected i trust him harf he has the authority to do it chris you aposre right he got elected he can do it it doesn apost mean he should do it and it certainly doesn apost mean that congress should not ask tough questions about why jared so needed to have this clearance and this just shows another complication with hiring family members it can cloud your judgment did he override in any other cases there aposs reporting that in at least 40 cases people were denied security clearances were those overridden as well there aposs a process for a reason here and it aposs to protect national security domenech marie you know that ben rhodes was denied a clearance ok he aposs a vacuous fool ph crosstalk wallace we should point out ben rhodes was on the national security council staff for barack obama domenech look this is all about the president being able to hire who he wants and have them in the position that he wants this is a basic executive harf basic process is unnecessary crosstalk wallace all right wait wait guys let me bring in gillian who is gillian turner correspondent the key that nobody is talking about i am been able to confirm it as far as the reporting i aposve looked at nobody else has been able to confirm this the key question is whether jared kushner actually ever took a polygraph and whether he passed or failed so as somebody who had a top secret security clearance for five years an important part of that process for 95 percent of the people who get that clearance ultimately is whether they passed or the polygraph if jared kushner passed a polygraph test and it was then the judgment of the cia and the intel community he shouldn apost get the clearance and the president overrode it that is one matter if jared kushner failed a polygraph test and then the president overrode the decision of the intel community to deny him a clearance anyway that is an entirely different issue wallace i have to i have to say that aposs a pretty explosive i aposm not saying you aposre alleging it but even to bring up why would you even bring that up turner well because i bring it up because again as somebody who had a security clearance this is i know that that aposs a major component of the process and a lot of people harman not all the time right turner i said about 90 percent of the time harman because i have one i served on the defense policy board and i served on the cia board and that was not a requirement turner right as i said about 90 percent of people who have a ts sci security clearance also undergo a polygraph test as part of that wallace and what do you think the question i asked marie i mean all of this is because the president thinks this guy i really trust so far in the two years that he aposs been a top advisor to the president how do you think jared kushner has done saudi arabia china now the mideast he aposs supposedly is the architect of the mideast peace deal turner well we haven apost seen a deal yet we haven apost seen the proposal so we don apost know really what avenue he aposs going to launch from i mean we aposve been hearing for two years that the deal on the u s side proposals are sort of nearing conclusion and that jared has been traveling to the middle east to talk about it with both sides of you know the israelis and the palestinians but we haven apost seen exactly crosstalk wallace congresswoman you got 45 seconds final word harman how he performs is not the issue the issue is whether he is a threat to national security because of relationships he has with foreign governments so i you know i didn apost know ben rhodes didn apost have a security clearance but and i don apost know why he didn apost have a security clearance but i don apost think domenech he aposs denied initially by the fbi harman i don apost think it aposs relevant how he performed domenech i agree harman i think it aposs relevant what foreign ties he had and whether he aposs deemed a national security threat wallace well let me just say as we end this conversation i seem to be the only one on this panel who has never had a national security top secret clearance and probably with good reason because i can apost inaudible very well laughter wallace all right panel we have to take a break here up next what impact does former trump lawyer michael cohen aposs testimony have on future investigations into the president aposs private and public conduct we aposll talk with a member of house democratic leadership congresswoman debbie dingell next commercial break wallace coming up president trump continues to go after the russia investigation begin video clip donald trump president there aposs no collusion so now they go and morph into let aposs inspect every deal he aposs ever done end video clip wallace we aposll ask a top democrat what to expect from her party once the mueller report is finally released commercial break wallace michael cohen aposs testimony is just the tip of the iceberg of what house democrats plan for investigating the president joining me now to discuss what comes next congresswoman debbie dingell if she co chair of the democratic policy and communications committee and congresswoman welcome back to fox news sunday rep debbie dingell d mich chris it aposs good to be with you wallace this is the first time that i aposve had a chance to see you and to talk with you since you lost your wonderful husband of 38 years john dingell i know i speak for a lot of people how are you doing dingell it aposs hard you know i but i can hear him in my ear saying get back out there and work he was a great man and we had a love affair you know the love affair we had you were there when i i remember talking to you about whether i should accept that first date with him and we were he was my love wallace and what did i say dingell well you didn apost want me to marry him it most people don apost know that you and i lived next door to each other wallace yes we did and and you were very you were like the the the fairy godmother to my children i didn apost want you to move out of town dingell and i didn apost want to move so that was hard but we had a love affair and you know the love affair we had and i aposve got a hole in my heart wallace good good well we it aposs a hole in a lot of our hearts and you have a lot of friends dingell thank you wallace president trump spoke at cpac yesterday and he said with the russia investigation his terms now basically falling apart house democrats want to go after him on a bunch of other things take a look begin video clip donald trump president so they don apost have anything with russia there aposs no collusion so now they go and morph into let aposs inspect every deal he aposs ever done we aposre going to go into his finances we aposre going to check his deals we aposre going to check these people are sick right now we have people in congress that hate our country end video clip wallace and in fact there are at least six house committees got them up on the screen looking into various areas from russia to mr trump aposs tax returns to his charitable foundation i know that the house democratic majority is also passing bills you passed the gun control bill this week but do you really want trump investigations to take up so much of the time and drown out so much of the other things you aposre doing dingell so i aposm going to actually say that we as a congress not just democrats democrats and republicans can walk and chew gum at the same time congress has a fundamental responsibility for oversight and investigations and i think we have abdicated it the last two years at the same time we have a fundamental responsibility to the people that elected us to be for the people and i think that we aposve got to make sure we aposre we did guns this week which is a subject that matters deeply to me it aposs very complicated for me as you well know too but we aposve got to do something about health care there isn apost a republican that cannot care as much as we as democrats do about how much the cost of insulin is we need to do something about our broken infrastructure the president said he would work with us we need to do something about pensions and trade and a lot of other we can do both wallace but but the fact is even even though you passed the gun control bill this week most people don apost even know that because the only thing that got attention from the news media and i think rightly so was the cohen hearing dingell so i look i think the cohen hearing is a first step in a very legitimate oversight process where we need to understand i don apost think i don apost quite agree with the president i don apost know what the mueller investigation is going to say i aposm staying i aposm waiting for facts i think we need to get the facts people are asking questions and not all oversight needs to be as you see chairman schiff is holding closed door hearings they aposre gathering the facts they aposre getting the information that aposs legitimate but we are also and need to deliver for the american people wallace ok dingell and they aposre holding us accountable do you think that people across this country aren apost worried about what aposs happening to the cost of insulin which has gone up like 300 400 a month we need to do something on drug prices and that aposs something we should be able to agree on wallace all right you talked about the mueller report the president spoke out very graphically and forcefully yesterday at cpac about the mueller special counsel investigation in fact we had to bleep out some of this here it is begin video clip donald trump president all of a sudden they aposre trying to take you out with bull expletive deleted ok with bull expletive deleted end video clip wallace you aposve said before this you aposve said that that democrats moving to impeach the president could in your words tear the country apart where are you on impeachment now more importantly where is the house democratic leadership is that off the table dingell i think that we aposre waiting for the facts i aposve always said that and i do not think an impeachment should ever be a partisan event i think we need to have republicans and democrats or it will tear this country apart it aposs a very serious movement but that aposs why oversight aposs a legitimate function this investigation is a legitimate function you know one of the things that i thought about as everybody started talking about why do we need to know about russia or why do you know during this government shutdown i met with tsa fbi custom and border patrol secret service and all of them were scared to death that their credit rating could be impacted and they could lose their job and why would they lose their job because people think that they might be subject to some kind of blackmail so if we aposre going to hold a tsa or an fbi or s secret service who puts their life on the line isn apost that a legitimate role of government to make sure that our top leaders are not that we aposre just getting the facts to make sure that there isn apost any interference in this russia by russia in our election process or there isn apost something that aposs being held over the head of any elected official wallace you talk about a bipartisan effort but the fact is in that five hours whatever it was a factual running time house oversight committee hearing every republican with the possible exception of your fellow michigander justin amash sided strongly with the president and went after michael cohen there was no bipartisan agreement about even looking into the allegations that cohen was making dingell so we want wallace are you disappointed that republicans aren apost dingell i i think that republicans have you know i we talked about john at the beginning of this show he was equally hard on members of his own party as he was too republicans he believed that that was one of the most fundamental responsibilities of our congress is to hold people accountable i don apost know what aposs going on behind closed doors with chairman schiff i have talked to republicans who are concerned that there not be interference by russia i think that some people need to get the courage to ask questions and i think that we aposve got to ask the questions and build the case and we aposve got to do it objectively and fairly and the more we do it together the better this country is wallace ok so you ask about asking questions and that raises the question how far should democrats be willing to go for instance should house democrats move even if it takes a subpoena to get the president aposs tax records should they particularly given the testimony that we heard from michael cohen this week should they require that the president aposs kids eric don junior ivanka come up and testify dingell well i think that people are going to have to really do some strong thinking about that i think that there aposs some reason to think that they may have answers to questions or have been part of discussions i think these tax returns are a very interesting discussion you know we have financial disclosure on the hill we have to well we have it in the executive branch as well and when you aposre seeing the kinds of discussions that you are seeing it aposs a very legitimate question and we have to talk about it i think that if he makes his tax returns public a lot of people if you aposre running for president do you need to make your tax returns i think it wallace ok dingell i mean becomes a question should everybody have to make them wallace last month congresswoman ilhan omar of minnesota suggested on twitter that israel supporters in congress are in effect being brought by pro israel lobbies she said this it aposs all about the benjamin aposs baby omar apologized for that but this week she was at it again she said at a town hall i want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it aposs ok for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country the the chair of the house foreign affairs committee said that those more recent comments by omar are anti semitic will the house democratic leadership discipline congresswoman omar dingell you know i aposm going to say what i aposm worried about in this country which is what this fear and hatred that we aposre seeing anti semitism is not ok we can never forget what happened in germany and we have to remember that but you know i come from my i represent the largest muslim population in this country too and the hatred and the targeting we aposre seeing one of the most fundamental pillars of our constitution is under attack and that is freedom of religion and we have got to make sure on both sides that everybody is being very careful when you look at what happened to her in west virginia on friday congressman omar was not all right either she needs to be careful of her language we should cannot attack we have to be very very careful of anti semitism and i think have talked to nancy and steny on monday and see what they aposre what you know how we all bring ourselves together but i see it on both sides wallace ok dingell i see too much hatred period wallace finally 2020 you aposre not running for president are you dingell i am not running for president wallace ok you aposre the only one of the democratic party who isn apost you are relatively speaking in the center one of the more moderate i know you aposre part of the progressive caucus but in his group you aposre relatively moderate in the democratic party do you worry that some of these candidates announced candidates for president are moving so far to the left and proposing programs that are so expensive that you could conceivably open up an avenue and make it easier for donald trump to win re election dingell i aposm a pragmatist by the way just for the record i told you two years ago donald trump could win and you all thought i was crazy and he could win re election we have got to be very smart about running this election i aposm a pragmatist i am for universal health care medicare for all but i want to get there if you don apost have the vision you aposre not going to get there we aposve got a problem with global climate change i you know people are mad at me all the time the auto industry aposs mad at me because i say we need to set 30 fuel economy standards for 2030 wallace to remind to remind people you are a congresswoman for michigan dingell michigan and an auto person but and you know but so what i do is i went to aoc and said aoc we want to go to a carbonless society will you work with me to build an electric infrastructure that will help give confidence for people to buy electric vehicles wallace and and and we aposre running out of time what did she say dingell she aposs coming to detroit i invited her to detroit and she aposs going to work with me that aposs why we everything aposs got to be like this why can apost we work together for common goals wallace congresswoman dingell again we are so sorry for your loss john dingell you know you pointed out dingell was my love wallace we were personal friends you and i have been friends for a long time he aposs a remarkable was a remarkable man thank you for coming in today and we we share in your loss dingell thank you chris wallace when we return we aposll bring back our sunday group to discuss president trump aposs comments about the increased scrutiny he aposs facing from congressional democrats who as you just heard says they hate the country commercial break begin video clip donald trump president he lied a lot but it was very interesting because he didn apost lie about one thing he said no collusion with the russian hoax michael cohen former trump attorney he doesn apost give you orders he speaks in a code and i understand the code because i aposve been around him for a decade end video clip wallace michael cohen and president trump with very different takes on what the president aposs former fixer said this week and we aposre back now with the panel ben michael cohen as the president said he said a lot about campaign contributions about potential bank fraud insurance fraud tax fraud but he had almost nothing to offer when it came to alleged collusion with the russians so in the end how much do you think he hurt the president ben domenech the federalist well i don apost think that he actually told us a lot that was new but it was a circus and it was salacious which is why it got as much attention as it did certainly entertaining at various points i think that michael cohen indicates where things are going in terms of the conversation about the legal situation surrounding the president which is that we aposre shifting away from this collusion narrative that we aposve been given for the last two years and instead talking about campaign finance issues and things that are much more under the purview of the southern district of new york and that aposs going to be i think the legal challenge for the president moving forward in terms of what democrats on capitol hill are going to do with this information this all is taking place in the context of the push backed by the democratic base for impeachment of the president impeachment which is i think unlikely to happen given the leadership of the democrats and what they want to have going forward the risks that they think would be entailed with pursuing impeachment in a situation as they have it today wallace all right we aposre going to get more into impeachment in the moment but marie what about this argument and the president said it and ben suggested it as well that the russia collusion obstruction of justice is basically a dry hole so democrats are shifting the terms of the debate to basically what the president did before he ever came to office as citizens trump marie harf co host benson and harf i think that aposs wishful thinking on the part of a lot of republicans and the president there are two big buckets of things that we heard from michael cohen this week that that will be important going forward the first is about the russia investigation michael cohen testified that donald trump had advance knowledge of wikileaks releasing information it had gotten from the russians that they had stolen donald wallace wait wait wait i mean he claims that he overheard a conversation harf right exactly wallace between roger stone and the president harf right wallace but there aposs no backup for that i mean it aposs his word harf so so it opens the door it doesn apost answer any questions but it puts a lot more on the table donald trump has said under oath in answers to bob mueller that he never discussed wikileaks with roger stone so again not an answer but more questions about donald trump wikileaks and the russians also not all the criminal conduct that was alleged in that hearing was from before donald trump became president some of it including with with checks with with documentary evidence is from when donald trump was in office michael cohen testifying he knows of other criminal behavior that is being investigated currently by the southern district of new york that donald trump undertook those are two big places where going forward we are going to be focused russia absolutely still a key part of that chris wallace let aposs take step back and take a look at the big picture congresswoman you were in congress in 1998 when the republicans were hell bent on impeaching bill clinton they did and they ended up facing a big backlash for doing it it was seen as an overreach how do you think democrats handle impeachment and what about all these investigations of trump six at least six committees looking into every part of the president aposs dealings both as a private citizen and as president jane harman former congresswoman well let me say first that during my nine terms in congress i served with john dingell he was the chairman of the energy and commerce committee on which i served he was a magical magnificent leader and debbie is such a worthy successor it was really touching to see your interview on this yes i was there and i was also there as a young lawyer in the early apos70s during the saturday night massacre and when richard nixon was impeached and two very different scenes but in the late apos90s everything stopped and it was viewed as totally political and during that time let aposs understand that al qaeda and osama bin laden grew in strength i mean there had been the attacks right before that on the african embassy so everyone took our collective eye off of critically important national security things to focus on this impeachment and it was damaging yes it was damaging to one party but i aposd rather say it was damaging to the country to go through the exercise i aposm not saying impeachment is never worth it it has to happen it aposs a constitutional remedy but segue to now with all these investigations going on i think the good news about that is that nancy pelosi is an adult and she aposs exercising an iron hand over where all this is going and keeping people in in their in their places and are a few people already favoring impeachment yes they are but i think bob mueller is going to have a major work wallace well yes and harman here when his report in some form comes out wallace and i want to pick up on that with you gillian because we are talking about all this in perfect ignorance of what aposs going to be in the mueller report and you know it was supposed to come out last week now people talking maybe this week or whenever we don apost know what he aposs going to say and what he aposs going to find out how hard the evidence is going to be about possible collusion possible obstruction of justice we also don apost know what bill barr because he gives the quote confidential report to the attorney general then the attorney general decides what to share with congress gillian turner correspondent we don apost know if we aposll ever get to see anything we the american people we may not get a bite at this report ever but i think the best possible scenario based on what the law spells out here is that you know it goes from mueller to barr barr to congress and they decide to release some portions of it or some heavily redacted portions of it my worry for the country with that scenario with that likely scenario is is this report ever going to amount to anything more than a rorschach test for the two political sides anyway is it going to short of collusion in the form of we aposve got video of president trump talking to president putin about the about wikileaks something short of that direct both sides will take from this report what they want to see and retreat to their corners and we will be exactly where we are today now having had the report released behind us i think that will be very toxic for for the country wallace and congressman if and i want to repeat this is just speculative but it aposs a legitimate issue if bill barr because under the regulations he decides what to release to congress and therefore what to release to the public if he decides to limit what he aposs going to release particularly if mueller says there aposs not the basis to indict the president for instance what will nancy pelosi and the democrats do harman well i can apost speak for them but i wallace right your guess harman i i think that congress is an independent branch of government i think they will demand to see as much as possible of the report and we don apost know what would be in it and there may be some indictments more indictments that come down before the report and remember he aposs very good mueller at these speaking indictments so you learn a lot through each indictment but whatever that is i think what she will do in some very coordinated and disciplined way is exercise the oversight responsibilities of congress do the investigations where they lead and there are investigations about the connection to russia and there are reasons to think there might have been a connection to russia and there are reasons to think there may have might have been a connection to russia and and then we aposll see but i aposm hoping that the country sticks together that the toxic partisanship starts to someh
