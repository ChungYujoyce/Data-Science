apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic nagoya japan former house speaker newt gingrich who led the last impeachment of a president said president trump can help himself by taming his frustration over the democrats partisan inquiry and staying focused on highlighting his economic achievements for middle class voters mr gingrich points to the example of former president bill clinton the man he helped impeach in 1998 as someone who successfully navigated that difficult path go back and look at clinton he compartmentalized mr gingrich said in an exclusive interview clinton was very disciplined about saying i m working on the american people s problems and i m not going to talk about that impeachment see also trump rips reports of 2nd deep state whistleblower keep them coming mr gingrich who has offered advice to mr trump since house democrats announced the formal impeachment inquiry said the president just needs to realize he doesn t necessarily help his case when he stays on this topic my advice would be to relax understand you re going to lose in the house mr gingrich said i don t worry at all about trump getting convicted in the republican majority senate mr trump spent much of the weekend tweeting his criticism of what he calls the latest democratic witch hunt the impeachment inquiry focusing on his efforts to persuade ukraine s president to investigate democratic presidential front runner joseph r biden he also engaged in a feud with sen mitt romney utah republican who has criticized the president s actions see also lindsey graham vows whistleblowers will testify in public if house votes to impeach not only are the do nothing democrats interfering in the 2020 election but they are continuing to interfere in the 2016 election they must be stopped the president tweeted the former speaker sat down with the washington times to discuss impeachment during a leadership summit in japan sponsored by the universal peace federation at which he delivered a keynote address mr gingrich said the president is understandably resentful of the impeachment inquiry after special counsel robert mueller s long running investigation found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign in 2016 that s one of the great dangers he faces he said first of all he s now been through three years of this and it does wear on you if you re president there does get to be a point where you wonder how are you supposed to cope with this but he believes mr trump will emerge in a stronger position to win reelection and he views sen elizabeth warren massachusetts democrat as the president s most likely opponent as mr biden grapples with his own ukraine controversy mr gingrich said the impeachment effort has fired up the republican base like nothing he has ever seen for the first time really in my lifetime you have an aroused conservative base out there that wants a fight he said they are totally prepared to go to the mat if you look at the initial republican fundraising reaction it seems to me that trump s base is reacting a lot stronger than democrats base and i think that makes it much more dangerous for the democrats mr trump s reelection effort raised 45 million online in the third quarter fueled by 313 000 first time donors and a big spike in small dollar donations the online donations part of an overall haul of 125 million by the trump campaign and the republican national committee rose 29 over the second quarter asked whether he believes democrats will succeed in impeaching mr trump mr gingrich replied sure anytime you re willing to commit suicide you can get a lot done he said adding that speaker nancy pelosi is endangering democrats in pro trump districts who are going to lose their seats look at rep collin c petersen in minnesota a 30 point trump district he said it s rural it s the kind of district where people just look at this stuff and think it s all garbage many democrats consider the impeachment of mr clinton more than 20 years ago as the same sort of partisan motivated effort that republicans say mr trump now faces mr gingrich said the two cases have significant differences first of all it s not an impeachment he said of the investigation of mr trump it s a coup there s no characteristic comparable to impeachment mr clinton was impeached for lying under oath and obstruction of justice charges that arose from a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by paula jones the impeachment was preceded by independent counsel kenneth w starr s report to congress which substantiated allegations of perjury and obstruction starr listed 11 things that he believes clinton s guilty of each of which is impeachable mr gingrich said so we were faced with a report from a reasonably competent person who uses the word guilty he said republicans during mr clinton s impeachment established procedural rules including allowing subpoena power for the minority party until democrats actually vote for the process and they actually set up a set of rules this is just a bunch of politicians on a witch hunt mr gingrich said what they re proposing on two levels is crazy one is that the congress can override executive privilege randomly on fishing expeditions and the other is that any foreign government leader who speaks with an american president needs to be aware that whatever he or she says may be captured by the democratic congress it s about as deep a hit on national security as you can get some republicans who participated in mr clinton s impeachment now view it differently former rep bob inglis a south carolina republican who helped draft the articles of impeachment and voted to impeach mr clinton said the accusations against mr trump are more troubling he said mr trump s alleged quid pro quo communications with ukraine the president was withholding military aid a matter not discussed in the call are more relevant to the operations of the executive branch the allegations against president trump are really far more serious they involve abuse of power abuse of the office mr inglis said saturday on fox news i think in retrospect it was a mistake to impeach bill clinton because the substance of the matter really wasn t all that essential to the nation in retrospect i think it really didn t go to the heart of the operation of the united states what we re dealing here with president trump does go to the heart of american foreign policy and to the heart of the office i think we house republicans were sort of blinded by our dislike of president clinton in retrospect i wish we hadn t done it although mr clinton was impeached the senate failed to muster the necessary two thirds majority to remove him from office and he completed his second term mr trump and his allies are targeting rep adam b schiff california democrat and chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence as the partisan leader of the impeachment probe many in mr trump s camp also believe they have nearly succeeded in mortally wounding the campaign of mr biden over his alleged strong arming of ukraine s leaders in 2016 to oust a prosecutor who had been investigating an energy company that paid his son hunter 3 million i think it s kind of helpful to have biden disappear mr gingrich said i think it increases the chaos on their side if i were a moderate democrat right now i d be really worried he expects ms warren to emerge as the party s nominee next year and views it as a good outcome for mr trump my expectation is that as long as the economy does reasonably well that trump will win he said and if the democrats do what i think they re going to do which is nominate warren it could be like 72 you could have a cataclysmic effect that was the year president nixon defeated democrat george mcgovern in a landslide capturing every state but massachusetts but two years later facing certain impeachment and removal from office over the
