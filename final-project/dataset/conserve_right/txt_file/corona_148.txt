and asking did i already have the novel coronavirus and if so what does it mean for me now a meme circulating on social media takes these questions even farther asking who got sick in november or december and it lasted 10 to 14 days if you can answer yes then you probably had the coronavirus you guys lived through that quit letting the media control you now give me back my toilet paper sports parades etc like so many posts that go viral experts say this one mixes a bit of encouraging potential truth with some inaccurate and potentially dangerous misinformation first a cautious silver lining there s a very real chance that some southern californians who had dry coughs fevers and other symptoms of the coronavirus as far back as december mighthave already recovered from the disease according to both brandon brown a public health professor at uc riverside who specializes in infectious diseases and dr robert kim farley an epidemiology professor at ucla if people did beat the virus both experts said there s a chance those patients can t get it again or spread it to others that in turn means those people might be able to start to return to their usual routines sooner rather than later now for the bad news most people don t know if they actually had the coronavirus because they haven t been tested and there isn t a test available yet that can tell if someone already recovered from the disease even if they did get a coronavirus test or an antibody test to show a past infection scientists don t yet know for sure if beating novel coronavirus once means long term immunity and assuming otherwise could expose more vulnerable people to a potentially fatal disease and extend the pandemic researchers now believe the new coronavirus emerged in mid november or early december with a transfer from wildlife to humans at an open air market in wuhan china the first identified case in the united states was mid january in a washington state man who d recently returned from wuhan it is possible that travelers to or from china may have already been exposed and transmitting covid 19 to others a few months ago kim farley said but given the slow roll out and limited supply of test kits combined with the good news that perhaps 80 of coronavirus cases are mild enough that people recover on their own experts say it s a near certainty that lots of people who ve had the virus simply haven t been tested it s risky though for people to assume what they had was the coronavirus there are other diseases influenza being one of them that may have similar symptoms to mild covid 19 kim farley said therefore it would not be wise to assume that an illness with symptoms compatible to covid 19 is definitely covid 19 if people assume they ve beaten the virus and resume their usual routines brown said they can inadvertently spread the infection to others including older people with compromised immune systems and others who are much more likely to have serious complications or die from the coronavirus hence experts are pushing for physical distancing until the virus subsides it s also not 100 clear whether people who ve had the coronavirus can or can t get it again as with most viruses kim farley said it s believed that people who ve beaten the coronavirus will produce antibodies that will protect them against the current strain of covid 19 the question of how long that protection will last is still unknown but is being studied over time kim farley said also there have been a few cases brown noted where people tested positive for covid 19 recovered from the disease but later tested positive a second time it could be that these individuals did not completely clear the virus he said we don t know enough at this point brown added but we believe that once you are infected and mount an immune response you are less likely to get sick a second time that s one reason experts say antibody tests currently in development will be helpful such tests could show if someone had the virus previously and has built up a defense once testing becomes more widespread and it is possible to routinely test people there may be a point at which such people who are immune can be easily identified and they could go back to work even in healthcare settings kim farley said that will help us to re start getting back to normal antibody testing also could help cut down on new transmissions since brown said health officials could quarantine those who ve been in contact with someone who previously had the virus for now both brown and kim farley said everyone should continue to follow physical distancing and other safety guidelines recommended by public health officials we don t know enough about the virus at this time to believe if we get sick we can go back to our normal lives brown said get the latest news delivered daily we invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community although we do not pre
