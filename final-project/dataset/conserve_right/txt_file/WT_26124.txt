leaving the democratic party are a republican fantasy trump s presidency has only solidified the fact that the democratic party has been and will remain the political home of the american jewish electorate jdca executive director halie soifer said in a statement this is because trump s policies and rhetoric are antithetical to jewish values and because anti semitism has increased to unprecedented levels due to trump s divisive words policies and willful blindness but at the rjc trump earned standing ovations for recounting both the embassy move and the golan heights recognition trump noted it had long been a priority for adelson and his wife miriam that is the most important thing that s ever happened in their life trump said they love israel trump s speech comes weeks after
