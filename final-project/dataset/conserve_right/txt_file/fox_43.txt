ng on fox news sunday press secretary sarah sanders says negotiations with democrats on border security funding and the wall are making progress but there s still a long way to go this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday january 6 2019 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace shutdown day 16 and president trump is still deadlocked with house democrats over the border wall begin videotape sen chuck schumer d n y senate minority leader he said he aposd keep the government closed for a very long period of time months or even years president donald trump absolutely i said that i aposm very proud of doing what i aposm doing wallace with nancy pelosi back as speaker we aposll discuss the new challenges facing the president in this era of divided government with white house press secretary sarah sanders and we aposll find out what house democrats hope to accomplish from congressional leader david cicilline plus president trump takes incoming from both sides sen mitt romney r ut i haven apost decided who i aposm going to endorse in 2020 i aposm going to wait to see what the alternatives are rep rashida tlaib d mich we are going to go in there and we aposre going to impeach the mother expletive deleted wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about an even tougher road for the president in washington and our power players of the week two new members of congress and how they intend to work across the aisle to get things done unidentified female for me its mission and when you are serving in the cia and the military you wake up everyday and you know what you aposre doing and why you aposre doing it and i think it aposs no different in congress unidentified male we aposve got to start socializing together the polarization the balkanization has taken us apart wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington president trump now says the government shutdown could go on for months or even years with the standoff over the border wall now in its third week white house officials and congressional staffers met saturday to work towards a deal but prospects for a breakthrough remain dim as the new democratic majority in the house seems determined to stand up to president trump in a moment we aposll speak with white house press secretary sarah sanders but first let aposs bring in kevin corke live at the white house with the latest on talks between the two sides kevin kevin corke correspondent chris with no end to the shutdown in sight top white house officials will join the president at camp david today for a 2019 agenda strategy session and as you can imagine at the top of the list ending the shutdown begin videotape corke from the situation room rose garden briefing and cabinet rooms and this weekend the eisenhower executive office building president trump carefully crafted a forward leaning posture during the shutdown this week but for all the crime statistics and letters to congress imploring lawmakers to fund border security including the wall an ominous realization has a cast a pall over the nation aposs capital with no sign of movement in the negotiations a partial government shutdown is unlikely to end anytime soon schumer it aposs very hard to see how progress would be made unless they open up the government corke now 16 days into the shutdown it is clear that despite increased face to face engagement cooler heads haven apost prevailed in fact the president turned up the heat warning that he would consider using a national emergency to get his wall funding if democrats won apost budge trump absolutely we can do it i haven apost done it i may do it i may do it end videotape corke so while the president stays here and then heads to camp david remaining in washington will be vice president mike pence in fact he will be here conducting yet another working discussion with congressional democrats who of course are here with their staffers hoping to find a way chris to end the shutdown wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thank you and joining me now here in the studio white house press secretary sarah sanders sarah welcome back to fox news sunday sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary great to be with you wallace so what is the latest on the negotiations did they make any progress yesterday sanders well they made some progress yesterday the fact that they aposre sitting down at the table is some progress in and of itself but they aposve got a long way to go i mean democrats set down the first thing that one of the individuals from the democrats apos side said in the meeting was we aposre not here to make an agreement so this was the beginning of a conversation that still has i think a lot left to be worked out they aposre going to meet again later this afternoon and hopefully they aposll continue to make progress and continue to move the ball down the field at the end of the day though democrats have said over and over again that they support border security that they support protecting american citizens now it aposs time to fulfill some of those statements that they aposve made work with the president let aposs get this done let aposs open the government back up wallace well of course the question is is the wall the best way to do it and i aposm going to ask you about that in a minute but again going back to friday the president meant what he said that he is prepared to fight for the wall to continue the shutdown for months or even years sanders well i think that aposs one of the things that people misunderstand the president aposs not fighting for the wall he aposs fighting for the protection of american citizens we cannot wallace but he wants the wall to do that sanders absolutely he wants the wall and he wants a number of other things we have a completely broken immigration system we have national crisis not just of safety and security but a humanitarian crisis we have drugs we have human traffickers we have terrorists that come across our border and there has to be a stop to that and we want to do not just the wall certainly that aposs one of the most important factors we know that it works we know that in the places that it aposs been it aposs 95 percent effective we want to be effective across the board and that includes the wall and other technology along the wallace but you aposre not answering my question he meant what he said he aposs prepared to continue this fight this shutdown for months or even years sanders absolutely the president means what he says when he says that but it would be outrageous for democrats who agree with the president that aposs what aposs the most outrageous thing to me and something that frankly is so just incomprehensible they agree with the president they agree that we need border security they just are unwilling to let this president win and i think at some point they have to decide that they care more about americans than fighting the president and so far we haven apost seen a willingness on their side to fully do that wallace but let aposs talk about caring about americans because house democrats this week passed six bills that would fund eight agencies unrelated to homeland security unrelated to the wall that would get them back going right now and the question is why not sign that bill fund those agencies that have nothing to do with the border wall and not hold those hundreds of thousands of federal workers and the services they provide hostage sanders we aposre not holding anybody hostage the president wants to fund the government he wants to open the government wallace but you could open those eight other agencies sanders chris we aposve been having this debate for years at some point we have to say enough is enough until we can come together we can be reasonable which we have put forth in good faith multiple offers to democrats to say let aposs make a deal let aposs have a discussion let aposs get to a place where we agree we have to stop kicking the can down the road and just continuing to say let aposs do it again in 30 days let aposs do it in 45 days let aposs do it now wallace no no no but do you but i aposm not talking about homeland security that you can continue to fight about that if you want and you shut it down but why hold agriculture hostage why hold justice hostage why hold the treasury department hostage why not fund them they have nothing to do with a border wall sanders the president wants to do this all at once he knows it aposs better if they can focus on getting all of these packages done at one time wallace isn apost the real reason because you want the leverage from all the agencies sanders it aposs not just it aposs not that but you also have to look at the six bills those aren apost the budget that we submitted either there are a lot of discrepancies between what we wallace those have all been approved by republicans in the senate sanders they have i aposm not saying we oppose those six i aposm just saying to make it like this is an easy deal we want to be able to negotiate but at the same time you can apost just keep passing the buck this is a major point of contention and let aposs just sit down and work it out wallace ok but if this shutdown lags on not months or years but even in to february it aposs going to start to hurt real people take a look at this sarah federal tax refunds will be delayed food stamps for 38 million americans will be cut millions of people will lose rental assistance payments and union leaders say hundreds of tsa workers are already off the job because they can apost afford to get to work president trump thinks the border wall is worth all of that sanders look the president certainly doesn apost want any of those things to happen but you know what else he doesn apost want to see happen he never wants to make a phone call like the one he made earlier this week where he spoke to officer singh of california aposs widow because an illegal immigrant came up off their border and killed him in cold blood this shouldn apost happen in this country particularly when we have things that we know can help prevent it every life that aposs what sets america apart from every other country we value life that it aposs what makes us unique and the day that we stop doing that even if it aposs one 10 or 100 000 that aposs when we stop being the greatest country on the face of this earth not only people like that but we also have a massive influx of drugs that come across the southern border ninety percent of the heroin that comes into this country comes across through the southern border and 300 americans are killed from that every single month wallace but let aposs talk sanders we have to look at it across the board wallace let aposs talk about the wall because there is no question that there has been a big spike in the number of family units coming across the border the president talks about terrorists potentially coming across the border and here is secretary of homeland security nielsen take a look begin video clip kirstjen nielsen secretary of homeland security the cbp has stopped over 3 000 what we call special interest aliens trying to come into the country in the southern border those are aliens who the intel community has identified are of concern end video clip wallace but special interest aliens are just people who come from countries that have ever produced a terrorist they aposre not terrorists themselves and the state department says that there is quote their words no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from mexico sanders we know that roughly nearly 4 000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border wallace wait wait wait i know the statistic i didn apost know you were going to use it but i studied up on this do you know where those 4 000 people come where they aposre captured airports sanders not always wallace at airports sanders certainly a large number wallace the state department says there hasn apost been any terrorists that they aposve found coming across the southern border with mexico sanders it aposs by air it aposs by land and it aposs by sea it aposs all of the above but one thing that you aposre forgetting is that the most vulnerable point of entry that we have into this country is our southern border and we have to protect it and the more individuals that crosstalk wallace but they aposre not coming across the southern border sarah they aposre coming and they aposre being stopped at airports sanders they aposre coming a number of ways they aposre certainly i aposm not disagreeing with you that they aposre coming through airports i aposm saying that they come by air by land and by sea and the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it the more that we aposre going to have an influx not just of terrorists but of human traffickers drug inflow and people that are coming here to do american citizens harm wallace ok the president now says and this was a revelation on friday that he can go around congress and build this wall on his own take a look begin video clip trump we can call a national emergency because of the security of our country absolutely no we can do it i haven apost done it i may do it i may do it but we could call a national emergency and build it very quickly end video clip wallace how serious is he about that has the white house drafted an emergency order a resolution that he could that he could that he could announce tomorrow we aposre going to declare a national emergency we aposre going to build the wall has he set a deadline for when he aposs going to end talks and simply say i aposm going to go off on my own and do it and is he really prepared sanders that aposs a lot of questions wallace well three crosstalk wallace is he really prepared it aposs still the same question which is how serious is he is he really prepared to go off on his own and use money that was authorized for military construction and build a wall instead sanders the president aposs prepared to do what it takes to protect our borders to protect the people of this country he knows that the number one job he has as president and commander in chief is to protect its citizens and if he doesn apost take that seriously whether it aposs at our southern border or whether it aposs from terrorists coming from whatever way they come or any other place that wallace and does he really think he has sanders they can try to do harm to americans then he is not going to be the president that he knows himself to be and he has shown himself to be over the last two years wallace and he really just quickly does he really think that he has the authority to build the wall with funds that were appropriated for the military construction without congressional approval sanders as we aposve said for the last several weeks we aposre looking and exploring every option available that the president has whether wallace and is that a viable option sanders whatever action he takes will certainly be lawful and we aposre looking at every option we can this is something the president takes incredibly seriously is very passionate about and is not going to stop until he figures out the best way to make sure we aposre doing everything we can to make america safer and more secure wallace i aposve got less than a minute left president trump is at camp david today to meet with white house senior officials about his priorities for 2019 what can you tell us about the meeting and about what his agenda is sanders we had an incredible first two years under the president trump the economy is strong isis has been on the run the judiciary is being made we have just a number of successes over these first two years we want to look at how we aposre going to continue to build on those as we move into 2020 wallace top priority sanders i think the president aposs got a lot immigration certainly has to be at the forefront right now that aposs one of the biggest things that we have to get done is securing our border but not just securing the border but fixing the immigration system as a whole it aposs completely broken the president wants to make sure we look at all of the different things loopholes we can close to make that better infrastructure fighting the opioid crisis those are going to be things that also not only are the president aposs big priorities but things we think we might be able to get democrats to actually work with us the american people elected them to come here and do more than just fight the president and we hope that they aposll fulfill their constituents apos hopes for them and do exactly that wallace sarah thank you sanders thank you wallace thanks for coming in today always good to talk to you sanders always great to be here wallace up next reaction from a top house democrat what aposs their plan to end the shutdown and what about those calls to impeach the president commercial break wallace house democrats have an ambitious agenda as they take over the majority from infrastructure to health care to investigations of the trump administration but their first priority is to end the government shutdown joining us now from rhode island one of their new leaders congressman david cicilline chair of the house democratic policy and communications committee congressman what aposs the latest on where negotiations stand are your is your side willing to compromise with the president on the border wall or are you in effect demanding his surrender rep david cicilline d r i no i don apost think we are demanding a surrender but what we aposre demanding is that the government be reopened we passed appropriations bill that were passed unanimously by the senate they were supported by republicans there was an agreement on those bills the president at the last moment changed his mind and that deal fell apart so we are trying to isolate the disagreement so we passed again the senate approved version that it was the republican path forward that passed the house in a bipartisan way with republicans and democrats we sent that to the senate what we are saying is open of the government we aposll have a short term extension so we can resolve this disagreement but we need to reopen the government and the president has really held this wallace i just cicilline i aposm sorry wallace let me just interrupt for a second because speaker pelosi and democratic senate leader schumer have been hinting at this on friday after the meeting is that the democratic view know that there can be no negotiations on the border wall at all until the president agrees to reopen the rest of the government cicilline i mean i think we believe the government must reopen immediately i mean it aposs having real consequences not only to the federal workers but to the contrary in terms of food stamps in terms of tax refunds in terms of the safety at the airports with the tsa i mean there are real consequences to a prolonged shutdown the president doesn apost seem to understand that but it aposs really impacting small business it aposs impacting people aposs lives and so what we are saying is open the government there aposs agreement bipartisan agreement on funding the government let aposs isolate the disagreement the department of homeland security and continue talking wallace all right let aposs talk about the merits of a border wall here aposs what new speaker nancy pelosi says begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif speaker of the house we are not doing a wall does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall the wall in my view is an immorality it is again a waste of money and opportunity cost to protect the american people but it is a diversionary tactic on the part of the president end video clip wallace i want to ask you a specific question congressman why is a wall immoral i aposm not asking why it aposs ineffective or why you think the money could be spent better but the speaker keeps saying the wall is immoral there aposs a wall or a fence around the white house people build walls around their homes why is a border wall immoral cicilline i think what the speaker is saying is that we believe in securing our borders we have appropriated 1 7 billion over the last two years for border security the department has spent less than 6 percent but we are prepared to do more because we need to do more but we want to do it in a way that aposs effective crosstalk wallace if i may just press why is a wall immoral cicilline well that aposs a question the speaker will have to answer but i think what she means by that is it doesn apost reflect our values as a country that america has been a place that welcomes refugees and immigrants people who are fleeing violence and war but i think the real point of that the rest of her sentence is it aposs not cost effective it doesn apost achieve the objective democrats are committing to securing our borders we have voted to secure our borders and appropriate significant resources to do it wallace ok cicilline but let aposs use technology let aposs use drones let aposs use satellites let aposs do cargo inspections which aren apost happening let aposs do things that will actually secure the border wallace ok but let aposs talk about the effectiveness of it brandon judd is the president of the national border patrol council he aposs been a border patrol agent for 21 years here aposs what he says begin video clip brandon judd national border patrol council president anywhere that you look where we have built walls they have worked they have been an absolute necessity for border patrol agents in securing the border end video clip wallace here aposs a guy who has been on the front lines on the border for two decades he says border walls work cicilline well look i think there aposs no question there are places we have walls and fencing and other kind of barriers i think good border security is going to be a combination of things but what we aposve heard of from the president is he wants a big great concrete wall that will be a thousand miles crosstalk wallace no no he aposs given up on the concrete wall he is talking about steel fencing out cicilline but i think the reality is this is actually a fight the president has created to distract from the real issues that he aposs facing the fact is the republicans were in control of the house the senate and the white house for two years and if this is such an important priority for the president why didn apost he do it at the beginning of the administration he waited to the lame duck why because his defense secretary left with a strong rebuke of his foreign policy his national security advisors sentencing hearing blowup because of the seriousness of the charges his foundation was closed on for persistent illegalities the gentleman heading the isis effort resigned wallace ok cicilline it was a bad couple of weeks so what does the president do he shuts the government down and he aposs distracted all the attention away from all of those pressing issues to the government shutdown wallace but sir the fact is even the washington post today said that there is now a crisis at the border there has been a dramatic spike in the number of family units coming across the southern border i want to put up some statistics in november of 2017 a year plus ago the border patrol apprehended 7 000 family units at our southwest border this past november two months ago they caught 25 000 family units coming across and look at these recent incidents were border patrol agents had to fire tear gas at migrants who were trying to climb the fence and who were throwing rocks at the border agents i mean congressman the president is not making this up cicilline no the reality is this is a complicated problem it requires a sophisticated answer and i think the incoming chief of staff for the president and the outgoing chief of staff have both set up border wall doesn apost solve this problem we need to have comprehensive immigration reform we need to have additional personnel we need to use technology so we want to secure our border and respond to these challenges but we want to do it in a way that works a way that will achieve the objective and so what we are saying to the president is open up the government these other departments have nothing to do with this do not punish the american people by shutting down government if you don apost get your way wallace all right i got cicilline and wallace let me just interrupt because i have two minutes left and i want to get to questions in cicilline sure wallace the president said on friday that he has the right and he aposs even considering and you heard it from sarah sanders just a moment ago declaring a national emergency and building a wall in his own without congressional approval using funds that have been appropriated for military construction if he goes ahead and does that what will house democrats like yourself do cicilline well i don apost think the president has that authority he would have to meet a very high standard article one establishes the congress of the united states and gives us the responsibility of appropriating money so i don apost think the president has the authority to do that and i hope you will continue to try to work with congress to resolve this disagreement but open the government first this the government will reopen when the republicans in the senate and the president come to their senses and recognize that we shouldn apost be shutting down the government if they don apost get their way wallace finally i aposve got less than a minute finally freshman congresswoman rashida tlaib and i know you were expecting this question of michigan said this on thursday night begin video clip rep rashida tlaib d mich when your son looks at you and says mama look you won bullies don apost win and i said baby they don apost because we aposre going to go in there and we aposre going to the mother expletive deleted cheers end video clip wallace what do you think of the language and what do you think of the idea of moving right away to impeach president trump cicilline well look democrats ran on the agenda for the people to drive down health care costs drive down the cost of prescription drugs raise family incomes by rebuilding american wallace i got all of that and i got a little time but specifically crosstalk cicilline look i think we need to move forward on our agenda at the same time our caucus is big and diverse and people are bringing their passions and reflecting the strong feelings of their constituents and there are a number of people who think we should move quickly on impeachment i aposm one of the people who think we have to wait for mr mueller to complete his report so we know all the facts before we take any action wallace and really quick yes or no do you condemn that language cicilline look i aposm not going to look it aposs kind of odd to hear people on the republican side who have not condemned the president aposs language in a million of different contexts to suddenly be clutching their pearls over her use of that language like look this is a private event she can use whatever language she thinks is appropriate the fundamental issues democrats are fighting for the people of this country and we aposre going to focus on the issues that matter in their lives and we aposre going to do our oversight responsibilities in a serious way wallace congressman cicilline thank you thanks for your time sir please come back cicilline i will thanks for having me wallace up next how long will the shutdown drag on we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the deadlock and when most americans will start feeling the pain commercial break wallace coming up the shutdown over the border wall tests the new divide in washington begin video clip trump without a wall you cannot have border security pelosi we aposre not doing the wall does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the political power struggle next commercial break begin video clip trump the southern border is a dangerous horrible disaster we aposve done a great job but you can apost really do the kind of job we have to do unless you have a major powerful barrier pelosi we recognize on the democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president end video clip wallace president trump and house speaker pelosi giving no sign of progress in talks to end the partial government shutdown and resolve the fight over funding for a border wall and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service marie harf co host of benson and harf on fox news radio and jonah goldberg of the national review congressman chaffetz there was an interesting development in the last couple of days a few three as i could them senate republicans who were up for re election in 2020 are now beginning to break with the president and say we need to reopen the government cory gardner of colorado susan collins of maine tom tillis of north carolina how do you see this shutdown ending when do you see this shutdown ending jason chaffetz contributor well i wish i could have that magic ball to tell you exactly what it is and i hope it aposs sooner rather than later but i think the democrats have really put themselves in a tough box because the president is on the side of national security protecting our border and doing what the federal employees the border patrol wants to do they had 60 000 people they apprehended in november coming across the border and when the border patrol goes out and says we have to have some sort of impediment something that will slow them down some sort of wall or barrier where we aposve done it in the past it work that aposs a compelling argument and i aposm sensitive to cory gardner who aposs a great member of the united states senate but now is the congress always gravitates to deadlines and pressure points and that aposs what i think is ultimately going to get this solved is the need the desire to solve this now rather than continuing to punt it down the road wallace mo are the democrats the one who were in a hole and are going to need to get out of it mo elleithee contributor i don apost think so i think most americans would agree that this is the president aposs shutdown and that the president is basically holding hundreds of thousands of federal workers hostage over over this and it aposs not just them it aposs the people who contract with the federal government people who aren apost getting paid people who are worried about paying the bills people who are worried about paying their rent people who may get stuck at airports this is all these are the pressure points that are really going to move this and i think to say that you aposre going to continue this for years over an argument an immigration argument that is actually not proven to be effective that is sort of in where there has bene a wall we have seen breaches time and time again almost 10 000 breaches among certain sectors of the wall that exist now rather than taking that money and investing in actual technologies that would provide real border security investigating in more border patrol agents that to me seems like a better way to go to keep the government shutdown and hurt all these people over kind of a fantasy answer i think is going to come back and hurt the president wallace i aposll let you answer about the fencing answer but but i mean here aposs the problem it seems to me if the if nancy pelosi were to say tomorrow all right we aposre going to give you the money for the wall she aposd be thrown out as speaker her her house democratic caucus would not stand for that if the president were to say you know what i give up on the wall his political base that 39 40 percent would turn on him where does the pressure come and is going to be a surrender by one side to the other are they going to sort of lay down the instruments of war or is there going to be a compromise that involves something that the president ends up giving to democrats whether it aposs on daca the dreamers people with temporary protected status whatever jonah goldberg contributor yes so that apos that aposs part of the irony here right is the fight over this is almost purely symbolic now it is a if they win we lose zero sum understanding that if trump gets anything he can claim victory for democrats will feel like it aposs a loss and vice versa the irony is is that there are serious public policy compromises that could be found here on daca there are serious restriction like my friend mark krikorian ph who argued for you know things like e verify that are much more important than a wall but the problem is wallace and incidentally e verify is is not goldberg shut down right now yes wallace right it aposs shut down as a part of the government shutdown that aposs the system that that people can use to check as to whether somebody aposs in the country legally or not goldberg right and so i to answer the question about the pressure point thing it seems to me that if you actually end up right now it aposs a lot of posturing from the tsa and their union but it seems to me that if if if airports start essentially shutting down and rip people out and the rest of the country start to feel the bite that is where i think the pressure really starts to build that moves markets that aposs going to cause congressman to start buckling right now overflowing garbage cans on the mall is not exactly i drove past it this morning it aposs not exactly like a scene from a mad max movie out there but as time goes by i think those are the pressure points and you can see a lot of senators get weak in the knees about it wallace all right i aposm i aposm going to ask all of you for a prediction in a moment but if not for the shutdown the big political story this week would be the house going back to the democrats nancy pelosi regaining the speakership after eight years in the minority in the first speaker to regain the gavel since sam rayburn in the 1950s here she was on thursday begin video clip pelosi i pledge that this congress will be transparent bipartisan and unifying that we will seek to reach across the aisle in this chamber and across divisions across our nation end video clip wallace marie whatever you think of her policies nancy pelosi is clearly a heck of a politician how effective do you think she aposll be dealing with president trump on this and other issues marie harf analyst absolutely and i i think i was one of those democrats that underestimated her ability to win back the speakership with the kind of numbers she got the fact that alexandria ocasio cortez voted for her in the end is just a symbol of the fact that she was able to win back that speakership in a way that showed her strength and her legislative ability the two things the democratic house have done now legislatively they aposve introduced a bill to on voting rights to get corruption out of washington and they aposve passed bills to reopen the government so i think they put down a marker this week that they are not here to play they have an agenda they aposre going to push it forward she will have i think some challenges bringing together this moderate block of democrats who re won the house in places like michigan elissa slotkin coming up later on the show she aposs one of them she is a moderate she is not an abolish ice democrat combine that with aoc and the liberal wing of the party going into a presidential election wallace aoc folks harf that is now how we refer to alexander ocasio cortez it aposs like jfk or lbj aoc harf exactly thank you but i think you know if we aposve seen anything from nancy pelosi in the few months since democrats retook the house it aposs that she can bring those members together and as long as donald trump aposs in the white house i think she aposs going to be pretty effective and she aposs shown that this week in holding the line wallace ok we got a minute left in this segment and i want to ping pong back and forth and get your predictions on friday as it goes into the 21st day if it does the shutdown would be the longest in history midnight friday will we a week from today will the shutdown still be going on and when it ends which side is going to be seen as winning chaffetz still going on and i think the next pressure point is actually the state of the union at the end of january i think if you will see some wallace so that aposs like january 29th chaffetz yes i think it will continue on to to go on to that to that point wallace and who aposs going to win chaffetz i think the republicans are going to win they aposre on the right side of the argument wallace ok chaffetz protecting our borders is the right side of the argument wallace mo elleithee i think it goes on probably for at least a couple more weeks but i think the points that jonah were making and others were making when this starts to be felt in people aposs homes or in their community or in the airports wallace and who caves elleithee the president will will will cave and democrats will actually find a way to help him cave a little bit less painfully is is what aposs going to be really interesting wallace marie harf i actually hope that democrats get something like daca out of this i don apost want this to keep going on but you aposre right the more real people that feel this people that can apost pay rent if it goes on till the state of the union i think that aposs insane that is crazy goldberg i think it goes past the state of the union harf oh my god goldberg and i think the living will envy the dead no i think i do think it goes past the state of the union and they will find a way for everyone to declare a victory wallace well that aposs very sensible and actually i do think that aposs true i mean it can apost be a complete surrender goldberg right harf right wallace it has to be the kind of compromise all right panel we have to take a break here when we come back the living will envy the dead president trump takes incoming from both sides a freshman democrat makes an obscene call for his impeachment and a longtime republican rival arrives in washington and wastes no time taking a shot and what would you like to ask the panel about mitt romney aposs criticism of the president just go to facebook or twitter at foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip sen mitt romney r ut i aposve laid out time and again places where i disagree with the president they are places that relate to the if you will forming of national character that i think we can do a better job trump if he fought really hard against president obama like he does against me he would have won the election does that make sense to you end video clip wallace president trump responding to a brand new senator mitt romney who wrote a controversial article this week saying the president has not risen to the mantle of the office which understandably got a lot of attention and we aposre back now with the panel congressman chaffetz you were are a former congressman from utah what do you make of of mitt romney before he is even sworn in having an op ed in the washington post that that basically says this president is living not living up to his responsibilities as president certainly in the image department and what aposs the reaction been back home chaffetz well this is not the candidate romney didn apost didn apost talk like this that aposs not who he was he accepted his endorsement in october in a debate he was asked a question and he said he aposs putting the past behind him he looks to working forward i think it was an unforced error and he was elected to represent the state of utah to solve problems this didn apost solve a problem it created a problem i think it was an unforced error wallace why do you think he did it chaffetz i think he does believe it i think it aposs in his heart but and i don apost think that it aposs going to do anything to actually move the meter and accomplish things i don apost i don apost know why he would do it before he was sworn in i think a lot of people are scratching their head wallace all right we asked you for questions for the panel and we got a lot of head scratching and reactions on romney aposs criticism of president trump mike johnson sent this on facebook when is he switching to the democratic party because he obviously is no longer a republican and jean caragher tweeted this is he positioning himself to challenge president trump for the 2020 nomination marie how do you answer them harf well in response to the first question i think that aposs actually a problem the republican party has that they that there are some member of the party president trump aposs base that feels like there aposs not room in the public discourse for republicans to criticize president trump and if that aposs the direction the party aposs going they will at some point no longer be a true national party and they will be the party of the 30 percent donald trump base so i think what will be interesting is what this senate does as we get the mueller report as things get more difficult for the president i don apost think mitt romney aposs going to challenge donald trump in 2020 that aposs just my instinct i do think john kasich might i think jeff flake might and a lot will depend on the mueller report this is the 800 pound gorilla in the room and once we get that i think you aposll see some republicans make some decisions about that primary wallace then there was and we talked about this before with congressman cicilline congresswoman freshman congresswoman rashida tlaib of michigan and her attack this week on the president her obscene attack and president trump aposs response take a look begin video clip rep rashida tlaib d mich we aposre going to go in there and we aposre going to impeach the mother expletive deleted trump i think she dishonored herself and i think she dishonored her family end video clip wallace jonah this clearly in the very first week that the house democrats took over and had done a lot of very careful things in terms of messaging stepped on their message the fact that we aposre talking about it the fact that cable news has feasted on this and i think one what do you think of that and two the fact that this really indicate how much trouble nancy pelosi is going to have controlling some of the firebrands in her party goldberg no i think that aposs right i think there are two issues here one the expletive which she should have apologized for and just moved on i don apost think president trump has an enormous amount of credibility condemning that kind of language or debasing discourse in any way but then there aposs the actual the policy issue which is the impeachment issue and nancy pelosi aposs challenge is to do something that she didn apost do very well the last time she was speaker which is to try to move legislation that divides republicans that peels off republicans and the one thing that will keep republicans unified at least for now prior to the mueller report is all this impeachment stuff if it just becomes if the democratic party is the antimatter universe version of what you were talking but with the republican party which i think is a real concern of just the anti trump party than that will unify the republicans and so get staying quiet about impeachment is totally in nancy pelosi aposs and the democrat aposs long term interest until there aposs a reason to actually talk about impeachment wallace i mean in fairness we heard congressman cicilline today say exactly that and jerry nadler who is the chair of the house judiciary committee which is where this issue of impeachment if it aposs going to come up would come up said the same thing this week goldberg right wallace so goldberg but it aposs a problem but that aposs not with the rank and file want right in the same way that the rank and file of the republican party wants it to be an always trump all trump party the rank and file of the democratic party wants it to be an always anti trump party here wallace well let me ask mo about that one what do you make of tlaib aposs statement plus her refusal afterwards to apologize and how much of a fever is there in the house democratic caucus to move right now and impeach donald trump elleithee so on the comment i aposd i aposd i aposd be hard pressed to disagree with anything jonah said the i spent a lot of time talking and worrying about the trumpification of politics rite large and that people go to that he has now given everyone license to use this kind of language and i think that is wrong and i don apost think democrats can effectively argue against him by acting like him nor can he criticize democrats for acting like him so i wish he wouldn apost have used that language but i do think the bigger issue here is the talk of impeachment goldberg right elleithee and i do think it is premature i think most members of house democratic leadership agree with that most members of house democratic leadership understand that the politicization of impeachment the way tom steyer is doing it the way some members are doing it is a very dangerous path to go down there may come a time when this is a very relevant conversation and bob mueller will let everyone know when that time is but until then democrats have a policy agenda to push they aposve got a presidential policy agenda to stand up to and they have an election to win if they want to beat donald trump the best way to do that and have a mandate behind their own agenda is to beat him at the ballot box they aposve shown they can do that in 2018 and now they aposve got to do it in 2020 that should be where the energy of people like this remains focused wallace we aposve got about a minute left marie there was a very interesting moment on friday because president trump came out to the rose garden after his meeting with nancy pelosi and said she assured me there aposs no interest in impeaching me and she immediately pushed back and said or his staff did and said she never said that she just said this meeting is about reopening the government it isn apost about impeachment which to me indicated that she and her people are very sensitive about the fact of not appearing to tamp down or step on not that they aposre pushing it but they don apost want to they don apost want to stamp tamp down on democrats who want to impeach harf i think that aposs right but they always condition it always always in the leadership of the democratic caucus right now on the mueller report that we cannot do this for political reasons like it appeared with bill clinton or like tom steyer is doing so i think they will keep it on the table conditioned on mueller wallace all right thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power players of the week we aposre going to introduce you to two new members of congress and ask how they plan to reach across the aisle and end the shutdown commercial break wallace with the old guard in washington not getting much done we met this week with two new members of the 116 congress to get their fresh ideas we sat down with democrat elissa slotkin of michigan who served three tours in iraq with the cia and with republican mark green of tennessee who was on the special ops team that captured saddam hussein and they are our power players of the week begin videotape welcome to fox news sunday rep mark green r tenn we aposre delighted to be here thanks chris rep elissa slotkin d mich thanks for having us wallace you both talk about trying to get things done trying to compromise to break the gridlock in washington be specific let me start with you congresswoman slotkin how slotkin sure well the perfect example is the government shutdown right now we have the basis of a deal right both sides are saying they care about border security they believe in national security start having a real negotiation about border security border forces more technology at the border fencing if we needed it in some areas it doesn apost just have to be a wall that aposs the essence of a negotiation so i think we can start now if people really care about getting something done wallace you aposre talking about the issues i guess i aposm talking more about attitude because it aposs you know there are problems there and people have known about possible deals possible solutions for a long time but it never gets done why not green i think what we as a class the freshman class brings particularly the congresswoman and i is you know a life of service to the country you know she aposs prior military i aposm prior military and we want solutions and we aposre just sick and tired of it not happening and our constituents sent us here to get it done so we aposre we aposre rolling up our sleeves and going to going to get it done wallace well i want to pick up on that because congressman green was a special operations flight surgeon in iraq part of the capture of saddam hussein you served for years in the cia then for presidents bush 43 and obama a republican and democrat what aposs the one thing that you think you can take from your service in national security and maybe help you here in washington slotkin i mean for me it aposs mission right you have a mission and when you aposre serving in the cia or military you wake up every day you know what you aposre doing and why you aposre doing it and i think it aposs no different in congress some people have treated it as if they don apost have a mission that they aposre there for themselves they aposre show horses whatever i think making sure that people remember that they were elected to get something done and passed legislation is the most important thing wallace there are a lot of very well intentioned people in that building behind me and somehow it doesn apost get done let aposs take the shutdown the wall that the president says has to be a wall or you know some version of a wall you hear nancy pelosi say a wall is immoral how do you compromise from that kind of rhetoric green i think we find you know some common ground with what is border security and we get it done i mean that aposs really what we have to do and you know the president has looked at this and has said this is what we need to do and you know i aposm supporting him in this in this effort slotkin i just think it literally life is about negotiations there is no one who lives their lives just saying i aposm going to unilaterally decide what happen so negotiate get in the room kick out the cameras and get something done wallace where are you both on donald trump question for you congresswoman slotkin are the democrats particularly in the house too anti trump slotkin i think the tenor and tone that the president has set is just unbecoming of the country that i love and for me that aposs critically important i don apost like policy by twitter but to me just because you aposre providing a check and balance on the president doesn apost mean you don apost have a responsibility to legislate and get something affirmative done if we aposre only anti trump we are not doing our job wallace on the other hand congressman you said during the campaign you can apost imagine an issue where you would differ with donald trump green so far every action he aposs taken has been spectacular from cutting taxes that created massive growth at least in our state in tennessee to one of the biggest pay raises for our veterans our soldiers in in ten plus years you know i i think the actions that he aposs taken are spectacular and i can apost see an area where i would disagree with him at this point wallace what about the tone green i think maybe in some cases there are better ways to say things but again i 100 percent support the actions that have been taken wallace over the next two years and i aposll start with you congresswoman how confident are you that you aposre going to be able to change washington instead of washington changing you slotkin i think the nice thing is we have over 100 new members in a body of 435 people any organization with that many new people the culture changes so i aposm not saying it aposs going to be easy and i aposve seen it already you know that sucking sound of people trying to get you to be very political you know salute the party instead of the country you aposve got to be strong enough to push back and that happens when you have people that you can link arms with and say no we aposre not going to do it that way and i think we have that green i came from a dirt road in a small rural town my friends are not going to let me go off the rails many years in the military you know the night stalkers that i went to combat with are going to be on the phone with me saying mark what what are you thinking if i if i do make the wrong decision or go the wrong way tip o aposneill and ronald reagan would fight like cats and dogs in the daytime and in the evening they aposd go out as irishmen and have a scotch and we aposve got to get back to doing that and that aposs how we become friends maybe not agreeing but but those relationships i think are what aposs really missing right now and something that i want to be a part of fixing wallace congresswoman slotkin do you like scotch slotkin you know i aposm going to suggest michigan beer you might want to try it but green tennessee whiskey wallace all right we aposll leave it there you see can apost even agree on that slotkin n
