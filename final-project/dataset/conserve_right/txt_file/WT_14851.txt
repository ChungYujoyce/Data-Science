and khaki pants and using crutches his right leg in a cast mr chen was greeted with cheers when he arrived at the apartment in manhattan s greenwich village where he will live with his family the complex houses faculty and graduate students of newyork university where mr chen is expected to attend law school for the past seven years i have never had a day s rest mr chen said through a translator so i have come here for a bit of recuperation for body and in spirit mr chen thanked the u s and chinese governments along with the embassies of switzerland canada and france after much turbulence i have come out of shandong he said referring to the chinese province where he was under house arrest the u s has granted him partial citizenship rights he said mr chen gave a short statement which was greeted by cheers in mandarin and english he didn t take questions from reporters the departure of mr chen his wife and two children to the united states marked the conclusion of nearly a month of uncertainty and years of mistreatment by local authorities for the self taught activist after seven years of prison and house arrest mr chen made a daring escape from his rural village in april and was given sanctuary inside the u s embassy triggering a diplomatic standoff over his fate with secretary of state hillary rodham clinton in beijing for annual high level discussions officials struck a deal that let mr chen walk free only to see him have second thoughts that move forced new negotiations that led to an agreement to send him to the u s to study law a goal of his at newyork university thousands of thoughts are surging to my mind mr chen said before he left china his concerns he said included whether authorities would retaliate for his negotiated departure by punishing his relatives left behind it also was unclear whether the government will allow him to return in newyork he said china had promised him protection of his rights as a citizen there i am very gratified to see that the chinese government has been dealing with the situation with restraint and calm and i hope to see that they continue to open discourse and earn the respect and trust of the people mr chen s expected attendance at newyork university comes from his association with jerome cohen a law professor there who advised mr chen while he was in the u s embassy the two met when mr chen came to the united states on a state department program in 2003 and mr cohen has been staunch advocate for him since before leaving china mr chen asked his supporters and others in the activist community for their understanding of his desire to leave the front lines of the rights struggle in china i am requesting a leave of absence and i hope that they will understand he said state department spokeswoman victoria nuland praised the quiet negotiations that freed him we also express our appreciation for the manner in which we were able to resolve this matter and to support mr chen s desire to study in the u s and pursue his goals ms nuland said in a statement the white house also said it was pleased with the outcome of negotiations china s foreign ministry said it had no comment the government s news agency xinhua issued a brief report saying that mr chen has applied for study in the united states via normal channels in line with the law mr chen s supporters welcomed his departure this is great progress u s based rights activist bob fu said it s a victory for freedom fighters the 40 year old mr chen is emblematic of a new breed of activists that the communist party finds threatening often from rural and working class families these rights defenders as they are called are unlike the students and intellectuals from the elite academies and major cities of previous democracy movements and thus could potentially appeal to ordinary chinese mr chen gained recognition for crusading for the disabled and for farmers rights and fighting against forced abortions in his rural community that activism angered local officials who seemed to wage a personal vendetta against him convicting him in 2006 on what his supporters say were fabricated charges and then holding him for the past 20 months in illegal house arrest even with the backstage negotiations mr chen s departure came hastily he spent the previous 2 weeks in a hospital for the foot he broke escaping house arrest only on wednesday did chinese authorities help him complete the paperwork for his passport mr chen said by telephone saturday that he was informed at the hospital just before noon to pack his bags to leave officials did not give him and his family passports or inform them of their flight details until after they got to the airport seeming ambivalent mr chen said that he was not happy about leaving and that he had a lot on his mind including worries about retaliation against his extended family back home his nephew chen kegui is accused of attempted murder after he allegedly used a kitchen knife to attack officials who stormed his house after discovering chen guangcheng was missing i hope that the government will fulfill the promises it made to me all of its promises mr chen said such promises included launching an investigation into abuses against him and his family in shandong province he said before the phone call was cut off much as mr chen has said he wants return to china it remains uncertain whether the chinese government would bar him as they have done with many exiled activists chen s departure for the u s does not and should not in any way mark a mission accomplished moment for the u s government said phelim kine a senior asia researcher at human rights watch the harder longer term part is ensuring his right under international law to return to china when he sees fit associated press writers didi tang gillian wong and charles hutzler in beijing andrew duffelmeyer in newark n j and matthew lee in washington and
