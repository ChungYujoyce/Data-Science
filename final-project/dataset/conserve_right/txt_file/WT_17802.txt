apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic defense secretary leon e panetta s unusual offer to china s military to join a major u s led naval exercise in the pacific prompted several u s security officials to express fears privately that china will gain valuable war fighting intelligence from the rimpac or rim of the pacific exercise china s military will learn details on how the united states conducts coalition warfare a strategic war fighting capability it also will learn valuable data on u s communications used in naval warfare maneuvers said defense officials familiar with the war games

2014 exercise rim of the pacific is the world s largest international maritime exercise mr panetta said the most recent exercises were held from june into august and included forces from 22 nations about 25 000 troops 40 ships six submarines and more than 200 aircraft participated if china takes part chinese military intelligence would be given access to sensitive information on the planning for the exercise and the communications and procedures used in maneuvering large groups of forces from different nations china could use the information in a future conflict considering its growing cyberwarfare capabilities a defense official said the offer for china to join the exercise grew out of the visit to china in june by adm samuel j locklear head of the u s pacific command adm locklear was asked about rimpac and told chinese military leaders that participation in the exercise was prohibited by a 2000 law restricting chinese military exchanges a provision of the 2000 national defense authorization act prohibits any contacts with the people s liberation of army that pose a national security risk including joint war fighting capabilities a key element of the international war games to circumvent the restriction the pentagon over the past few months had lawyers review the prohibition they told mr panetta he could authorize the chinese military participation by asserting it would not undermine u s security however pentagon officials are concerned that congress especially house republicans will step in and oppose or block the chinese warship involvement the 2000 law prohibits all inappropriate exposure for chinese military visitors to 12 categories of information including force projection and nuclear operations advanced joint warfare know how surveillance and reconnaissance operations and military space operations rep dana rohrabacher chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on government operations said in an interview that inviting china to rimpac is a bad idea and would be like inviting iranian gunboats to join maneuvers in the persian gulf to prevent collisions is this what pivot to the pacific means the california republican asked of the u s effort to bolster forces in the pacific against china s high tech weaponry i thought the pivot was meant to make us stronger not weaker mr rohrabacher also said such cooperation is not just impractical but illegal the defense authorization act of 2000 prohibits this kind of military contact with china he said this is not only unwise but illegal it would be putting our military in a cooperative situation with a potential enemy during a chinese military visit to sensitive u s military bases in may house foreign affairs committee chairman rep ileana ros lehtinen called for a review of the military restrictions congress must immediately review existing prohibitions against giving chinese officials access to sensitive information and determine if they need to be strengthened the
