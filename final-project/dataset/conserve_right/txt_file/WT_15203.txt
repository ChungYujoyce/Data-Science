critical swing state with stops in columbus and cincinnati his administration asked the world trade organization wto to review up to 1 billion worth of subsidies china gave to its own auto and auto parts industries between 2009 and 2011 and to accelerate a wto investigation of chinese levies on u s made cars a separate case the white house first pursued earlier this year these are subsidies that directly harm working men and women on the assembly line in ohio and michigan and across the midwest mr obama said it is not right it is against the rules and we will not let it stand top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots in launching the new trade enforcement case against china mr obama is focusing on an economic issue that resonates with ohio voters and has become a flash point in the campaign with gop presidential nominee mitt romney repeatedly pledging to get tough with china on trade issues if elected quickly responding the government of china announced a new trade complaint against the united states protesting anti dumping measures against its exports including kitchen appliances magnets and paper unlike mr romney mr obama says he has plenty of experience standing up to china filing more wto complaints in one term than former president george w bush did in two terms if mr romney really cares about holding china accountable mr obama said monday he wouldn t continue to hold investments in companies that keep costs low by relying on chinese factory workers and wouldn t support a tax plan democrats say could encourage companies to outsource jobs overseas now i understand my opponent has been running around ohio claiming he s going to roll up his sleeves and take the fight to china mr obama said during his stop in columbus but here s the thing his experience has been owning companies that were called pioneers in the business of outsourcing jobs to countries like china ohio you can t stand up to china when all you ve done is send them our jobs in ohio the auto parts industry directly employs 54 200 people and the sector indirectly impacts 850 000 total jobs or 12 4 percent of the economy the white house said the administration s wto action directly addresses criticism from republicans and mr romney who regularly attacks mr obama for failing to aggressively challenge china to abide by international trade laws on friday while campaigning in painesville ohio mr romney said he would demand that china stop manipulating its currency or face tariffs obama campaign and administration officials insist the action is not motivated by politics pointing to a number of successful complaints the u s trade representative has filed with the wto during mr obama s tenure obama campaign spokeswoman jen psaki told reporters on air force one that mr romney had a special kind of chutzpah that he is going to criticize the president on an issue that he has been such a strong advocate and fighter for the romney campaign called the administration s trade complaints a blatantly political move the romney camp said the move highlights mr obama s unwillingness to crack down on cheating china in ohio and across the country and only happened because mr romney had focused attention on the issue president obama may think that announcing new trade cases less than two months from election day will distract from his record but the american businesses and workers struggling on an uneven playing field know better mr romney said at the u s hispanic chamber of commerce meeting in los angeles if i d known all it took to get him to take action was to run an ad citing his inaction on china s cheating i would have run one long ago while obama aides were peppered with questions from reporters about the timing of the wto action and the political trip to ohio where an average of recent polls on realclearpolitics com gives the president a 4 percent advantage the alliance for american manufacturing applauded the trade complaint against china president obama is delivering a major boost to our nation s automotive sector workers and businesses today by holding china accountable for its cheating aam executive director scott paul said for the past eight months we have built a compelling case on the merits of moving forward with a trade enforcement action on chinese auto parts and automobiles we commend the obama administration for launching the case today the china trade issue also plays to voters in other rust belt states such as pennsylvania sen robert p casey jr pennsylvania democrat also gave mr obama credit for the wto action saying he pushed the administration to take on china s trade practices in the automotive sector earlier this year and there still much more the president can do when china cheats middle class pennsylvanians lose jobs mr casey said today s action is a step in the right direction to level the playing field while the announcement is welcome news there is much more the administration can do to confront china s rampant cheating and i will continue to urge them to take additional action despite mr obama s 4 point edge in ohio the crowds gathered to hear him in cincinnati and columbus on monday were smaller and more subdued than in some other recent venues in battleground areas possibly a reflection of mr obama s frequent stops in the state it was his 28th visit of his presidency and the 12th this year still many of those attending the lunchtime speech in cincinnati s eden park were die hard loyalists sporting shirts with slogans such as change has come and obama i ve got your
