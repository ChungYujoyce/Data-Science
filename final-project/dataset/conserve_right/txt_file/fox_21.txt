ican member of the senate armed services committee talks trump administration policy on russia north korea and syria on fox news sunday this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday april 1 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace russia tests a new generation of nuclear missiles it says can strike anywhere on earth as the white house and kremlin expelled dozens of each other aposs diplomats begin videotape heather nauert spokesperson state department russia should not be acting like a victim wallace we aposll discuss the sharp escalation and tensions between the u s and russia with a leading member of the senate armed services committee senator lindsey graham then the commerce department announces the 2020 census will include question on citizenship a decision that will directly affect states with large numbers of illegal immigrants we aposll talk with two top officials from california which has sued the trump administration over the policy democratic congressman brad sherman and republican shawn nelson of the orange county board of supervisors plus north korea aposs leader takes a surprise trip to china as the world looks toward the summit between kim jong un and president trump donald trump president of the united states and if it aposs no good we are walking out and if it aposs good we will embrace it wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what are the chances kim will give up his nuclear weapons all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace hello again happy easter and happy passover from fox news in washington it aposs been a turbulent week for president trump aposs foreign policy russia tested a powerful new missile and responded to the u s expelling 60 of their diplomats by kicking out 60 of ours kim jong un made a surprise trip to china while appearing to set new conditions for talks with mr trump and the president announced he wants to pull all american forces out of syria and is freezing recovery aid for that country we want to discuss all this with senator lindsey graham a key member of the senate armed services committee senator welcome back to fox news sunday and happy easter sen lindsey graham r s c senate armed services committee happy easter a lot to talk about wallace well let aposs start with the situation in russia the launch of a powerful new missile those mass expulsions here aposs how russia aposs ambassador to the u s described the situation begin video clip anatoly antonov russian ambassador to the u s it seems the atmosphere in washington is poison is poisoned it aposs a toxic atmosphere end video clip wallace how serious is the split now between moscow and washington graham i think it aposs pretty ironic that he used the word poison one of the reasons we are expelling diplomats is because the russian intelligence services most likely poisoned a british citizen and his daughter a former russian agent in the united kingdom so this is the 80s to me all over i can tell you what ronald reagan did every time the russians tried to advance their military technology we one up to them every time the russians started running wild throughout the world reagan pushed back so if i were trump i aposd look at the reagan playbook and economically isolate russia i would study every major recipient of russia oil and gas and see if we could find ways to supply those countries with oil and gas somewhere from a source outside of russia wallace i want to pick up on the president aposs action because while the trump administration has taken some actions imposed some sanctions the week before last president trump himself has been reluctant to call out vladimir putin in fact here aposs how we talked about his call to congratulate putin after he won his reelection victory take a look begin video clip trump we had a very good call and i suspect that we will probably be meeting in the not too distant future to discuss the arms race end video clip wallace senator do we need a trump putin summit meeting or do we need president trump first to take some stronger actions against russia graham let aposs go back to the reagan playbook he stood up in front of the berlin wall and said tear this wall down on the other side is an evil empire he wound up meeting with gorbachev to try to reduce the number of nuclear weapons i think the problem is that russia is running wild whatever we aposre doing is not working and the president for some reason has a hard time pushing back against putin directly so again economic isolation of russia they aposre an oil and gas economy they couldn apost survive very long without customers so if i were president trump germany and europe i would france i would try to cut off all of their customers and provide alternatives to their customers for oil and gas outside of russia that aposs what i do wallace speaking of summits north korea leader kim jong un made a surprise visit to beijing this week to meet with chinese president xi as kim prepares for a summit meeting with president trump next month and according to the chinese kim is now calling for phased synchronized moves to denuclearize his country question does that concern you that according to what the chinese said after the meeting between kim and xi that the north korean leader kim now wants concessions from both sides and longer negotiations graham yes it could but let me just highlight one thing the reason that north korea is at the table is that this maximum pressure campaign against north korea launched by the trump administration where the world is beginning to follow has paid off they aposre coming to the table because it has hurt so much and the president has called out kim jong un by name for being the tyrant he is now we aposve got an opportunity historic in nature to sit down and maybe not only get him to give up his nuclear weapons but to end the korean war which is still going on but yes i aposd be very cautious about the terms and conditions of this meeting and this is why i like john bolton as national security adviser he aposs a very he has a very healthy skepticism but i do hope president trump will meet with north korea wallace well i just want to pick up on that you say you want to be careful about the terms of the meeting if what kim says he has in mind is longer negotiations concessions on both sides it sounds kind of like the negotiations graham yes wallace that prior presidents have had with the north korean regime with kim aposs father do we still want to have the summit graham we don apost want to give him nine months or year to talk and build a missile at the same time so i had dinner with bolton a couple of nights ago his big fear is that they aposre just buying time they aposre about nine months to a year away of having a missile with a nuclear weapon on top that can hit america he sees these negotiations as we aposre ph buying time that aposs what they aposve done in the past so i aposd cut them off at the pass there i would make sure the negotiations were very focused and get quick action here aposs the goal in negotiations to make sure that north korea gives up their nuclear program japan and south korea they don apost have notes there aposs no reason for north korea to have a nuclear program they aposll sell anything they aposll build as to their history and maybe get a peace treaty with north korea south korea the united states and china but not let this drag on a very long time wallace meanwhile president trump started talking this week about pulling all of our 2 000 troops graham yes wallace out of syria who are there supporting the effort against isis and we learned yesterday he has frozen 200 million in funds for recovery efforts there here is the president on syria this week begin video clip trump we aposll be coming out of syria like very soon let the other people take care of it now end video clip wallace is president trump making a mistake talking about getting out of syria while isis is still alive obviously diminished but still in the field and while iran is still pushing and some could say helping the assad regime won the civil war graham well mr president when it comes to russia read the ronald reagan playbook when it comes to syria do not read the obama playbook this is the obama playbook one foot in one foot out this is a disaster in the making all of his military advisors have said we need to leave troops in syria to work with the kurds calm down the conflict between turkey and the kurdish fighters who have helped make sure that raqqa does not fall back into the hands of isil there are over 3 000 isis fighters still roaming around syria we aposve got troops there to protect us and to protect the region if we withdrew our troops anytime soon isis would come back the war between turkey and the kurds would get out of hand and you aposd be giving damascus to the iranians without an american presence and russia and iran would dominate syria it aposd be the single worst decision the president could make i aposve seen this movie before when obama did the same thing in iraq and quite frankly gave assad a pass in syria when he had them on the ropes we got isil on the ropes if you want to let them off the ropes remove american soldiers wallace you have talked we also want to talk about some domestic issues you have called for a second special counsel to investigate graham right wallace the fbi and the justice department and how they conducted both the clinton investigation and the trump investigation but the inspector general who is independent says he is looking into that and this week the attorney general jeff sessions named john huber the u s attorney from utah to conduct his own investigation into those matters does that move satisfy you or do you still want a second special counsel graham well some people say it aposs a good start some people say it aposs an insufficient process i don apost know yet the jury is still out regarding mr huber but i do know this if you tried this when it came to the trump campaign not appoint a special counsel but take some u s attorney outside of washington and let them look at the trump russia connection the left would have went crazy saying this deserves a special counsel my belief is that there should be a special counsel and here aposs the question i want a special counsel with the same determination and resources to look at the abuses of the fisa process was the clinton email investigation a sham were there conflicts of interest in the justice department i want to special counsel to be appointed with the same resources and the same determination to look at those issues as is mueller is looking at the trump campaign and i don apost see that yet wallace finally you said we had a lot to cover this week the president fired the secretary of veterans affairs and he named the white house doctor admiral ronny jackson to take that job jackson who famously gave president trump a clean bill of health take a look begin video clip admiral ronny jackson white house physician to answer your question he has incredibly good genes it aposs just the way god made him end video clip wallace you call this a home run for veterans and there aposs no question that admiral jackson is a brilliant well he aposs a great combat surgeon the question that everybody is raising is whether or not he is equipped has the experience to run an agency with 360 000 employees and an annual budget of 186 billion why doesn apost that concern you and how much trouble do you think admiral jackson is going to have being confirmed graham one i think he aposll get confirmed because he aposs made life and death decisions on the battlefield he aposs committed medical personnel on the battlefield he aposs been in the middle of this war i was with him a week ago i guess two weeks ago now at an event in charleston and he had no idea this was coming i had no idea it was coming but we started talking about the veterans administration and he said to me something that was very satisfying somebody needs to take that place and turn it upside down somebody needs to make sure that no veteran has to wait too long or drive too far to get basic health care i want competition for the veterans apos health care i want the v a to stay in existence but if a veteran waits too long or lives too far away from a facility i want the private sector to fill in that gap and admiral jackson has that same mentality and he need somebody to go into the v a he aposs willing to fight the bureaucracy and i think admiral jackson is a good pick because he aposs been on the battlefield he knows what the fight is all about wallace senator graham thank you thanks for your time this holiday weekend it was a busy set of questions and we got it all in always good to talk with you sir graham thank you happy easter wallace happy easter to you up next the president announces he wants to pull american troops out of syria we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss whether he aposs moving too fast plus what would you like to ask the panel about the state of u s russian relations now just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip antonov if anybody slap your check your face what will be reaction from your side you will retaliate it goes without saying nauert russia should not be acting like a victim the only victims in the situation are the two victims in a hospital in the u k right now end video clip wallace russian ambassador anatoly antonov and state department spokeswoman heather nauert continuing the two countries war of words this week and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz fox news analyst marie harf catherine lucey who covers the white house for the associated press and fox news correspondent gillian turner well gillian let me start with you where are we headed in relations with the kremlin after this week and you heard from senator graham what should president trump do next gillian turner fox news correspondent well all right chris to lay it out right now this investigation phase into the nerve agent attack is in full swing reporting this week is that the united states is sort of hand in glove with the brits on this investigation every step of the way and some horrifying horrifying developments coming out of that just in the last 24 hours the brits confirmed that they believe president putin at some point directly authorized this attack himself they believe it aposs not a stand alone event and it aposs part of a broader plan of a large scale assassination plan for russian defectors around the world they aposve gone so far as to warn partner nations they should amp up security for russian defectors living inside their borders it aposs a horrifying set of circumstances wallace why would they do that i mean what aposs to be gained i mean i understand you don apost like these people but why is killing the person who is living as a private citizen in salisbury england worth the blowback you get internationally turner i think because according to the putin and the kgb playbook these are some of the worst people on earth people who defected from the former soviet union now from russia are people that don apost really deserve to live they are enemies of the state in the truest form and not to play pop psychology but i think that aposs what motivates this wallace we ask you for questions for the panel and on this issue of relations with russia and the mass expulsion of diplomats lambert boeman tweeted this the only question does this not put to bed any and all allegations of true collusion they put him in office to kremlin allegedly helping mr trump to expel people catherine how do you answer lambert and the argument that the trump administration is taking action the shows he aposs not playing ball with putin catherine lucey associated press the actions this week the administration took a strong stance these are very aggressive actions but there is a disconnect a little bit between the administration aposs actions and the president aposs public rhetoric we haven apost heard him directly challenging putin so critics are still pointing to that as a cause for concern but in terms of collusion specifically that aposs just not going to be put to rest until this investigation concludes we still don apost know where that aposs going and the people are still waiting to see what mueller finds wallace i want to turn to a different subject and that is mr trump surprise announcement this week that he is eager to pull all use u s troops about 2 000 there backing up syrian rebels wants to pull them out of syria and also that he has decided to freeze 200 million in u s recovery aid for people in the country here was mr trump this week begin video clip trump we are going to be coming out of there real soon we aposre going to get back to our country where we belong where we want to be end video clip wallace congressman i want to pick up on what senator graham said he said that the president is if he follows through on this is making exactly the same mistake that barack obama made in iraq which is to pull u s forces out before the battle is won is graham right jason chaffetz r former utah congressman senator graham is right why do you telegraph in advance what you are going to do to your enemies and to the local people that you aposre working and engaging with to signal to them that hey a couple weeks from now we may not be here that aposs that aposs not a good message i do think it aposs right to look at the aid portion of this and how are you going to distribute that but i also don apost think we aposre that close inches away from getting rid of the caliphate and reclaiming all of the land i just don apost see that wallace so i mean there didn apost seem be any pressure there was no huge call to pull u s troops out how do you explain the president suddenly announcing this he was in ohio for an infrastructure speech and suddenly he says this chaffetz there aposs no way that i aposm going to be able to answer that in its totality but look i think his heart is in the right place i do believe you want to get in get your job done and get our troops home and i think that aposs a good message to their military go in with overwhelming force do what you need to do and come back home but i don apost think you telegraph that in advance and you know the timeline is iffy but i think senator graham is right in this case wallace i mean it aposs interesting because you say don apost telegraph in advance that was one of the major points chaffetz yes wallace that president trump made during the campaign chaffetz i think i said that every week i was critical of the president saying president obama don apost do it like this wallace right so is president trump he was saying don apost be unpredictable chaffetz yes wallace don apost tell people in advance what aposs going to happen marie your thought about the president aposs apparent eagerness to get out of syria marie harf former state department spokesperson i think it would be a huge strategic mistake and not just because of the telegraphing issue although i do agree with congressman chaffetz who will fill that void if the united states is not there russia and iran and we aposve already seen russia and iran both move in increasingly into syria they have you know airbases they have troops there both of them do if the united states pulled back and leaves the reconstruction to someone else we are handing that country over to the two countries we don apost want to have more power in the middle east so we are hearing from commanders on the ground we are hearing from diplomats that president trump needs to take a step back and stay in this for the long haul whatever that means whether it aposs months or years this would be a mistake and i think republicans like senator graham will keep standing up and may be pushing the president in a different direction wallace now i have to ask you did you feel the same way about barack obama when he pulled our troops out of iraq in 2012 harf well i think it was a completely different strategic situation at the time and there are wallace why harf the conditions on the ground quite frankly were different and barack obama pulled troops out of iraq on a timeline set by the bush administration wallace well that aposs not quite true harf well it is absolutely they negotiated the forces agreement under which those troops got pulled out and on that timeline wallace you want to take this one on or shall i harf well wait there aposs a question and congressman chaffetz brought it up there aposs a tension between going to the american people rightly so and saying our men and women are not going to fight indefinitely overseas policing other countries apos civil wars there is tension between that and advocating american leadership the balance is not always an easy one to find but going to the infrastructure event in ohio and saying we aposre going to get out of syria really soon sends a bad signal to the commanders and to our enemies wallace i aposm going to make an audible here we could relitigate that and the fact is that although there was a status of forces agreement there aposs always the presumption that u s and iraq were going to negotiate for troops to stay harf maybe ph wallace and that president obama didn apost push very hard i want to move on to north korea because there was an interesting catherine after kim surprised us with the chinese the chinese said that kim is now saying we aposre not talking about a quick dismantlement like libya did like gadhafi did to get rid of all of our nukes we want phase synchronized talks concessions by both sides longer negotiations what aposs the reaction in the white house to that lucey you know i think we aposre still waiting to hear how the president processes this we haven apost heard from him in the last day or two but he said earlier this week that he was still looking forward to talks i mean he talked about he made references to this in ohio this week so we haven apost heard an indication that he aposs not going to do this and some of this i think is a part of sort of there aposs some public posturing that aposs going to keep going on i think up until this meeting potentially happens wallace does that concern you when you hear him talk because it sounds a bit like what the north koreans have done in the past well we aposll give you this you give us that we will play along for a while and then we aposll go back on our word chaffetz this is all moving in the right direction i think this is one of the strongest points for president trump and what he aposs done he aposs put the pressure on both economically and militarily it aposs pushing in the right direction you see that china is obviously going to play a key key role in ultimately what happens there and us with the japanese and the south koreans have got to hold the line and i do think it aposs important that the president meets with the leader of north korea i think that will be productive i don apost think you should let off the gas at all and certainly the appointment of john bolton is not going to send any signals that we aposre going to be softer wallace quick final thought gillian turner i think the president changed tack this week he shifted to what i would call a maximum pressure campaign against south korea which was really interesting and threatening to tie a bilateral trade deal with them to the denuclearization issue he aposs now saying to south korea or demanding that they deliver some results before he even sits down at the table for this negotiation with kim jong un and that was remarkable because i think it shows it shows up how little leverage we actually have against this crazy despotic rogue regime north korea the president is sort of triangulating as much as i hate that word looking at the levers and saying well i aposm not really going to get what i want from this so i might as well push this lever and see what i can extract from south korea wallace and since they aposre meeting first the south koreans and north koreans at the end of this month he aposs saying before we sign this trade deal which you guys want let aposs see how much you push the north koreans and we certainly don apost want you breaking away from us turner yes you said it better than i did laughter wallace well all right thank you panel you aposll get more time in the next panel for buttering me up we aposre going to take a break here we aposll see you a little later when we come back the decision to include a question on citizenship in the 2020 census raises an uproar we aposll talk with two california officials about that and the escalating battle over its status as a sanctuary state all of that next commercial break wallace coming up the commerce department adds a citizenship question to the 2020 census and some states are fighting back begin video clip xavier becerra d california attorney general adding a question on citizen strip threatens to derail the integrity of the entire process end video clip wallace we aposll ask two california officials what it means for their state next commercial break wallace a look around the world as christians celebrate easter the trump administration announced this week the 2020 census will ask respondents whether they are u s citizens for the first time in 70 years and that has started a fierce debate in california which has voted to become a sanctuary state joining me now from california democratic congressman brad sherman and the vice chair of the orange county board of supervisors shawn nelson california aposs attorney general announced this week that he is suing the federal government for deciding to add that question to the census here was his reasoning begin video clip becerra an undercount resulting from this decision would jeopardize vital services for all californians it would also jeopardize our representation in government end video clip wallace mr nelson is congressman becerra wrong or in fact would you like to see california lose some seats in congress and some federal money that is based on the large number of people in your state illegally shawn nelson vice chair orange county board of supervisors well attorney general becerra i just think is incorrect because the federal government has a right to conduct the census and there aposs nothing that says they can apost ask any particular question i don apost want california to miss out on anything but i think that hysteria than answering questions is somehow going to force people away from a censes i i just don apost buy it the the government is precluded from sharing that information for 72 years after a person answers the census and i think his time ought to be spent allaying the fears of people he things are going to be freaked out by having to answer questions wallace let let me ask you though about the practical effect of it because it aposs kind of an open question as we looked into it even the supreme court has not definitively ruled do you think that people who are in this country illegally should be counted when it aposs decided how you aposre going to apportion congressional seats and how you aposre going to divvy up federal money nelson well that aposs a great question i mean if if in the end we essentially import a few million citizens of other countries to game the system to get extra congressional seats i suppose that presents a big question for power in washington d c i mean we always just assumed the count is for the citizens of a country but california where i aposve lived my whole life obviously has a little different issue and that poses a big problem wallace congressman sherman let me ask you the same question why should california or any state with a sizable number of illegal immigrants in its population benefit from that to get more federal money or to get more seats in congress brad sherman d california congressman we aposre often shortchanged when it comes to federal money and congress can allocate the federal money however it chooses the enumeration for the census is the allocation of house seats and seats in the electoral college and the constitution is clear you count all persons except indians untaxed those are the words of the constitution now if people want the change the constitution they there aposs a process for doing that but instead they seem to want to thwart the constitution to achieve their results without an amendment by deliberately undercounting all immigrants legal and illegal and they aposve got a three step program for doing that create massive fear starting by calling immigrants rapists and murders deportations the fear in latino and asian communities is palpable then you add this question which the census itself under the trump administration says will lead to an undercount and then you add insult to injury by saying that the reason you aposre doing it is to enforce the voting rights act that it aposs part of the trump program for latino empowerment that aposs why they aposre doing it wallace let me let me sherman that aposs absolutely absurd if you believe that then wallace let me let me bring mr nelson in if i can congressman because we do have limited amount of time this will be the first time that this question has been asked as a general question it aposs been asked i know ph to a small group of people but as a general question in the census since 1950 what about the argument that this is an effort by the trump administration to depress the count by frightening illegal immigrants nelson listen i think that any questionnaire has the potential to be avoided the point is to reach out to communities and encourage them to participate there aposs no repercussions this information cannot be shared and there aposs no reason people shouldn apost participate unless folks go out and scare them and i would say that what aposs happening on this very show the congressman sherman might have more to do with scaring them than anything that that i aposm seeing from from my end of the of the spectrum i mean tell people they are protected and encourage them to participate my county has more poor people than most counties have people many of them are immigrants we need federal money wallace let me let me let let i just want to ask you congressman sherman mr nelson is exactly right that the law expressly prohibits using sharing any information from the census with any government with any court so why should anybody be afraid and perhaps aren apost you by talking as you are aren apost you creating that fear sherman i aposm certainly trying not to create any fear but the fact is immigrants come from countries with oppressive governments in many cases and to convince them that a man who stands there and says these are rapists and murders and must be pushed out of our country should get information about who aposs in your family and what their immigration status is and that a congress that includes people that say they aposre rapists and murders isn apost going to change the statute and use that as a deportation list to convince someone who aposs lived through the terrible situations in guatemala and honduras that they should go ahead and answer the census is going to be difficult and to say that you aposre doing it to wallace all right sherman enforce the voting rights act is absolutely absurd wallace i want to switch to the other side of this because while california is suing the federal government about including this question on the census the federal government is suing california about its decision to enact laws that in effect make it a sanctuary state and in fact the orange county supervisors voted this week to join the federal lawsuit against their own state of california here was president trump this week begin video clip donald trump president of the united states sanctuary cities where they protect criminals they protect murderers they protect people that you don apost want on the streets other places in california said we don apost want that first time they aposre speaking up end video clip wallace mr nelson you were one of the orange county board of supervisors members who voted to join a federal lawsuit against her own state why nelson well it was my idea because we are put in an untenable position where our sheriff aposs deputies are precluded from talking to federal authorities if they know the authorities want to pick someone up because the person is here illegally is charged with a crime and our our people can apost even talk to the federal government unless there are some exceptions that are that are met like they aposre a prior convicted felon but we have people getting out every day that we don apost want released without the federal government at least having an opportunity to put hands on and make their own decision whether these people ought to be released into the streets we aposve had 244 people as of last week released that we could not stop and our people could not tell ice officials that we believe ice would have wanted to speak with and likely wanted to do something about wallace congressman sherman you have said that washington is violating the constitution by putting this citizenship question in but isn apost california violating the constitution by interfering with the federal government which has supremacy when it comes to matters of immigration sherman chris we need comprehensive immigration reform until we get it we aposll be pulling our society apart over this issue wallace sir you aposre not answering my question isn apost sherman now i aposll get i aposll get wallace ok sherman california is absolutely within its rights and california has sued the trump administration 29 times and we haven apost lost once inaudible the trump administration wallace you aposre not answering my question which is isn apost immigration sherman i will wallace well let aposs get to it sir sherman absolutely wallace we aposre almost done sir sherman yes yes the states and the federal government share sovereignty in our federal system that aposs why obamacare couldn apost force the states to expand medicaid even though that aposs the federal program that even though wallace now that aposs the question of supremacy and in fact when arizona went further than president obama did the supreme court said that they had overstepped their bounds under the supremacy clause the federal government what they say on immigration goes and aren apost you violating that sherman federal government establishes immigration policy but whether america whether california employees are going to spend california money and resources to help enforce that policy is a california decision we will win that in court and if the federal government can apost compel states to participate in medicaid it can apost compel states to become law enforcement authorities on immigration wallace of course the federal the constitution didn apost say anything about medicaid which didn apost happen until the 1960s it says something very specifically about immigration mr nelson i aposm going to give you 30 seconds for a final thoughts nelson right and chris unfortunately that aposs completely misleading we don apost want our people doing the federal government aposs job nor do they have the time to do it what california aposs law is requiring is our sheriffs not even cooperate which is resulting in people that have committed crimes ending up on the streets of every county but certainly orange county we got involved because we don apost think that aposs right we are tired of the state trying to use these arguments to prevent us from keeping the citizens safe wallace all right we aposre going to have to leave it there didn apost think we were going to settle this and we didn apost congressman sherman mr nelson thank you both nelson thanks chris wallace thank you for joining us today to discuss the continuing debate over immigration up next we aposll bring back the panel to weigh in on the census asking people if they are u s citizens and president trump aposs new war on amazon all of that coming up commercial break begin video clip becerra every person who uses our highways or our mass transit system counts everyone who relies on our government federal state and local to be there when a natural disaster strike counts shawn nelson vice chair orange county board of supervisors they aposd like to pretend that everyone here is entitled to certain government carve outs and benefits and of course non citizens are entitled to a lot of benefits end video clip wallace california aposs attorney general and orange county supervisor shawn nelson with sharply different views on whether the 2020 census should ask people if they are u s citizens and we aposre back now with the panel well marie let me start with you why do you think the trump administration has decided to ask this as a general question on the census for the first time since 1950 marie harf fox news analyst well it aposs hard to know their motivation i know what they aposve said but for many americans including myself i see this decision in the context of the divisive rhetoric about immigration in the context of more hard line policies on deportation and that aposs how most importantly americans and people living in the country are seeing it so the point of the census is to take account of everyone in the country not just citizens and there are many people on both sides of the aisle who firmly believe that this question will depress turnout and that we will not get an accurate count because people are scared of what the trump administration might do with that information wallace gillian do you think that aposs true that this is a conscious effort to try to depress voter response by people to the census with the expressed effort of trying to lower the amount of money that aposs spent on federal benefits a apportionment of congressional seats particularly to areas with large number of illegal immigrants which tend to be democratic gillian turner fox news correspondent well that is certainly the political argument to be made about this issue but there is in fact in addition to this a much larger context at stake that gets a little bit more to the fundamentals of american democracy and how our representatives in congress and elsewhere represent us meaning the question and this is something the supreme court took up as recently as 2016 should congressional representative represent numbers equal numbers of voters in different districts or should they represent equal number of people in that the case was called i wrote it down so i aposd remember evenwel versus abbott in that instance they decided that folks who are not citizens have as much equity and should have as much say in these policy decisions as people who are american citizens that was that decision wallace yes now that apparently and and and i aposm just learning about that this morning apparently that was a decision that was more to the states and local localities than it was to congress so the question as to whether congressional seats should be apportioned according to people or citizens i have to say i was shocked to learn that it might be people and not citizens turner well i was i the same considering that you know american members of congress are supposed to represent the american electorate not just any everybody who i thought you know common parlance what we aposre taught in school seems that there aposs a fair argument to be made for they should also be representing the interests of non citizens that aposs a bigger question cross talk wallace let aposs bring it to one member of congress that aposs sitting at this table chaffetz that aposs ridiculous to think that we weren apost going to have people that aren apost americans that they are going to influence the vote so that california gets more wallace but are you aposre aware that aposs how it aposs worked up until now because there aposs been no citizen question chaffetz i aposm i aposm just i aposm just saying as a fundamental principle i i think that aposs wrong now the census is going to count everybody we aposre having our national debate about daca about immigration reform shouldn apost we know how many people are here illegally of course we aposre going to count everybody but we ought to know by the way the biggest problem that aposs moving forward with the census isn apost this question and it will be on there there aposs no way for the democrats to get it off their way the biggest problem with the census is that they aposre going to try to do this over the internet and through electronic machines what what could possibly go wrong chris wallace catherine what the debate inside the white house about this and and you know it just seemed to come out of nowhere with secretary of commerce ross announcing it this week had there been a lot of discussion about adding this question catherine lucey associated press i know that secretary ross pointed to concerns about appropriately dealing with the voting rights act so that aposs kind of the the argument that aposs being made from the administration as to why this is important but i think also we know that all these legal challenges are already happening a number of states are going to challenge this and it aposs not clear how quickly this will be resolved i mean so some people are saying that it aposs possible that this question may not end up on the census if it if it gets tied up for so long in the courts so we aposll have to see how it plays out wallace meanwhile president trump has been on a tear this week about amazon and here is one of his tweets to give you a sense of what he aposs been talking about they amazon pay little or no taxes to state and local governments use our postal system as their delivery boy causing tremendous loss to the u s and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business congressman chaffetz as the former chair of the house oversight committee you aposve dealt with some of these issues is president trump right or wrong chaffetz you know i aposve been fond of the president and his policies but he is fundamentally wrong on this issue and i actually think he knows he aposs wrong on this issue the problems at the post office are rooted in the decline in first class mail their pension issues and how they account for for their medical costs the fact that they have more customers in amazon is a blessing and it is a good thing to the postal service if you look at ups fedex amazon they all use the postal service and you need them to actually boost up the numbers that are coming in to to the post office so it is a good thing i know that they there is a personal conflict between the president and mr bezos and that aposs rooted in his acquisition of the washington post but you need more customers at the post office not less wallace and what about this question of taxes because i know it was true in the past that a lot of the big box brick and mortar retailers were upset that sales over the internet they didn apost collect sales tax but in fact amazon has i think is collecting sales tax in 45 states chaffetz it aposs all rooted in do you or do you not have physical presence in these states but quite contrary to what the president has said amazon has been helping to lead the charge because it aposs in their best economic future to have sales tax collected in these states the remote transaction parody act which i helped sponsor has broad bipartisan support in both both bodies in the house and the senate and that says that the states would get to make this determination so amazon is paying quite a bit of taxes more than they aposve paid before and they want each of the states to be able to make these types of decisions a very conservative viewpoint wallace catherine why is the president so focused on amazon right now and is it just tweets or is there talk in the white house of really taking action to move against amazon lucey well the white house said this week there were no specific policies on the table at this time so you aposre with the obvious caveats that the president sometimes makes policy without telling anyone as of right now they don apost appear to be signaling anything but he does as the congressman said this is something that aposs rooted both for him i think in sort of policy and politics but also personal and he does find the fact that jeff bezos amazon aposs founder owns the post deeply frustrating now the post has been very clear bezos is not involved in journalistic decisions but the president does seem to lash out particularly if he aposs frustrated by news coverage wallace marie let me ask you because this is part of a bigger story which is that there is a backlash against big tech and we see it particularly with facebook and the role that they played with the with the russian ads the the role that they played with cambridge analytica and turning over information what what are your thoughts about why the president is targeting not tech as an industry but targeting amazon and jeff bezos and specifically talking about bezos using the washington post to lobby for his interests here in d c harf well catherine aposs right this is personal for the president and we see him use his twitter feed to sort of hash out personal issues that he has whether it aposs with the washington post and jeff bezos this is sort of his inner monologue coming made being made public right but i think that he hasn apost or his administration even more importantly hasn apost really looked at these bigger issues of tech there actually could be some good work if they stepped back from the personal and said how should and how should we and how should we regulate facebook twitter amazon google all of these different platforms there aposs a huge conversation we aposre having in our country about tech right now and the president aposs playing out some personal personal game on twitter which is frustrating to a lot of people wallace i aposve got less than a minute left gillian and and while there is certainly some seems to be something between president trump and jeff bezos there is also a policy question here which is that the success of these internet companies does hurt the big box retailers in the street turner yes that aposs yes and that aposs i think to the president this is about the u s government the postal service versus amazon and he aposs weighing in and putting his finger on the scale in favor of the postal service but to the tech sector and to the rest of america this is about the future of brick and mortar and retail and what happens if a player like amazon is forced to bear out some of the consequences that the president would like to see to see happen you can apost put the cat back in the box and you can apost you can apost move america away from the future of of online retail wallace all right we aposll discuss more of this i aposm sure thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week how the birth of two baby bald eagles attracted international attention for one of d c aposs hidden gems commercial break wallace pope francis celebrating easter mass this morning at the vatican it aposs one of washington aposs hidden treasures just two miles from the u s capitol building but as we showed you in 2016 thanks to some stars it has captured the world aposs attention here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape dr richard olsen director national arboretum i think people are fascinated by this because this is this is real live action nature right in front of their eyes wallace voice over richard olsen is talking about the birth of two baby bald eaglets events that attracted 22 million hits on eagle cam olsen is director of the national arboretum in washington and he took us to watch the nest from a distance where the eagle family was still living olsen what you aposre seeing moving is actually the mom or the dad mr president or first lady wallace the interest in the baby eaglets has brought more attention to the rest of the arboretum a huge collection of plants trees and shrubs in the heart of the city wallace on camera so is this a garden or a 400 acre laboratory olsen it aposs both it aposs not mutually exclusive science occurs here every day wallace voice over for example these beautiful azaleas that used to grow only in the south until scientists at the arboretum developed hybrids that can thrive farther north olsen we behave as a bumblebee and move pollen from the male to the female evaluate the seedlings to find the best one that combines the traits we aposre looking for wallace there aposs a collection of 650 000 dried fresh plants to keep a permanent record olsen if there aposs any confusion as to what scientifically a rosemary is we can go back to the original specimens and say this is how the plant was described wallace and there aposs a museum of bonsai miniature trees japan gave to this country in 1976 to mark our bicentennial including this peace tree that aposs had quite a life since 1625 olsen this tree did in fact survive hiroshima so just a mile or more away from the epicenter and this tree survived the blast wallace on camera so history 400 years and one nuclear blast olsen yes it aposs pretty amazing to think about this is my office and i obviously get to get out when i want wallace voice over richard olsen grew up loving the outdoors olsen i was always seemed to be the kid that was out helping the parents in the tomato garden vegetable garden i remember planting rhubarb in wisconsin and planting red tipped petunias in north carolina wallace there was a time when he considered a different line of work olsen i thought well wouldn apost it be fun to be an analyst in for the cia i read too many spy books and movies wallace but by the end of college he traded spy craft for seeds and he aposs never looked back olsen our mission at the arboretum is
