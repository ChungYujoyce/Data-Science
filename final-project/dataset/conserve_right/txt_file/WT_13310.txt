underestimation of china s future aircraft carrier have been wrong building and operating aircraft carriers is a sacred responsibility of china s armed forces mr geng said noting the complexity of operating large ships that launch and recover aircraft an aircraft carrier is a weapons platform it can be used for offensive or defensive purposes it can also be used to maintain global peace and for
