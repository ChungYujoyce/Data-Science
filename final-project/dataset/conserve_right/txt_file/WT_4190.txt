apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion for anyone interested in the prospect however remote of improved u s russia ties get this straight it isn t going to happen anytime soon if ever in an increasingly dysfunctional american political landscape now melting down into a zero sum game over impeachment rational discussion of perhaps the most imperative question of u s global policy has become virtually impossible one of the telltale symptoms is that normal words don t mean anything anymore for example take allies as in the accusation that president trump has benefited moscow by betraying our kurdish allies in syria or balking on arming our ally ukraine in fact the u s has an alliance treaty with neither kurds nor ukraine conversely turkey actually is america s nato ally as few americans are aware we just picked up a new treaty ally under the improbable moniker of north macedonia nato expansion to counter the russian threat marches on top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century or take rule of law salon s chauncey devega writes that mr trump has co opted the rule of law through the department of justice as well as united states foreign policy how by circumventing the career u s foreign service and other bureaucracies in a bid to investigate the foreign including ukrainian role in fisa gate can these people read the constitution article 2 section 1 clause 1 says the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america the president not the foreign service not the intelligence community not the fbi or other inferior officers section 2 whose job it is to implement the president s policies not the other way around impeachment fixated democrats and their never trump gop fellow travelers think they have a smoking gun with current charge d affaires in kyiv william taylor s claim that there was indeed a quid pro quo between providing ukraine with arms for which the u s has no obligation and america s top law enforcement officer i e the president asking ukraine to investigate criminal activity but do they mr trump s enemies keep hyping hunter biden s profiteering as the object of his attention while downplaying the real issue what was ukraine s role in the criminal conspiracy inside the u s government to block mr trump in 2016 it failed or to neuter and remove him if he happened to win still ongoing as anyone who s been paying attention knows along with british agencies the previous ukrainian government under petro poroshenko current president volodymyr zelensky s predecessor was integral to activities to that end by john brennan james clapper andrew mccabe james b comey peter strzok susan rice samantha power victoria nuland and many others probably including former president barack obama himself plus some republican never trumpers and d c think tanks even now the resistance inside the administration protects this anti constitutional cabal which is why mr trump despite his legal authority is pathetically reduced to what he can accomplish personally or through private intermediaries will the long awaited department of justice inspector general s report and the much ballyhooed durham investigation now reportedly after brennan and clapper amount to much i m skeptical meanwhile federal prosecutors ostensibly under mr trump s authority are johnny on the spot in hammering rudolph w giuliani and his informants seeking to uncover the conspiracy the message from the deep state to those seeking to help their nominal boss is clear back off or end up like paul manafort as matt taibbi comments we re in a permanent coup i don t believe most americans have thought through what a successful campaign to oust donald trump would look like the real problem would be the precedent of a de facto intelligence community veto over elections using the lunatic spookworld brand of politics that has dominated the last three years of anti trump agitation if the deep state plotters finally harpoon their great orange whale it will mark the end of even a pretense of a constitutional order in this country at this point the odds are against mr trump his critics still hold their ace card russia coup meister clapper agrees with house speaker nancy pelosi that all roads lead to putin as anne gearan of the washington post asks what s mr trump s common denominator in syria and ukraine to help russia of course not just mr trump but anyone who puts american interests before those of the permanent warfare state can count on being targeted as a kremlin stooge rep tulsi gabbard jill stein sen rand paul former rep ron paul and rep tom massie are among the brave few willing to face the smears as the impeachment witch hunt unfolds the real treachery rotting our public life remains hidden meanwhile in ukraine mr zelensky faces his own deep state thwarting both efforts to bring peace to the donbas and to get the truth to washington as if anyone here really cared in such a climate russia isn t a foreign policy issue it s rorschach blot test for treason things have no place to go but down james george jatras is a former u s diplomat and former foreign policy
