player of the week robert caro this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday august 25 2019 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace anchor i aposm chris wallace the trade war with china escalates dramatically as beijing imposes new tariffs and president trump fires back begin videotape donald trump president we are having a little spat with china and we aposll win it wallace with the president attacking both the chinese and the federal reserve he meets with world leaders at the g7 amid a global economic slow down slowdown we aposll discuss the economy trade and new fears of a recession with treasury secretary steven mnuchin who is traveling with the president it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive then sen amy klobuchar d minn presidential candidate this is about him not keeping his promises to the middle class of this country wallace we aposll get reaction from presidential candidate senator amy klobuchar and ask about her plan for the economy in a fox news sunday 2020 sit down plus our sunday panel on the president aposs plan to end family separations at the border by allowing children to be detained longer trump this new rule will do even more to bring them together wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington president trump is back on the world stage at a critical time of the global economy as trade disputes are raising fears of a recession all eyes are on mr trump to see how he aposll navigate tensions with allies at the group of seven nations summit in france one of the big questions just how far he aposll go in his standoff with china in a moment we aposll speak exclusively with treasury secretary mnuchin who aposs at the g7 with the president but first john roberts has the latest on the president aposs trip john john roberts chief white house correspondent chris good afternoon to you from saint jean de luz which is just a short distance away from where the g7 summit is being held and the escalating trade war between the united states and china really taking center stage here at a breakfast meeting with the new u k prime minister boris johnson president trump asked this morning if he has any reservations about where the trade war is headed begin videotape reporter mr president any second thoughts on escalating the trade war with china trump yes sure why not reporter second thoughts trump might as well might as well reporter you have second thoughts about escalating the war with china trump i have second thoughts about everything roberts after president trump aposs comments were interpreted as regret for the trade war the press secretary later said of the president regrets anything it aposs not raising tariffs higher president trump did say he has no plans at the moment to invoke emergency powers to force american companies to stop doing business with china also insisting he is under no pressure from g7 allies to end the trade war trump i think they respect the trade war presidents and administrations allowed them to get away with taking hundreds of billions of dollars out every year and putting it into china so the answer is nobody old me that nobody would tell me that roberts in his first meeting with president trump since becoming u k prime minister boris johnson mildly voicing his dissent boris johnson british prime minister the u k has profited massively in the last 200 years from free trade we don apost like tariffs on the whole roberts as the trade war with china remains at a hot boil president trump today announced that he and japanese prime minister shinzo abe are very close to rewriting their trade relationship trump if it gets done we will possibly know by the end of this meeting roberts another topic of controversy at the g7 president trump aposs desire to invite russia back into the fold and resurrect the g8 trump ii think it aposs adventitious i think it aposs a positive other people agree with me and some people don apost necessarily agree end videotape roberts next year aposs g7 summit will be held somewhere in the united states as the host president trump can invite anyone he wants to the summit even vladimir putin chris wallace john roberts reporting from the g7 in france john thanks for that joining us now for an exclusive interview from the summit treasury secretary steven mnuchin mr secretary i want to ask you first about the president aposs comment this morning that he has second thoughts about the trade war with china which set off some confusion which i hope you aposll clear up which is it is he regretting how far the trade war has gone is he thinking about holding off on another round of tariffs or does he wish he been even more aggressive steven mnuchin treasury secretary well chris it aposs great to be here with you the president is determined to have fair and reciprocal trade with china and this morning aposs comment ph weren apost meant to back that off it was meant to say that he aposs determined as ever on this issue he wants a good deal he wants free fair and reciprocal trade wallace president trump tweeted this on friday about american businesses i want to put it up on the screen our great american companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to china including bringing your companies home and making our products in the usa mr secretary is the president ordering u s companies to stop doing business with china and if so under what authority mnuchin well he would have the authority to do that under if he declared an emergency he has not done that i think what he was saying is he aposs ordering companies to start looking because he wants to make sure to the extent we are in an extended trade war that companies don apost have these issues and move out of china and we want them to be in places where they are trading partners that respect us and trade with us fairly wallace i want to just press down on us a little bit because the president claims he does have authority on something called the emergency economic powers act passed in 1977 here he is on friday night begin video clip donald trump president well in 1977 we had an act passed a national emergency act i have the absolute right to do that we aposll see how that goes but i have the absolute right 1977 check it out end video clip wallace but there are a couple of problems here mr secretary first of all as you pointed out the president has to declare a national emergency which he hasn apost secondly the act only blocks american countries sending the transfer of future funds not past investments and also in the past of the last 42 years it aposs only been used to stop businesses with outlaw nations or with drug dealers not with trading partners so is this really a realistic option for the president mnuchin well the president has lots of options and again our first choice is to have fair and reciprocal trade the reason why we put on tariffs is for the last two and a half years we aposve been working with china to rebalance the trading relationship and it hasn apost rebalanced the trade deficit has grown significantly despite assurances from china that we would we would improve this and as you know when we were close to a deal the president was happy and they backed off of that so the president does have lots of authorities you know we use these authorities successfully with mexico on certain issues there we now are close to hopefully having the usmca passed we had a terrific meeting with canada today on this and we aposre looking forward to getting that agreement passed wallace so just to lock this up the president fully intends to impose the next round of sanctions as he aposs announced on september 1st unless there is some break in the negotiations mnuchin absolutely and to the extent that the chinese respond again you can assume the president will consider all his options wallace i want to ask you about another tweet from the president on friday and let aposs put this up on the screen my only question is who is our bigger enemy jay powell the head of the federal reserve or chairman xi the president of china question does the president really regard the chairman of the federal reserve whom he appointed to be an enemy of the country and i guess a larger question which is with all of these statements from the president all of these tweets how seriously how literally should we take what the president says mnuchin well chris let me first comment on the president xi side of this because i was with president trump today and he was very clear that president xi is still his friend he has a very good relationship with president xi we worked on lots of different things together but as it relates to financial issues and trade you know we have become enemies we aposre not we aposre not making progress but this was not intended to send a message that president xi is his enemy in the sense of all these different areas and the other thing i would say is we are very hopeful that there will be a humane solution in hong kong we are obviously watching what aposs going on there the president again reiterated he thinks that president xi sat down with the protesters he could get this over with in a few hours so we aposre hopeful that there will be calm in hong kong wallace well let me pick up on that if there isn apost if the chinese were to crackdown as they did in tiananmen square in 1989 what impact will that have on u s relations with china mnuchin chris i aposm not going to speculate because that aposs not the outcome we aposre hoping for the outcome we aposre hoping for is a peaceful outcome i think you know there was a deal with the u k when hong kong was transferred over we aposd expect china to meet that deal it aposs the and it aposs something we hope we respect they respect the laws and they respect what aposs going on there but president trump is hoping there will be a humane solution there wallace so you were at pains to say well chairman xi is not an enemy of the country but you didn apost say the same about fed chairman powell mnuchin well i really wanted to first comment on president xi on powell i think i don apost think it was a literal comment that he is an enemy but again you know my position on the fed is that i don apost make specific comments about the fed i meet with chairman powell weekly and as my role as treasury secretary i don apost comment specifically on the fed wallace but this does bring up the bigger question which i do want you to address which is you know for americans whether just people people investing ceos when the president says something how seriously how literally should we take it mnuchin i think most of the time you should take it very literally i think sometimes he says things that are meant to be a joke obviously the comment you know recently on the chosen one that was that was said tongue in cheek that wasn apost meant to be a serious comment i think most people know the president is serious about china and trade so people should understand that he is very determined he aposs trying to correct something that aposs gone on for the last 20 years but we have a very unfair trading relationship that aposs been a tremendous disadvantage to u s companies and u s workers and he aposs working hard to rebalance that wallace now when chairman powell spoke at that fed conference out in wyoming on friday he said one of the greatest headwinds that he and the economy are facing are the president aposs trade policies in fact there are a number and i think we could all agree there are a number of signs of strength in the economy especially jobs especially gdp growth at least solid signs of strength but there are some concerns and i want to ask you about those growth of business investment dropped from 9 percent last year to 1 4 percent now and the manufacturing sector has contracted for the first time since 2009 secretary mnuchin many financial experts say that one of the biggest headwinds that they now face as companies deciding whether to invest or investors deciding whether to put more money in the stock market is uncertainty about administration policies and that that uncertainty is a much bigger problem than whether or not the fed should drop interest rates 100 basis points or 1 percent mnuchin chris let me first comment that the single biggest thing that everybody is talking about here in france is the u s economy it aposs the bright spot of the world we have growth people are now talking about doing tax cuts and cutting regulations in europe so people are looking at the trump economic policies and wanting to replicate them because that aposs the reason we have all this growth second issue i aposd say is the consumer is very very strong we aposre seeing that across the board and the third issue i aposd say is on these other statistics i think you aposve got to look at them quarterly there aposs a bunch of volatility at the end of last year people worry about the economy slowing down based upon some numbers and then the numbers came out in the beginning of this year and it was clear the economy was roaring back and as it relates to uncertainty there aposs only one area and that aposs trade we are close to having a major announcement with japan we expect to have usmca passed in the next month or two that aposs going to add a significant amount to u s growth and growth in mexico and in canada we had the korea deal done there aposs three or four other major agreements that ambassador lighthizer is working on so these trading relationships are going to add significantly to growth and we aposre still somewhat hopeful that china will come around and enter into a fair good deal with us wallace let me just push back a little bit on the idea that the only concern is trade because the president has flipped on a few issues for instance tariffs and taxes in recent days and i want to play some of his contradictory statements begin video clip trump the tariffs are not being paid for by our people it aposs being paid for by china we aposre doing this for christmas season just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on u s customers payroll tax is something that we think about and a lot of people would like to see that i aposm not looking at a tax cut now we don apost need it we have a strong economy end video clip wallace the issue is whether or not i there you can see this widely i aposm not i aposm sure you aposve read it too secretary whether this administration has a steady path to keep us out of recession and the question i guess i have for you is as the markets open on monday after falling 600 points in just a few hours on friday what do you have to say to them mnuchin chris first of all we don apost see a recession on the horizon i don apost think the yield curve reflects a recession i think the yield curve reflects the fact that it anticipates the fed is going to lower short term rates and the long end has already reflected that that aposs the first thing the second thing on tariffs the reason why the president decided to delay 150 billion of tariffs was because u s companies had already purchased those goods for holiday in u s dollars so it was a very specific situation that had nothing to do with passing on or not passing on those had been committed prior to the tariffs going into effect and that aposs something we wanted to do as it relates to holiday as it relates to prices going up going forward we have seen china depreciate their currency that aposs going to mean that a significant amount of the tariffs are paid for by china we haven apost any inflation yet we haven apost seen prices go up we will have some exceptions for the rare circumstances where we have problems and the ambassador lighthizer is running that so i don apost think there aposs any mischaracterization on the tariff issue and i aposd be happy to comment on the tax issue if you want as well wallace we aposre out of time but that aposs only a better reason for you to come back when you aposre back in his country and set across the desk from us and we aposll have a conversation secretary mnuchin thank you thanks for taking time from the summit to speak with us and we aposll be tracking developments out of france sir mnuchin my pleasure look forward to seeing you soon wallace good up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss growing concerns about the state of the economy and the president aposs increasingly bitter war with fed chair jay powell commercial break begin video clip trump we are having a little spat with china and we will win it we put a lot of tariffs on china today as you know they put some on us we put a lot of them end video clip wallace president trump defending his escalating trade war with china as he left the white house with the g7 summit in france and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove columnist for the hill juan williams julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and fox news contributor emily compagno karl what do you make of the president aposs twitter storm on friday when he is saying ordering u s companies get out ordered u s companies get out of china the federal reserve chairman is an enemy of the country what are we going to make of all this karl rove former bush white house adviser we make that it aposs a wild wild friday but let aposs step back for just a moment the president is making a gigantic bet his reelection depends on three things a strong economy the democrats nominating somebody who aposs out of the mainstream or can be depicted as out of the mainstream to the american people and doing something to rehabilitate his strength among suburbanites who defected to the democrats in 2018 friday raised the stakes on the economy i mean there aposs a lot good in the economy i mean democrats talk about it you wonder whether they are fearing for the economy or hoping for recession but think about this consumer confidence up in july nfib small business numbers up in july confidence of small business people top 7 percent of the 50 some odd year history of their pole family single family housing purchases up nearly 2 percent over july over july i mean lots of good numbers wallace so o why is the president acting the way he aposs acting he doesn apost act as if he believes it rove well because he aposs made a big bet on redoing the relationship with china and that involves some challenges to our economy and we saw on friday he tweets and 600 points later we aposre at the bottom of the day on the dow but having said that you know paul samuelson was right the nobel economist when he said the stock market has called nine out of the last five recessions so i don apost put a lot into that one day but the president is making a huge bet that he aposs going to be able to pull off a deal with china that aposs going to be good for the economy and at the economy will be in good shape in 2020 wallace julie let me pick up exactly on what karl said from what you aposre hearing from your sources at the white house how freaked out is the president at the possibility despite all this good news that there could be a recession and that the tensions with china could help precipitate it julie pace the associated press from what i aposve heard he toggles between two different views on this on the one hand he watches the markets incredibly closely he believes the markets are a signal of the strength of the economy and so he gets incredibly nervous incredibly worried when he sees these drops he aposs watching some of the wallace but wait he aposs the one the market was doing just fine on friday even with pace until he tweeted wallace until he tweeted at 11 00 pace exactly that aposs what caused the drop but he sees some of these other indicators as well so he is nervous about a downturn in the economy but then he has this part of him that also thinks that some of this is being ginned up by his political opponents he thinks that the media is making too much out of these and he has this tendency to say look everybody in the sort of establishment has warned me against my own election prospects against all of these negative outcomes all of these different things that i aposve done and i haven apost seen that come to fruition why would this time be any different and that aposs why he keeps the pedal on the gas largely on the china trade talks wallace what aposs curious about all this is exactly the fact that we talked about which is that on a lot of levels the economy is pretty solid yes there are some concerns but you aposve got 3 7 percent unemployment you aposve got gdp growth still over 2 percent and sometimes the president focuses on that take a look begin video clip trump i think the word recession is aware that aposs inappropriate because it aposs just a word that certain people i aposm going to be kind certain people in the media are trying to build up because they aposd love to see a recession we are very far from a recession end video clip wallace but then emily as we say you get a day like friday the president saying we are far from a recession where he lashes out at china and the fed and starts ordering u s companies around and the question becomes or at least in my mind does he believe his own argument emily compagno contributor i think he does strongly and i want to point out that just after the conference when chair powell came out and said essentially look market policy we are not going to establish market policy to affect a recession or predicted but we will use it for trade policy developments and not an hour later is when the president tweeted that out essentially escalating the trade war and potentially spurring the drop in interest rates i want to point out that you know the market response to stability and to certainty and that interest rates are not the only predictor of a recession nor is it the only tool to stave it off and i think what would be more important and what perhaps the president understands is that the achievement of a substantive trade deal with china with the two most primary components being them buying more products from us and us enlarging our market share over there including i p that is the largest indicator and that would be the largest staving off for a recession and especially with the european and asian markets you know we are not an island we are not isolated so yes our economy is robust but there are others that are on recessions in recessions or on the brink of recessions germany included with negative interest rates and going back to the larger picture the most important thing is the messaging with our trade deal one of us cannot win we need to save face us and china for there to be a global positive response wallace yes of course but as karl says all of that depends on getting a deal if you don apost get a deal all that becomes a huge issue we got to talk about the g7 that aposs where the president is now he aposs meeting with the other six great industrialized nations and he seems to really at this point be the odd man out on a lot of issues there whether it aposs trade whether it aposs iran whether it aposs climate change and also now about re admitting russia in fact some people are calling the g6 plus one juan williams political analyst right it used to be the g8 wallace right williams with russia and in fact when he was leaving the president went out of his way to blame president obama for getting russia out i mean the reason russia is out as they invaded crimea and wallace right williams but i think what you get is there aposs differences about russia and readmitting russia there are differences about brexit and boris johnson trump is a huge boris johnson fan wallace the new prime minister of britain williams the prime minister of britain but money to many of the other european leaders don apost want britain to become a junior partner to the united states they see that as undermining the european union and then of course finally you have the trade war with china in which you know the president is over there he wants them he wants the european countries to focus on their economies you know germany is contracting you have a lot of these countries in slow down he wants them to spur their economies on they see the principal problem here globally as the trade war and that the trade war is having negative consequences not just for china but for people who trade with china people who do business with china so they want they want to get away from this nationalistic kind of america first or nation first thought that the president is advancing wallace good luck with that williams i don apost think it aposs going to happen and by the way an answer to your earlier question isn apost it obvious he comes out and says how about a tax cutting payroll taxes how about we look at capital gains taxes differently and he says i aposm not doing that yes he aposs worried about the economy wallace let me just ask one last question we got about 30 seconds left the president blew up the last g7 if you remember a year ago in canada in his fight over tariffs what do you expect this weekend and how much does he hate these big multilateral conferences pace he hates them and look that aposs not unique american presidents most i think world leaders don apost like these summits they can be they can be a little bit mind numbing actually but part of the problem that he has when he goes over there is i think he likes stirring it up with some of these world leaders i think he likes creating a little bit of controversy and therefore it aposs pretty likely that we aposre going to come out with much of an agreement on anything wallace i do want to say before he was on the air i asked secretary mnuchin how was the food he said it aposs france the food is fabulous laughter pace that aposs the one thing they aposve got going for them wallace all right panel we aposll have to take a break here we aposll see you all a little later up next democratic presidential candidate amy klobuchar on her plans for the economy gun control and winning the democratic nomination senator klobuchar joins us for a sunday sit down next commercial break wallace coming up democratic presidential candidate amy klobuchar takes on donald trump aposs economy begin video clip klobuchar he inherited a stable economy coming out of that downturn so what does he do he gloats about it says how great it is instead of meeting the challenges of our time end video clip wallace we aposll ask klobuchar how she would avoid a recession next commercial break wallace democratic presidential candidates have until wednesday to qualify for the third round of debates next month in houston so far 10 have qualified as the field is beginning to shrink someone who will be on that stage in september senator amy klobuchar who joins us now for a fox news sunday sit down senator welcome back klobuchar well thanks chris it aposs great to be on again wallace you say that president trump is right to take on china but that he aposs going about it the wrong way so given all the problems that with trade with china how would president klobuchar get tough with china and get them to clean up their act klobuchar in this case chris i think you aposve seen it in so many other areas he creates chaos and i don apost think that aposs good for getting an agreement with a country like china you look at what he aposs done and you pointed this out earlier you know august 1st he claims he aposs going to put tariffs on 300 billion worth of new goods then august 13th they dial it back then on august 20th he says he aposs going to lower taxes because he aposs concerned about what aposs happening which would of course add even more to our debt and then the next day he dials that back china aposs watching and i think when you look at trade negotiations with the world and i saw this in my role as the democratic chair in the senate of the joint economic committee you aposve got to keep your promises and you aposve got to keep your threat he has done neither and so i think that aposs the first thing is that this negotiating by tweet hasn apost been working we aposre at an all time trade deficit at 891 billion wallace but senator klobuchar the second thing is you go back to the negotiating wallace senator let me let me just senator let me just pick up on this though klobuchar go ahead ph sure wallace because the fact is that the u s economy and there are some troubles but it still by historical standards pretty strong as we were discussing with the panel historically low levels of unemployment gdp growth not quite the 3 percent the president promised but still ok haven apost the president aposs policies i aposm turning now from trade to just economic policy haven apost the president aposs policies of tax cuts and especially deregulation been effective klobuchar i don apost think so chris because i look back to the downturn and how we got out of that that was our workers that aposs been affective they aposve worked really hard and our businesses that got us out of that downturn and got us to a better place right now of some stability but what a great leader does and you know there aposs this old ojibwe saying that you make decisions not just for this generation but for seven generations from now in this case we have a president that can apost even keep his decisions seven minutes from now and so what a great leader does is rises to the challenges of our time we know what they are republicans independents democrats i think people know you can apost keep escalating this debt like he has we just found out that over a trillion dollars we aposre going to reach in the deficit by 2020 that aposs a big problem you have to do something about immigration reform wallace but but barack obama had made a huge and i understand part of it was out of a recession but barack obama added more to the debt than anybody in history i aposm not saying that that trump isn apost klobuchar well i aposm looking ok wallace but but barack obama and i didn apost hear a lot of people squawking about that klobuchar but chris look at where we are now a different situation we aposre in a stable time in the economy we hope we stay there and that is when you work on these challenges climate change immigration reform we know we need workers in our hospitals in our nursing homes in our fields in our factories starting small businesses this has been america and so what bothers me is when you look at any of these long term problems and goals and things we have to get done he aposs not doing them and i just thought i was just in iowa you know soybeans mounting up in bins you aposve got pork at its lowest export level in nine years and so go back to the negotiating table let the federal reserve be independent start pushing on these long term challenges that i just mentioned as well as infrastructure long term care you aposve got doubling of the senior population coming up wallace right klobuchar and they aposre still re litigating the affordable care act instead of dealing with that and alzheimer aposs wallace let klobuchar i just think we need to start looking to the future and dealing with those challenges wallace well let aposs let aposs talk about the immediate future in politics and and let aposs talk about where you stand in the democratic race right now in the latest national polls your 11th in the real clear politics average with 1 2 percent in iowa you aposre 6th at 3 5 percent and in new hampshire you aposre tied for 7th at 2 percent now three candidates dropped out of the race this week you are going to be on the debate stage next month but what aposs the threshold for you at what point does this not make sense klobuchar oh this makes perfect sense to me chris and that is because i aposve always known that i wasn apost going to jump to the front of this pile right away there aposs 20 some people i look at it this way i aposve made the playoffs all right and i aposve done that coming from a position of a state that aposs a little not as big as some of the other ones and coming from a position where my whole focus from the very beginning when i announced in the middle of that blizzard on an island in the mississippi river was to bridge the river of our divides to get to a higher plane in our politics and i have won with moderates and i have won in rural and i have won wallace right klobuchar even with a bunch of republicans as well as liberals and i do that by bringing people together and day in and day out i have heard from people out there that aposs what they want right now wallace all right let me klobuchar they don apost want a whiner in the white house they are tired of hearing the president whining every day when they are struggling to make ends meet wallace let let let me ask you about klobuchar they want a leader a leader should lead wallace you you talk about being a moderate and i and you are running in the moderate lane i want to put up some of your positions on various issues you support a public option but not medicare for all you call the green new deal aspirational and you oppose decriminalizing illegal border crossings joe biden is also in that lane and he aposs he aposs leading beating you in that lane at this point you say that you are and you use this phrase a candidate for our times which may be a nice way of dealing with the age issue i want to ask you something honestly and i don apost i don apost know that you aposre going to give me an unguarded answer although i know that you you you often in private you do honestly do you have concerns as you see the gaffes by joe biden mounting up day by day week by week do you have concerns as to whether or not he is up to taking the fight over the next year and a half to donald trump klobuchar i aposm focused on my own campaign chris i aposve made that very clear and taking it to donald trump myself i have strong arguments that i am the candidate to do this i am from the midwest as you know democrats had trouble winning the midwest in 2016 but we can do it i can lead the ticket because i aposve got an optimistic economic agenda for this country and i know people are looking for something else and i can lead because i have a proven track record of bringing in independents and moderate republicans and democrats and this isn apost just about this campaign i am not running for chair of the democratic national committee i am running for president of the united states and if you want to lead you aposve got to run a campaign that aposs going to show people how you aposre going to govern and we have had a time like no other with the shootings in dayton and in el paso the divide that the president causes every single day where people are just crying out for a different kind of leadership and that aposs why these debates coming up and the going into the spring i aposm going to have a chance to do that and as you know you are a veteran watcher of all this and commentator you know we aposve had plenty of presidents that have been in single digits at this moment that over time the american people got to get to know them and said you know what this is my candidate wallace all right i i got less than klobuchar that aposs what i want to be wallace i got less than two minutes left and finally i want to ask you about ilhan omar the congresswoman who aposs a member of the minnesota delegation you aposve called you talked before about the president stoking divisions you aposve called the president aposs comments about her quote racist and reprehensible but what about omar aposs statements one of which i want to play one of which she made just this week take a look begin video clip rep ilhan omar d minn we give israel more than 3 million in aid every year this is predicated on there being an important ally in the region and the only democracy in the middle east end video clip wallace now you couldn apost see it because you can apost see our feed but when she said the only democracy she did it in air quotes are you troubled by congresswoman omar questioning whether or not israel is a democracy and earlier saying that explaining american politicians support for israel as quote it aposs all about the benjamins baby are you prepared you talk about the president and his divisiveness are you prepared to call out congresswoman omar klobuchar i have i don apost agree with her on her positions on israel and i certainly don apost agree with anti semitic comment all of that being said and i have been very clear about that i thought this decision by the president to say that elected members of congress who were duly elected shouldn apost go to visit israel that they shouldn apost be allowed in that country which is our ally and yes a beacon of democracy in a really tough neighborhood in the mideast i think that was wrong and i was pleased to see that aipac and j street and other leading jewish groups came out and said the same thing because when people go to israel they see despite my disagreement with some of the policies wallace yes klobuchar of ph the prime minister there they see a democracy and i think that is the one of the worst things a strong democracy allows people in their doors they don apost shut them out wallace senator klobuchar we aposre going to have to leave it there thank you so much thanks for your time please please come klobuchar thank you it was great to be on chris wallace yes well please come back and safe travels on the campaign trail senator klobuchar thank you wallace when we come back joe biden aposs campaign says democrats need to focus on one thing beating donald trump we aposll ask our sunday panel whether the frontrunner can make that case to voters next commercial break begin video clip jill biden wife of joe biden may be have to swallow a little bit to say ok i sort of personally like so and so better but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat trump sen cory booker d n j presidential candidate can apost we have bigger aspirations than that beating donald trump as the floor it aposs not the ceiling end video clip wallace joe biden aposs wife jill making the case electability is the top issue for democrats in 2020 while rival senator cory booker tries to poke holes in that argument and we aposre back now with the panel well karl you helped george w bush win two presidential elections do you think this message of you may like somebody else better but swallow hard and he aposs the guy that can be donald trump is that the kind of message that you can win a party aposs nomination and the election karl rove contributor no you can but that aposs not the only argument that aposs being made here let aposs step back a little bit because of presidential primary is a collection of individuals and biden is making two arguments one explicitly and one implicitly the explicit one is i aposm the most electable guy and that aposs not sustainable but his opponents are helping him make the argument that he aposs the only guy who aposs a traditional reasonable democrat when you have elizabeth warren out there and bernie sanders and kamala harris and maybe pete buttigieg as a those are the only people who really have a chance of this nomination with all due respect to senator klobuchar wallace i was going to say thank you very much for rove you know look these are these are these are wallace folks we just wasted a few minutes but hey rove yes look these are vanity candidates what julie and i were talking about was there somebody who was at single digits and and actually won the nomination i think maybe james k polk in 1844 was maybe in that inaudible wallace i was running out of time but i was going to say i don apost think anybody aposs been this low this late rove yes so but but there is two there are two arguments that the biden campaign is making one would one you i aposm electable but the other one there he aposs got a lot of help this week bernie sanders came out with a 16 trillion alternative to the green new deal and they aposre all endorsing weird stuff and putting themselves in knots wallace the biden gaffes however are starting to pile up here was the former vice president just i think it was on friday say talk about how the assassinations of martin luther king and bobby kennedy in 1968 affected him when he was still in college begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate imagine what would have happened if god forbid barack obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee what would aposve happened in america end video clip wallace i know emily the president likes to say he lost it and you could argue that aposs political rhetoric but these statements misstatements curious statements they aposre piling up emily compagno contributor they are and i think it aposs why he is quickly becoming the starter nominee for a lot of voters which is essentially who they support while they aposre waiting for someone to really inspire them and i think kind of to your point karl the electability argument is fast becoming stale voters especially democrats need to be inspired and we see when they vote with her head that they essentially become catastrophic right we aposve seen that with gore and dukakis and kerry and here i think as this campaign falters there are others clearly waiting in the wings that can inspire and i think that you know the the head of the monmouth polling institute which just released a poll which still proves that he aposs leading in the polls in iowa said i have not yet met one biden voter that in any way shape or form is excited about voting for him commercial break wallace and then there was president trump aposs controversial comment this week which he made one day and then doubled down the next day take a look begin video clip trump in my opinion you vote for a democrat you aposre being very disloyal to jewish people and you aposre being very disloyal to israel and only weak people would say anything other than that end video clip wallace juan some top jewish groups were very upset by that and pushed back saying look jews american jews who voted overwhelmingly for hillary clinton in 2016 vote on a lot of issues they don apost just vote on who aposs the best candidate for israel juan williams political analyst right and the anti deformation league just said explicitly this is kind of an anti semitic trope that you are using here mr president and people like charles chuck schumer the democratic leader in the senate said at a time of rising hate crimes against jew globally but also here in the usa that he was in essence you know encouraging kind of white nationalist anger at jewish people this trope has been used for a long time to isolate jews is the other people who are really self interested or interested in israel more so than they aposre interested in being american patriots but i think that in some ways it helps the president with the evangelical base that sees him as having moved the capital into tel aviv and done all the wallace no to jerusalem williams to jerusalem excuse me and also in terms of the settlements and i mean they see him as having taken steps that strengthen their love for israel i aposm not so sure it works with american jews though wallace julie karl talked in the first segment when we were talking about what the president needs to get re elected and one of the things he talked about his republican suburbs college educated women in republican suburbs when the president seems to stoke these divisions whether talking about the squad or about jews being disloyal for baltimore congressman elijah cummings how does that play in the republican suburbs among college educated women julie pace the associated press well i think there are some differences in some of those things that he that he aposs saying there and i would also throw in some some policy issues when you aposre talking about suburban voters particularly suburban women so when you talk about the squad the strategy from the trump campaign is very clear here they want to paint the entire democratic party a socialist as outside the mainstream of what we think about democrats as and that aposs in part because they want some of these republicans independents in the suburbs who maybe don apost like donald trump very much to say all right i don apost like him but i aposm not very comfortable with is either so i guess i aposll stick with what i with what i know but then underneath all of this there are some policy issues that are really starting to worry republicans when it comes to suburban voters and top of the list right now is guns i aposve talked to a lot of republicans over the last couple of weeks after these shootings who say we have to be careful to not look as though we aposre doing nothing because particularly with mother aposs in some of these suburban districts they want to see some type of action so there are a lot of different forces at play when it comes to this group of voters wallace but the president who immediately after el paso said you know i don apost believe this slippery slope stuff we can do something the nra saying you do one thing it leads to something else was actually espousing the slippery slope this week pace exactly and that aposs that aposs because you know when it comes to this president the most important group for him is his base he he is constantly fearful of losing that group of voters and that aposs the tension for him in his reelection is he going to is he going to play more to the base and risk losing those suburban voters or would his base stay with him if he if he actually moved in the direction of bringing some of these a lot more moderates wallace but and the base is essential but it it aposs enough to get him re elected pace it aposs not enough it aposs not enough wallace thank you panel see you next week up next our power player of the week a biographer who has captured the essence of power how to get it and how to use it in his award winning books on lbj commercial break wallace he aposs one of america aposs greatest biographers the winner of two pulitzer prizes but this spring he took a break from his life aposs work to write about how he does that work and as we told you in may his loyal followers freaked out here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape wallace you must know that this has given a lot of people heartburn robert caro pulitzer prize winning biographer yes i do if you want to know the truth it aposs heartwarming that so many people are worried that i won apost finish wallace voice over robert caro has spent more than half his life telling the story of lyndon johnson four books some 3 400 pages but he aposs only up to 1964 not yet to vietnam which is why when he took a detour to write working it caused well heartburn caro i want people to have some idea of what it is i do how it is to research this type of book wallace caro fans may not be happy he took time from finishing the story of lbj but it is fascinating to learn how he goes about his masterwork caro says he learned about research from his editor at newsday back in the apos60s caro this guy looks up at me and he says just remember turn every page never assume anything turn every page wallace it aposs advice he aposs followed researching lyndon johnson wallace on camera you walk into the lbj presidential library and when you look up at the documents section what do you see caro you see at that time 32 million documents you they had 40 000 boxes each of these boxes holds about 800 pages that aposs the only time i felt like turning around and going home wallace voice over caro says he has one big rule when interviewing wallace on camera your notebooks are filled with a notation su caro yes wallace what does that mean caro shut up people have a desire a need to fill in silences if you could just make yourself shut up often they aposll tell you what you want to know wallace voice over then there is writing caro remembers what a professor at princeton told him caro you aposre never going to achieve what you want to achieve mr caro unless you stop thinking with your fingers i knew exactly what he meant it was so easy for me to write that i didn apost think things through wallace which brings us back to his final book on lbj which is about a third written caro took us into his offense caro this is the outline of the rest of my last volume from here to there to the end of the book over there wallace he writes several drafts in longhand again to slow himself down caro after i aposve done a number of drafts i go to the typewriter and i do a lot of drafts on the typewriter then it goes into this box and the box goes to my typist wallace when i talked with caro about his last lbj book he said it would take three or four years to finish the final volume that was seven years ago and he aposs now 83 wallace on camera are you really going to vietnam caro yes wallace why caro i feel unless i see it and really understand it i can apost make the reader see it wallace if you should be unable for whatever reason to finish the book have you made provisions for somebody else caro no i aposve made provisions that nobody else can finish my book nobody is going to publish anything with my name on it that i didn apost write not a word wallace voice over but caro is determined to finish the story of lyndon johnson down to the last word on a smith corona electra 210 wallace on camera how many typewriters do you have caro i have at this moment 11
