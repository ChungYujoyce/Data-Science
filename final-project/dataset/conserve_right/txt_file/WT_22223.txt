apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion there was a day not so very long ago when one newspaper shone brighter than all others the new york times the gray lady each day gathered up all the news that s fit to print as it ruled over the journalistic world becoming the newspaper of record in america if it wasn t in the times it wasn t all that important for a century and a half the paper which has won 127 pulitzer prizes far more than any other adhered to the highest of standards but not anymore not even close top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century for more than two years the editors at the times produced hundreds of weak articles pushing a story they claimed was solid as a rock president trump and his campaign coterie colluded with russia to alter the outcome of the 2016 election the times hyped and rehyped the fishy fish story even as the narrative was clearly crumbling all around them then robert mueller the knighted keeper of the truth championed by the left as a near saint blew the whole thing in his 32 million report the special counsel wrote that his investigation did not establish that members of the trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government in its election interference activities with that story dead and buried the times had to move on fast they needed another narrative to write up daily through election day 2020 and they pivoted quickly to one that the paper s top editor declares is a pure fact trump is a racist we built our newsroom to cover one story and we did it truly well executive editor dean baquet said last week in an internal town hall with key members of the paper s staff a recording of which was leaked to slate now we have to regroup and shift resources and emphasis to take on a different story mr baquet was shockingly frank as he admitted that our readers were distraught when mr mueller cleared the president the day bob mueller walked off that witness stand two things happened mr baquet said our readers who want donald trump to go away suddenly thought holy s t bob mueller is not going to do it and donald trump got a little emboldened politically i think because you know for obvious reasons and i think that the story changed a lot of the stuff we re talking about started to emerge like six or seven weeks ago we re a little tiny bit flat footed i mean that s what happens when a story looks a certain way for two years right looks a certain way but isn t that what newsmen do find out all the facts and then report they don t just chase a story for two years because it looks a certain way do they but then mr baquet got to the real point what to do next i think that we ve got to change he said adding that the times new focus will be to write more deeply about the country race and other divisions i mean the vision for coverage for the next two years is what i talked about earlier how do we cover a guy who makes these kinds of remarks he said how do we cover the world s reaction to him how do we do that while continuing to cover his policies how do we cover america that s become so divided by donald trump how do we write about race in a thoughtful way something we haven t done in a large way in a long time that to me is the vision for coverage you all are going to have to help us shape that vision but i think that s what we re going to have to do for the rest of the next two years he said and there you have it the top editor at the most respected newspaper in the country declares that he and his editors and reporters plan to stoke social discord in order to oust a sitting president right up to election day the town hall was called after a fair and balanced editor at the times wrote a headline capturing mr trump s comments when two mass shootings in one weekend shook the nation trump urges unity vs racism after outrage from prominent liberals and some staffers the paper changed its headline to assailing hate but not guns mr baquet told top editors that the person who wrote the headline is sick about it he feels terrible he said the top editor reiterated that the headline was a mistake it was a f ing mess he said so get ready for a lot of times stories about how mr trump is a racist hey it doesn t have to be true the russia collusion canard wasn t but clearly the once great new york times isn t going to let a pesky thing like facts get in the way of a good story joseph curl covered the white house and politics for a decade for the washington times he can be reached at emailprotected and on twitter j
