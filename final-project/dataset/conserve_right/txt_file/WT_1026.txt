message for the 29 graduates who had completed their job training and life skills instruction there were no media members present today we declare that you are made by god for a great and noble purpose and you are valued members of our american family we are determined to help you succeed and we are going to work with you the president told the graduates megan fox a pj media columnist wrote

give birth his appearance at the hope for prisoners graduation affirms his commitment to second chances and investing in people who have been incarcerated as worthwhile members of our community president trump s dedication to and interest in solving these issues that face the forgotten men and women who have served time in prison are a constant presence in his presidency while critics have claimed that his interest in criminal justice reform is a cynical ploy to get votes the impact he is having on former criminals is undeniably positive ms fox says this is not the democratic party
