apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic new york ap first it was the media that was at fault then democratic governors came under fire china president barack obama and federal watchdogs have all had a turn in the crosshairs and now it s the world health organization that s to blame president donald trump is falling back on a familiar political strategy as he grapples with the coronavirus pandemic deflect deny and direct blame elsewhere as he tries to distance his white house from the mounting death toll trump has cycled through a long list of possible scapegoats in an attempt to distract from what critics say were his own administration s missteps in slowing the spread of the coronavirus on american shores top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed the strategy relies on validation from supportive media personalities and republicans evoking white house tactics during other challenging times for trump s presidency the effort is taking on more urgency during a once in a century health crisis playing out just seven months before voters go to the polls the list of those trump has blamed is lengthy and shifting democratic governors for alleged mismanagement at the front lines of the crisis the media first for hyping the threat of the virus and then for not giving the administration credit for its response federal inspectors general believed to be conspiring to make the white house look bad the obama administration for not adequately preparing china initially absolved of responsibility then accused of covering up worrisome health data and now the who from which trump has threatened to withhold funding trump himself owns up to no mistakes last month as the nation began to lock down trump declared i don t take responsibility at all for a lack of testing and when asked this week if he would have responded to the crisis differently had he seen a january memo from a senior adviser warning about the potential severity of the virus outbreak in the u s the republican president was blunt i couldn t have done it any better he said in the face of extraordinary electoral headwinds finding fault elsewhere has become the directive for the president s allies according to four white house officials and republicans close to the white house they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly

has tried to drown out joe biden the presumptive democratic presidential nominee and has attempted to blame the former vice president for bureaucratic failures trump has transformed the daily white house coronavirus task force briefing into a substitute for his canceled rallies treating the james s brady briefing room like a stage in ohio florida or wisconsin he has sparred with reporters mangled facts and at times distanced himself from the advice of his own public health team there is no the buck stops here like the sign once found on president harry s truman s desk george h w bush
