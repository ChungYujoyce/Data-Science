spur its listless economy pyongyang has not publicly released detailed economic data for decades but it has made building the economy a focus of government policy since 2009 rason however is one of northkorea s newly revamped special economic zones governed by a separate set of laws and rules giving local officials more autonomy as well as being easier to access from the chinese city of yanji than from the northkorea capital of pyongyang with its economy languishing in sharp contrast to the booming market economies of its neighbors in northeast asia pyongyang has turned in recent years to china to provide trade investment and know how in exchange for access to its minerals and labor last week jang song thaek uncle of northkorea s new leader kim jong un forged deals with china on accelerating joint development of northkorea s special economic zones including rason and hwanggumphyong island according to china s ministry of commerce details were not available the timing of mr jang s visit has got to be to try to make chinese investors who are coming or thinking of coming to rason feel more comfortable about the agreements they are about to or are considering signing said andray abrahamian executive director of choson exchange a singapore based nonprofit group that has provided business and legal training for north korean government officials doing business in

committee said laws also were amended in december to protect foreign investors property still though changes were made to the legal code and transport from china has improved rason officials must ensure steady electricity broadband internet an international banking system and cellphone service for foreigners mr abrahamian said earlier this month a chinese firm the xiyang group warned other companies against investing in northkorea calling its four year experience trying to tap into northkorea s mining industry a nightmare xiyang said it invested 37 1 million to set up a joint venture to build a mining facility and sent 100 workers to northkorea last year however north korean officials demanded changes after the contract was signed and when xiyang refused they cut off utilities to the plant and deported the workers it said in a blog post a project manager who asked to be identified only by his surname wu confirmed the post tuesday on the other hand the yatai group a conglomerate based in china s jilin province announced last week that it had signed a 50 year contract with rason officials to build a sprawling complex around unsang harbor to produce cement concrete and mortar rason which encompasses the cities of rajin and sonbong sits in the far northeastern tip of northkorea with russia on one side and china on the other it was earmarked in 1991 as a special economic zone with officials seeing promise in building factories for manufacturing and expanding the rajin port for shipping however little was done to develop rason until north korean authorities amended laws in 2010 to give the region some autonomy from pyongyang drafted new laws last year to make it easier for foreigners to conduct business and signed a pact with china to jointly develop the zone mr abrahamian said rason officials told him last year that 80 percent of decisions are made locally 20 percent in pyongyang with north korean firms given the latitude to negotiate and conclude deals with foreign partners on their own before seeking final approval from the government a joint economic zone was set up in 2004 in the city of kaesong near the demilitarized zone to do business with south korean firms seoul was a main trading partner for northkorea until the south korean government forbade nearly all exchanges in 2010 following the deadly sinking of a ship that seoul blames on pyongyang about 120 south korean firms still operate in kaesong there are signs of progress in construction in rason including a paved road from the chinese city of yanji railroad lines linking rason to russia and power substations are under construction while piers are being rebuilt and expanded a model of the future rason international commercial trade center showed rows of modern buildings sparkling with lights as well as cars parked under street lamps along tree lined streets but rason has a long way to go including providing such basics as international banking internet and even a reliable power supply i d like to see some concrete evidence of the deals to provide electricity from the chinese side of the border said mr abrahamian who spoke from yanji on sunday before heading to rason they still apparently have power outages with some regularity getting a secure and steady supply of electricity is obviously huge some 110 companies from 11 countries have booths at the four day event rason s second international tradefair organizers told the associated press chinese companies dominate the exhibition hall while the big goods are parked outside exhibitors inside are showing off everything from toys to medicine clothes to household appliances made in countries as far away as the czech republic and france and as close as factories in rason one american is selling t shirts
