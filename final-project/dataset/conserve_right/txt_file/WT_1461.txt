employed in april even though their employers had closed down if they had been counted correctly unemployment would have been nearly 20 the government said however the labor department doesn t change the results submitted by its survey takers because that could be seen as political manipulation also people who are out of work but aren t actually looking for a new job are not officially counted as unemployed an estimated 6 4 million people fit that description last month probably because they saw little prospect of finding work given the shutdowns counting them as unemployed would push the rate

eurozone is expected to surpass 10 in coming months as more people are laid off that figure is expected to remain lower than the u s rate in part because millions of workers in places such as france
