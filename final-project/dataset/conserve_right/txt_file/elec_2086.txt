crossed over into arizona other family members who have lived there for decades will follow the atrocity was the work of one of the cartels battling for control of the drug traffic into the united states in mexico s sinaloa state in october an arrest of ovidio guzman lopez son of el chapo who sits in a new york prison brought a military style cartel attack on the state capital culiacan followed by a surrender to the cartel gunmen by national guard and army troops and a release of the captive is mexico a failed state asks the washington times its editorial describes another blood soaked year in mexico where 17 000 people were murdered by july and the 2019 death toll is expected to reach 32 000 usa today reports through august of the current fiscal year the border patrol apprehended 457 871 migrants arriving as family units a 406 increase compared to the 90 554 family unit apprehensions during the same period the previous year migrant families from guatemala honduras and el salvador made up almost 92 of the total with cartel battles escalating into a war that mexico city has no stomach for fighting and a record number of migrants from central america crossing mexico to flood into the usa what is the democratic party s policy for halting the rising tide democrats are moving toward an open door policy on the u s border an open borders embrace of any and all who wish to come america apparently does not belong to those who live here and love the country america belongs to anyone who chooses to come america belongs to the world consider bernie sanders immigration proposal outlined the week of the massacre of mormon women and children on day one president sanders would declare a moratorium on deportations and offer a swift pathway to citizenship for all illegal migrants who have been here for five years bernie would break up ice border jumping would cease to be a crime and become a civil offense like jaywalking the muslim ban would be abolished president sanders would back sanctuary cities that refuse to work with u s law enforcement asylum seekers would not have to wait in mexico as their claims were processed but would be welcomed into the usa family separations would end trump s wall which bernie calls racist would be history the administration s treatment of illegal immigration as a criminal and national security matter is inhuman impractical and must end migrants who enter illegally would qualify for federal health care and the same social welfare benefits as u s citizens immigrant officials say sanders proposals would create an irresistible magnet for millions of migrants from all over the world to stampede into the usa the nation magazine calls sanders plan one of the boldest immigration plans any major politician has put forward in years and comes amid a campaign season that has seen a major shift to the left among democratic candidates on immigration with calls for a total moratorium on deportations abolishing ice and providing a path to citizenship for undocumented migration the plan serves as a road map for what a fair and just immigration can be from another standpoint sanders proposal is a surrender to the reality that a leftist regime lacks the conviction or will to stop an endless stream of people from migrating here americans troubled over what is happening on the syrian turkish border or ukrainian crimean border might take a closer look at what will happen at our own border and to our own country if democrats win the presidency and throw open the doors to unrestricted immigration the federal budget already running trillion dollar deficits and state budgets too will see huge increases in the cost of social programs without the commensurate income tax revenues to pay for them even at present levels illegal immigration is bringing in millions of people without the work education or language skills to compete and assimilate rapidly in a first world western economy these migrants pay virtually no income taxes yet would qualify for the same benefits as u s citizens the inevitable result another run up in an annual deficit already running 1 trillion in the red politically so massive a migration of peoples who once they become citizens vote 70 90 democratic means an end of the gop as a truly national party if we open the borders how do we stop the drugs from coming in how do we stop the cartels from following ms 13 which is already here socially this country is as splintered as it has been since the 1960s will a barrage of migrants add to its diversity or deepen the ethnic
