sa 22 missiles china criticizes commander s japanese roots china s communist government reacted harshly to last weekend s u s warship passage near a disputed south china sea island that beijing is claiming as its territory china s propaganda department however appears to have topped itself in criticizing the u s commander of the pacific command the jingoistic communist party affiliated global times newspaper on saturday quoted a people s liberation army official as saying the warship passage was due to the hard line policies of adm harry harris the new pacific command chief according to li jie a senior colonel in the pla navy and military expert quoted by the newspaper adm harris is a hawk who harbors a deep misunderstanding and prejudice toward china col li then argued that adm harris japanese origin makes him even more of a hard liner who has been leading efforts by the u s military to do more to contain china adm harris also was given the green light to do so by the obama administration the colonel urged china to raise its voice and adopt a tough counterattack to the u s challenge adm harris was born in yokosuka japan to a navy chief petty officer father and a japanese mother since taking over the command he has adopted a much tougher position on china and its maritime claims than his predecessor adm samuel locklear adm harris began conducting what were considered routine naval freedom of navigation operations in the south china sea adm locklear had halted the passages by warships for several years based on internal bureaucratic opposition within the obama administration from officials who did not want to upset china china s government has cranked up anti japan propaganda operations since tokyo purchased privately owned senkaku islands in the east china sea several years ago anti japan propaganda in china has reached new heights in state run media in recent months as beijing has sought to portray japan a vibrant democracy as reverting to world war ii militarism and adm harris prompted criticism from china after a speech in washington last week the four star admiral told a meeting at the center for strategic and international studies that he is concerned about chinese efforts to build military facilities on newly created south china sea islands on territory also claimed by vietnam taiwan and the philippines adm harris called the chinese territorial claims provocative adding that the u s rejects china s claims to owning some 90 percent of the south china sea on the warship transits he told the audience days before the guided missile destroyer uss curtis wilbur transited the paracels you will see more of these chinese proliferation to n korea iran hit both iran and north korea have been obtaining weapons and technology from china and beijing has failed to join an international initiative designed to halt arms proliferation u s officials say thomas countryman assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation said china was asked to join the u s led proliferation security initiative psi as recently as last month but so far there has been silence from the chinese the chinese are essential partners in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction technology mr countryman told reporters during a teleconference jan 21 and it s an unfortunate fact that both iran and north korea seek to obtain high technology from china from chinese companies for their missile and nuclear programs the state department official declined to discuss specific cases of chinese proliferation but said i ll simply say again that when north korea and iran seek to purchase high technology materials or equipment for their nuclear and missile programs the place that they like to shop is china it is a very high technology economy and produces a number of advanced goods and it is important that china exercise the same degree of vigilance and control on strategic trade with iran and north korea as other countries do he said the arms transfers are a matter of constant dialogue between the united states and china he said according to mr countryman china has objected to the international arms interdiction efforts under the psi that have included stopping ships at sea and aircraft believed to be carrying illicit weapons shipments china is a major arms proliferator and is largely responsible for helping pakistan develop both nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems beginning in the 1980s china recently concluded a new strategic cooperation agreement with iran following the conclusion of the nuclear agreement that is expected to accelerate major arms and technology transfers from china to iran to north korea china illegally sold pyongyang mobile transporter erector launchers that are now carrying the kn 08 road mobile intercontinental ballistic missile the obama administration has ignored the violation china told u n investigators the launchers were sold as lumber transporters despite the fact that most experts say the missile launchers are too wide to be used on logging roads mr countryman said arms proliferation from north korea continues to be a problem a charge china called irresponsible the obama administration has been pressing china to rein in its ally in pyongyang which announced this week that it would conduct a new missile test in the coming days the announcement came as a senior chinese official was arriving in the north korean capital for talks contact bill g
