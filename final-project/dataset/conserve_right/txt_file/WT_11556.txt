apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap novelist mo yan this year s nobel prize winner for literature is practiced in the art of challenging the status quo without offending those who uphold it mo whose popular sprawling bawdy tales bring to life rural china is the first chinese winner of the literature prize who is not a critic of the authoritarian government and thursday s announcement by the swedish academy brought an explosion of pride across chinese social media the state run national broadcaster china central television reported the news moments later and the official writers association of which mo is a vice chairman lauded the choice but it also ignited renewed criticisms of mo from other writers as too willing to serve or too timid to confront a government that heavily censors artists and authors and punishes those who refuse to obey top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed the reactions highlight the unusual position mo holds in chinese literature he is a genuinely popular writer who is embraced by the communist establishment but who also dares within careful limits to tackle controversial issues like forced abortion his novel the garlic ballads which depicts a peasant uprising and official corruption was banned he s one of those people who s a bit of a sharp point for the chinese officials yet manages to keep his head above water said his longtime u s translator howard goldblatt of the university of notre dame that s a fine line to walk as you can imagine typical of his ability to skirt the censors limitations mo had retreated from beijing in recent days to the rural eastern village of gaomi where he was raised and which is the backdrop for much of his work he greeted the prize with characteristic low key indifference whether getting it or not i don t care the 57 year old mo said in a telephone interview with cctv from gaomi he said he goes to his childhood hometown every year around this time to read write and visit his elderly father i ll continue on the path i ve been taking feet on the ground describing people s lives describing people s emotions writing from the standpoint of the ordinary people said mo whose real name is guan moye and whose pen name mo yan means don t speak he chose the name while writing his first novel to remind himself to hold his tongue and stay out of trouble the state media hoopla and government cheer contrasted with the last nobel prizes given to chinese beijing disowned china born french emigre dramatist novelist and government critic gao xingjian when in 2000 he became the only other chinese writer to win the literary prize after imprisoned democracy campaigner liu xiaobo was awarded the peace prize two years ago the government heaped scorn on the award as a tool of the west and put diplomatic and economic relations with norway which awards the prize into a chill nobel winners have included political and social critics including guenter grass of germany and orhan pamuk of turkey the swedish academy disputed suggestions that it had selected mo to seek beijing s favor and rehabilitate the nobel s image in the minds of many chinese as we ve been trying to naggingly say this is a literature prize that is awarded on literary merit alone we don t take other things in consideration said peter englund the academy s permanent secretary the reaction in a winner s homeland doesn t enter into our calculus mo writes of visceral pleasures and existential quandaries and tends to create vivid mouthy characters while his early work sticks to a straightforward narrative structure enlivened by vivid descriptions raunchy humor and farce his style has evolved toying with different narrators and embracing a freewheeling style often described as chinese magical realism among the works highlighted by the nobel judges were red sorghum 1987 and big breasts wide hips 2004 as well as the garlic ballads frogs 2009 looked at forced abortions and other coercive aspects of the government s policies restricting most families to one child his output has been prolific which has contributed to his popularity and his impact his works have been translated into english russian french german and many other languages giving him an audience well beyond the chinese speaking world mo has a top literary agent andrew wylie who was at the frankfurt book fair in germany when he learned of mo s nobel and told the associated press we are in discussions globally several of his books quickly sold out thursday on amazon com although few copies likely were in stock mo is probably best known to english language readers for red sorghum thanks in part to zhang yimou s acclaimed film adaptation the novel has sold nearly 50 000 copies in the u s according to the publisher penguin group usa a strong number for a translated work most of mo s books in the u s have been released by arcade publishing whose founder the late richard seaver had previously worked with samuel beckett henry miller and other writers who faced battles with censors dick seaver was mo yan s champion from the beginning and admired this exceptional writer s unique and original voice seaver s widow jeannette seaver said in a statement he was constantly reading passages to me mo has said that censorship is a great spur to creativity in our real life there might be some sharp or sensitive issues that censors do not wish to touch upon he said in an interview with the literary magazine granta earlier this year at such a juncture a writer can inject their own imagination to isolate them from the real world or maybe they can exaggerate the situation making sure it is bold vivid and has the signature of our real world even so mo who started writing while in the army has steered clear from criticizing the government in public he has been accused of refusing to appear with dissident writers at overseas literary seminars the award stirred the criticisms anew some are opposed to his winning the nobel prize because he serves as a vice chair of the china writers association and helps the government in censorship but some are supportive arguing literature should not be linked to politics but be valued on its own merit said murong xuecun the pen name of author hao qun who has become more outspoken about censorship in recent years yu jie an essayist and close friend of imprisoned nobel laureate liu who fled to the u s this year was more acid this reflects the west s disregard for china s human rights problems mo yan s win is not a victory for literature it s a victory for the communist party yu said on his twitter feed the government ignored the controversy and instead focused on the prize as emblematic of china s now recognized status as a great nation china is winning more and more respect from the world we can say this award is not only for mo yan but to all the chinese people state run television said in a commentary for many chinese and his supporters the award was welcome for recognizing an acclaimed author and for steering clear of past nobel controversies for me personally it s the realization of a dream i ve had for years finally coming true it s suddenly a reality said mo s publisher cao yuanyong deputy editor in chief of shanghai literature and art publishing house cao said he and a dozen colleagues were toasting mo in his absence with red wine in a shanghai restaurant thursday night the prize is worth 8 million kronor or about 1 2 million born in 1955 to a farming family his early education was cut short by the cultural revolution a decade of political chaos when many of china s schools closed down to escape rural poverty he joined the army in 1976 and while still a soldier started writing in 1981 his breakthrough came with red sorghum set in a small village it is an earthy tale of love and peasant struggles set against the backdrop of the anti japanese war it was turned into a film that won the top prize at the berlin international film festival in 1988 amy tan author of the best selling the joy luck club became an early admirer goldblatt who has translated nine of mo s books remembered meeting the author in beijing in the late 1990s when the two had dinner we didn t have any chemistry and we sat there silent the whole time goldblatt said i tried to strike up a conversation and nothing happened then he pulled out a cigarette and although i had quit smoking i said why not we were best friends from then on nordstrom reported from stockholm associated press
