Elizabeth Warren’s campaign says her New Hampshire headquarters was broken into, along with other offices in the same building.

The office, located in Manchester, was broken into Wednesday night, Andrew Taverrite, Warren’s New Hampshire communications director, told the Associated Press. He said that “we have no reason to believe this was targeted to the campaign or is anything further than a regular break-in.”

The campaign says it is “working with authorities” who are investigating the break-in. It is not yet clear if anything was stolen.

A Manchester Police Department electronic log shows the burglary was reported just after 9 a.m. on Thursday.

Warren was campaigning in New Hampshire on Thursday with a town hall event planned at Dartmouth College in Hanover, about 75 miles from Manchester.

Warren has been rising steadily in the polls over the past few weeks. A RealClearPolitics national average of polls has her trailing front-runner Joe Biden 27.2% to 21.8% among voters.
