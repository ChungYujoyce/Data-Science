outlining various methods to find and track chinese people the city approved as a virus prevention strategy the effort to identify chinese citizens on public transportation applies not only to buses but underground trains and street trams in moscow russian media reported wednesday metro workers were instructed to stop riders from china and ask them to fill out questionnaires asking why they were in russia and whether they observed the two week quarantine the reports said the forms also ask respondents for their health condition and the address of where they are were staying in yekaterinburg a

masks along with strong recommendations to visit a health clinic to chinese residents human rights advocates have condemned the targeting of chinese nationals as racial profiling not an effective epidemic control strategy prevention of any serious virus be it a flu or the new coronavirus should involve a proper information campaign and not discrimination of other people said alyona popova an activist engaged in a year long court challenge of moscow s use of facial recognition technology the containment measures in the capital came as the russian government instituted an indefinite ban on chinese nationals entering the country that could block up to 90 of travelers coming to russia from china weeks before russia shut down the country s long land border with china suspended all trains and most flights between the two countries an employee of a moscow based company that employs chinese nationals told the ap on condition of anonymity that police officers came to their office on thursday and asked a dozen chinese staffers to stay home for two weeks the visit took place a little more than two weeks after these staffers returned from china and went through health checks at the airport the employee said the employee spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about what had happened the moscow metro confirmed to the associated press that the underground system was actively monitoring the stations and has a protocol in place for dealing with people who have recently returned from the people s republic of china we ask to see their documents and to show us documents proving that if they have recently returned from the people s republic of china they have undergone a two week quarantine period yulia temnikova moscow metro s deputy chief of client and passenger services said if an individual does not show proof of completing the quarantine metro workers ask the person to fill out the form and call an ambulance temnikova said bus and tram drivers contacted their labor union about the instructions to look for chinese nationals and report them to the dispatch center the drivers were outraged and didn t know what to do public transport workers union chairman yuri dashkov said so he saw a chinese national and then what dashkov said how can he ascertain that he saw a chinese national or a vietnamese national or a japanese or someone from the russian region of yakutia dashkov showed the ap a photo of the email that officials at mosgortrans were said to have sent out he also showed three photos of on bus electronic displays reading if chinese nationals are discovered in the carriage inform the dispatcher the ap was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the email and the photos dashkov shared screenshots of what appeared to be a genuine bus drivers group chat in whatsapp while moscow public transit operator mosgortrans dismissed the email as phony on its official twitter account wednesday the company told the ap in a statement two days later that it does conduct monitoring and sends data to the medics when necessary mosgortrans referred additional questions to the detailed statement from moscow s mayor who on friday acknowledged the sharp focus on chinese people in the city s virus control plan officials ordered everyone arriving from china to isolate themselves for two weeks and those who skip the quarantine step will be identified through video surveillance and facial recognition technology sobyanin said the systems give authorities the ability to constantly control compliance with the protocol he said in the statement the mayor s office did not respond to a request for comment on the city s containment approach and the accusation that it s discriminatory but rights activist popova insists the facial recognition program is unlawful whether the searches are seeking russian or chinese faces we have a constitutional right to privacy and citizens of other countries have it according to foreign and international legal norms she said temnikova from the moscow metro rejected accusations of racial profiling subway workers mainly look at the passenger s health condition she said and approach people who need help addressing identification questions like the ones that worried the bus drivers temnikova said it should be clear who could have arrived from china because it is obvious the cossacks of yekaterinburg men in conservative often pro kremlin groups claiming to be successors of the proud guards who policed the russian empire s frontiers took fighting the virus into their own hands three weeks ago they also have a system of sorts for deciding who needs a face mask and advice to see a medical professional mainly we approach people from china because it is from them that the coronavirus came they are the main source igor gorbunov elder of the ural volunteer cossack corps told the ap during one such patrol friday but not only them gorbunov continued there are different nationalities there are many people of asian appearance and they seem to be vulnerable to this disease the coronavirus because it is them who are most often affected europeans are not yet affected m
