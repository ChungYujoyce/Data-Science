tion of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump has successfully hardened u s policy toward iran since pulling out of the obama era nuclear deal 17 months ago engineering a dramatic shift in policy that has rankled america s allies in europe but won deep praise from israel and several key arab powers but that policy is likely to be strongly tested this year national security insiders say with the world watching warily to see whether the administration s maximum pressure approach manages to contain tehran or triggers a dangerous escalation as mr trump heads into his fourth year in office and a likely tumultuous reelection campaign even before a deadly year end clash between u s forces and iran allied militia groups in iraq plus the killing friday of the head of iran s quds force some longtime middle east watchers were expressing concern that ramped up u s sanctions and military pressure against the iranian regime are on the verge of unleashing a new wave of chaos and violence in the region see also iran vows harsh response to u s killing of top general u s airstrikes against a militia base followed this week by a two day siege of the u s embassy compound in baghdad have top administration officials warning iran against crossing the line while expressing pessimism that tehran has received the message there are some indications out there that iran and its proxies may be planning additional attacks defense secretary mark t esper said thursday if we get word of attacks we will take preemptive action as well to protect american forces protect american lives the game has changed iran seems wary but defiant supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei told reporters in tehran this week if anyone threatens our nation s interests we will fight back without any hesitation see also u s military claims responsibility for deadly airstrike on iran s quds leader the trump administration showed no sign of being intimidated by such threats as iraqi state tv broadcast friday that gen qassem soleimani had been killed in an airstrike at baghdad international airport three iraqi officials told reporters in baghdad that the strikes also killed abu mahdi al muhandis the deputy commander of the iran backed popular mobilization forces mr trump apparently celebrated the strike on twitter posting an image of a u s flag shortly after the deaths were reported thursday evening u s time sen christopher murphy connecticut democrat and a member of the foreign relations committee called mr soleimani an enemy of the united states but cautioned on twitter that did america just assassinate without any congressional authorization the second most powerful person in iran knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war many conservative analysts applaud the trump administration s determination over the past two years to coerce iran into behaving as mr esper and secretary of state mike pompeo have put it like a normal nation it s indisputable at this point that the trump administration s maximum pressure campaign is working toward the goal of potentially bringing the iranian regime back to the negotiating table in a way the administration wants said michael pregent a former u s intelligence officer now with the hudson institute in washington the pressure campaign he said has been so successful that it is also having the secondary effect maybe even a stumbling into success effect of actually weakening the regime through protests across the region to a point that it could actually collapse mr pompeo and other top trump advisers say the administration is not seeking regime change in tehran but rather negotiations with iranian leaders for a more far reaching accord than the 2015 nuclear deal the agreement which was also signed by britain france germany china and russia eased international sanctions on tehran in exchange for new limits on its nuclear activities but the u s wants to address what it calls the full range of malign activities including tehran s backing of militant proxies in iraq syria lebanon and yemen and ballistic missile tests that washington contends violate u n security council resolutions both before and after the 2015 nuclear deal year of escalation the pursuit of fresh talks over the past two years has proved elusive with sporadic waves of u s iranian brinkmanship the situation escalated early last summer in the wake of the trump administration s imposition of a global embargo on iranian crude oil and designation of the islamic revolutionary guard corps an elite iranian military unit as a terrorist organization in the past year iran launched a campaign against shipping in the persian gulf and downed an american surveillance drone mr trump canceled a planned retaliatory airstrike in august at the last minute and imposed more u s sanctions targeting top iranian officials and institutions and saudi arabian oil facilities were hit with a stunning missile attack that the u s and its european allies blamed on iran european efforts to keep the 2015 nuclear deal alive were undercut by secondary u s sanctions that made many international businesses reluctant to deal with iran and tehran methodically breached its commitment to the 2015 deal to pressure the europeans into more concessions washington leveled fresh sanctions on an inner circle of ayatollah khamenei officials while gradually beefing up u s military assets in the region most notably the white house deployed 3 000 u s personnel and advanced missile defense systems to saudi arabia and announced a further deployment in the wake of the embassy attack in baghdad this week the outbreak of large demonstrations in lebanon and iraq where protesters lamented iranian influence has added another twist in recent months hawkish u s analysts are calling on washington to seize the opportunity presented by rising anti tehran sentiment in the region such calls grew when protests suddenly hit dozens of cities inside iran in november after tehran announced a 300 increase in heavily subsidized fuel prices by early december the situation had snowballed into the most violent anti regime uprising in iran since the 1979 islamic revolution the regime has cracked down fiercely u s officials say iran s internal security services may have murdered more than 1 000 protesters the crackdown may have been a sign of the regime s sustained power but some saw the widespread protests as an indication that it could be toppled from within trump administration officials know this and so they are making public statements to stand with iranian protesters mr pregent said in that sense the language coming from the administration is that of embracing the opportunity at hand which is regime change even though the actual policy continues to be to try and find a way to negotiate with the existing iranian regime playing with fire some analysts say the administration is playing with fire if iran were to break out into massive demonstrations that become violent and i suppose that s the administration s hope that they will become violent and the government in tehran won t be able to successfully scare people away then you end up with a sort of arab spring situation said joshua landis who heads the center for middle east studies at the university of oklahoma obviously everyone would like a sort of tunisian outcome to such a situation said mr landis referring to the emergence of a democratic government in that north african nation after popular uprisings nearly a decade ago but we ve seen throughout the middle east that most outcomes are not tunisia they re more like syria or something much messier mr landis said iran hopefully is more of a stable state but when you do maximum pressure you don t know what s going to come out the other side mr trump s maximum pressure policy he predicted is going to force iran to escalate the chances of iran ever withdrawing from its malignant foreign policy in any way that would be noticed by the u s i think is zero others go further philip h gordon and robert malley both of whom worked on middle east policy in the obama administration said the emergence of a more benign government in tehran is possible but it is also one of the current protests least likely outcomes as cases such as cuba north korea and iraq have demonstrated all too well economic strangulation even when harsh and maintained for years or decades does not have a great record in leading to regime collapse the two wrote in a recent analysis published by foreign policy iran s history and its actions during the current crisis leave little doubt that the regime will stop at virtually nothing to remain in power they wrote beyond risks of an internal crackdown there is every reason to fear that further steps to asphyxiate iran s economy will backfire even in terms of the white house s stated goals to moderate iran s regional behavior and compel it to agree to more stringent nuclear restraints mr pregent said election year politics will influence impending strategy choices by the trump administration and iranian leaders the trump administration needs to be careful during the coming months not to cave to any internal desire to embrace a negotiation with iran just so the president has that to run on for reelection next november now is not the time to legitimize the iranian regime mr pregent said in an interview if iran believes mr trump will win a second term they may become desperate and seek to negotiate with trump because they know that if he wins the reelection his maximum pressure policy will only become harder and more effective going forward mr pregent said at the same time the iranians may seek to wait trump out on the hope he loses and that a democrat administration in 2021 seeks to walk back the maximum pressure campaign and return to the obama era nuclear deal this is a delicate situation for the regime if it engages in violence or provocations like the saudi oil attacks that could trigger a feeling among democrats that iran needs to be contained he said this could bolster democratic support for trump s maximum pressure posture in the short term in the longer term it could undermine any iranian strategy of waiting trump out in the hope a democrat in the white house might embrace a softer iran policy in 2021 mr landis predicts little change to the tense status quo in six months i think we re still where we are now he said i think the iranian regime is not going to crack this u s iran standoff is going to go on for a long time and maximum press
