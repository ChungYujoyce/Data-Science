ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion president obama is on a two week vacation in martha s vineyard as wars rage across the middle east and ukraine terrorists threaten to topple iraq and republicans are on the brink of capturing the senate around the country a deepening mood of anger and anxiety permeates america s electorate with the midterm elections less than three months away in a brewing political civil war among democrats hillary clinton has unleashed a sharp attack on mr obama s timid foreign policy calling for a more muscular response to the spread of global terrorism top stories cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces 500 doctors tell trump to end the coronavirus shutdown say it will cause more deaths you are not going to die from covid 19 the president s job approval scores remain in the low 40s and show no signs of improvement on the problems voters are angry about from jobs incomes and the budget deficits to a rash of disturbing government scandals that have exposed an incompetent and corrupt administration there is a lot of angst about whether this country is continuing to provide an opportunity to live the american dream says democrat ted strickland former governor of ohio the overarching concern is an economy that is not providing an opportunity for working people hurtling toward the fall elections the democrats political prospects and mr obama s presidency are sinking fast republicans have a political lock on the house and have a better than even chance of taking over the senate where they need only six seats to make sen harry reid nevada democrat the minority leader last week those chances improved significantly when democratic sen john e walsh of montana announced he will not seek election in the wake of a story broken by the new york times that said he had plagiarized portions of a paper he wrote at the u s army war college according to the times the six recommendations he made in a foreign policy study were taken nearly word for word without attribution from a carnegie endowment for international peace document on the same topic democrats will choose a new candidate next week but the chances of mounting a credible campaign and raising enough money to be competitive were bleak before the scandal broke polls showed republican rep steve daines running ahead of mr walsh by double digits this means democrats were behind the eight ball in at least three seats their party held but that were now open owing to retirements montana south dakota west virginia and to some extent a fourth in iowa republicans will need just three more seats to take control and there are at least five and possibly a dozen competitive contests to get them there alaska arkansas colorado louisiana and north carolina what is the coming midterm campaign going to look like when it gets underway on labor day weekend no doubt mr obama will be fully engaged but he is no longer the political force he once was indeed many democrats will not want to be seen with him in red states such as louisiana montana south dakota or west virginia to name a few democrats are desperately sinking piles of money into voter turnout to counter the gop wave but their turnout will be well below what it was in 2012 voter intensity is stronger in the gop and even among independent voters than it is among democrats that will be an overriding factor on nov 4 next will be the democrats message if they have one that resonates right now it doesn t appear they do mr obama ground tested several carnival barker pitches this year including income inequality only to discover they didn t resonate with voters neither does mr obama s insistence that the economy is doing much better since the recession many americans including large numbers who have dropped out of the workforce or who are in part time jobs but need full time work do not believe that for a moment then there s the pessimism factor no matter what he says about an improving economy he hasn t been able to convince skeptical americans who believe that economic conditions will be worse in the future recent gallup surveys reported that confidence in the u s economy fell significantly last month one attack line mr obama will continue to hammer is that congress has not acted on his threadbare agenda or he claims not even offered any legislation of its own to deal with the country s problems in truth house republicans have sent more than 300 pieces of legislation to the senate where they have been summarily shelved by mr reid mr obama wants voters to think that it s the republicans in the house who are holding things up as he threatens to take executive action with or without congress support it is all play acting of course over the decades most of the bills the house sent to the senate have been routinely placed in limbo according to govtrack us which has gone back and studied the legislative flow the website s findings more than 50 percent of the bills sent to the senate in 11 of the past 19 congresses had not received action by the time congress finished its business and went home the founding fathers in their infinite wisdom gave us a lengthy delay prone legislative system filled with plenty of procedural obstacles to keep bad bills from becoming law what mr obama s complaining about is that congress won t pass his bad laws what about the gop s election agenda that s not getting anywhere near the public attention it deserves it is partly because the national news media tends to ignore republican proposals or distorts what they would do and partly because the gop leadership has done a poor job of explaining promoting and selling its ideas a national tv ad campaign explaining how their ideas would unlock the power of job creating capital through tax reform expand trade lower gas prices cut the deficit and step up new business formation would be a good place to start backed up of course by its
