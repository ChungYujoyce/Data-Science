apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap eager to expand in the united states china s biggest technology companies face an america anxious about threats to jobs and national security the latest blow a u s report that says telecom equipment makers huawei technologies inc and zte corp are potential security threats that americans should avoid doing business with the report coming amid an american presidential race in which trade tensions with beijing are a prominent issue highlights conflicting u s sentiments toward china an important trading partner but a potential strategic rival u s companies see china as both a crucial growth market and a source of competition and industrial spying top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time a lot of people in america are worried about a diminishing role in the world and china being the prime beneficiary and potentially one day moving into that top slot said charles maynard senior managing director of business development asia which advises companies on acquisitions legislators are playing to a lot of voters at home who are very concerned about that issue he said the report monday by the house intelligence committee said u s companies should avoid doing business with huawei and zte and recommended regulators block them from buying u s companies it said government computer systems should not include components from them because they might pose an espionage risk china s government rejected the report as false and an effort to block chinese companies from the u s market the chinese side expresses its serious concerns and strong opposition commerce ministry spokesman shen danyang said in a statement tuesday he called on the united states to abandon the practice of discrimination against chinese companies the report has no official force but could discourage american telephone carriers from dealing with huawei and zte especially when it comes to the big ticket network technology the chinese companies are eager to sell huawei and zte both based in shenzhen in southern china near hong kong rejected the accusation and complained the committee failed to provide evidence to back it up the report employs many rumors and speculations to prove non existent accusations said a huawei spokesman scott sykes in an e mail we have to suspect that the only purpose of such a report is to impede competition and obstruct chinese ict companies from entering the us market sykes said zte said the investigation should be extended to western suppliers because their equipment is manufactured in or uses components from china the united states and other governments welcome the small but growing flow of chinese investment most deals abroad go through with little trouble but companies from china s government dominated economy carry unusual political baggage that has stymied transactions in sensitive areas such as energy and telecommunications last year huawei was forced to rescind its purchase of a small california computer company 3leaf systems after a u s government security panel rejected the deal huawei founded in 1987 by a former chinese military engineer has grown into the world s biggest supplier of network gear competing with nokia siemens networks and sweden s ericsson ab they are the first chinese company to present a viable sustainable competitive threat to what has long been perceived as america s core competitive advantage which is innovation and high technology said david wolf a technology marketing consultant in beijing no matter what firm stepped into that it would be caught in the barbed wire huawei with 140 000 employees says it made two thirds of its 204 billion yuan 32 billion in sales last year outside china the smaller state owned zte says it made just over half its revenues abroad huawei says it is employee owned and has denied suggestions it is controlled by the ruling communist party or is a front for the military both companies are well established suppliers to other developing countries and want to expand in lucrative u s and european markets huawei sells smartphones in the united states under its own brand other governments also have questioned huawei s suitability australia s government disclosed in march that huawei was banned from bidding to help build a nationwide high speed internet network due to concern about cyber attacks traced to china huawei has been hurt by its reluctance to release details of who controls the company such secretiveness is common among major chinese companies but unusual in western markets in contrast to american ceos who are expected to act as their companies public face huawei founder ren zhengfei never talks to reporters and rarely appears in public huawei has tried to ease u s concerns by hiring american executives and spokespeople it has taken reporters on tours of its sprawling leafy campus in shenzhen in the congressional investigation it handed over information about members of its board of directors and names of employee shareholders in britain huawei has set up a testing center where government technicians can examine its equipment they are going to have to move more quickly said wolf they need to put their most senior executives in front of the american public in other industries chinese executives are reluctant to pursue deals in the united states if they think they might be subjected to the unfamiliar and uncomfortable scrutiny of a government security review maynard said he said those might apply even to such acquisitions as an auto parts producer that makes a small portion of its sales to the u s military last month president barack obama blocked chinese owned ralls corp from owning four wind farm projects in oregon near a navy base where the u s military flies unmanned drones obama acted after the same government review panel that rejected huawei s acquisition of 3leaf said there was no way to address possible security risks this has the potential to cut both ways said maynard if you want american companies to be welcome in china you need to be making them welcome in the u s huawei technologies ltd https www huawei com target equals blank https www
