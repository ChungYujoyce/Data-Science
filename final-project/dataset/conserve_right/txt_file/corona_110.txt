for violating pennsylvania s stay at home order that s meant to contain the spread of covid 19 shaffer told pennlive that she went for a leisurely drive simply to get out of the house but ended up getting pulled over by two state police officers as she was returning home the cops said her taillight was out but the ticket they ended up issuing to shaffer says she violated the state s disease control and prevention act of 1955 and failed to abide by the order of the governor and secretary of health issued to control the spread of a communicable disease he asked me if i was aware of the stay at home act shaffer told pennlive s jan murphy i am aware of it but i didn t know it pertained to just driving indeed why should it the key to stopping the spread of the coronavirus we ve been told by public health officials is social distancing that is staying away from interpersonal contact as much as possible a single person sitting inside their own car is no less isolated than someone sitting alone inside their house would be in fact if shaffer s story is true the only interpersonal contact she had while driving on sunday was with the officers who pulled her over troopers have been encouraged to use contacts with the public as opportunities to reinforce the necessity to abide by stay at home orders is how ryan tarkowski a spokesman for the state police explained the encounter but maybe at a time when contacts with the public are considered a public health risk the cops could find a better strategy unfortunately shaffer s story is not a singular one a paddleboarder in california was arrested last week for violating the state s stay at home order apparently being surrounded by open water is insufficient social distancing in new york city where the covid 19 outbreak is most severe right now police have been arresting people for violating social distancing orders technically the arrests were for obstructing governmental administration unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct the intercept reports and packing them together in crowded jails how is this helping there has been much discussion about whether the treatment for the coronavirus outbreak is worse than the disease itself any serious accounting of the pandemic must take into account the immense economic damage and widespread unemployment caused by stay at home orders and mandatory shutdowns a corollary to that discussion is the question of how aggressively shutdown orders should be policed yes they are necessary to stop the spread of the disease and cannot be ignored but you risk tipping beyond protecting the public and actually increasing the risk of spreading disease with aggressive enforcement what if one of the officers who gave shaffer a ticket was an asymptomatic carrier nearly 2 000 cops in new york city have tested positive for covid 19 which suggests that you might be more likely to contract the disease while getting written up for leaving your house to go for a run or drive than if you d simply been allowed to go for a run or drive and that says nothing of the civil liberties violation that occurred when shaffer was pulled over for doing absolutely nothing that threatened public health if anything driving for recreation should be encouraged right now it s a way for people to get out of the house and have a bit of fun especially with roads being so empty and gas prices falling to near record lows while maintaining social distance as local and state governments try to find the right balance between enforcing mandatory quarantines and respecting civil liberties they should pursue policies that are driven by science that are proportionate to the risks involved and that do not last any longer than necessary says elizabeth goitein director for liberty and national security at the brennan center for justice a legal policy think tank she worries that ramped up scrutiny of every detail of everyday life could become a new normal that tilts away from freedom could we start to see once people get socialized to this idea that governments have this power could we see governments a little more willing to use that power she asks i think we re going to have to be extremely careful extremely vigilant that we don t allow this time in our history to break down the barriers to powers the government should not have police should not have the power to stop and question everyone who leaves their home in apparent contravention of a stay at home order even in a time when those orders are in place the default assumption cannot become that movement is illegal unless approved by the state yes the police may have a role to play in preventing large public gatherings and other actual violations of social distancing guidelines but not every apparent violation of a quarantine order is a risk to other people for that matter not all violations of quarantine orders can be enforced as there simply aren t enough cops to do so and if enforcement is going to be arbitrary then it would be no surprise to see some communities and individuals targeted for reasons that have nothing to do with public health and for heaven s sake don t call the cops on your neighbors shaffer tells pennlive that she plans to appeal the ticket and fine when this is all over a court should have no trouble clearing her name update york county district attorney dave sunday has announced his intention to withdraw the citation against shaffer based on the facts in this one specific case the fact that she was on her way home that she was by herself in her car that she was completely cooperative i think that prosecution from my office of this may not be in the public interest sunday told wsba morning news with gary sutton advertisement next trump wants 2 trillion pelosi wants 1 trillion for next coronavirus spending bill eric boehm is a reporter at reason show comments 143 editor s note we invite comments and request that they be civil and on topic we

orders oh hell why not you know else was just following orders kirkland pence nkvd custer no not custer my bartender up until 3 weeks ago say hello to lundberg for me the guy who makes the pizzas at my local dominos i was pretty ticked for this too do ticks carry corona virus btw i know that computers can get infected with viruses lots of cars have several embedded computers in their electronic guts these days so when you re driving alone you re not driving alone you might get a virus from the computers in your car s guts that is why we must obey these laws that s completely bs first forget your civil liberties the reason this continues on cause there s not enough of us standing up and speaking our minds since when did the states become individual countries with governors making decisions for us we are no longer a country of the free just a gathering of individual states ridiculous they probably also lied about the tail light change your life right now work from comfort of your home and receive your first paycheck within a week no experience needed no boss over your shoulder ytr say goodbye to your old job limited number of spots open find out how here more here why would cities on the east coast issue strict shelter in place orders but fail to shut down subways light rail and all other forms of mass transportation people should be encouraged to drive alone in cars if they need to get someplace a h s really generate respect for law enforcement a corollary to that discussion is the question of how aggressively shutdown orders should be policed yes they are necessary to stop the spread of the disease and cannot be ignored depressing language from an ostensibly libertarian organization they should be ignored by all means wear a mask and keep your distance but orders to stay at home until government provides permission is authoritarian we are not at war despite what language the media and government use to dress up this exercise in tyranny we are not at war despite what language the media and government use to dress up this exercise in tyranny never let a crisis go to waste i am far less concerned with recovery from the flu than i am recovery from the governments take overs of the economy and our personal liberties as am i but i am also depressed by reason nick seems to be the only person comfortable with pushing back against quarantine dogma bohem has been telling us for weeks that the only reason this virus is out of control is because trump didn t panic early enough he s boxed himself in and is left justifying government tyranny now he wants to parse it to well of course he government has to quarantine everybody but if they enforce their laws i ll be very angry agreed when even the libertarians are in favor of such sweeping police power i am left feeling hopeless resistance to this bullshit is increasing daily in another month or so the government is going to have a very hard time enforcing this yes it absolutely can be ignored and should be by most healthy people i m really starting to doubt that social distancing is really doing us any good it might be slowing the spread but it s also prolonging things and making it more likely that there will be a second wave later in the year i m starting to think that what needs to happen is everyone gets exposed so we develop herd immunity the virus seems to be a pretty minor thing for children closing schools may have been a terrible idea if we stop all the distancing measures it may well really suck at some hospitals for a few weeks and that s not nothing but i don t see how it s worth it for everyone else i was wondering when this would start happening someone taking a walk in the woods when a park ranger gets in your face and coughs on you while writing a ticket because you re not social distancing enough well how about all of the people going into private homes in places like ri to determine if people are properly quarantining themselves this whole thing is fascist and needs to be seen as such texas went full fascist on people from louisiana 15 of all cold virus are some strain of a coronavirus the more you know the trick here to avoiding a ticket is coming up with an excuse that is considered a valid reason to leave your house had she told him she was going to the liquor store he would have tipped his hat and wished her a good day in pennsylvania liquor stores which are state run have been shut down dropping by the old abortion clinic in my pennsylvania town covid 19 impacts include a new requirement to tie cardboard for recycling in bundles with string no stacking into a cardboard box alone so my family s defense if we get stopped is that we re going to buy pandemic essential string so i m still seeing a conflict between social distancing laws and regulations on hov lanes that require 2 or more people in the car is the quarantine order legal to begin with since when did that matter no 1a establishes a right to peaceable assembly and there are no exceptions for when people are getting sick your governor might not like it but he can go fuck himself it s probably legal for governors to do it that s separate from the question of whether it s constitutional are governors dictators where you live the pa case is interesting because they seem to have an actual law on the books about this kind of thing a law passed by their state legislature whether that law is constitutional or not is up for debate but they at least went through a process to get the law on the books in the absence of a law like that though your governor has no standing to tell you to stay inside or wear a mask or do the hokey pokey when they pretend otherwise they should be told to go fuck themselves in no uncertain terms states possess plenary or police powers that the federal government lacks thus yes the state can issue quarantine orders even when the feds could not and yes medically justified quarantine orders are a recognized exception to the first amendment guarantee of freedom of association whether that power may be exercised only by the legislature or can be exercised by the governor is an interesting question that depends on state specific law constitution and precedent in most states and i venture to say probably all the power of the governor to issue quarantine orders is established law that doesn t mean that any and all quarantine orders are okay the standard for what is justifiable and what is not is fluid senseless ones like the cop s interpretation above are indefensible but others can be valid haha dont believe anything rossami says about state power he cannot cite it and he s dangerously wrong states do not have plenary power they are limited by the us constitution their state constitution enumerated power and limitations and the natural rights of citizens the right to breath cannot be infringed the proper scope of the police power randy e barnett georgetown university law center i think you are confusing what should be with what is dejonge v oregon consistently with the federal constitution peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime the social distancing and self quarantine are all half measures because actually declaring martial law would be met with bullets every time a police or military vehicle passed by tyrannical state governors are trying to toe the line of hysteria that will go over with more sheeple are governors dictators where you live they sure are now no law at all every state has a disease control act but that doesn t give anyone the authority to suddenly decree what kind of movement isolated in a private automobile is permissible i m sure the cops literally picked a random code section and cited it meaningless anyway https www legis state pa us wu01 li li us pdf 1955 0 0500 pdf this is the closest i could find to any kind of controls in the act section 5 control measures upon the receipt by a local board or department of health or by the department as the case may be of a report of a disease which is subject to isolation quarantine or any other control measure the local board or department of health or the department shall carry out the appropriate control measures in such manner and in such place as is provided by rule or regulation penalties a any person who violates any of the provisions of this act or any regulation shall for each offense upon conviction thereof in a summary proceeding before any magistrate alderman or justice of the peace in the county wherein the offense was committed be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than twenty five dollars 25 and not more than three hundred dollars 300 together with costs and in default of payment of the fine and costs to be imprisoned in the county jail for a period not to exceed thirty 30 days b prosecutions may be instituted by the department by a local board or department of health or by any person having knowledge of a violation of any provisions of this act or any regulation the governors order is not a health department order the police have no idea about what any violations might be or if there are any regulations and they cite them either i have been personally cited by building inspectors like i was a zone on stolen police summons they dont work with citations its civil and the citation was for a regulation that carried no arrest or criminal penalty all of these citations are bunk i much prefer voting for anyone but this november all it s going to take are a few surprise upsets this fall to put the tin horn despots in their place torturing people for using marijuana is apparently legal so why wouldn t this be permissible we live in crazy land could we start to see once people get socialized to this idea that governments have this power could we see governments a little more willing to use that power the answer to that question is almost certainly yes once the government realizes they can violate your rights and you won t do anything about it it s pretty much a guarantee that they will no no the government would never do that remember after the vaping panic was established to be based on already illegal materials they rolled back all the knee jerk restrictions oh wait she should have called the cops and reported some guy getting within 6 feet of her or she should have sneezed uncontrollably every time the officer got within six feet of her and apologize while that explaining she s allergic to police and get arrested for making a terrorist threat yeah that s being used although all the instances i ve read about involve some jerk intentionally coughing sneezing on as much merchandise as possible in a supermarket some jerk intentionally coughing sneezing on as much merchandise as possible that s the version of events we see in the press to justify the arrest we can t be sure of the authenticity of the accusation all it takes is one busy body who heard you clear your throat and reported an exaggerated version of your actions compounded by further exaggerations by the arresting officer and garnished by journalism s usual hyperboles to ensure readers viewers and assorted riff raff before you find yourself on the way to whatever covid 19 gitmo has been ginned up i m sure that could happen given the general hysteria around covid 19 however it s unlikely a store would toss 35 000 in goods on some busybody s feverish play on words fully intended allegation https www cnn com 2020 03 26 us woman coughed on produce trnd index html or made a citizen s arrest and be celebrated as a hero for quite awhile i have been questioning what happens when we lift this stupid stay at home orders the fact is unless the virus is completely died out we will have a second round as people who weren t exposed because they were following the orders are now exposed will we then be forced into a second round of this draconian tactics there is no strategy here it is pure reactionary thinking and totalitarian at that yup and to further that point we have evidence that this is going to be seasonal like the flu do we do all of this again next year people need to accept that getting sick and dying is part of life your 90 year old grandma is going to get sick and die probably sooner rather than later even if we all stay inside and do irreversible damage to the country it might be covid it might be the flu it might be 1000 other things but she is going to get sick and die eventually and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it cowering in fear for the next 18 months is hardly a rational response to that fact amen yes the majority who have died vast majority are people who had a better than average chance of dieing within a year anyhow yes the younger people at risk are sad stories as is the woman who went into premature labor and lost her baby as a result of the illness but those are the exceptions and they could be planned for and there will be some extraordinary cases of people who seemed perfectly healthy but died after contracting it this happens with the flu chickenpox etc as well it is in the environment now it is now being transmitted to cats that means felines have now become a reservoir for the virus i doubt people will be getting rid of mr tiddles anytime soon we need to learn to live with this not hide in fear of it true that maybe if we beat this virus down enough and hope the weather does something for us we can wind this mfer back up starting in may i sound like trump i don t have tds by the way i just think he s a fucking idiot nah you have tds just like an addict the one with the problem is usually the last to know what everyone around him has seen i had looked up the actuarial tables at the beginning of this just general ss administration data not controlled for health or lifestyle or anything like that in your 80s the chances of dying in the next year ranged from 7 at age 80 to 15 at age 89 so basically say that in any given year in your 80s you have a 10 of dying math tells you that no matter what you don t have a very good chance of making it out of your 80s plus what is the quality of life for so many of these people is it even a gross benefit never mind a net benefit to keep someone alive for another year or two or three in a nursing home with dementia or whatever else they have going on coronavirus most often causes death by pneumonia in the old days pneumonia was sometimes called the old man s friend since it often killed the very old relatively quickly and ended their suffering from other less fatal but more unpleasant ailments yes there are outliers my grandma is in the upper half of her 80s still lives alone and at home gets around does great and isn t living a miserable existence as a nursing home invalid however one slip and fall or significant medical issue could change that any day if she s lucky she could die if she s not she could end up sitting in a wheelchair for years as her mind and body slip away if she died from something relatively quick at this point like covid i don t think she or i could have anything to complain about i certainly don t want it to happen and i m not saying kill the old people but i m saying that sometimes it s ok to let life take its course and not obsess over squeezing out every last possible second of life for every single person on earth death is ok my grandfather passed away around this time last year ostensibly his cause of death would be the flu he was in poor health for a long time he had broken his neck twice in his life had partial paralysis for as long as i can remember started experiencing some unusual pain and went to the hospital while in the hospital he contracted the flu and that ultimately did him in he was in his upper 80s i don t think anyone in my family would say that the flu killed him we d say the flu is the straw that broke the camel s back there are lots of people like my late grandfather out there holding on when everything is going perfectly but they re 1 bad day away from the funeral parlor if he were alive today he d probably be getting wiped out by covid i do know that his response to all of this would be that we re all overreacting and that he didn t fight those communists for us to sit around pissing our pants over the flu he d be extremely upset that a bunch of young people are ruining their lives to protect a bunch of people who are on death s door already i think the young people good little sheeple and the boomers are using government tyranny to keep the young adults in line so it might save their old asses my one grandfather died several years ago he must have been in his late 70s or very early 80s very active was still riding his bike and doing all kinds of things then one day he was out painting the eaves on his house and fell off the ladder he hit his head on the driveway and died shortly after due to bleeding in the brain it was a shock to us of course because he was in such good shape but damn can you really complain too much about going suddenly after living a good life right to the end maybe not quite as long as you d like but still above average it sucked for us but not for him contrast that with my other grandfather similarly he had been active his whole life working around his house and in his garden and cutting lumber until his 80s then his health started to decline including kidney problems which resulted in his being on dialysis it was all downhill from there soon he was a shell of himself a sickly person whose only reason to get up in the morning was to get dragged to a clinic and hooked up to the machine that kept him alive when he finally died of course we were prepared and even a little relieved which made the death itself easier for us but it sucked for him i d take the former scenario over the latter myself even if it meant a few less years on earth what is it you are actually trying to say sure death is a natural part of life but we should reasonably try to prevent it no are you suggesting there should have been no response to this outbreak and we should just let it spread and whoever dies dies the response was so drastic because it is a new disease with a high death rate once we know more about it then the response will be more calm and reasonable such as get your flu shot i would love to see you and the others above with the attitude you re 80 you re gonna die anyway when you are 80 doubt you ll have the same attitude yes try to prevent it by encouraging vulnerable people to take precautions and get treatment promptly if they get sick not by turning everyone into a prisoner ok but you are missing the big picture people who are young and healthy are still becoming very sick and being put on ventilators they have a higher chance of pulling through but this is hitting everyone who catches it extremely hard hospitals would be more overrun then they already are if we had done nothing you ll forgive me if i listen to doctors and scientists over people who are more concerned with money not all doctors and scientists agree about everything and we still have pretty terrible data at this point so it s likely that those advising the government are being extra cautious and the economy is also vital to people s lives and wellbeing the economic harm will cause deaths and ruin people s quality of life too i d like to hear more from actual epidemiologists and less from public health experts who are a hybrid of science and politics and work for people who want to look like they are doing something about this so they can get votes you are right i don t know for sure about anything but no one does at this point the data isn t there maybe it doesn t cause serious disease in as many people as we think and it has already spread through a lot of the population i think that would really be the best news we could get i just don t think this thing will go away before we have herd immunity and it could be i m not sure a worthwhile tradeoff to let it be really horrible now so that it won t keep coming back i m not primarily concerned about money i concerned about people and i think it is likely that the response will do far more harm to people than the virus there s something i have trouble finding stats on what proportion of people infected develop serious illness that progresses to pneumonia and what is the demographic breakdown of the people who need to be hospitalized for it you seem to think you know something about that do you have any good source for data very few young healthy people are getting sick enough to be put on ventilators as a medical doctor on the front lines i can assure there are almost no young people on ventilations due to corona virus i have seen no one under 70 need intubation we had a 32 year old woman in labor with a cough who tested positive and got an epidural she did fine our 59 year old did well on high flow nasal cannula out of hospital in 3 days i ve seen a few 70year olds get intubated and recover a 79 year old died when we tried to ventilate in prone position the only young who die have co morbid conditions the rational approach would have been to quarantine those at risk and keep all children in school and under 50 in good health at work pretty much yeah that s what i m saying the amount of effort and expense that is worth putting into keeping someone alive depends upon the number and quality of expected years left if you re almost certain to die within the next 5 years do you disagree that it is pretty silly to expend a huge amount of resources in keeping you alive you act like there is no difference between going door to door and plugging old people in the head and allowing a relatively small chance of them catching and dying from an illness no different than any number of other illnesses that thousands of them die from every day the former is a definite aggressive act the latter is not doing nothing is always an option and usually the best one if i was in my 80s i sure wouldn t expect the world to change for my benefit if i was worried i could lock myself in my house with a 12 gauge by my side point is even when i m old my health is my responsibility and no one else s no adult should want or need to be protected amen sorry folks but none of us is making it out of this life thing alive and i prefer to actually live while i m alive not cower in fear and clamor for men with guns to put on a show to make me feel safer i was pretty cynical about people before all of this but the human race has disappointed me even more than usual with this cowardice panic and clamoring to be ruled over just let it run its course it will hurt least in the long run suck it up for a few weeks of carnage and then get on with life jfc i m headed to the grocery store fuck you but yeah i hope she never pays the fine it s hard to just not pay the fine she has to fight it by demanding a speedy jury trial or whatever pa allows for this nonsense i bet the prosecutor will drop the ticket before it even gets to trial there is no way that any politician or judge wants to set a precedent on whether all this hysterical emergency laws are actually constitutional the scotus just reversed korematsu v united states 323 u s 214 1944 a few years ago and congress apologized i would doubt the soctus would put to paper that this hysterical state action should never be done again the state government hysteria will be deemed a success government say that they will never do it again and all will be forgiven never answer questions especially now say something like in the interest of public safety i m not opening my mouth how do i do this telepathy just say we shouldn t be having a conservation right now conversation jesus cell phone typing plus my impatient trash chop down all the trees write it on a placard and hold it up every time you get pulled over i need to get i m infected license plate there is a better than average chance they d just shoot you why risk it being infected i mean the most important thing is that they make it home safe sounds like she should have shot her way out of it they were literally killing her with the super bug known a kungflu she had a self sense case defense i would have found her not guilty the cops said her taillight was out but the ticket they ended up so was the taillight out or not if so why not 2 tickets shortage restraint mercy answer none of the above perhaps them wanted to cut her a break by just giving her the significantly higher penalty ticket and did not want to come off as greedy highway robbing jbt a more contextually parentalesque approach by citing her for failing to stay in her room instead of a fixable bureaucratically authoritarian equipment failure ticket that could more easily be challenged if false more likely troopers have been encouraged to use or create contacts with the public as opportunities to reinforce the necessity to abide by stay at home orders house arrest is the real genesis here to keep the sheeple in line and sufficiently terrorized and intimidated into submission stupid bitch should have said she moved to living in her car within the last 10 days of course instead of coming off as a moron that does not understand the difference between staying at home and leaving said home in one s car answer them s questions and win a prize if she passed go on her sunday drive then it s a 200 wash the fact that unreason does not think social distancing law are unconstitutional is not surprising at all there is no imaginable power that the federal government or states have that allows them to tell americans how far from other people they can stand or be this is tyranny if you allow cops to get away with this you are a tool maybe this will be the final push to get the feds to nationalize car production and finally get a car where the tail lights work wouldn t matter there d be a sudden epidemic of crossing the center line or weaving or failing to use your turn signal or looking like you were texting there is no chance cops are going to run out of phony pretexts to pull anyone over at any time i smell marijuana true i stand solidly behind law enforcement most of the time but there are a few select branches that contain a very high percentage of state revenue enhancement officers who masquerade as safety officers on this note i went shopping today dry cleaners were open a bunch of georgians were out doing normal stuff our grocery stores were almost fully stocked construction is going on with paving roads and other stuff yard guys are working in the area roads have traffic on them old wwii navy vet was at hardware store megachurch was holding bbq good i hope more people start doing that as weather gets nice you people are psychotic why do you want this disease to spread i hope you are all very hard hit with this as a result of your dumb ass defiance of logic because nothing is more sacred to you then don t tread on me i want the disease to spread so people will develop immunity and it will be less likely to come back next winter the lockdown stuff could be making things worse in the long run maybe i m wrong and the death toll would be unacceptable it may well also be that fewer people will die from it in the long run if we just let it go we should at least be considering that possibility rasmussen poll released today show the majority of people are worried about the economic impacts of the pandemic while the poll shows people are still somewhat supporting the measures it shows increasing discomfort and questioning of the quarantines it also shows that health issues are the main worry for only 4 of those polled boredom and isolation is 23 of the main worries of those polled how much longer until we have widespread social unrest i would also like to point out for those worried about increasing nationalism it appears one of the outcomes of the pandemic is growing nationalist sympathies in italy the pro eu party is now even admitting they are taking a far more nationalist stance even pro eu publications are now predicting that the eu is likely to not weather this storm and very likely will break up of course their answer is for the northern germanic states to assume the debt of the debt ridden mediterranean countries i am sure that will play well in germany and finland will netherexit germanexit and finexit be next european un union they should have stopped at being a free trade zone or at least not started admitting countries that didn t have their shit together fiscally that might be what they are saying now but in most cases they merely stick their finger in the air and if the breeze is strong they will stay with it for awhile globalists are globalists by conviction and opportunists as necessary polling is showing that support for italy exiting the eu is as high as 80 and the german people have been increasingly disenchanted with supporting the mediterranean countries since 2008 don t the german people realize that the drag that the mediterranean countries put on the value of the euro is what props up their strong export economy their leaders sure do yes because most people are extremely selfish and only care about what effects them personally i m bored so i want to go outside i don t care if i catch a deadly disease or spread a deadly disease to others the economy is going to suffer for a few months so lets ignore a deadly disease and get the stock market up again people s priorities are severely out of whack the economy is not going to suffer for just a few months but for years and or decades businesses are not able to restart at the drop of a hat production lines and supply lines will be disrupted for years and many will never even recover no the selfish ones are the ones are people like you who blindly dismiss real world worries because of a disease that likely has under 1 fatality rate and may actually approach the levels of a bad flu season and is most fatal to people who have a better than average chance of dying within a year anyhow and even the majority of the elderly who contract it recover and it always turns out so well when germanic countries decide to become nationalist in their thinking especially when they were sort of socialist to begin with but maybe at a time when contacts with the public are considered a public health risk the cops could find a better strategy you do realize that i feared for my life is their go to strategy for dealing with risks right rather than violating the 6 foot rule necessary to write her a ticket the cops should have just shot her from 7 feet away that s your suggested fix to this problem good ole government common sense the likelihood of wolf being reelected after all this is getting slimmer which is fine there needs to be a concerted effort to remove all democrats from every level of government the police never miss a chance to earn the publics disrespect when you ride alone you ride with hitler this is commonsense war on commievirus legislation just as in 1943 would the government printing office lie to us anti collectivist arrogant scofflaws need to be put in their place with service pistols if obstreperous by sensitive concerned and aware officers remember the common good before the individual good https www zerohedge com economics stockman not your grandfathers recession based on the shocking 6 6 million of new unemployment claims we d bet they ll be some explosive political fireworks soon in this country about covid containment versus keeping the main street economy alive there have now been an unprecedented off the charts 9 96 million new unemployment claims in the last two weeks for point of reference it took fully 28 weeks to generate the same level of cumulative new claims after the beginning of the great recession during that interval the largest weekly number was 387 000 during the week of march 29 2008 even when you scroll forward not shown to the worst week after the lehman bankruptcy meltdown commenced on september 15 the peak number was only 665 000 during the week of march 28 2009 so today s new claims number was 10x higher so yes some politically incorrect pundit is likely to note that there are now 47 jobless workers for every confirmed coronavirus case 320 jobless for every hospitalization and 2 112 jobless for every coronavirus death moreover it virtually certain that cumulative initial claims will hit 20 million before the end of april thereby doubling the above ratios that is to say do they really want 100 jobless workers for every case of a bad winter flu that is to say do they really want 100 jobless workers for every case of a bad winter flu don t be silly corona19 is not an influenza it s an aggressive strain of the common cold they don t do a lot of testing for flu and symptoms are similar so a lot of coronavirus illnesses get lumped in with flu like disease in statistics there has been much discussion about whether the treatment for the coronavirus outbreak is worse than the disease itself a corollary to that discussion is the question of how aggressively shutdown orders should be policed yes they are necessary to stop the spread of the disease and cannot be ignored no they fucking aren t necessary yes they fucking can be ignored and safely they are not necessary to stop the spread of the disease any more than fascist edicts have been necessary to stop the spread of the flu basic hygiene measures that should already be sop and common sense are all that s needed what the fuck with conceding the government s premise on this and the premise of the sheeple that politicians are our saviors what the fuck with even treating this as something worse than the seasonal flu or pneumonia or the quarter million people killed by medical mistakes every year or the 40 000 who die in car accidents every one of those 40 000 deaths could be prevented if the government just took our keys it s worth it to save a life right of course the treatment for the outbreak is worse than the disease the treatment has been to suspend the bill of rights fuck you boehm for your neutral observer pose of acting like rights are on the table for debate loved your rant and couldn t agree more yes what you said all of it and fyi folks i m a healthcare provider in the interest of remaining employed i have to keep my mouth shut at work thank god i can come on here and rant and read comments that make sense and don t support subjugation state troopers need their fix and pickings are slim especially with the restrictions on asset forfeiture sharing sooooooooooooo you people are still saying cops won t go against the constitution and will do the right thing well i say barbara streisand on you see these cops love the power this is deep state destroying the economy they government want you to obey and see if you will fight push back now will you you will have a new normal just like we do since the patriot act we will be screwed yet again remember what you do today will impact your children and grand children down the road wake up sheeple the wolves are voting on who is for supper broken tail light what no i smelz me some marijuana this lady was lucky to get off with a ticket obviously the officer needs to be re trained in his defense not every innocent driver has a dog to shoot but he neglected to even conduct a roadside body cavity search too local thar ya go duke of url good one and yet somehow pennsylvania has seen fit to let trout fishing season proceed two weeks early trout fishers are advised to maintain physical social distance from other fishers and to travel to their fishing hole only with people they live with but otherwise go ahead and fish which is fine with me but not very consistent i don t fish and spend my days working from home but my fishing enthusiast retired neighbor will be loving this i m sure i say everyone who can t pay their bills because of all this should send all their bills to the governors of the state houses and have them pay them maybe an overload will wake them up and make more sensible choices people s jobs and relationships are one thing but don t fuck with fishing season cops use proper ppe because if they got close enough to take her license and registration then hand her a ticket they broke the isolation bubble the only thing that is surprising about this is that people are surprised this was the inevitable result of increasing government mandated stay at home orders you have to be prepared to enforce them or they are meaningless we have surrendered our civil liberties so easily and government doesn t tend to shrink so thank you for your article it is very useful and if you can help me with hp printer assistant so please also post the article https hp support assistant us disable hp support assistant policing isn t about public safety or anything of the sort it s about revenue extraction and yes they still want your money now more than ever as their opportunities for theft are decreasing these recent stories about pennsylvania are making me reconsider whether pennsylvania is the libertarian paradise that i d heard it was that she was completely cooperative i think that prosecution from my office of this may not be in the public interest fuck you people need to start to understand these state local municipal corporations are a foreign entity not a constitutional government of for and by the people the government is not us keep a no trespassing sign in your car if you get pulled over by the municipal corporation mercenaries looking to enrich themselves through revenue extortion put it on your window and refuse to lower your window which might subject you to a lethal disease from a potential carrier that is violating social distancing above all else don t ever leave home without a gun and be prepared to use it to defend your liberty 99 of the time these municipal terrorists are violating their oath of office exceeding their jurisdiction and acting outside their authority when ever they do this they are committing a felony and supreme court precedent tells us we may dispatch them at will in defense of our liberty the article says social distancing is needed to stop the spread of the virus but why do we want to stop the spread of the virus among the entire population how are we supposed to develop herd immunity if we continue with these extreme social distancing measures what we should be doing is imposing stay at home orders on the elderly and the medically ill but letting everyone else resume normal life since every statistic we have tells us that the overwhelming majority of covid 19 deaths at least 80 are among people aged 65 and above and among the medically ill in younger age groups how is this helping gives more power to the powers to be this sucks i rented a house in northern pa for several days for a bunch of reasons mainly to get out of the city which is always a great thing will i get pulled over once these troopers trace my ny
