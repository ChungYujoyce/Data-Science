klobuchar it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive then the president aposs trade war with china causes a rift among republicans we aposll discuss the impact of the president aposs tariffs are having on the economy and u s farmers with gop senator pat toomey plus joe biden d presidential candidate i aposm jill aposs husband cheers wallace joe biden now up double digits against bernie sanders in the latest fox news poll we aposll ask our sunday panel how solid his lead really is and our power player of the week one of america aposs greatest historians on his life aposs work robert a caro historian i feel unless i see it and really understand it i can apost make for you ph to see wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again today from the gym at stevens high school in claremont new hampshire home of the cardinals and tonight the site of our town hall with mayor pete buttigieg on fox news channel we came to new hampshire site of the first in the nation primary and just eight months to get a sense of where the democratic race for president stands at this point the field is 24 candidates deep with mayor pete rising in the polls in tonight aposs town hall new hampshire voters will get a chance to learn more about the mayor and will see how he responds to moves republicans made this week on abortion and immigration but first we want to talk about all of that with a candidate who aposs already had her fox town hall senator amy klobuchar joining us from the campaign trail across the state in nashua new hampshire for a fox news sunday sit down senator welcome back sen amy klobuchar d minn presidential candidate thanks chris it aposs great to be on wallace eight states now eight states have passed tight new restrictions on abortion that pro life groups have been pushing and as they say dramatically restrict rights of abortion alabama would ban abortions at any point except on matters of the extreme health of the woman my question is if the supreme court overturns roe v wade when you become president what would you do klobuchar if the supreme court overturns roe v wade i would make sure that we are codifying roe v wade into law but i think it aposs really important for the fox news viewers to understand exactly what aposs happening here these aren apost nuances anymore this is a case where the laws that they have passed in these states would actually make it so that no one could get an abortion and at the same time while we would reduce the number of abortions because of making contraception more available all over the country through planned parenthood and other ways they aposve also moved to defund planned parenthood so this is dangerous it is a place that we have never seen i think people have always warned that this could happen and it aposs actually happened and when i talk to people whether they are pro choice or they are personally opposed to abortion a lot of them chris don apost think we should go this direction seventy three percent of americans don apost want to overturn roe v wade you have a situation here where they would actually put doctors in prison 99 years that aposs what the alabama law says this is a law that they passed that would mean that if someone was raped if a college student was raped she wouldn apost have a choice in the pregnancy from a rape i don apost think the majority of americans are where the republicans are on this issue right now wallace but senator pro life advocates are pushing back there aposs a group called restoration pac and they are no running an ad on facebook that we are showing right now showing what it calls the party of death six democratic senators running for president including you who have opposed restrictions in the later stages of pregnancy you talk about the extreme as you call it on one side let me make the case and you can answer it on the other side because folks say that one of the concerns is that a number of democratic senators are not willing to see restrictions on late term abortions abortions after 24 weeks as we enter the third trimester now that aposs only 1 percent of all abortions in the country but even 1 percent is 6 000 abortions after 24 weeks when a fetus might well be viable are you ok with that klobuchar i aposm ok with the law chris and what the law says is that in that third trimester it is allowed to protect the health and the life of the mother but that aposs not what the president said chris the president misled the american public what he said at a rally was basically a doctor would be holding a baby and kill that baby that aposs illegal under the law that is already a crime i know this i aposm a former prosecutor wallace forgive me senator klobuchar no i think crosstalk wallace are you ok let me ask you i understand that the argument against infanticide and that aposs an overstatement what i aposm asking you is are you ok with abortions after 24 weeks klobuchar to protect the life and the health of the mother that is exactly what the supreme court ruling says and i am ok with that but i just think it aposs really important chris for your fox viewers to know because there aposs so much misinformation out there that what these laws do is extreme there are a number of republicans who said they are opposed to them they are extreme then you have the president misleading the public and telling them that this is about basically killing a baby after a baby is born that is not what this is about that is a crime so i think what people have to understand here is that we are at a point where a number it is not just alabama this has happened in ohio this has happened in missouri this happened in georgia wallace right klobuchar there aposs a law that aposs being passed in michigan that the democratic governor is going to veto this is happening across the country and people need to know what aposs really going on here this is a violation of civil rights wallace attorney general barr sat down with our bill hammer earlier this week and he said he could understand why president trump has called the russia probe a witch hunt a hoax because he says president trump felt that he was falsely accused and the mueller report seemed to back them up and then he also said that he intends to drill down on how the fbi and the intel agencies handled the probe here is the attorney general begin video clip william barr attorney general i thought when i came in from outside that all the questions that i had many other people had that it would be readily answered once i got in but i haven apost found that to be the case end video clip wallace aren apost there legitimate reasons to investigate the investigators senator klobuchar i don apost think there are and this really bothers me because we have in front of us two things one of them is to get to the truth of what happened here and we are simply trying to get director mueller in front of us so we can find out i remind you this investigation was started under a republican attorney general with a former republican appointed u s attorney rod rosenstein with a former republican appointed fbi director that aposs where we were they started investigation because of legitimate news that there were people from the trump campaign talking to others about russia and exchanging information we know that ok the second thing though that is most disturbing to me is we have something right in front of us the current fbi director and the current director of intelligence have told us that russia is getting bolder that what we aposve just seen was a dress rehearsal and yet any attempt that i aposve made with the secure elections act which is a bill that i have with conservative senator lankford that basically would say let aposs get some back up paper ballots let aposs get some audits in place so we cannot allow a foreign power to invade our election again they didn apost do it with tanks or missiles they did it with a cyber attack they have stopped them in their tracks the white house made calls to stop that bill despite strong republican support for the bill so that is what aposs right in front of us and barr is off talking about whatever he wants to talk about politically but what he should be doing is to protect the integrity of our elections and our democracy wallace as you know new hampshire where we both are although in different parts of the state is among the five states with the highest rate of opioid related deaths in the country twice the national average you have released a hundred billion dollar 10 year plan to deal with mental health and substance abuse you know they all sound roughly the same prevention treatment recovery so i guess i want to ask you just focus on one thing one thing that you think that makes her plan dramatically different from all the other democratic plans to deal with this problem klobuchar this is an issue that no presidential candidate has taken on really in history and i would emphasize here the mental health aspect of it one in five americans have problems with mental health for me the mental health addiction issue comes from my heart my dad struggled with alcoholism his whole life had two dwis and then a third right before i got married and at that point in the apos90s he was facing either jail or treatment he chose treatment and in his words he was pursued by grace and i think every american has that right to be pursued by grace and what i aposve done here is layout a thorough plan so we have beds for people who have extreme problems with mental illness so that we have counselors for people to talk to we aposve had a 30 percent increase in suicides including farmers including veterans including students in this country in 15 years and chris the other thing that aposs unique about my plan is i show how i aposm going to pay for it i figure if you aposre running for president you better be addressing real problems with real solutions and show how you aposre going to pay for it i would pay for it by taking on the pharma companies that got a bunch of people addicted to begin with and you can do it simply with a fee a per milligram fee on the opioids that are being sold and then there aposs going to be a major master settlement with those companies that profited off of people aposs addictions that got people hooked and that aposs where you get the hundred billion dollars wallace i aposve got about three minutes left i want to get to two more subjects with you one of them is immigration klobuchar ok wallace the president proposed a new plan this week that emphasizes merit skills education over family ties here aposs how the president described it begin video clip donald trump president we discriminate against genius we discriminate against brilliance we won apost anymore once we get this passed end video clip wallace now canada and australia have merit based systems why shouldn apost the u s klobuchar you know you can do both you can have some people coming in and that get degrees here on merit but i think you also have to have people that maybe don apost have those degrees and i aposm talking here about what we need workers right now in our fields in our factories we have openings in our nursing homes we don apost have enough labor and some of our states for those kinds of jobs as well and so what bothers me about the president aposs plan is the fact that he doesn apost deal with the dreamers he doesn apost deal with the millions of people who came here with no fault of their own he doesn apost deal with the 10 million people that are here now many of whom would like to see if they follow the law learn english they want to be on a path to citizenship and a lot of our republican colleagues people like wallace right klobuchar mike rounds of south dakota and johnny isakson of georgia they joined with democrats to take this on so i feel like the president has carved out one niche here instead of dealing with the overall comprehensive immigration issue that as president that aposs what i would do wallace senator i want to talk a little 2020 politics in the time we have left and i want to put up the real clear politics average of the latest polls in iowa you aposre in eighth place with 3 percent support and here in new hampshire you aposre also in eighth place with 1 1 2 percent support i understand that it aposs very early we are still months away from people voting their in new hampshire i guess the question i have is why do you think you have not gained as much traction so far in the campaign as other candidates for instance mayor pete who aposs going to be here for the town hall this evening klobuchar oh chris i think being in the top ten in a 25 person race when you aposre from the middle of a country in a state that aposs not so big at some of my colleagues i think that aposs pretty good and i wouldn apost count me out everything i aposve done in my life whether it aposs taking on 48 hour hospital stay for new moms and babies when people didn apost think i could get that done i got it done or when i was the first woman to run for d a in my state of the biggest county i got it done in the next time around no one even ran against me then i go run for u s senate running against the congressman and win big time i am someone that takes on challenges and finds a way to get there no one thought i could raise money when i was running for senate i finally just called everyone i know in my life and i raised an all time senate record wallace right klobuchar 17 000 from ex boyfriends and as my husband has pointed out it aposs not an expanding base i will find a way to win no one thought a peanut farmer from georgia was going to win jimmy carter aposs pointed out to me that he had less support at this point than i do no one thought a guy wallace senator klobuchar named barack obama could become president this is you know politics chris wallace senator klobuchar klobuchar it is a long road wallace it aposs forever listen i but it is a snapshot of where we are at this point i aposm certainly not counting out that aposs why you aposre here for the fox news sunday sit down thank you thanks for taking time for the campaign trail klobuchar thank you wallace always good to talk with you klobuchar thanks wallace up next we will bring in our sunday group to discuss the growing 2020 field and a front runner who keeps building his lead plus what would you like to ask the panel about alabama aposs strict new abortion law just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air as fox news sunday reports live from stevens high school in claremont new hampshire commercial break begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate if the american people want a president to outdoor division lead with a clenched fist enclosed hand a hard heart to demonize your opponents to spew hatred they don apost need me they aposve got president donald trump end video clip wallace 2020 democratic front runner joe biden at the formal kick off of his campaign for president yesterday in philadelphia and it aposs time now for our sunday group the cofounder of the federalist ben domenech julie pace washington bureau chief of the associated press katie pavlich of townhall com who says that this is gymnasium reminds her of her day as a high school basketball star and mo elleithee georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service well welcome all and thank you all for coming up here at claremont to keep me company and answer my questions joe biden officially opened his campaign today although it seems that he aposs been campaigning for a few weeks and he really has done remarkably well let aposs put up the latest average of national polls biden up to 39 percent sanders down to 16 percent and everyone else in the single digits mo why do you think that biden has had such a good rollout so far and how solid do you think his lead is mo elleithee georgetown university institute of politics and public service so i think a couple of things one i think democrats care about electability and i think joe biden sort of projects an electability argument well number two i think democrats like a lot of people in the country are looking for an authentic champion and joe biden when he aposs out there on the stump projects authenticity and that he can be a real champion for folks i think ultimately the reason he aposs doing well and others are sliding probably at this point has more to do with his name id than anything else but others are going to have to start moving in the right direction if they aposre going to catch up to him he aposs looking really really strong wallace ben how strong do you think i mean obviously he aposs looking really strong right now but as senator klobuchar pointed out as an inaudible we even haven apost had the first debates yet any doubts about biden aposs staying power ben domenech the federalist i think the only question that really you know emerges around biden is how much his lengthy history of previous decisions and policy positions is going to be a problem for him in a field that has a lot of new faces to it you know democrats traditionally tend to like these new faces inspirational figures to come along you aposre obviously going to have mayor pete you know tonight to be one of those figures i think the problem for biden is going to be navigating all of the different previous decisions and positions that he aposs had but i think that he also has a lot of built in advantages not just name id but i think his advantage among african american voters particularly in the south is going to be a real strong point for him and everybody else has to figure out what kind of lane exists to take on biden and the best way to critique them wallace perhaps the biggest political development so far this year and certainly this week has been that now eight states have passed very restrictive laws on abortion alabama leading the way with the most restrictive law which would only allow an exception not for rape or incest but only to prevent a serious health risk to the woman and here was the back and forth among alabama lawmakers begin video clip bobby singleton d alabama senate minority leader i apologize to the women of alabama for this arcane law that we passed terri collins r alabama state congresswoman is that baby in a womb a person in alabama law it aposs a person end video clip wallace we asked her for questions for the panel and on alabama aposs new law we got this on twitter from ray kitchens why would they make no exceptions to rape and incest katie how do you answer ray and how do you respond to the whole fact that this has become such a hot issue katie pavlich contributor well of course abortion is always a hot issue but to answer the question if you are intellectually and morally consistent in your belief that life starts at conception you then have a very hard time justifying any kind of exception for people who are conceived in rape and there have been a number of people whose parents or who themselves were conceived in rape this week who are adding to the conversation and saying why are we valued less because of the way that we were conceived now when it comes to the abortion issue this is something that a number of states have passed the accusation has been that republican men are trying to control women aposs bodies when the alabama governor is a woman there aposs a democrat in louisiana the governor there who aposs willing to sign up similar piece of legislation and this is something that aposs been going on as a debate topic for 30 years and for good reason the pro life movement has a choice to make here take it or the courts in hopes that it gets to the supreme court in hopes that roe v wade gets overturned but there aposs also a way that they aposve done this tactically over the past couple of decades in the sense of changing people aposs public opinion based on the new science and technology that we have rather than going through the court system so it aposs a twofold issue it aposs always a hot topic amy klobuchar couldn apost answer your question about how she feels about late term abortion not just for the health of the mother but elective late term abortion and that aposs a question that democrats are going to have to answer on the campaign trail wallace president trump has been surprisingly quiet on this all week until yesterday afternoon when he put up this week i am strongly pro life with the three exceptions rape incest and protecting the life of the mother the same position taken by ronald reagan but as we aposve noted some of the new laws especially alabama but other laws as well do not make exception for rape and incest julie i hate to reduce this to politics but obviously it is a hot political issue how does the white house political operation feel about this drive and particularly if women come to feel that roe the 1973 ruling that allowed a woman aposs right to an abortion stated it might conceivably be under threat julie pace the associated press i heard two different arguments from republicans this week one for people who think politically and again we will have to talk about this in a political space who think politically that this aposll be good for republicans it does energize a portion of the republican base a portion of the republican base that has been very strongly supportive of trump for one reason which is that they believe is going to put judges on the courts and he now is a track record of doing so who will try to overturn roe but the second piece of it i heard this from a lot of republicans is that they are worried about what this does to their support with women 2018 midterms republicans lost significantly with women in suburban areas it aposs one of the reasons that republicans lost the house and there aposs a concern that if the party is seen as rallying around these state laws cheering them on through the courts that that will have a detrimental impact on trump and other republicans in 2020 wallace i want to pick up on that because i aposve always thought that as the issues stood right now where there was a right to an abortion that the whole issue energized the pro life side more than the pro choice side but if you get these laws and if there aposs a chance that they might go up the court system and get to the supreme court and people begin to perceive that roe is under threat does that change domenech you know with the exception of john bel edwards of louisiana the fact is we had a great cultural sort on this issue the parties are truly divided on them the number of pro life democrats in any significant office can be counted on one hand and i think that to a certain extent driving the base and both sides on this issue serves both parties interest i mean the fact is the president not just the court apartments but his rulings on title x his rulings on other aspects of issues that pro life americans care about have been consistently putting him you know in rewarding them for backing him in 2016 i think this is meant to serve as a reminder of where things are and frankly going back to someone like mayor pete he came out this week for repeal of the hyde amendment saying that he wants to actually take taxpayer funding expended on abortions and that sort of situation i aposm not sure that this actually moves that needle that much i think the people have basically made up their mind wallace all right panel thank you we aposll see you all a little later up next manufacturers and farmers are feeling the brunt of the president aposs trade war with china we aposll talk with republican senator pat toomey about the rift it aposs causing inside the gop as fox news sunday reports ahead of tonight aposs town hall with mayor pete buttigieg who recently bragged about his appearance on this show appearing on late night tv begin video clip jimmy fallon comedian is a true you hooked up with fox news at the start of your campaign because some might say that makes you a naughty boy mayor pete buttigieg d presidential candidate actually i aposm proud to say that i was the first candidate to appear on fox news sunday because i don apost believe in leaving out an entire portion of the country end video clip commercial break wallace coming up president trump boasts about his latest round of tariffs on chinese goods begin video clip trump i think it aposs going to be i think it aposs going to turn out extremely well we are in a strong position end video clip wallace we aposll ask republican senator pat toomey why he calls it bad policy next on fox news sunday commercial break wallace the president aposs ongoing trade war with china is creating a growing divide in the gop member of the many of the businesses feeling the effects are in states mr trump won in 2016 and are represented by republican senators one of those is senator pat toomey a leading member of the senate finance committee who joins us now from bethlehem pennsylvania senator our trade war with china escalated this week president trump put the chinese telecom company huawei on a business blacklist and china cut its orders for u s pork and chinese state media became more nationalistic here aposs what the president had to say about all this begin video clip donald trump president we aposre having a little squabble with china because we aposve been treated very unfairly for many many decades for actually a long time and it should have been handled a long time ago and it wasn apost and we aposll handle it now end video clip wallace senator how worried are you about the escalating trade war with china sen pat toomey r penn chris thanks for having me listen i put china in a distinct category separate from the rest of the entire world and to do that because of the facts in the case right china aposs the world aposs second biggest economy it aposs a revisionist power it aposs now for the first time attempting to be able to project force it aposs intimidating neighbors it aposs disrupting american institutions and it aposs engaged in some egregious economic behavior the theft of intellectual property in various ways so i actually think the president is right to challenge china this agreement if we reach one won apost solve all of those problems and the tariffs are absolutely painful and dislocating but if in the end we end up with an agreement that gives us a meaningful reform of china aposs most egregious behavior we might look back and say this was worth the price that we aposre paying i look at 232 ph tariffs and tariffs on europeans and canadians and mexicans in a very different way wallace it but but those aren apost national security tariffs right toomey that that aposs correct that aposs right and i put those in a very different category but i think the president is right to challenge china and to think about this in the broader context such as what vice president pence laid out in a famous speech where he made the case of how aggressive china has been wallace now farmers are among the the the folks that have been the hardest hit so far by the u s tariffs and the response from the chinese but the white house says well they aposve got a plan and they aposre talking about up to 20 billion as a bailout to farmers here aposs the president aposs message that he sent to farmers this week begin video clip trump they aposll be planting they aposll be able to sell for less and they aposll make the same kind of money until such time as it aposs all straightened out end video clip wallace but you call this plan quote your words very bad policy why toomey yes i think it aposs bad policy to you know start to just sending checks to to farmers or any segment of the economy what i think we ought to be doing is working with allies working with friendly countries finding more markets opening up more markets taking down trade barriers and creating an opportunity for our farmers to sell their products around the world rather than sending them a check from taxpayers wallace generally speaking it aposs fair to say you aposre a free trader you were a former president of the club for growth what are your thoughts about the president aposs trade policy and his willingness in an effort to try to and he says that to try to bring down tariffs to raise tariffs at least in the short term which sometimes goes on for a while toomey yes so the way i look at tariffs they are a tax on the american people they can only be justified if they are and means to an end in the case of china i think we might be pursuing the right end i think in the case of canada and mexico for instance on steel and aluminum we were not pursuing the right end i think the changes that the administration has made to nafta actually diminish nafta as a as a driver of economic growth and prosperity i think it would be a huge mistake to impose taxes on the auto imports for instance from europe and asia i think that would be a huge cost to consumers without a good objective so you know i aposm going to continue to push back on the use of national security as a justification for imposing taxes on americans when they choose to purchase products from our neighbors and allies and friends wallace let me turn subjects with you president trump proposed a dramatic new immigration reform plan this week and for legal immigration i want to talk to you about that currently 12 percent of green cards are based on skills and 66 percent are based on family the president would flip that to 57 percent based on skills and 33 percent based on family as the grandson of irish immigrants how do you feel about this the president aposs proposal for this new system toomey so it aposs mixed i think this is so i aposm very much open to expanding legal immigration i think people who come to this country wanting to build a better life for themselves and their families they contribute to america they help to build this country just as my relatively uneducated and penniless grandparents did when they came here so i aposm open to more legal immigration i think the president aposs right in his insights that i you know people who come with a lot of human capital intellectual capital education these people contribute to our country enormously it aposs a no brainer to allow people who come here the best and brightest from around the world come to our colleges get a great education and then we ship them out so that they can compete against us rather than welcoming us ph so i fully embrace the idea that these people with greater skills and education and knowledge should be welcomed but i think people with lower skills can contribute as well so i aposd be open to expanding that category as well wallace i want to ask you another question on immigration the department of homeland security says the overcrowding and there aposs no question there is on the border in texas between mexico and texas has gotten so severe that it has started flying illegal immigrants to san diego to hold them there to process there and conceivably to release them there there were also going to do that in florida but there was such a backlash including from a republican governor of florida that they stop that but apparently dhs is considering continuing this how do you feel about the idea of shipping people in this country illegally all over the country toomey well chris it aposs a symptom of a complete full blown crisis that we have at our border they are swamped they are overwhelmed the numbers have been staggering we aposve got a humanitarian crisis and a security crisis so we need to respond to that we need better border security we need to we aposre we are building and we need to build physical barriers walls it we need more personnel we need more surveillance and we also need the ability to adjudicate these huge numbers of people who came come here they asked for asylum they have very very little case to be made for granting an asylum but we aposre encumbered by having inadequate resources to adjudicate those those claims those requests that aposs a big part of it we aposve got to change our laws that are driving people our america aposs a magnet if you come there with a child you aposre almost guaranteed to get in wallace but but let me if i may if i may because we aposre running out of time toomey yes wallace senator just just a cut to the chase here because we aposre running out of time how would you feel if dhs shipped several hundred migrants to pennsylvania toomey yes we actually do house some migrant families and that aposs you know a temporary arrangement that is made necessary by the crisis on the border i aposd like to fix the crisis so that that aposs not necessary wallace ok let aposs one last subject i want to talk to about and that aposs iran over the last week the president has taken a number of measures he aposs ordered a carrier strike group to the persian gulf we aposre sending long range bombers there the pentagon at least considered a proposal to send 120 000 u s troops to the middle east i really two questions one do you understand what aposs going on with u s policy in iran and how do you feel about as you do if you do understand it what the president aposs policy is toomey i think i do chris i took the time to go down to the secured briefing room and read the intelligence reports last week i aposm looking forward to the full briefing to all senators on tuesday on the intelligence we have i can apost comment on that but let me simply say this if you read a report about a potentially imminent threat to american personnel and american assets originating from the iranian regime i think you should take that report very seriously let aposs remember who we aposre talking about this is the regime that systematically designed manufactured and distributed the iad aposs that were designed to penetrate armored vehicles and kill american soldiers in iraq and they did in large numbers i think the president is right to try to deter the iranians from a foolish and dangerous attack on american personnel or our assets and i think that aposs the strategy right now demonstrate with a show a powerful force that this would be a really bad idea for the iranians to pursue and hopefully deter a really tragic and disastrous decision by the iranians wallace senator toomey thank you thanks for sharing your weekend with us please come back sir toomey thanks for having me wallace up next democrats call president trump aposs new immigration plan dead on arrival but is the real purpose as a campaign weapon for 2020 our fox news sunday panel returns live here in new hampshire that aposs next commercial break begin video clip trump we aposll see what happens with iran if they do anything it will be a very bad mistake they put out so many false messages that iran is totally confused i don apost know that might be a good thing end video clip wallace president trump talking tough about iran on monday but by the end of the week blaming the media for the chatter about war and we aposre back now with the panel well ben help us sort this out because in the beginning of the week there were some dramatic moves the president took as i talked about with senator toomey carrying a carrier strike force long range bombers talk about 120 000 troops by the end of the week the president put out the word that he had told his acting defense secretary i don apost want to get into a war ben domenech the federalist yes wallace what aposs going on domenech i think that the president is totally fine with rattling the sword here and there when it comes to confrontations with other nations around the world but he has very much been opposed to any kind of significant involvement in the middle east he internally has sent that message in a lot of different ways i think one of the things that was happening this time is that as with so many things that go around this administration people were having the argument in public there were sort of pushing the story to various different outlets and i think that he saw that playing out and wanted to come down at the end of the week and sort of send a message to his supporters many of whom are very much opposed to getting involved in what he calls another stupid war and say look i aposm still in charge and we aposre not going in there this as much as the stuff has played out in the public square pushed by various people within the admin i aposm still in charge and i don apost want this to happen wallace julie i want to pick up on precisely that as our white house watcher here how much of the split is there within the white house or within the administration especially for instance between the president and his national security advisor john bolton who aposs very hawkish on iran and it does seem to for all of the talk that the president and the saber rattling that he really does not want to get involved in another foreign conflict julie pace the associated press he he doesn apost want to get involved in another conflict there is a split certainly in administration on foreign policy broadly but but specifically on iran someone like a john bolton is incredibly hawkish he sees iran as you know the central negative force in global affairs right now and he believes that the united states has to play a role in trying to to counter iran and he is more comfortable than others in the administration about looking at military options on that front this dates back to his early days in the administration where he was pushing the pentagon to put forward proposals for large scale military action there but the president looks at this i think from from from a political lens mostly you know he campaigned as much as he campaigned on immigration he also campaigned as being a president who would pull the united states out of foreign entanglements in the middle east and would not go back and so when he sees that some of his own advisors are out there suggesting that kind of action or asking the pentagon for plans he really recoils at it and he he made a point by the end of the week to make clear that even if john bolton is out there mike pompeo is out there talking very hawkishly you know he that aposs not coming from him wallace do you think either of them are in trouble pace i don apost think either of them are in trouble i think trump is very you know trump is interesting in these situations because he actually doesn apost mind splits within his administration he doesn apost love when wallace there aposs a certain kind of good cop bad cop quality to it pace absolutely absolutely what what he doesn apost like is the idea that it looks like his advisors are pushing him beyond what he wants to be wallace all right let aposs turn to immigration because the president did propose a new merit based immigration plan which got real pushback from democrats and even some from republicans especially because it didn apost lower pat toomey aposs a little bit of an exception a lot of republicans would like to see fewer legal immigrants come into the country as well here aposs the president indicating that he doesn apost expect this to become law anytime soon take a look begin video clip trump if for some reason possibly political we can apost get the democrats to approve this merit based high security plan then we will get it approved immediately after the election when we take back the house keep the senate and of course hold the presidency end video clip wallace katy if this is really more about 2020 than any realistic chance of getting this past before next year in this congress with a democratic house why do you think the president felt the need to put it out do you think he feels a need to shore up his position on immigration katie pavlich contributor i think that the white house has been looking for different ways to deal with the current illegal immigration crisis on the border the problem with the asylum laws and also looking at the entire system and saying we haven apost had immigration reform on the legal side since the 1960s the focus is always on trying to find a solution for people who came to the country illegally rather than trying to find a solution for people who want to come to the country in a legal fashion and be part of the american society in terms of becoming citizens and learning the language and advocating for the country in terms of economics but when it comes to the politics of this it aposs on president trump aposs side because you have people asking about well why isn apost daca in this deal well they can then say we aposve offered daca in a number of other deals with democrats they aposve said no to that and the fact is that legal immigration in this country needs to be reformed regardless of whether we passed daca right now we want to make it easier for anybody to come to the country not just people who have family ties here in terms of non immediate family they aposre still focused on getting immediate family members into the country wallace mo i mean one of the things that were striking as there was no outreach to democrats at all about this bill and they have already declared it dead on arrival in this congress but is it good politics for the president to be able to say it aposs not just that i aposm against illegal immigration here are some things that i aposm for mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public service i think it aposs necessary politics for him to change the conversation as it aposs being had around immigration you know we did a poll at our institute not long ago that showed while the american people support his approach to the economy when it comes to immigration they actually support congressional democrats over his approach this is supposed to be his signature issue and and it isn apost playing out electorally politically for him the way he aposd like beyond his base so i think what you aposre seeing here is the president and his team trying to change the conversation a bit he aposs never going to walk away from the wall he aposs never going to walk away from from his signature you know approach to border security because that aposs his bread and butter with his base but i think his team recognizes that politically they have to figure out a different way to do it i aposm not sure this is it pavlich well and that aposs still in the plan i mean that aposs half of this plan border security is half of the plan that they aposve introduced it aposs not just inaudible elleithee and i aposm not saying he should walk away from it pavlich right elleithee right i aposm totally right but i think he has recognized and his team has recognized he has to start talking about this a little bit differently wallace when you when you talk look at polls i understand the wall and cracking down on illegal immigration plays dynamite with his base but when you look at polls the american people are much more open for instance to a pathway to citizenship somewhere down the line elleithee right right and right exactly that people are that aposs sort of the hardline you know approach that he has been taking is not where people are beyond his base and so i think he aposs trying to look for a way to open up a conversation this may not be it right as we aposre seeing he aposs running to resistance even amongst some people in his own party on the hill but but i do think he aposs recognized that what he aposs been doing is not going to work for him politically inaudible domenech this is all this is all about 2020 this is about laying down a marker right now so that he can use it in that context say i have put forward an immigration plan and use it against who whichever democrat emerges from this gigantic field pace one of the great frustrations among republicans wallace you know what save that thought pace oh no wallace we aposll talk about that later thank you panel see you next sunday pavlich thank you wallace up next because nobody aposs going to want to miss this our power player of the week a biographer who has captured the essence of power how to get it and use it in his award winning books on lbj commercial break wallace he aposs one of america aposs greatest biographers the winner of two pulitzer prizes but he aposs taken a break from his life aposs work to write about how he does that work and loyal followers are freaking out here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape wallace you must know that this is giving a lot of people heartburn robert caro pulitzer prize winning biographer yes i do if you want to know the truth it aposs heartwarming that so many people are worried that i won apost finish wallace voice over robert caro has spent more than half his life telling the story of lyndon johnson four books some 3 400 pages but he aposs only up to 1964 not yet to vietnam which is why when he took a detour to write working it caused well heartburn caro i want people to have some idea of what it is i do how it is to research this type of book wallace caro fans may not be happy he took time from finishing the story of lbj but it is fascinating to learn how he goes about his masterwork caro says he learned about research from his editor at newsday ph back in the apos60s caro this guy looks up at me and he says just remember turn every page never assume anything turn every page wallace it aposs advice he aposs followed researching lyndon johnson wallace on camera you walk into the lbj presidential library and when you look up at the documents section what do you see caro you see you know at that time 32 million documents you they had 40 000 boxes each of these boxes holds about 800 pages that aposs the only time i felt like turning around and going home wallace voice over caro says he has one big rule when interviewing wallace on camera your notebooks are filled with a notation su caro yes wallace what does that mean caro shut up people have a desire a need to fill in silences if you could just make yourself shut up often they aposll tell you what you want to know wallace voice over then there is writing caro remembers what a professor at princeton told him caro you aposre never going to achieve what you want to achieve mr caro unless you stop thinking with her fingers i knew exactly what he meant it was so easy for me to write that i didn apost think things through wallace which brings us back to his final book on lbj which is about a third written caro took us into his offense caro this is the outline of the rest of my last volume from here to there to the end of the book over there wallace he writes several drafts in longhand again to slow himself down caro after i aposve done a number of drafts i go to the typewriter and i do a lot of drafts on the typewriter then it goes into this box and the box goes to my typist wallace when i talked with caro about his last lbj book he said it would take three or four years to finish the final volume that was seven years ago and he aposs now 83 wallace on camera are you really going to vietnam caro yes wallace why caro i feel unless i see it and really understand it i can apost make the reader see it wallace if you should be unable for whatever reason to finish the book have you made provisions for somebody else caro no i aposve made provisions that nobody else can finish my book nobody is going to publish anything with my name on it that i didn apost write not a word wallace voice over but caro is determined to finish the story of lyndon johnson down to the last word on a smith corona electra 210 wallace on camera how many typewriters do you have caro i have at this moment 11 yes wallace and will that get you through the end of it caro i aposm worried end videotape wallace caro has tried to take care of everything he uses old fashion
