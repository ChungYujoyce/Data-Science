apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the future of powerby joseph s nye jr publicaffairs 27 99 300 pages the united states is the world s most powerful nation yet washington is finding it harder than ever to achieve its ends consider libya where a campaign that was supposed to last just days is turning into a stalemate that could last weeks or months so much for being a superpower top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century american policymakers like to talk about smart power as if the meaning was self evident helping us understand what power is and how it is best used is joseph s nye of harvard university s john f kennedy school of government he attempts to answer the question how will power work and how is it changing in the twenty first century the topic is made more important by the increasing challenge to american dominance mr nye points out that the united states continues to stand tall compared to its competitors he writes for all the fashionable predictions of china india or brazil surpassing the united states in the next decades the greater threats may come from modern barbarians and nonstate actors that s obviously a controversial topic but the future of power is more analytical than ideological however one sees the future balance of power mr nye helps readers understand what power is most people understand power even if it is hard to define and even harder to measure at its simplest power is the ability to get what we want but that phrase encompasses much mr nye writes a policy oriented concept of power depends upon a specified context to tell us who gets what how where and when resources matter the soviet union s power always was constrained by its economic weakness but notes mr nye power conversion getting from resources to behavioral outcomes is a crucial intervening interval mr nye s writing style is accessible even when his subject grows more complex he is serious about plumbing the complexities of power for instance he writes about relational power which he believes comes in three forms commanding another party to change controlling another party s agenda and shaping another party s preferences recent reliance on military action emphasizes the first of these but the other two can be more effective at much lower cost to maximize power one should utilize all three forms of power also differ nevertheless military economic and soft power can reinforce one another of the first writes mr nye noncoercive and benign uses of military resources can be an important source of the soft power behavior of framing of agendas persuasion and attraction in world politics soft power still draws the most skeptics but mr nye persuasively argues that it matters indeed he asserts soft power has often had very real effects in history including on the movement of armies the ability to persuade another nation to fight on one s behalf is almost the same as possessing the other country s military resources europe has been doing this to america for decades who exercises power also matters governments are the traditional force in international relations but nongovernmental organizations are playing an increasingly important role individuals also matter the internet has created an important new tool still the internet alone has not transformed international relations among states rather mr nye explains while leaving governments the strongest actors the cyberdomain is likely to see an increase in the diffusion of power to nonstate actors and network centrality as a key dimension of power in the twenty first century the most interesting part of the book is mr nye s assessment of america s potential decline and who stands to benefit he makes a good case for some day but not yet the united states faces significant challenges but no other power is yet ready to thrust washington aside his assessment of china offers a welcome antidote to the assumptions of many that beijing is just a few years away from surpassing america economically china s growth is likely to slow even when china gains a bigger economy american per capita income will remain well above that of china s mr nye writes china is a long way from posing the kind of challenge to american preponderance that the kaiser s germany posed when it passed britain at the beginning of the last century nevertheless the united states is going to find it harder to get what it wants in the future especially through military action mr nye proposes a policy of smart power which he thinks of as a synthesis of liberalism and realism such an approach sounds good but the devil remains in the details using smart power to advance stupid policies is not smart indeed president obama appears to think that he is mixing liberalism and realism with his decision to intervene in the libyan civil war already america s next geopolitical train wreck is in sight still the future of power is a helpful primer to better understand the tools available to those formulating america s foreign policy they just need to remember that adopting smart policies is even more important than using smart power doug bandow a senior
