siphoning power from washington elites and giving it back to the people at the 100 day mark they have barely made a dent they have passed bills to revamp campaigns to tighten gun controls and to

mentioning a bill to block president trump s border wall emergency declaration did clear both chambers but the house was unable to override the president s veto house speaker nancy pelosi said she and her team should get a bit of a pass given the headwinds they faced when they claimed the majority jan 3 you have to remember our first few weeks for these 100 days we were in the midst of a government shutdown she told reporters this month even with that i m very proud of the record we ve had for the people on the initiatives that we said we were going to work on where democrats have made a major start is on the investigative front they have issued document requests and voted to approve subpoenas across the span of mr trump s relatives associates and business empire while laying the groundwork for possible impeachment proceedings or at the least providing fodder for democrats 2020 campaign to unseat mr trump those efforts are unlikely to put another dollar in americans pockets rep david n cicilline of rhode island a member of the judiciary committee told reporters at the house democrats issues conference that his party has to balance its focus between legislation and investigations even as they look to gain the president s support on major issues i don t think we have a choice but to do both he said i think there s a way that you can conduct oversight that may be less threatening and uses less bombastic rhetoric but i think the fundamental work needs to be done as they wrapped up their annual retreat democrats pushed a clear message they are unified and open to

110 house bills through her chamber by the beginning of april this year that total was 92 perhaps even more striking just 28 percent of those bills came up through the committee process compared with 74 percent in 2007 using the committees rather than writing bills at the leadership level was one of the democrats major promises so much for the people s house mr mccarthy said on the house floor it
