in unauthorized assembly and inciting other protesters to do the same both have been released on bail hong kong police have also denied organizers permission to hold a march planned for saturday the two 22 year olds are leaders of demosisto an organization that backs greater autonomy and self government for hong kong wong serves as secretary general while chow is on the standing committee wong first entered protest politics during hong kong s umbrella movement of 2014 those roughly three months of demonstrations called for giving the semi autonomous chinese city s residents the right to elect their chief executive directly without the communist party pre screening the candidates currently citizens elect the chief executive but have no options aside from candidates who have earned beijing s stamp of approval the current round of protests was set off by a bill introduced in early june and suspended shortly thereafter that would have allowed hong kong to extradite accused criminals to both taiwan and mainland china while the marchers are glad the legislation was suspended they want it fully pulled and they have broader demands too the chief executive of hong kong should be elected by hong kong s people instead of picked by beijing wong tells reason we urge the government to terminate the bill stop police brutality and respond to our calls for free elections though hong kong is technically a part of china it operates under a one country two systems policy that allows hongkongers to enjoy basic democratic norms and due process in 2047 though hong kong s quasi independent government will be dissolved and it will become fully absorbed into mainland china the protesters fear china is speeding up this timeline one country two systems has already eroded says wong it s one country one and a half systems he adds that mainland chinese people also deserve democracy tensions between the protesters and the authorities have escalated in recent weeks in mid august police beat up community organizers and shot a woman in the eye with a non lethal bean bag round days later airport protesters attacked some men they believed to be undercover chinese infiltrators their suspicions turned out to be right one was a cop from shenzhen the other a reporter for state owned media about a week after that chinese authorities disappeared a staffer at the british consulate in hong kong the washington post reports that police have arrested more than 800 people in connection with the protests over the past few months i was really shocked by the threat of police to us people on the fifth of august the day we had the general strike wong says i joined the assembly outside of the government headquarters and a sniper from the riot police fired tear gas from 40 floors up wong says police have fired more than 2 000 tear gas shells over the course of the protests now the cops are cracking down on protesters ability to assemble in public places the associated press reports the organizers of saturday s march the fifth anniversary of a decision by china against allowing fully democratic elections for the leader of hong kong said they were calling it off after an appeals board denied permission it was unclear whether some protesters would still demonstrate on their own the police commander of hong kong island kwok pak chung appealed to people to stay away from any non authorized rallies warning that those caught could face a five year jail term in the past five years wong says activists were jailed lawmakers were kicked out of office foreign correspondents were expelled from hong kong and book publishers were kidnapped to china it s not only saying that hong kong is a place far away from democracy it s also saying that hong kong is a place without basic political and economic freedom advertisement next is the surgeon general right about the risks of marijuana use during pregnancy liz wolfe is a staff editor at reason show

president drumpf has waged a draconian war on immigration even building concentration camps in which people are literally forced to drink from toilets moreover drumpf is also a theocratic extremist don t let the much younger former model wife fool you who is turning this country into the handmaid s tale i ve enjoyed your parody for some time now but you really really need a new schtick a more creative outlet for your talent it is clearly being wasted on endless references to handmaid s tale and when amy barrett is nominated to take ginsberg s place on the sc in a few weeks do you suppose the protesters are going to show up in those outfits again rbg will retire after 2021 when a democrat is back in the white house s g s s s s x y m 80 13000 s y s s pop over to this website read more the don will attend her funeral we can hope your case of tds is fatal the media was covering for rbg s 3 weeks of chemo radiation treatment for a new cancer there is no way that they can keep rbg from rotting for the entirety of trump s next 5 5 years in office trump s next 5 5 years in office lol the don is as good as in only michelle obama has a chance against him if they can keep her hidden until the last minute open borders i see you have the iq of a houseplant name one country with open borders that is not a crap hole even canada controls their immigration and only wants those with job skills or an education your opinion is about as low information and ignorant as is humanly possible i shudder to think just what kind of sh t job you work probably retail or service he s a parody account even if that s true i bet drumpf s america is worse you do really you belive this drivel you realize that if trump were worse than the geriatric authoritarian bastards that misgovern china the government response to antifa would involve automatic weapons fire don t you trump is worse that a he s worse than b he s literally hitler do you actually expect to convince anybody want trump out of office make sure the democrat party nominates somebody who isn t dumb as a post arguably criminal or batshit crazy because compared to granny maojackets von pantsuit or any of the current batch of clowns trump looks like calvin coolidge maybe not the best choice but good enough to be going on with watch out for miz michelle as the pinko chinko s call her even if that s true according to heritage foundation hong kongers have more economic freedom than anyone else in the world i bet drumpf s america is worse only if you haven t developed a taste for toilet water pro democracy just doesn t push my buttons like it used to hong kong was never a democracy and while autonomy may be a legitimate demand democracy strikes me as significantly less so it s not even clear that most of the population would vote for it if there were a referendum it s a question of context if they want democracy so they can have a majority vote to take people s stuff that would leave me cold but here the thieves and crooks are the nondemocratic leaders and the democratic leaders are the ones who have experience living in a basically free city they have every incentive to vote to keep those freedoms while the unelected crooks have every incentive to screw them over in every way once the barrier of democracy is removed autonomy may be a legitimate demand democracy strikes me as significantly less so democracy means rule by the demos the poor it s greek in origin demo doesn t mean poor poor would be pto and the opposite would be timo aristo nobles which by the time these words apply to govt also meant hereditary oligo few the original word used for the form of govt that cleisthenes introduced for athens was iso equality isonomia equality of law isocratia equality of power isopsephos equal vote for those few things that used voting as the means of choice the prefix demo was attached to that by those who opposed it notably both plato and aristotle in the same way that marxists used capitalism to describe the economic system they oppose and aristocrats used capitalist to describe the vulgarity of the nouveau riche they wanted rule of the few by however they chose to define who gets selected as the few since by definition the few are a minority any attempt by the non few to exercise anything other than submission is considered bad poly the actual opposite of oligo had positive connotations then so instead they chose demo meaning roughly districts citizens people because it had the connotation of rule by the bad part of town demo doesn t mean poor true but democracy is rule by the poor because the poor outnumber the non poor the greeks recognized this as did the us founding fathers who did all they could to check their power and influence limiting the vote to property owning men the greeks recognized this the greeks who we read today recognized this ftfy we don t read ancient greece esp pericles who instituted many of those favoring the poor measures so opposed later as mere history where context matters or pre socratic philosophers who at least were contemporaneous with those events hell we don t even read plato aristotle who constructed strawmen about democracy isokratia in order to sell rule of the idle virtuous we read third hand moderns with their own agenda who interpret plato aristotle in translation for us as did the us founding fathers greece was near irrelevant for both the us french during enlightenment the roman republic and its decline was the ancient model for them and more importantly actually the various governance models used by church denominations congregational presbyter episcopal etc which was their only actual experience of self governance during the colonial era the key point of democracy or isocratia was that all people who are governed have an equal voice in determining the terms conditions of that governance majoritarianism is not to democracy prepare for the long stays in the gulags boys and girls need a little tiananmen in my life a little gulag for my strife these young gallant chinese are in my prayers in the pla s crosshairs thomas friedman must be relieved true heroes like these don t wear mask let that be a lesson to antifa the founding fathers didn t wear masks and they all knew that if they were caught by the british they would hanged as traitors to the crown the founding fathers didn t wear masks they wore wigs and false wooden teeth when dumping tea in harbors they dressed as indians they also belonged to secret societies and rode the streets conveying coded messages actually it is a myth that washington s teeth were wooden he did have an early version of dentures which often contained cadaver teeth this was the norm as for the wigs it was the fashion in both the us and england but it wasn t universal many like jefferson henry and franklin and sam adams didn t commonly wear whigs as for the secret societies and coded messages that was basically standard operational security but every single person who signed the declaration of independence used their real name and all had warrants on their heads and would have been tried for treason if the colonist had lost the boston tea party also happened before the revolution and was during a period before the colonist considered independence even then the disguised were rudimentary and were really worn to give a little plausible deniability to the colonial authorities everyone knew who were the ringleaders they didn t even attempt to hide it very much and the secret societies the code words the disguised at the tea party only became necessary as england became less tolerant of the colonial protests the embargoes that proceeded them were done in the open but the king and parliament declared that the colonies were in near revolt and began cracking down on the protests the son s of liberty used to meet openly and publicised their meeting times at first and the secret societies the code words the freemasons to which paul revere and many other key figures belonged were active before the revolution started to heat up they were always anti monarchical and conducted their business in secret true heroes do indeed wear masks conceal their identities and don t tell their enemies their plans liberals and pro antifa are happy to see free speech lovers thrown in prison china is their true love a true socialist paradise quite a few more are being arrested including pro democracy legislators lots of courage there these people are my heroes like the solidarity citizens pretty sure it was conquest who wrote that the ussr collapsed when the those in the red army decided they would not shoot their friends and neighbors anyone old enough should easily remember the tank man of tienanmen square the members of the pla had no such qualms in 1989 we can hope that times have changed so far so good thats not how the ussr collapsed the army was never given orders to shoot people so they never decided anything the collapse was a lot more slow motion than that thats not how the ussr collapsed it s closer to how the shah of iran collapsed the break up of the ussr saw the military kidnapping gorbachev shelling the parliament building leveling the chechen capital grozny and killing dozens of protesters especially in surrounding republics like lithuania georgia etc it s true that these events weren t decisive and the military was just as confused and divided as the populace sevo s mistake is to assume that the actions of the red army 30 years ago have any bearing on what the pla does today this is heartbreaking it s always more depressing to see people lose liberties they already have than to see people who never had any what brave young people if this were a movie they d win the silver lining is that if the shtf the u s can finally find a group of refugees it can unambiguously welcome as future citizens and i bet they won t vote for this time we ll get it right socialism either the silver lining is that if the shtf the u s can finally find a group of refugees it can unambiguously welcome as future citizens hong kong is 414 square miles surrounded by china controlled ocean the only refugees will be those who leave before the day china decides enough is enough and rolls its armor across the border reason thinks china is acting badly and that we should not use any tools in our arsenal such as trade policy to deal with it can we admit that opening trade with china has not liberated its people or improved their freedoms whatsoever why not use other asian countries to supply our needs why not use other asian countries to supply our needs why use asian countries to supply our needs why use asian countries to supply our needs it is no surprise that the concept of competitive advantage is lost on someone so abysmally stupid the word is comparative advantage not competitive advantage stupid competitive advantage is business school blather that in fact equates to the economic term absolute advantage not comparative advantage the word is comparative advantage not competitive advantage stupid oh oh fucking lefty ignoramus is now a grammar nazi fuck off it s not about grammar it s about economic concepts trade today for the us as reserve currency has virtually nothing to do with comparative advantage or free trade or anything that ricardo wrote about you don t have structural long term deficits with comparative advantage can we admit that opening trade with china has not liberated its people or improved their freedoms whatsoever no because only an idiot who has not watched china since the 70s would make such a fucking stupid claim britain handed hong kong over at midnight on 1 july 1997 china has handled it with kid gloves for more than two decades about twice what i would have predicted those folks have been on borrowed time ever since the brit flag came down i m guessing it s about to run out and reason cheers because he was disrupting the

well any way the protesters have set one of the government buildings on fire and it burn for thirty minutes by the way for weeks now beijing has refuse to allow carry lam to back down from the protesters to be honest it looks like beijing is doing all it can to provoke them any way if you are really interested in what happening in hong kong here a singapore web site that s been updating every few hours on the protest https www channelnewsasia com news topic hong kong protests all the best to joshua wong and agnes chow meanwhile what happened to news of street protests in tegucigalpa not all hondurans are pleased about usaf navy and dea having major bases in honduras with a government that continues to serve our pentagon while our drug wars and their severe drought gets worse meanwhile what happened to news of street protests in tegucigalpa reason has evidently decided that the honduran situation is not worth covering i found this strange because libertarians are typically concerned over drug wars foreign meddling and immigration none of which figure in the hong kong protests hong kong is a place without basic political and economic freedom sounds like they re talking about contemporary american college campuses the heritage foundation has listed hong kong as the freest economy on the planet for at least two years running the usa doesn t even make the top ten an exceptionally competitive financial and business hub hong kong remains one of the world s most resilient economies a high quality legal framework provides effective protection of property rights and strongly supports the rule of law there is little tolerance for corruption and a high degree of transparency enhances government integrity regulatory efficiency and openness to global commerce undergird a vibrant entrepreneurial climate the heritage foundation has listed hong kong as the freest economy on the planet for at least two years running the usa doesn t even make the top ten sevo

crushed in the us a long time ago seattle 1999 occupy since trump was elected 18 r legislatures have created anti protest laws banning some forms of non violent protest to go along with the free speech cages we ve had for a long time now and a ton of commenters here thought it was perfectly ok and libertarian a couple weeks ago to run over protestors with a truck cuz obstructing a sidewalk is an act of violence they that means you would fit in well as a commie china apologist fact is that the protests in hk would probably have been crushed in the us a long time ago seattle 1999 occupy you know is a fucking lefty ignoramus when we get hypotheticals instead of facts yes of course jfree why trump would have sent in the tanks and had them open fire and you wonder why no one takes you seriously trump doesn t need to send in the troops now that he has via executive order restored giving military equipment to state local police departments the whole fucking point of proposing enacting state laws detailed here that find invent ways to turn constitutional protest into criminalized activity is to ramp things up to that level to legally test how the 1a can be infringed going forward if one thing gets defeated now that s ok cuz it then can become a political issue trump s only direct impact is that his authoritarian nixonian streak and his revival of other as enemy enables r s to politicize delegitimize protest so they can once again make law and order a political issue that transcends mere criminality with 2 million people in prison and an incarceration rate far higher than every country including cuba or china the us has run out of low hanging fruit that can be fearmongered but clamping down on other gets tons of fear mongering votes which says nothing regarding freedom of speech assembly or other personal freedoms how do you have economic freedom if you don t have personal freedom the freedom to change your job for example is that a personal freedom or an economic freedom tell us what you think sevo i wish freedom lovers from other countries would join these young people then these heroes could destroy china s communist stranglehold on a billion people
