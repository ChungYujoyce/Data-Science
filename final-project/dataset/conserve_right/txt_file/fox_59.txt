house trade adviser weighs in on fox news sunday this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday june 10 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace we aposre live in singapore where president trump has just arrived for his historic summit with north korea aposs kim jong un begin videotape donald trump president of the united states it aposs a one time shot and i think it aposs going to work out very well wallace this hour we aposll preview the high risk high reward summit with special reports from here and the korean peninsula we aposll discuss what aposs at stake as president trump presses kim to give up nuclear weapons and long range missiles that pose a growing threat to the u s asking veteran diplomats about the challenge of negotiating with the north koreans then the president aposs other summit this week confronting close allies angry after he slapped stiff new tariffs on their exports trump we aposre like the piggy bank that everybody is robbing and that ends wallace we aposll ask white house trade advisor peter navarro what are the chances to head off a trade war and about the president aposs surprising call to bring moscow back into the g7 trump i think it would be an asset to have russia back in i think it would be good for the world wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news today in singapore you are looking at the night sky line of this vibrant island nation of five and a half million people that is one of the financial capitals of the world air force one just landed bringing president trump to a summit that was unthinkable just over three months ago the man he came to meet north korean leader kim jong un got here a little earlier today let aposs get you situated about exactly where we are singapore is 10 000 miles from washington in southeast asia it aposs much closer only 3 000 miles from pyongyang but that aposs the longest trip kim has taken since he became north korea aposs leader in 2011 the two leaders are set to meet tuesday at 9 00 a m on sentosa island just across from the city center sentosa has an amusement park and beaches and the luxury capella hotel where the summit will take place this hour we aposll discuss what to expect out of the summit how both leaders are likely to approach it and what would qualify as success but we begin with chief white house correspondent john roberts reporting from a military airbase here in singapore where president trump just landed john john roberts fox news chief white house correspondent chris good evening to you president trump disembarking air force one into the steamy singapore night and taking a step closer to history with that meeting tuesday morning here in singapore with kim jong un the president telling the host tv in the assembled proposal under the wing of air force one that he is feeling good about that meeting the president going back to his hotel tonight for some rest tomorrow he will meet with lee hsien loong he is the prime minister of singapore lee hsien loong last year when he visited the white house extended an invitation to the president to come to singapore so the president really killing two birds with one stone you mentioned kim jong un arriving earlier this afternoon here in singapore he landed at changi which is the civilian airport aboard an air china plane it aposs the national flag carrier of china but the type of plane that he arrived on like the president was an american made 747 he will meet with prime minister lee tomorrow before leaving la malbaie quebec in the g7 summit president trump saying this is a one shot opportunity that this is the only opportunity kim jong un is going to get to try to turn around the future of his nation because if these talks do not bear fruit and north korea goes back to its nuclear program that is not going to work out well for kim and denuclearization is the only thing that president trump says that he will accept but if things go well chris we could see kim jong un come to the white house we could see a normalization of relations between the u s and north korea which would mean the u s putting an embassy in pyongyang chris wallace john roberts reporting from singapore aposs military airbase john thank you now we want to get the view from inside north korea about this historic meeting eric talmadge is the associated press bureau chief in pyongyang the only american reporter with a regular posting in north korea eric what are you hearing from officials there what does kim want out of this summit and what is he prepared to give up eric talmadge ap pyongyang bureau chief well i think the main thing that the north korean side wants is as they said and end to the american hostile policy towards their country which is something that they said they wanted an end to for many years now and it aposs kind of hard to determine exactly what they are looking for but one of the things that normally would be on the table with that kind of thing would be a removal of strategic nuclear assets for instance aircraft that can be used to attack this country or other things that can be used to threaten the security of the regime that aposs the main thing that they are after and i think in return it aposs very hard to say exactly what they are willing to discuss i think there should be some surprises and there should be some room for progress at this summit but right now it aposs really very hard to say exactly what aposs on the table wallace well let aposs press down on that because president trump says the ultimate u s demand is that north korea give up all of its nuclear weapons and all of its missiles from what you hear there is that a realistic possibility talmadge i think in the short term that aposs not a realistic possibility i haven apost heard any comments from any officials here that that aposs something that they aposre looking at right away i think when the north korean side talks about denuclearization what they have said so far is indicated that when the whole world is ready to denuclearize then the north korean side will do the same now whether that aposs actually the negotiating position that they aposre taking as they go into the talks we aposll have to wait and see but i think if there is going to be denuclearization it aposs going to be a very long and difficult process and we haven apost really gotten any indication from pyongyang that anything serious is going to happen along those lines in the immediate future wallace president trump says that if north korea were to disarm that the u s and the west would invest heavily and boost the north korean economy but you say that kim and his regime view that more as a threat than a promise talmadge well i think definitely there aposs an element of caution on this side to that kind of a promise or an offer the north korean side i think is looking for better relations with its neighbors first and foremost particularly with the south korean side and also with china the problem with investment is that investment if it aposs heavy and it comes to fast then that can cause changes it could be too rapid it could be seen as threatening for this country so although i think the north korean government would like to see investment and they are definitely interested in improving their economy they are at the same time very cautious about exactly what kind of relationship they want with the united states in the future wallace eric talmadge at his post in pyongyang eric thanks for your time talmadge thank you very much wallace so what should we expect from the singapore summit we decided to bring in american diplomats with years of experience dealing with the north koreans ambassador robert gallucci started negotiating with pyongyang during another nuclear crisis in 1994 former governor bill richardson has led more than a half dozen missions to north korea negotiating for the release of americans detained there and gordon chang is an expert on north korea and china ambassador gallucci what should president trump aposs game plan be going into this summit what should he hope to accomplish in the one or two days he meets with kim here in singapore ambassador robert gallucci chief u s negotiator apos94 noko missille crisis i think the chris i think the easy part is the meet and greet that he referred to on the white house lawn i think that they can have good vibes they can have a nice appearance and optics it aposs the meet and greet plus it aposs the plus part i think everybody is going to be looking to president trump to get something and that doesn apost mean a full deal that means real clarity on the question of whether the north will in fact in a reasonable amount of time give up in a verified way its nuclear weapons capability everybody is looking for that if he does not get that it aposs very hard to call it a success and if he does get that almost no matter what else happens it will be a success wallace let me bring in governor richardson and i want to play a clip for you from president trump earlier this week that surprised a lot of people governor here aposs where here it is begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i think i aposm very well prepared i don apost think i have to prepare very much it aposs about attitude it aposs about willingness to get things done end video clip wallace governor is that what this summit is really about the two men getting together face to face and sizing each other up deciding whether or not they can do business and we now hear talk that president trump may right at the start of the summit on tuesday pull gently pull kim aside for a one on one before they meet with their full delegations would that be a good idea or not bill richardson former u s ambassador to the u n that would be a good idea because the north koreans never make deals with counterparts across a negotiating table they are very focused relentless they are very well prepared but you make deals with them on the side you know i think that facility in singapore is good for that you take him for a walk or over a meal i think the one on one is very important the only caution i would give the president is not be photographed too much with a smiling kim jong un because they use that in north korea for dramatic propaganda purposes the north koreans have already gotten one major concession a meeting with the president they are going to want a piece treaty a security guarantee i would wait on those until the north koreans deliver some kind of verification inspections timelines i think that aposs going to be very important wallace mr chang you say and i aposm really following up on what governor richardson says that north korea has already gotten a lot of successions like the very fact that the summit is being held what do you think kim wants out of this day or so in singapore gordon chang columnist because certainly kim wants the photographs of him shaking hands with president trump because that aposs legitimization and even more important that means he solidifies his rule at home because we are going to see those pictures of trump and kim for decades in north korea so you know president trump gives up a lot of leverage as soon as he shakes hands with kim and that means if he doesn apost get firm commitments to dismantle the weapons programs then we aposre going to be working uphill we can do that because we aposve got a lot of leverage but it nonetheless puts kim in the driver aposs seat at least for a little while wallace governor richardson you have been to north korea eight times on various diplomatic missions back in 2005 you met with kim aposs father kim jong il what stands out about sitting across the table and negotiating with the north koreans richardson well first they are very prepared they know what they want they never say no you can brag on negotiations they never tell you no at the same time they want that personal trust they want to feel that you can deliver and you can negotiate with them kim jong un i understand is not like his father his father was like a rug merchant you know you get a political prisoner in exchange you get the visit of a former president kim jong un is not that way i think he aposs more strategic i think he wants private sector assistance for north korea rather than what his father wanted which was handouts and foreign aid so i think we aposre dealing with a man that we probably have underestimated and he aposs going to be very well prepared on some of these nuclear missile issues and i hope the president and i worry sometimes that the president will not be as prepared wallace let aposs gentlemen let aposs talk about some of the key issues that we think are going to come up in this summit i want to begin with an acronym we aposre going to hear a lot about over the next few days cvid complete verifiable irreversible denuclearization here aposs how the president aposs national security advisor john bolton defined that back in april begin video clip wallace north korea has to give up basically its whole program before the u s begins to relieve economic sanctions john bolton white house national security adviser yes relieving that pressure isn apost going to make negotiation easier it could make it harder end video clip wallace mr chang do you think that kim will ever give up his entire nuclear and missile programs what aposs the most that we can hope for in that area chang yes i think we can actually get cvid this is not a kim question though you know kim certainly doesn apost want to give up his missiles his nukes he doesn apost want to do any of that of course but this is an issue of what president trump will do whether president trump will use the elements of american power to force kim to do what he doesn apost want to do so for instance we can tighten the sanctions on north korea because although the junctions are strict they aposre not strict enough and we need to put sanctions on north korea aposs major power backers the chinese and the russians who have been violating sanctions lately for the last three months so clearly there aposs a lot that we can do now we can do those things it aposs a trump question though chris it aposs not a kim question wallace let me i aposve got about a minute or so left and i want to get to a couple of quick answers on other issues ambassador gallucci president trump is also talking about an agreement between north and south korea in effect a peace treaty and the conflict the armistice rather that began in the 1950s and there aposs even talk that the president might offer normalization of relations and a u s embassy in pyongyang are those good ideas are those good places to start and if you begin there isn apost it going to be almost impossible to maintain the sanctions regime the maximum pressure against north korea gallucci chris this meeting is a cart before the horse as everybody has noticed with the president out front you can also make the whole negotiation a cart before the horse the normalization process and the president referred to a process should really be following the gains that we are looking to make at this summit and then in the following meetings so yes ultimately having normalization of relations exchange of liaison offices exchange of embassies all that is a good idea but it should be done clearly in the course of a step by step phase movement in which we get what we need to get and it means performance on the nuclear weapons nuclear program productions capability fissile material and their ballistic missile program taking the political part of that part is to give the concession the major succession that the north koreans seek something we should be willing to do it eventually wallace governor i aposve got about 30 seconds quick question if president trump brings up human rights and the repression inside north korea how will that be received by kim richardson well he aposll be nervous about it but the president should bring those issues out the gulag issues in north korea the remains of our soldiers from the korean war should be returned to their families there aposs about 5 000 of those help the japanese on the abduction issue i think that aposs important but i think kim is going to want modernization of his economy a good trade off is going to be a strong commitment of his improving the human rights situation in north korea which is pretty bad the president should not leave human rights aside in this negotiation wallace right gentlemen thank you thank you all so much for participating this morning and we aposll see how the world turns this week up next we will talk with two american reporters who covered the white house and state department and have made the long trip here what do their sources say we should expect from the singapore summit when we come back with much more from fox news sunday live in singapore commercial break begin video clip trump how long will it take to figure out whether or not they are serious i said maybe in the first minute end video clip wallace president trump trusting in gut instinct on whether he aposll be able to make a deal with kim jong un at their historic summit that is now just hours away we want to bring in two of the literally thousands of reporters who have come to singapore to cover this historic event david nakamura who reports from the white house for the washington post and fox news correspondent rich edson who covers the state department welcome gentlemen this is a kind of cool place to be isn apost it well i shouldn apost say cool because the humidity and heat are off the charts but it aposs a fascinating place david i want to start with you and what strikes me as we approach the summit is how dramatically president trump has lowered the expectations and his goals for the summit originally there was talk about the complete denuclearization of north korea now there aposs talk about a getting to know you process pretty substantial david nakamura white house reporter washington post very substantial i think some of that chris is due to what we saw leading up to the summit which was that the president declared in march he was going to do this on a very fast time frame he wanted to meet as soon as possible he instructed his team to get set to work and then we saw some hiccups along the way including the president of course backing out about two weeks ago of the summit i think that show that the negotiations were hitting a bit of a roadblock and that aposs not unexpected people who negotiate with north koreans in the past have said they are very difficult to nail down ahead of these summits and you have a very condense time frame so the president is readjusting some of that to what he was hearing from his negotiating team on the ground in korea i think they had at least five different sessions trying to nail down what is going to take place at the summit and the white house has still not said what that is we do know the president has talked about this meet and greet tomorrow and he really stressed the historic nature of that wallace tuesday nakamura tuesday really stressed the historic nature of that i think to say look just the meeting is a big deal but as we as some of your guests have talked about that aposs not nearly big deal enough wallace nothing it seems to me rich defines the split inside the administration more than two people first national security advisor john bolton who originally said when this meeting was first announced here aposs what the meeting should be president trump should meet with kim and say when are you going to deliver all of your nukes and all of your missiles in the next week i mean he was like you deliver and then we aposll talk about what we may give and then you aposve got the new secretary of state mike pompeo who seems to have taken a much longer view of this whole process i guess the question is how dramatic a split is there inside the president aposs foreign policy team rich edson fox news correspondent it aposs significant but it aposs the type of split that you have a national security advisor who went through some of this during the bush administration and there was from 1994 to 2002 an agreement in place between the united states and north korea where there were inspectors living inside north korea they did destroy nuclear infrastructure and that didn apost hold and now you have a secretary of state who comes in and the 21st century and the trump administration who is the most senior person in the last 18 years to have met with kim jong un or to meet with north korean leadership to meet with the dictator of north korea he aposs been there twice we asked the secretary of state directly what his impression of kim was and he was i wouldn apost want to say complementary but he certainly wouldn apost say anything very bad about the conversation that he had with him when he went to north korea wallace i aposll say two things he told me off camera i guess i can say it one is he said he is very well prepared very well versed and i said do you think he understands english because the conversation was all being translated and he said i had the distinct impression as i was making my point he understood the point i was making and took the time for the translation to figure out his response edson yes the question if he really understands what he aposs saying is really waiting for the translations sometimes they put that show on in front of translators but the key thing that the secretary of state has said going into this is that it would be a true tragedy if kim jong un didn apost take advantage he was essentially saying that it aposs the north koreans who have to move here but unlike the national security advisor it seems as though he wants to give them that opportunity that we want nakamura what aposs interesting is you do see that john bolton has made this trip and he aposs going to be part of it we saw him sidelined a bit a week or so ago when the north korean official visited the white house john bolton was not in those meetings because the north koreans have a very crosstalk wallace do you think he will be he will sit down in a meeting nakamura we think that he aposs involved as parts of the meeting at least wallace because i mean i think it aposs fair to say the north koreans just plain don apost like them right nakamura he has foul language about john bolton they stayed away from doing that with donald trump but certainly there aposs a lot of hard feelings from the bush days when john bolton advocated for wallace i suspect john bolton would consider that a badge of honor david you know the president has said from the start and said again this weekend in canada look if this meeting is a waste of time i am going to walk out do you think that there were any circumstances under which he would walk out or given that probably at the very least there is going to be the optics of the two men meeting and talking that he will declare the singapore summit a success regardless nakamura i think some of these things tend to be baked in ahead of time there is a lot of ground work that led up to this it was you know a rough process but i think the goal the president really wanted to be a success he sees a political victory here he aposs done something his predecessors have not done start this process start a meeting as you said he aposs lowered expectations but i see very unlikely the president gets up and walks out you know even if we don apost see sort of a grand bargain at the end of this which no one expects to happen i think it aposs the start of a process the president himself now had said it could take more meetings between the two leaders and certainly the staff to get nail down some of the details wallace yes your man mike pompeo at the state department has obviously been the leader in terms of negotiating with the north koreas kim and then also his vice chairman what aposs the sense that you aposre getting from your sources about how this process plays out after singapore is it a long process are we talking about months are we talking about years are we talking about multiple summits what your sense of the process here edson multiple summits and continued conversations and remember the united states and north korea under the trump administration have already had conversations going back to when otto warmbier was returned to the united states there had been a channel in new york at the united nations so a lot of those conversations had taken place even before secretary of state mike pompeo took over at the state department and remember as cia director he has been to north korea and as secretary of state he has been there but i think now you are even hearing the president publicly acknowledged because i think of the results that you are hearing from the conversations with the state department officials that this is going to take more than one meeting a high level meeting also with the continued conversations at the staff level to try to get this done there are major issues that they have to work through here to have a successful agreement wallace all right having said all of that david how invested is president trump in this negotiation with kim you know in the early heady days right after the announcement of the summit the president was thoroughly enjoying the crowds chanting nobel peace prize clearly things have calmed down a little bit from that point but how badly does he want a deal and is there a danger that he could fall exactly into the trap that barack obama he says fell into with iran that he pushes for a deal even if it aposs not the right deal nakamura right that is a danger and it could be very similar to what we saw with obama extended period of time and one that north korea could get some economic benefits down the road i think how invested he is he aposs extremely invested if you look around the world with his foreign policy he aposs alienated allies as we know we saw what happened at the g7 he aposs sort of tangling now with iran again raising stakes there this is a place where he aposs trying to use diplomatic means to achieve something i think it aposs a real important moment for him wallace david rich thank you both thank you for joining us let aposs hope for lots of news this week before president trump flew here to meet with a long time enemy as david said he first confronted u s allies over tariffs at the g7 economic summit in canada we aposll discuss where things stand now on that issue with white house trade advisor peter navarro as fox news sunday continues to live from singapore commercial break wallace coming up president trump warmed up for his summit in singapore by taking on u s allies at the g7 begin video clip trump they do so much more business with us than we do with them that we can apost lose that end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the split over tariffs coming up on fox news sunday commercial break wallace a look at the striking marina bay sands hotel here in singapore with its iconic sky park at the top there ahead of tuesday aposs landmark summit before president trump traveled to asia he faced other world leaders at the group of seven economic summit in canada allies that are upset over new tariffs he aposs imposed on steel and aluminum imports joining us now one of the architects of that controversial plan white house trade adviser peter navarro mr navarro the summit ended with a nasty dustup between president trump and canadian prime minister trudeau he held a news conference after the summit in which he said canada will retaliate for tariffs that the u s has imposed on canadian aluminum and steel here he trudeau begin video clip justin trudeau canadian prime minister we move forward with retaliatory measures on july 1st applying equivalent tariffs to the ones that the americans have unjustly applied to us canadians we aposre polite we aposre reasonable but we also will not be pushed around end video clip wallace well president trump responded with this tweet while flying here on air force one to singapore trudeau of canada acted as meek so meek and mild during our g 7 meetings only to give a news conference after i left very dishonest and weak question mr navarro is that really how we want to deal with our second biggest trading partner peter navarro white house trade adviser chris there aposs a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with president donald j trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door and that aposs what bad faith justin trudeau did with that stunt press conference that aposs what week dishonest justin trudeau did and that comes right from air force one and i aposll tell you this to my friends in canada that was one of the worst political miscalculations of a canadian leader in modern canadian history all justin trudeau had to do was take the win president trump did the courtesy to justin trudeau to travel up to quebec for that summit he had other things bigger things on his plate in singapore where you are now chris he did him a favor and he was even willing to sign that socialist communique and what did trudeau did do as soon as as soon as the plane took off from canadian airspace trudeau stuck our president in the back that will not stand and as far as this retaliation goes the american press needs to do a much better job of what the canadians are getting ready to do because it aposs nothing short of an attack on our political system and it aposs nothing short of canada trying to raise its high protectionist barriers even higher on things like maple syrup and other goods wallace mr navarro i aposve got a lot to talk to you about but i do have to press this you used some very strong words stab in the back a special place in hell you said that that came from air force one are those the views are those the words of the president towards trudeau navarro those are my words but they aposre the sentiment that was on air force one after that look chris this was this was just wrong what what trudeau is doing the canadians are totally bungling our trade relationships and it aposs due to their leadership take nafta for example we aposd have a deal we aposd have a great deal with nafta by now if the canadians would spend more time at the bargaining table and less time lobbying capitol hill and our press and state governments here they wallace all right navarro they are just simply not playing fair dishonest weak wallace well i i i want to pick up on this though mr navarro because it isn apost just canada germany aposs chancellor angela merkel released a photo of the summit and there was no comment on it but it certainly looked like it was president trump against the other members of the g 6 america aposs closest allies and i want to pick up on this point because the last time you were on with me on fox news sunday you said that no country would retaliate for the tariffs that we were going to impose but let aposs take a look at in fact what has happened since we last talked canada has announced tariffs on 13 billion in u s goods the european union will impose tariffs on 3 billion in american products i understand sir that the objective of the president aposs trade policy with your advice some would call it a trade war is to get the other countries to lower their tariffs on us but hasn apost the practical effect been to get them to raise their tariffs on our products navarro so one of my favorite quotes of this president happened just yesterday when he said we aposve been the piggy bank for the world and that aposs got to stop if you look at angela merkel aposs europe you see a continent where we run 151 billion trade deficit in goods every year germany has tariffs on autos four times higher than our tariffs on the equivalent german imports here and they sell us three times as many cars as we sell them so on the issues alone we have allies strategically but when it comes to these trade disputes these allies basically are robbing us blind the president is not going to put up with that and in terms of these retaliation i want to get back to the canadian miscalculation here the canadians wallace i i i i navarro we because this is inaudible retaliation wallace i i i i don apost mean to interrupt but i do i do want to move on navarro sure wallace because we aposve got limited time and i aposve got some other questions because the president also shocked the allies just before he came to canada by suggesting pushing the idea that russia should be invited back into the g7 to make it the g 8 the meeting the group of economic world leaders here aposs the president on that begin video clip donald trump president of the united states it may not be politically correct but we have a world to run and in the g7 which used to be the g8 they threw russia out they should let russia come back in end video clip wallace but mr navarro russia was kicked out of the g 8 after it invaded ukraine and seized crimea why does the president think they should ineffective be rewarded when they haven apost done anything to clean up their action they aposre still in crimea but welcoming them back into the g 8 navarro chris let me say a couple of things here first of all that that one aposs above my pay grade ambassador bolton mike pompeo the president himself deal with issues like that but just observationally i mean looks what aposs happening now in singapore the president is willing to talk to kim jong un in the hope that we can deal with denuclearization on the korean peninsula he aposs willing to talk with any world leader and i think the philosophy here is that when we have discussions with world leaders we should get everybody together so that we can basically hammer some of these problems out so i think that the bigger problem here from my point of view i aposm the trade guy is that we have a bunch of countries out there whether it aposs strategic competitors like china or allies like europe and canada basically using us as a piggy bank using unfair trade practices and my job at the white house is to help the president get jobs good jobs manufacturing jobs to the working men and women of america and we can apost do that unless we upset this existing world order which basically is tremendously biased we aposd lose half a trillion dollars a year of our wealth every single year because of these unfair trade practices and that aposs what the president is aiming for wallace let aposs go back mr navarro let aposs go back to a trade issue then you are a notorious hard liner on china navarro inaudible wallace and the unfair trade practices there well you wrote a book a few years ago called death by china so here aposs my question how do you explain navarro my code name at the cia is notorious by the way go ahead wallace oh ok that aposs interesting navarro no i was just joking chris wallace how do you how do you explain the decision by president trump to lift the sanctions against the chinese telecom company zte after it had violated our sanctions our ban on doing business with north korea and iran and was considered to be a serious national security risk why on earth would we do that navarro i i i think you should have secretary of commerce wilbur ross on to explain the the details of what is a very hard negotiation that that was done but i can tell you this it aposs going to be three strikes you aposre out on zte if they do one more additional thing they will be shut down what we have a bad actor in zte the president did this as a personal favor to the president of china as a way of showing some goodwill for bigger efforts such as the one here in singapore but it will be three strikes you aposre out for zte and everybody understands that within this administration so they aposre on notice wallace yes navarro we aposre going to have monitors inside that company they aposre changing their board of directors they aposre changing their management the they aposre paying us a billion and a half dollars in order to continue in business wallace i i want you navarro yes sir wallace i want you to give me a one sentence answer on my final question navarro ok i aposll try wallace did the zte decision did the zte decision give you some heartburn navarro i don apost get heartburn justin trudeau tried to give me heartburn i didn apost get heartburn wallace all right i aposll have to think i aposll have to think of another physical i aposll have to get think of another physical diagnosis navarro yes wallace mr navarro thank you thank you for joining us today always good to talk with you sir navarro my pleasure good luck in singapore chris wallace thank you up next president trump aposs surprising call to bring russia back into the economic group of world leaders we aposll discuss that and more with our sunday group back in d c as fox news sunday reports ahead of the u s north korea summit live in singapore commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states when i aposm telling them they aposre smiling at me you know it aposs like the the gig is up it aposs like the gig is up they aposre not trying to there aposs nothing they can say they can apost believe they got away with it end video clip wallace president trump at the g 7 summit in canada describing the reaction of u s allies to his tough new trade policy and it aposs time now for our sunday group back in washington former republican congressman jason chaffetz adrienne elrod former advisor to hillary clinton aposs campaign and jonah goldberg of the national review jonah let me start with you your thoughts about the optics and the substance of the g 7 summit in canada and especially those explosive words we just heard from peter navarro that clearly was on like a a direct message from president trump on air force one jonah goldberg national review yes so i aposm not an expert on all things theological but i aposm pretty sure your admittance to hell is not entirely contingent upon your attitude towards donald trump or whether or not you agree with his trade policies so i aposm not sure there aposs a special place in hell for trudeau and i thought that was more than a little over the top as i did i thought donald trump aposs entire performance in canada i understand that he likes this optics it works for him domestically with his base to sort of be seen as standing up to the globalist world order and whatnot but these are our closest allies he aposs saying that you know he aposs legally justifying these tariffs and and on the ground that it aposs a national security issue but when he aposs pressed on a little bit all of a sudden he says no it aposs really because of dairy subsidies in canada and i think that aposs going to create real policy problems for him going forward wallace adrienne democrats generally like the idea of protections to help u s workers in u s industries so from the democratic point of view with this new tough trade policy and talk of tariffs is president trump on the right track adrienne elrod democratic strategist no absolutely not chris i mean look democrats are all for protecting u s workers but at the same time we recognize that getting into a trade war with some of our biggest allies notably canada and germany in this situation is not the right course of action for our workers this is what the president has done from the very beginning we know that he did not consult with his full team of economic advisors before he imposed tariffs on china on chinese steel and aluminum and we aposre now we aposre seeing him display this erratic chaotic type of behavior with some of our closest allies that is not a way to help american workers wallace congressman chaffetz do you want to respond to that jason chaffetz former u s congressman r utah no look the president was elected to do something other than the status quo and his disruption was certainly very successful in that summit that aposs what he was elected to do that aposs what he aposs doing and i think in his from his approach that puts the united states in a position to now go back and push some negotiations so that we can get to something that is fair and balanced and equal i think that aposs what the president is after and i think that aposs where we aposll eventually get to wallace but congressman chaffetz president trump keep saying and peter navarro says that look the point of all this and that eventually our allies and countries like china will cave and lower their trade barriers but the results at least so far and i understand it aposs early is that instead of lowering their trade barriers in response to our threats they aposre raising their tariffs i mean are can apost you make the argument that instead of solving the problem we aposre creating a trade war chaffetz i think the president is after the long term goal of making sure that there aposs an equalization that happens across our borders we love canada we love germany these are our allies but it is not fair and the people within those industries who want to export to those countries know how imbalanced it is and that aposs why donald trump enjoy so much support from those people in those industries and i think this will accelerate the need to now that there aposs a problem to go back and it aposs been highlighted by the president to go back and solve that and i think he will wallace jonah as a traditional conservative free trader do you buy that goldberg no not at all sorry with all due respect i think it aposs i think that all of this is premised on a lot of economic fallacies it which can be illustrated just starting with the fact that president trump loves to talk about how terrible trade deficits are while he aposs bragging about how much foreign investment that we are getting foreign investment is the inverse of trade deficits because all of those dollars have to come back to america somehow the more the bigger your trade deficits the more foreign investment you get this is all premised on an accounting fiction that somehow trade deficits are terrible meanwhile the things that we aposre putting tariffs on are much more important to industries in america that use them we use a lot of steel when we make steel more expensive we hurt more workers and cost more jobs than we save this is a blinkered 1930s approach to economic policy and it makes no sense whatsoever wallace i would i aposve got a couple of minutes left and i want to get to one other subject adrienne what do you make of president trump aposs surprising call to bring russia back into the economic summit to make the g 7 the g 8 elrod you know chris the fact that he is again alienating some of our top closest longtime allies but he seems to continue to embrace russia and frankly north korea i don apost understand i don apost know what vladimir putin has on him but it aposs absolutely ridiculous to even insinuate given all of the international rules that russia has violated most notably going into crimea that he would even invite them back into the to make it the g8 again it aposs ludicrous it makes you again wonder what really does vladimir putin have on donald trump to make him do this wallace congressman chaffetz i know you aposre not going to like that association but it is one that people are certainly going to raise and it is i think you aposd agree at least from a political standpoint it is an odd suggestion to make to invite russia back in right in the middle of the russia investigation in the united states chaffetz i see nothing in russia aposs behavior that would justify bringing them back into make them part and make it back into the g8 i just don apost see that the invasion of crimea the attack of our financial systems the meddling in an election the stealing of our intellectual property i mean there aposs nothing on that checklist that would say hey this is a good idea russia is now behaving better let aposs bring them back in as a partner in these discussions and make it the g8 i i don apost i don apost get it wallace so well so let me ask you as one of our political analyst why do you think he aposs doing it chaffetz i don apost know i don apost know i it was we the president had a mission to disrupt the current status quo with the g7 and get after some of these trade imbalances but i think that was a distraction to suddenly suggest that russia should be part of those those discussions i i it just came from out of the blue i don apost understand it wallace thirty seconds jonah what do you think is going on here goldberg yes i aposm not sure i buy the this is all because putin has something on trump explanation i think it may be in fact be because president trump tends to like to pick on people he thinks he can get away with picking on and he sees the g7 and people like trudeau as as pushovers and meanwhile he sends tends to respect countries and strong leaders that don apost like democracy and and behave in a sort of an authoritarian way and i think he kind of likes xi of china kim and putin because they exert kind of manfulness ph wallace all right all right anyway it aposs something to talk about thank you panel see you next sunday back in d c up next what we can learn about the trump kim summit from summits of the past showmanship and substance and sometimes agreements that changed the course of history commercial break wallace the excitement over the trump kim summit hearkens back to an earlier time 30 or 40 years ago when the leaders of the two great superpowers would get together with the world aposs fate hanging in the balance for sheer drama and long term significance nothing rivals the talks between ronald reagan and mikhail gorbachev and i was fortunate to have a front row seat begin videotape wallace voice over when reagan and gorbachev met in geneva in november of 1985 it was the first summit between leaders of the u s and soviet union in six years and this first encounter of a lifelong cold warrior and a vigorous business like russian drew the world aposs attention a young white house reporter was there wallace on camera and certainly no major breakthrough and we certainly don apost expect anything like that at all but of course we don apost know what aposs going to happen in these two days of talks that aposs going to be the telling sign and that aposs what we aposre told by u s officials that one of the keys to this whole summit will be how these two men get on during the 12 hours they aposll be spending together wallace voice over there were no breakthroughs but the two leaders decided they could do business eleven months later they held a snap summit in reykjavik iceland gorbachev offered massive arms cuts but only if reagan gave up his star wars missile defense plan reagan refused and walked out u s russian relations went into the deep freeze but the deadlock in iceland led to deals a year later they signed an historic agreement to eliminate all medium range missiles in europe although star wars still blocked a deal on long range weapons ronald reagan former u s president the general secretary and i expressed different points of view we did so bluntly and for that reason alone our talks have been useful in this area wallace on camera it seems clear then that gorbachev is ready to deal with the u s but only on his own terms and at his own pace for a president with just a year left in office that may mean steady progress but not the big finish he had hoped for wallace voice over but there was a big finish in moscow in may of 1988 walking through red square with gorbachev reagan was asked whether he still thought russia was an evil empire reagan i was talking about another time another era wallace again there was no deal on the icbms the two superpowers aimed at each other but reagan spent time pushing for human rights in russia setting the stage for future change wallace on camera as u s officials become increasingly certain there will be no big agreements here they are playing up the president aposs contact with the soviet people saying it will be great theater and could mark something of a turning point in superpower relations end videotape wallace that turning point came in november of 1
