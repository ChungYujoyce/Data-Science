tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap like whisperers in a tempest conservative minded officials across the breadth of donald trump s government are letting it be known what they think of him and some of it isn t pretty but they are speaking oh so softly in a kind of code to a country that may only hear shouting jim mattis is just the latest in a string of leading lights from the conservative establishment to throw shade at trump as with others the chief justice a special counsel various republican lawmakers who hope to have a political future the ex pentagon chief s words are subtle filtered through notions of duty decorum deference to history the greater good top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time crack the code and you can sometimes see deep discomfort with trump the contours of a searing repudiation in the view of many institutionalists of the right as well as the left he is bulldozing values that america holds dear yet the negativity is couched in words of moderation and caution what effect does that have in trump s america these are sober restrained players in a fracas produced directed and dominated by an in your face president the well informed public understands what they re saying and how deeply concerned they are said cal jillson a political science professor and historian at southern methodist university in dallas the rest of the public might not get it says eric dezenhall a crisis management specialist who has studied trump s rise in business and politics in a fight between crassness and discretion in the new millennium crassness will win every time washington s well known partisan fever coexists with a more decorous tradition in some quarters of raising eyebrows instead of raising hell of saying things in so many words without actually using the words people such as mattis former special counsel robert mueller and chief justice john roberts are steeped in those ways when certain people let down their guard history can happen so it was when joseph nye welch a lawyer representing the buttoned up u s army assailed sen joseph mccarthy in a 1954 congressional hearing remembered for his putdown of the senator s scorched earth pursuit of men and women he deemed communist sympathizers in government and society have you no sense of decency sir at long last have you left no sense of decency in the mccarthy and richard nixon eras it took a long time for congressional leaders for the republican party to see the damage to their party and step in jillson said and no such tipping point has been reached in republican ranks if it comes he said that s when they ll talk and then everybody will hear them republicans will not do it while they think there are still gains to be made through the trump presidency he said but if the fear that was stirred by 2018 losses and trump s behavior since then consolidates into wide eyed terror that s when they cut their people loose loyalty fractures and more in the gop abandon the president for now censure comes in coded form from power players in the nonpartisan world as well as frontally from a few republican lawmakers as they exit their careers and from predictably democrats mattis mueller and others have lived in a world of consequences which combined with their natures has made them discreet says dezenhall the crisis management specialist they re not about to blast trump because they view it as dishonorable but they hint at what they think when the associated press asked the chief justice last fall to address trump s criticism of judges who had ruled against his wishes like the obama judge who had just rejected his migrant asylum policy it did not really expect an answer it got one we do not have obama judges or trump judges bush judges or clinton judges the republican nominated roberts responded in a statement what we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them he added the independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for his words were both startling and circumspect no more provocative on the surface than a civics lesson yet a rare engagement by the high court in the fray roberts had never addressed trump s past personal criticisms whether as president or pundit congratulations to john roberts for making americans hate the supreme court because of his bs trump tweeted in 2012 but when trump rhetorically charged through the firewall of the independent judiciary the chief justice subtly called him out among the elites those without robes also maintain stoicism through slings and arrows to a point trump nominated federal reserve chairman jerome powell bites his lip in silence when the president upset that interest rates aren t lower takes on a target that past presidents only jousted with obliquely my only question is who is our bigger enemy jay powel or chairman xi trump demanded in a tweet misspelling the fed chairman s name and referring to china s president mueller s mastery of restraint drove trump s opponents batty in hours of congressional testimony about his special counsel investigation of russia s attack on the 2016 election and its contacts with the trump campaign democrats pressed him to say what they wanted to hear but he talked the code problematic is an understatement is how the longtime republican characterized his view of trump s 2016 encouragement of russia to find missing emails of his political opponent hillary clinton i hope this is not the new normal but i fear it is mueller said of the idea of a u s campaign embracing help from a foreign government it is not a witch hunt he said of a probe that trump repeatedly attacked as just that he was no more animated than the stone statues of the capitol through the two years of his investigation mueller never responded to any of trump s attacks never updated the public on his work and certainly never offered a glimpse of any personal view of the president yet his final report had damning detail wrapped in legalese about trump s efforts to get mueller fired to get aides to lie on his behalf to get an attorney general he perceived as a loyalist to take control of the investigation all while stopping short of accusing trump of a crime mueller s fellow marine mattis quit as defense secretary before trump assigned him an insulting nickname though the president came close in branding mattis sort of a democrat mattis resigned over differences with trump on syria and the fight over the islamic state and is known to have objected to trump s disparagement of traditional allies months later mattis is promoting his new book call sign chaos learning to lead which is not a tell all about trump despite the title and for now he s speaking the code he s an unusual president our president is he said blandly in an interview for cbs sunday morning adding elliptically just the rabid nature of politics today we ve got to be careful then there was this exchange on pbs newshour this week when mattis was asked whether he would say so if he thought trump or any president wasn t fit for office yes so he thinks trump is fit to be president no i m not saying that i don t make political assessments one way or the other i come from the defense department in interviews for an article in the atlantic magazine mattis a student of history cited the french concept of the duty of silence to explain why he won t say whether he thinks trump is fit to be in charge i may not like a commander in chief one fricking bit he said but when you leave an administration over clear policy differences you need to give the people who are still there as much opportunity as possible to defend the country yet it seems that the man with the marine flavored nickname trump once loved mad dog will someday break his leash and growl there is a period in which i owe my silence he told the magazine it s not eternal it s not going to be forever associated press writers robert
