apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic house democrats will take their historic impeachment hearings in front of television cameras and the public for the first time wednesday to make the case that president trump broke the law in dealing with ukraine but the president insisted the effort to oust him is going absolutely nowhere mr trump who is the fourth president in u s history to undergo an impeachment push predicted the move would backfire with voters who don t want to risk trump era prosperity because of a murky power play in ukraine chairman adam b schiff of the house permanent select committee on intelligence will gavel open the impeachment hearing at 10 a m with two witnesses william taylor the former u s charge d affaires in ukraine and deputy assistant secretary of state george kent who oversaw ukraine policy both men have told lawmakers behind closed doors that they were concerned mr trump was politicizing u s policy in ukraine top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches mr schiff the california democrat whose earlier attempt to impeach mr trump over alleged russia collusion fizzled promised colleagues in a letter tuesday that he will treat the president fairly we intend to conduct these hearings with the seriousness and professionalism the public deserves mr schiff wrote the process will be fair to the president the committee members and the witnesses above all these hearings are intended to bring the facts to light for the american people in an interview with npr mr schiff said no decision on whether articles of impeachment should be brought against the president has been made but testimony thus far has suggested impeachable offenses such as bribery and high crimes and misdemeanors he also said the impeachment inquiry will be worth the political consequences of it failing to remove the president from office if impeachment deters further presidential misconduct then it may provide some remedy even in the absence of a conviction in the senate mr schiff said mr trump who will host the president of turkey at the white house wednesday said democrats are fixated on the impeachment inquiry instead of working for the good of the country on issues such as a new trade deal with canada and mexico democrats in washington would rather pursue outrageous hoaxes and delusional witch hunts which are going absolutely nowhere mr trump told business leaders in a speech to the economic club of new york tuesday don t worry about it the white house and its allies plan to confront the accusations aggressively hoping to portray the spectacle as a partisan goal in search of a crime republicans on the house judiciary committee which would consider any articles of impeachment called on democratic chairman jerrold nadler of new york to set up drastically different rules than those crafted by mr schiff they demanded any evidence that mr nadler may already have without it america will be left to wonder what chairman schiff chose to keep to himself the republicans wrote republican lawmakers are pushing for testimony from the anonymous government whistleblower who first complained about mr trump s july 25 phone call with the president of ukraine if the house democrats are going to use any evidence from this so called whistleblower they need to make this secret witness available for public cross examination said gop legal strategist mike davis whose name has been floated as a possible white house tactician for the impeachment proceedings he called the impeachment hearings a charade read the transcript of the phone call and even if everything that the house democrats allege is true it does not amount to quid pro quo corruption under any scenario he told the washington times house republicans also plan to emphasize that mr trump did not condition u s military aid to ukraine on his request for an investigation of democratic presidential candidate joseph r biden that ukrainian officials were not aware the military aid was on hold at the time of the call and that the funding was delivered in september without any move by ukraine to investigate mr biden the president is also reminding the public what s at stake particularly his economic leadership that has brought record high employment and prosperity from his agenda of tax cuts and deregulation he said there s no sensible alternative to him among 2020 democratic presidential candidates and said the bigger risk facing the country is the economic downturn ahead if any of his crazy democratic opponents win the presidency i think the biggest risk is the election mr trump said at the economic club i think we re going to do very well i think we re going to win it i think we re going to win it hopefully easily but it doesn t matter as long as we win it by a vote our country is strong our country is great our economy is probably the best it s ever been and we want to keep it that way pointing to democrats emphasis on renewable energy and their urgent concerns about climate change the president said i think these people have gone totally loco they will kill our industry mr trump predicted tell texas there will be no more drilling there will be no more oil and gas we ll put hundreds of thousands of people out of work we won t fuel our factories and now you re talking about millions and millions of people you re talking about a country that couldn t even exist these people i almost don t know is this politics because i think it s bad politics senate majority leader mitch mcconnell kentucky republican again challenged house speaker nancy pelosi to bring up for a vote the trade deal with canada and mexico saying it will boost an already strong economy house democrats have enough time to continue their three year old obsession with impeaching the president but they cannot find the time to pass a landmark trade deal that would create 176 000 new american jobs mr mcconnell said democratic aides working on the impeachment inquiry expressed eagerness tuesday for the public to hear televised testimony of the president s guilt after six weeks of closed door questioning of witnesses we think it s going to be a phenomenal week one democratic aide said the american people will hear evidence for themselves mr schiff said mr taylor mr kent and former ukraine ambassador marie yovanovitch who is scheduled to testify friday will begin to flesh out the details of the president s effort to coerce a foreign nation to engage in political investigations designed to help his campaign a corrupt undertaking that is evident from his own words on the july 25 call record they will describe their own experiences and how american policy towards ukraine was subverted to serve the president s personal political interests not the national interest mr schiff said democratic aides described ms yovanovitch who was removed from her post in kyiv as the first victim of the president s scheme in his october testimony mr kent told lawmakers that he was bothered by the role of the president s lawyer rudolph w giuliani in ukrainian foreign policy and the smear campaign that targeted ms yovanovitch both on social media and within the state department mr kent said he was alarmed by the effort to get ukraine to investigate mr biden and his son hunter and the 2016 election but he also repeatedly told the inquiry that there wasn t a quid pro quo transaction of u s military aid for those sought after investigations what s more he said he raised red flags in 2015 about hunter biden serving on the board of the ukrainian natural gas company burisma holdings back then he was rebuffed by one of then vice president joseph r biden s staffers behind closed doors republicans zeroed in on what basis could justify the president s interest in the investigations and are likely to do so again on wednesday the question really isn t were they in fact corrupt you can also view the question as is it possible for the president to have a good faith belief that there s something really nefarious going on samuel dewey a lawyer at mcdermott will and emery who used to lead congressional investigations told the washington times but mr schiff has warned that he won t allow republicans to undertake the same sham investigations into the bidens or mr trump s contention that ukraine not russia meddled in the 2016 election mr taylor is a key witness for democrats being the first official to say he believed military aid and a white house meeting were linked to ukrainians opening an investigation into mr biden he detailed what he understood to be two channels of foreign policy an official one he operated in which he focused on institution building and an irregular channel led by mr giuliani that focused specifically on the 2016 election and the biden family s connection to ukraine the diplomat testified that he heard this from ambassador to the european union gordon sondland who was working to set up a meeting between mr trump and ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky but mr taylor also acknowledged in his testimony last month that he didn t hear the july 25 phone call between mr trump and the ukrainian president he didn t see a transcript of the call until it was released in late september and he has never spoken to mr trump or mr giuliani ultimately this is a very simple story a democratic aide said the president abused his office and his presidential powers to force and pressure a foreign government to interfere with our election on his behalf ryan lovelace and s a mille
