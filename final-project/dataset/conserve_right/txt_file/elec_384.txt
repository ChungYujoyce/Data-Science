history portends large republican losses in november this factoid is firmly imbedded in the beltway belief system and in the algorithms used by most political analysts who predict that the democrats will capture the house and perhaps the senate as well forbesechoes the conventional wisdom historically the president s party performs poorly in the midterms like many things everyone knows this is spurious rot in reality it s unusual for either house to flip in the first midterm of a presidential administration and quite rare for power to shift in both houses of congress while it is indeed common for the president s party to suffer modest losses in a midterm election this rarely results in congressional power shifts since world war ii only two elected presidents have lost both houses of congress to the opposition party during their first terms eisenhower 1954 and clinton 1994 these are also the only years in which the senate has flipped during the first midterm of an administration the house has changed hands more often but this is not a regular occurrence since wwii it has flipped in the first midterm of only three elected presidents eisenhower 1954 clinton 1994 and obama 2010 why has the commentariat exaggerated the potential impact of this year s midterm curse they have either forgotten or ignored the unique political dynamics associated with a relatively new presidency compared to the more complex environment that usually prevails in the midst of any president s second term they have also underestimated the positive impact of president trump s high popularityamong republicans who turn out more reliably for midterms than do their democrat counterparts finally they don t grasp the implications of a recent gallup poll showing the republicans with a higher favorability ratingthan the democrats only one other time in the last decade has the republican party had a significantly higher score than the democratic party that one exception came in november 2014 immediately after elections that saw republicans capture control of the senate and expand their majority in the house and the news gets worse for the democrats who worry about that all important turnout number the percentage of republicans and leaners with favorable views of their party grew from 67 last september to 85 now the fact that republicans are more likely to view their party favorably than a year ago can be considered a positive indicator for the party particularly if a more positive image boosts republican turnout and what are the democrats doing to win back the trust of the electorate they have launched a strategy that combines calumny and clownish candidates to that end they have slandered widely respected jurist brett kavanaugh wildly popular rapper kanye west and even the voters themselves their rising stars are ridiculous charlatans like elizabeth warren who fraudulently claims to be native american fake chicano robert francis o rourke who was rejectedwhen he tried to join the congressional hispanic caucus and phony girl from the bronx alexandria ocasio cortez who was raised in westchester county new york if this strikes you as a losing strategy you re not alone the smear of supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh did notplay well with registered voters a harvard harris poll conductedat the end of his final hearing before the senate judiciary committee found that 69 percent of respondents considered the confirmation hearings a national disgrace even worse for democratic hopes of regaining a majority in either house of congress an npr poll conducted after the hearings foundthat the enthusiasm advantage they allegedly enjoyed during most of the year had evaporated after feinstein co raked kavanaugh over the coals and how did the attacks on kanye west turn out for them not too well when he left the democratic plantation to have a conversation with president trump at the white house california democrat jackie speier went on cnn and said i felt like i was sitting in on a psychiatric visit and a commercial for donald trump i would suggest that the president should curtail these kind of engagements that was of course accompanied by similar cheap shots by the talking heads candace owens of turning point usa explainedto laura ingraham how such attacks on west will work out for future democratic prospects the democrats rely on our vote so they will say whatever they can to smear him to make sure that no other black people wake up and understand that it has been the left that has harmed our community it has been democrat policies that have rendered our communities in the shape that they are in today when we talk about chicago and philadelphia and all the major cities that they have run down black people are having a mass awakening and kanye west is a big part of the reason why but alienating their most loyal constituents is by no means the dumbest tactic in the democratic tool kit they continue to insult the voters in general following the lead of hillary clinton who classified trump voters as deplorable joe biden recently impliedthat people who don t support democrats are the dregs of society and insulting the voters is not restricted to the beltway democrat kyrsten sinema who is running for the arizona senate seat soon to be vacated by jeff flake has referredto the copper state as the meth lab of democracy evidently calling her constituents crazy has long been a regularpart of her stump speech all of which means that the outcome of the midterms depends less on the arc of history than the ineptitude of the democrats even if history actually supported the claim that the president s party always gets clobbered in the midterms bumblers like biden sinema warren o rourke ocasio cortez et al will probably save the republicans the voters have heard the calumny and seen the clowns even worse they know the democrats want to hit them with high taxes open borders and single payer health care not to mention an impeachment charade that would put the kavanaugh circus to shame the gop congress is probably pretty safe the heroes act introduced tuesday by house speaker nancy pelosi read more in law school we
