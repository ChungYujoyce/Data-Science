thing almost all of them have in common is that they re not really enforceable we may have reached the point where most people are realizing that case in point the texas department of licensing and regulation has decided to drop 200 enforcement investigations into barbers and cosmetologists who returned to work in recent weeks the dallas morning newsreports the department is also dropping 180 cases that had not moved past the complaint stage so stop tattling on your neighborhood salons texans which seems like a clear admission that enforcing the shutdown is simply untenable the turning point in texas at least probably came a few weeks ago when a dallas salon owner shelley luther was sentenced to seven days in jail for reopening her business on april 24 the outrage over luther s arrest and sentencing eventually convinced gov greg abbott a republican to remove jail time as a punishment for people who violated the state s stay at home order the licensing department has now gone a step farther saying it will allow the reopening of cosmetology and barbering establishments retroactively to april 2 wiping out any violations from the past six weeks in wisconsin where the state supreme court last week struck down a statewide stay at home order counties are lifting their own lockdown orders due to mounting confusion over their legality but the bigger question again might be their enforcability i ve seen a lot of coverage of wisconsinites heading to bars in the wake of the supreme court ruling i haven t seen much evidence that people are getting arrested for violating local shutdown orders and in washington more than 25 000 complaints about alleged lockdown violations were filed across the state but as of may 8 the state had revoked exactly one business license as the days go on expect to see more anecdotal evidence like this update just now a local bellmawr police lieutenant walked up to front door owner of atilis gym said you re all in violation of governor s executive order that being said stay safe have a nice day and walked away crowd of supporters let out a loud cheer fox29philly pic twitter com m3xvbhfvv0 steve keeley keeleyfox29 may 18 2020 the government s role in all of this has always been more limited than either the bureaucrats drafting stay at home orders imagine or the protesters shouting about tyranny fear since forcibly quarantining 330 million people was never really possible the lockdowns that have wrecked the economy and slowed the spread of covid 19 over the past two months were ultimately based on voluntary compliance don t get me wrong there s been plenty of heavy handed enforcement in new york in california in wisconsin and in plenty of other places but it s been ineffectual and perhaps even counterproductive given that cops who get close enough to issue a citation or make an arrest are hardly practicing social distancing imagine what a public health disaster it might be if they were somehow capable of detaining or fining everyone who broke quarantine it certainly isn t the reason people have been practicing social distancing research from fivethirtyeight has shown pretty conclusively that most state level stay at home orders came days or even weeks after most americans were already staying home that remains true in places where governments are fighting to maintain lockdowns as compliance frays like in pennsylvania where gov tom wolf has threatened businesses with the loss of their licenses if they go along with county level reopening plans that move faster than his state issued directives and it remains true in places where lockdowns have already been lifted in georgia restaurant reservations are still 90 percent lower than they were at this same time last year according to data from opentable even though gov brian kemp has lifted the lockdown the biggest benefit that comes from lifting stay at home orders is an end to the charade that such lockdowns can be enforced kemp didn t reopen georgia all he did was give people consumers and businesses permission to choose their own acceptable levels of risk something they re doing anyway in every state governments at all levels should continue to provide accurate information about what s relatively safe like going to the beachor drinking outside and what isn t like getting together in big groups or using public transportation but enforcement should be reserved for where it can actually work an official order closing stadiums and the like seems reasonable jailing salon owners does not advertisement next two

week or two in an emergency but for as long as the government decides that it isn t safe for this to occur fuck you boehm seriously go fuck yourself you miserable ignorant cowardly authoritarian fuck that s pro china miserable ignorant cowardly authoritarian fuck to you sir an official order closing stadiums and the like seems reasonable small tariffs bad shut down entire business good only the ends matter sarah paul walker six months ago i lost my job and after that i was fortunate enough to stumble upon a great website which literally saved me i started working for them online and in a short time after i ve started averaging 15k a month the best thing was that cause i am not that computer savvy all i needed was some basic typing skills and internet access to start this is where to start for more detail no kidding where enforcement actually works like in your ass get lost creep who would ever want to be in a crowd with you anyway link john i was ok with limited temporary and time bound restrictions it made sense given how little we actually knew about the wuhan coronavirus toward the end of april my thinking changed on this mostly because of phailing phil murphy governor of the people s republic of nj and his health commissar judith m persichilli incompetent performance and the fact that we knew more about transmission and mitigation from my perspective they are both to blame for the thousands of deaths in nursing homes their policies directly contributed to the problem how they forced nursing homes to take patients infected with wuflu the deaths of our nursing home patients are on their heads in a just world they will be held personally accountable by a higher power stroke for stroke lash for lash life for life they truly deserve to reap what they have sown now in the people s republic we cannot assemble we cannot attend synagogue we cannot attend church we cannot petition for a redress of grievance otoh we can buy booze weed and go to the beach or a state park i have nothing but contempt for our elected leaders in the people s republic they are utterly contemptible i am pretty much exactly with you i was okay with it too because i thought it would be temporary and i thought he virus was much worse than it has actually turned out to be but we are now at the end of may this crap has to stop i was okay with it too because i thought it would be temporary i wonder how many people throughout history said the same thing too many trickyvic too many according to the data at https usafacts org visualizations coronavirus covid 19 spread map there are 3196 counties in the united states of those 1541 48 have zero reported covid deaths i happen to live in one of these counties a total of 1970 61 have zero or one reported covid death a total of 2458 77 have 5 or fewer reported covid deaths a total of 3075 96 have fewer than 100 reported covid deaths these 10 counties alone essex county nj suffolk county ny los angeles county ca nassau county ny wayne county mi new york county ny cook county il bronx county ny queens county ny kings county ny account for 30879 35 of all covid deaths in the us we ve shutdown the entire us basically for the benefit of nyc and across the bridge jersey and long island and bedroom communities in connecticut detroit chicago la new orleans and miami p s some 5400 or so covid deaths in ny state are being attributed to gov cuomos orders that mandated nursing homes you know the places filled with the people seemingly most vulnerable to respiratory ailments like covid accept active covid cases to keep them out of the hospitals this move is widely believed to have lit the proverbial match in nursing homes in ny state and ultimately killing thousands of the very same people we were all sheltering in place to avoid infected i swear to god i m going to pistol whip the next person who says social distancing https i makeagif com media 11 03 2015 k6pwft gif hey farva what s the name of that thing where you have to do all that goofy shit like standing 6 feet apart social distancing oh no not before the one who says new normal has been properly instructed on the inner workings of a wood chipper add we re all in this together to that or new normal the sooner we can shift to policies that balance public health fuck off slaver violations of your fundamental rights are not something that has to be narrowly tailored to some compelling government interest nope your rights are just another interest to be balanced with things like public health this is what boehm actually believes and he thinks that is the pro freedom libertarian position screw being a libertarian anyone with any sense should be able to see this is bullshit fuck off is right bookends quite nicely with the libertarian case for mask wearing this site shat out a couple of weeks ago link they have a search function https reason com 2020 05 05 masks can be a symbol of privacy and personal responsibility not tyranny you commented on that link overt and in a quite critical way of reason don t you remember that https reason com 2020 05 05 masks can be a symbol of privacy and personal responsibility not tyranny comment 8240910 i actually did do a search and that one came up and i honestly thought this cannot be the article they are talking about the day that enb in any way claims to make the libertarian case for anything is the day that i stop drinking but i do admit she tried pretty hard to bring first principles to bare but she ruined it by being so focused on cherry picking the worst actions of people and ascribing them to rush limbaugh or some other righty that obviously hides beneath her bed so i m safe from sobriety but i ll sub in a truly for a beer tonight to give her credit for trying sure gray jay we comment on lots of their articles here i certainly can t keep them straight nor do i usually care enough to try and use their search function overt is probably the same way hi overt lol we are all tulpa or mary ok overt if you dont care dont ask for citations i never understood that motive if you cant take 3 seconds to search why would someone think youd spend 30s on the link given true jesse and i usually don t ask for cites here nor do i have much patience for the cite cite method that often passes for discussion other places just making a comment on not being able to remember which thread you last posted in when it s really funny at other message boards where someone sometimes bumps a long ago thread you start reading it think of a response and get down to your own several year old post in the thread sure overt nope your rights are just another interest to be balanced with things like public health reason was once the batshit insane site where you could say they are crazy but at least they are principled any drug for anybody who wants it all taxation is theft no to any surveillance they were one of the few magazines fighting against the wars when even post 9 11 dems were getting in line the sad thing is that even as i have come around to be more libertarian over the past decade i probably started closer to john s ideology today reason has crept off the edge into this mushy liberal middle the reason the us keeps moving left and more authoritarian is that there are a thousand batshit crazy leftists continuously arguing in leftist publications for universal healthcare and other socialist nonsense perhaps the authors think that arguing from within the shifting overton window will keep then relevant but it really doesn t this this is why i fell in love with reason 30 or so years ago this is why only the comments section keeps me checking in you know overt i tried to address the restrictions on my relifgious free exercise rights the old fashioned way i wrote to my state assemblyman and state senator i asked that they act to restore our free exercise rights the response was deafening the assemblymen never bothered to respond my state senator this is pathetic his flunkie staffer wrote back we ll address religious rights sometime during the summer i was flabbergasted my conclusion religious life in the people s republic of nj will not be the same for a long time to come inside every progressive is a totalitarian yearning to break free we are incapable of doing anything in moderation shutting down big social events for a few weeks while we figured out what this virus was and we made sure it didn t spread so fast it overwhelmed the hospitals made sense and was i think constitutional since we can t do anything in moderation anymore and every power once used becomes permanent here we are months later and the government is still severely restricting people s fundamental rights with no end in sight and no evidence it is even doing what it is supposed to do you don t have to be a strict taxation is theft anarcho libertarian to see that that is wrong yet reason can t manage to do it what do you suppose is their motivation just to kill freedom for shits and giggles we still have by far the highest number of cases and deaths in the world my god do you do anything but whine tony the motivation might have started as trying to save lives now it is about control from twitter cnn s first amendment rights to freedom of the press are sacred your first amendment rights to assemble are optional if your assembly is a petri dish of infection can it really be called peaceable meanwhile in california newsome already crying about a 3ed wave of infections while threatening to cut off power and water to those that dont comply he is always crying mom didnt nurse him long enough or ever he s also threatening to fire first responders if his state isn t bailed out because first responders are the only non necessity in the state budget not the millions they just started spending to help illegals and all did anybody happen to notice that in wisconsin the shutdown was lifted by the court but within 24 hours the county health departments stepped in and put them right back under shutdown he mentioned pennsylvania but what wasn t mentioned is that licenses are considered a privilege so if a license is pulled even if a court reopens pennsylvania that license stays pulled or can be pulled at a whim it s been a bit more of a mixed bag in wisconsin than that some counties and or cities have doubled down on local lockdowns others have lifted the local lockdowns a couple of county execs even noted that any county stay at home orders would have the same legal issues that the state order had fascist judge whathisname hardest hit what am i saying he ll probably be re elected for the rest of his life so stop tattling on your neighborhood salons texans i suspect those mean spirited complaints come exclusively from ca refugees who fled oppressive state regulations and taxes in order to vote in oppressive state regulations and taxes i suspect those mean spirited complaints come exclusively from ca refugees who fled oppressive state regulations and taxes in order to vote in oppressive state regulations and taxes or illinois new york maryland massachusetts new jersey all are license plates i see regularly around here feel free to fuck off back to your home state if you don t like the way we do things here course there are few jobs where you came from and plenty here wonder why maryland is still working bigly and we thank all the other 48 states for their generous tax donations excluded virginia cause they get the even more graft sure overt there must be blood governments at all levels should continue to provide accurate information lol how are you expected to continue something that never started in the first place rumor has it george washington might have told the truth a couple times lies and propaganda he was known for clear cutting the nation s vast cherry tree forests also long live ken osmond eddie haskell was a role model the lockdowns that have wrecked the economy and slowed the spread of covid 19 over the past two months were ultimately based on voluntary compliance yea no by that definition everything is voluntary complying under threat of violence voluntary nooooooo not the precious immigrants this happening to shithole american citizens in shithole america is one thing but not the precious precious immigrants the undocumented restaurant workers who fed us are being forgotten this is their struggle https www latimes com food story 2020 05 15 undocumented restaurant workers coronavirus just barf not subjecting myself to that garbage brown people don t have rights the founding fathers somebody looked behind the curtain governments at all levels should continue to provide accurate information about what s relatively safe like going to the beach or drinking outside and what isn t like getting together in big groups or using public transportation they can t even provide consistent information let alone accurate the author is clearly unfamiliar with george carlin s first rule maybe texas needs a new government do the trains run on time debating the value of the initiation of violence threats thereof in a specific case e g the lockdown while accepting the political paradigm as such is a big mistake even if the result is beneficial in a given case it cannot be used to justify the worldwide coercive political monopoly presently destroying humanity sacrificing rights to socialism authoritarianism the choice is not obey or die it s disobey or live enslaved most choose to obey living a life not worth living will they wake up and grow up politically will they get up stand up for their rights the lockdowns that have wrecked the economy and slowed the spread of covid 19 over the past two months were ultimately based on voluntary compliance not really voluntary when the far left democrats and media bootlickers attempt to frighten the populace with lies about a virus that will kill few relative to the number of deaths that normally occur anyway they made every attempt to make sure their citizens were compliant now they make empty threats you will notice it s all democrats making those threats remember that in november
