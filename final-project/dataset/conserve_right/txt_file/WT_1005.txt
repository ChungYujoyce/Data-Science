apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the septuagenarian showdown between president trump and former vice president joseph r biden is on offering voters a stark choice of political styles and policy visions amid a pandemic that has frozen traditional campaigning and upended people s lives mr trump begins the race with 82 million more in his war chest while mr biden kicks off the contest as the preferred pick of most voters in head to head polls a monmouth university polling institute survey released thursday showed the 77 year old mr biden holds a 48 44 lead over the 73 year old mr trump which closely aligned with the same poll s findings last month top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state the static nature of these results suggests the president s response to the pandemic is certainly not helping his reelection prospects said patrick murray director of the independent polling institute the survey included additional warning signs for mr trump gop enthusiasm for voting has fallen off this year and half the voters including 55 of female voters have an unfavorable view of the commander in chief former president barack obama was in a stronger position at this point in 2012 when he held a 5 point polling lead over republican presidential nominee mitt romney as well as a cash advantage but mr trump proved against democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton in 2016 that polls don t necessarily predict the outcomes of races he also has remained immensely popular among his loyal band of supporters and is expected to take the same no holds barred approach against mr biden that he took against mrs clinton the election battle came into greater focus this week after sen bernard sanders suspended his second bid for the democratic presidential nomination mr biden will not officially capture enough delegates to win the nomination likely until june but he can now turn his full attention to the nov 3 election his next steps include settling on a running mate and wooing those far left voters who see him as part of the establishment against which mr sanders raged as part of that effort mr biden said thursday that he supports lowering medicare eligibility age to 60 from 65 and forgiving student debt for low income and middle class families who attended public universities and colleges and private historically black colleges and universities sen sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas and i m proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis mr biden said mr trump is also eyeing mr sanders backers telling reporters this week that a lot of those people voted for him in 2016 the bernie sanders people are big believers on what i m saying on trade mr trump said at a white house briefing and i got a lot of them in the last election that surprised people but it didn t surprise me ken farnaso deputy press secretary of the trump campaign said that the democratic establishment got the candidate they wanted president trump remains a disrupter in washington d c while biden is the very definition of establishment mr farnaso said and although bernie sanders won t be on the ballot in november his policies will be biden has adopted bernie s policies like ending the oil and gas industries free health care for illegal immigrants and raising taxes on almost all american taxpayers he said president trump has a clear record of success while joe biden is a relic trying to appeal to the far left a key to mr trump s victory in 2016 was his ability to punch through the blue wall states of pennsylvania wisconsin and michigan buoyed by the support of white working class voters he carried the three states by a total of fewer than 80 000 votes j miles coleman of the university of virginia s center of politics said the three states are expected to be in the thick of things again this fall we see michigan as the flukiest of trump s wins some of the recent trends there especially in the grand rapids area favor democrats mr coleman said mr trump carried michigan by fewer than 11 000 votes making him the first republican to win the state since george h w bush in 1988 the 2020 primary saw a spike in turnout in michigan where mr biden had a much stronger showing than mrs clinton did in the primary four years ago the latest
