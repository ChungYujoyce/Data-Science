severed ties with the splm n sudan accuses it of continuing to aid splm n fighters the clooney video produced with the advocacy group enough project shows graphic footage of a boy who lost both hands in an attack it also shows clooney speaking to a child who recently had a bullet removed from his body clooney asks one man during a conversation this is simply trying to clear people out ethnically because of the color of their skin the nuba man responds that sudan wants to move black nubans out and put arabs in boyette said that he has been frequently told by nubans that they are scared of the antonov airplane bombings so haven t been in the fields to plant but since they have used the rockets now they are scared to even get firewood and water nearby to cook for their children boyette said

that 250 000 people are on the brink of a famine clooney said in washington it was imperative for the world to move swiftly to open a humanitarian corridor to those in need when the rainy season starts it is impossible to get through clooney said there is a very very great possibility of a lot of people starving in the next few months the kony video produced by the advocacy group invisible children has received about 80 million views on youtube since its march 5 launch the video was applauded in some corners for raising awareness about kony and his group s attacks on civilians critics called the video misleading and accused it of being a fundraising vehicle for an organization some critics said doesn t spend enough on ground level programs jonathan hutson a spokesman for the enough project said clooney was not aware of the popularity of the kony video while filming the nuba people because he was in sudan during its release clooney is quoted in the kony video as saying he wants warlords to be as famous as he is but clooney was referring to sudan president omar al bashir not kony the purpose of the four minute video is for clooney to give a megaphone for the nuba people on the ground and to raise awareness hutson said clooney wanted to make sure that the nubans in the video were not portrayed as victims he wanted
