apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinion the miniature mid july ballet danced by american chinese and u n statisticians only obscures a much larger geopolitical drama china s unquenchable thirst for and america s unbreakable dependence on imported oil when an official from the u n international energy agency last week named china the world s no 1 energy consumer surpassing the u s zhou xi an a beijing energy official quickly snapped we should be on guard with those exaggerated statistics and what s more prevent the issue from being politicized top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time it may be the first time that a beijing with a clear propensity for gigantism from population overcounts to the olympics extravaganza to the elaborate shanghai expo 2010 to its growing bloated infrastructure has shown a preference for second place true americans do consume five times as much energy per capita as their chinese counterparts but the iea notes as with most chinese statistics beijing s 2009 energy numbers don t match its claims of gross domestic product it s no secret that subsidies general inefficiency and corruption have inflated chinese consumption levels there are other reasons for beijing s sensitivity in 2007 china zoomed by the u s as the world s largest producer of greenhouse gases getting most of its electricity from coal the dirtiest fossil fuel beijing is under growing pressure to clean up its act but mr zhou s irritability hints at something far more significant in the early 1990s beijing became a net oil importer and demand is growing exponentially as china moves into the motor age in 2009 china produced 13 79 million cars the world s largest market by june 2010 china consumed almost 10 million barrels of oil daily half of that total imported in several ways the u s and china may be returning to an old petroleum symbiosis in the industry s earliest years john d rockefeller s flamboyant distribution of millions of free mei foo kerosene lamps to chinese consumers was just part of building his monopoly alice tisdale hobart s novel oil for the lamps of china is a good read on an earlier generation s fascination with the marco polo myth of an inexhaustible chinese market today despite president obama s highly subsidized renewable energy resources schemes most analysts agree that the u s for decades will continue to depend on fossil fuels u s oil imports plateaued in the new century because of increased domestic production and greater efficiency standards in part produced by higher prices and higher auto mileage mandates there is of course the present dip because one hopes temporarily of the economic downturn but in 2008 the u s still consumed almost a quarter of the world s petroleum more than half of that imported between them the u s and china now burn nearly a third of the world s total predictions for a flattening of china s growth and improved energy efficiency are largely speculation so both countries are likely to increase their imports rapidly if and when the world economy recovers beijing despite its success in nailing down deals some lasting some ephemeral with would be suppliers from cuba to angola to kazakhstan faces some hard realities as with most consumers china s oil spigot turns on in the persian gulf china is already the biggest customer for saudi arabia with the world s largest reserves and beijing has bought heavily into renewed production in iraq which has the world s second largest reserves ironically china s energy lifeline depends on the u s navy s policing of the indian and pacific oceans as well as critical technology transfers from american and european based producers unhappy with that dependence beijing is busily seeking detours but pipelines from central asia into troubled westernmost xinjiang province thousands of miles from coastal industries off and on deals with moscow enmeshed in disputes over routes and pricing a proposed pipeline in burma to isolated yunnan province and an even more speculative pipeline project from a pakistani port at the entrance to the persian gulf all would still be band aids on the bigger problem so as domestic energy costs rise oil is increasingly a major concern for chinese planners as it is with washington that beijing has just had its largest oil related accident and is experiencing rising pollution levels of fisheries off northern china only adds to the parallels faced by planners in the two capitals china s no holds barred attempts at access to foreign oil already have complicated washington foreign policy in countries from nigeria to sudan to burma in fact beijing s growing consumption is the primary cause of rising world fuel prices competition for access to world oil will grow add that to other frictions in the sino american relationships from taiwan to north korean nukes to persistent trade and currency imbalances and it s not just the oil that may soon be combustible it was after all petroleum access that was the final straw in japan s 1930s conflict with the u s when washington s oil and steel embargoes in the summer of 1941 were followed just months later by the attack on pearl harbor no one would argue that chinese and american relations have reached that stage but that history is all too familiar to be dismissed sol sanders veteran foreign correspondent and
