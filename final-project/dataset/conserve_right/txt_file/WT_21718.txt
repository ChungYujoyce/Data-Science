apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic sen elizabeth warren was part of the pro impeachment stampede of presidential hopefuls in april taking to twitter to announce her support for ousting president trump but in the five weeks since former special counsel robert mueller testified to congress ms warren hasn t broached the subject on twitter focusing instead on themes of corporate greed mr trump s reckless handling of the economy and a congratulatory marriage shoutout to actor dwayne the rock johnson on the campaign trail ms warren and her fellow presidential hopefuls find themselves fielding more questions about health care and immigration than they do about the mueller report top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens bret niles chairman of the linn county democrats in iowa said candidates are responding to voters who seem to have decided that congress isn t going to remove mr trump i think most of them the candidates and the people i talk to they are resigned to the fact that no matter what the house does it is going to go nowhere in the senate mr niles said so why waste the time and energy to give trump another platform to talk about how everybody is out to get him some house democrats are still agitating for impeachment a majority of the party s house members have said they want to at least begin an impeachment inquiry and judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler new york democrat has told federal judges he is already in the middle of that inquiry but the presidential candidates out meeting voters in early primary states say it s just not an issue for the party s base in probably 30 different stops no one asked me about impeachment montana gov steve bullock told democratic strategist david axelrod in a recent interview for his axe files podcast what they do talk about is am i going to lose my rural hospital that s not to say democratic voters don t support impeachment polling shows they do but they are much more focused on health care and other bread and butter issues said patrick murray director of the polling institute at monmouth university when trump does come up it s about beating him at the ballot box mr murray said i think the presidential candidates realize that impeachment is not an issue that can help them break out of a crowded field so they spend less time talking about it monmouth s latest polling found 69 of democrats embrace impeachment but for respondents as a whole the issue is a loser with just 35 of all adults backing it there was a clear lack of interest in the issue this month at the iowa state fair a must attend cattle call that puts the candidates in direct contact with voters candidates who previously signaled support for impeachment didn t mention it in their stump speeches and voters offered praise for house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat who has tried to pump the brakes on her caucus push for impeachment it has been rare that i appreciate pelosi but i do at this point said david cline of polk city house democrats had hoped mr mueller s highly anticipated testimony on july 24 would present mr trump s behavior in such a poor light that the public would demand impeachment forcing reluctant republicans to go along instead mr mueller s appearance fell far short of what some democrats had hoped for there were a few sound bites but no damning information or smoking guns that weren t already in mr muellar s voluminous report mr mueller said he did not find evidence to accuse mr trump of conspiring with russia to subvert the 2016 election though there was evidence he wanted to thwart the investigation in the end the justice department concluded no charges could have been brought some house democrats remain undeterred with more than three dozen saying the mueller testimony was worrisome enough that they announced support for impeachment in the weeks afterward kevin mack lead strategist of need to impeach an anti trump group founded by democratic presidential candidate tom steyer said he doesn t see a disconnect between pro impeachment democrats on capitol hill and the candidates crisscrossing the nation who seem to have turned the page robert mueller s testimony showed there were 199 criminal charges 7 guilty pleas 37 indictments and trump s presidency can be defined as crimes corruption and obstruction of justice and it is up to congress to hold him accountable not the 2020 candidates he said mr mack said he is not surprised voters aren t talking impeachment to the presidential candidates not even i who runs the need to impeach campaign would choose impeachment as the no 1 issue he said ms warren became the first major presidential contender to call for impeachment on april 19 and others signaled their support including sen cory a booker of new jersey sen kamala d harris of california and former rep beto o rourke of texas the decision turned out to be a financial boon for warren campaign coffers according to a new york times analysis which found before her announcement there were 68 days in which she raised less than 50 000 but she surpassed that benchmark every day for two months afterward ms warren repeated her conclusions in a tweet on july 24 the day that mr mueller testified it s time to begin impeachment proceedings but she has gone silent since both on twitter and in a series of campaign stops including in seattle where she drew a crowd of 15 000 and focused her message on her plans to root out corruption empowering unions and enacting a wealth tax on the ultra rich the warren camp did not respond
