and disclosure activities that were intended to interfere with the u s election process hillary clinton calls those activities which revealed purloined emails that made her look bad during her unsuccessful presidential campaign an attack against our country and our electoral system that undermined the integrity of our democracy these overheated descriptions misleadingly equate information that guides voters choices with nullification of those choices a calmer less partisan perspective suggests that what clinton and obama view as interference with the election process might more accurately be described as voter education which strengthens democracy by helping its participants make better informed choices news reports routinely describe the leaking of emails stolen from the democratic national committee dnc and john podesta clinton s campaign chairman as election hacking john mccain the gop s 2008 presidential nominee seems to agree with that characterization in a cnn interview last month the arizona senator a harsh critic of donald trump who denounced him endorsed him and then withdrew his endorsement complained that by leaking information helpful to the republican nominee the russians have been able to interfere with our electoral process he warned that if they are able to harm the electoral process then they destroy democracy which is based on free and fair elections that take seems pretty hysterical in light of what actually happened true election hacking aimed at perpetrating voting fraud obviously would be a threat to the democratic process but there is no evidence of such interference and it s not even clear that the dnc and podesta emails had an impact on the election results or why it would be so terrible if they did the new york times reports that hackers gained access to the emails through standard phishing techniques tricking podesta and at least one dnc employee into revealing their passwords by pretending to be from google the times notes that every major publication including the times published multiple stories citing the d n c and podesta emails posted by wikileaks becoming a de facto instrument of russian intelligence those news organizations did that because much of the information in the emails including dnc officials disdain for clinton rival bernie sanders excerpts from her secret wall street speeches and observations about her weaknesses as a candidate concerned matters of legitimate public interest it was information that voters might rationally want to consider before deciding which candidate to support valuable journalism is often based on information that was obtained or divulged illegally by people with axes to grind it is hard to see how this case is different in principle is it the nationality of the informants that matters if the emails that embarrassed clinton had been swiped by americans would she still be talking about a democracy threatening attack on our electoral process last fall the times obtained parts of donald trump s 1995 tax return and shared them with the public if that information had come from a foreign source would publishing it have undermined democracy suppose german hackers had managed to obtain complete copies of trump s recent tax returns a subject of intense journalistic interest and shared them with news outlets either directly or through an intermediary like wikileaks would clinton have perceived the resulting expos s as undermining the electoral process or assisting it cybersecurity is a serious concern especially when it comes to systems that control important functions such as vote counting banking and the distribution of electricity helping politicians conceal facts that might alienate voters probably does not belong in the same category judging from the account in the times both the fbi and the dnc were remarkably lax in their initial responses to the intrusions that produced a bounty of newsworthy emails politicians with things to hide might want to be more careful about the security of the systems they use to discuss sensitive matters but we should not confuse their challenge with a threat to

the fatherland so i m gonna go through all of gary johnson s personal effects and papers to see if anything is of legitimate public interest but but don t i necessarily violate gary s privacy before i know if any of it is a legitimate public interest seig hiel go fuck yourself you run for public office you get zero privacy that s the deal it s the best way to prevent people from seeking government office laughing it s the best way to prevent people from seeking government office if if if nobody runs for public office then government would disappear hallelujah and fuck those crazy libertarians who think personal privacy is an unalienable right i ll further add that no personal privacy was violated once you email something anyone who can get their hands on it can do with it as they please the dnc is the very definition of misplaced trust your inability to understand the basic premise of email servers is your problem not a network admin s problem the same party that lies about proper vetting of syrian refugees proves they can t even do proper vetting of network administrators i personally am grateful for the information how it was hacked is one matter and may very well be illegal but having it released was nothing more than the public right to know and being informed about the shenanigans of those who would be president and you are certainly correct about sending an email and losing control over that information the had way as it is no longer yours i learned the hard way on that one and incurred the wrath of an angry physician but a good lesson learned to wish this otherwise is nothing less than wishing you could have concealed the truth in the hope for a different outcome and that does not pass the billboard test if you are faced with a difficult decision consider the options the one you could paste onto an interstate billboard with your name under it may not necessarily be the most advantageous or desirous but it is most likely the one you can live with and not get your ass in a sling over may very well be illegal but having it released was nothing more than the public right to know and being informed about the shenanigans of those who would be president even crime is okay if it damages the opposing tribe and you are certainly correct about sending an email and losing control over that information the had way as it is no longer yours strike two to wish this otherwise is nothing less than wishing you could have concealed the truth in the hope for a different outcome strike three the only people who defend personal privacy must have something to hide said every fascist ever if you are faced with a difficult decision consider the options the one you could paste onto an interstate billboard with your name under it may not necessarily be the most advantageous or desirous but it is most likely the one you can live with that s how you live with egregious violations of individual liberty it makes you comfortable already demolished but but don t i necessarily violate gary s privacy before i know if any of it is a legitimate public interest ummm yep a six year old child can see the simple logic but the authoritarian mind can justify anything for the fatherland goddamn statists even infest reason and you are certainly correct about sending an email and losing control over that information the had as it is no longer yours strike two it seems obvious that you lose control over info you email to other people because they could pass it along to others who you don t want to have it or it could be hacked could you explain what you mean in case i am missing your point email is considered a private form of communication the fact that someone on the other end might distribute your emails doesn t change that fact it is not something which is made public and arguing otherwise is not something that any honest person would say that is not to say that email is 100 secure but let s be honest here there wasn t anything in these emails everyone who claims otherwise is simply lying i ve read them every time i challenge someone every time to specifically point out what in the emails was nefarious people get suspiciously silent i wonder why it is because people want to believe there s something nefarious in there if you can call them people based on reports i read one of the dnc emails suggested using sanders religion or lack thereof against him the writer wanted to point out that sanders is an atheist taking advantage of prejudice against atheists and portray him as not fully jewish go read the dnc emails more objectively i ll further add that no personal privacy was violated he came back to make an even bigger ass of himself once you email something anyone who can get their hands on it can do with it as they please is he a fascist or a bigot the dnc is the very definition of misplaced trust a bigot your inability to understand the basic premise of email servers is your problem not a network admin s problem now he mindlessly drags in hillary s server the same party that lies about proper vetting of syrian refugees proves they can t even do proper vetting of network administrators behold the mindless tribal bigot my tone is partly in defense of raging aggression by a foulmouth thug and partly ridicule of abject ignorance got it it s okay to commit a violation of personal privacy if it s in the public interest dis is vast der fuhrer obama and fraulein clinton haff told us for past ahct years ja dis is vast der fuhrer obama and fraulein clinton haff told us for past ahct years ja he did it first mommy and obama s difficulties were all caused by bush lol there is a differnce between violating the privacy of a political candidate and undermining democracy both may be crimes but they are not the same crimes the real issue here is that the people having hysterics about the hacking think that our candidate lost and democracy is failing are the same thing true if we agree the raging hillary haters are just as morally corrupt tribalism it s okay to commit a violation of personal privacy if it s in the public interest but pussy grabbing why do you hate women gilmore it s okay to commit a violation of personal privacy if it s in the public interest but pussy grabbing why do you hate women yes my ridicule applies there aiso one hates the right of privacy the other hates or disrespects women got it it s okay to commit a violation of personal privacy if it s in the public interest for the good of the fatherland so i m gonna go through all of gary johnson s personal effects and papers to see if anything is of legitimate public interest but but don t i necessarily violate gary s privacy before i know if any of it is a legitimate public interest seig hiel sure you can go through gary johnson s emails and make them public but then you hacked the election and we just give the presidency to gary johnson at that point lest we further besmirch democracy and act like traitors sure you can go through gary johnson s emails and make them public but then you hacked the election and we just give the presidency to gary johnson at that point lest we further besmirch democracy and act like traitors in the dark world of tribal depravtiy defending the right of privacy means defending hillary sick it s not ok it s illegal and rightfully so however when it happens and you are a public figure in particular a politician it s asinine to claim that said information shouldn t be used against you fuck off hihn hahaha that s hihn say some more stuff about how my parents didn t raise me right hihn snickers you are commenting on the reason com giggles bully kudos to you to citizen x 1 4 17 10 13am bully 16 so far and counting like ventriloquist dummies or standing in line to kick somebody in the balls the tribal mind at play and not a single word on the topic of the page you sure that s hihn and not am he s been getting roundly ignored here lately and i must admit it s fun to watch him squirm when no one gives him any attention no it s hihn behold the absolute dumbass no one gives him any attention count the replies sparky four of them deny the right of privacy for purely fascist reasons but the vast majority like you are repeated aggressions however when it happens and you are a public figure in particular a politician it s asinine to claim that said information shouldn t be used against you lol fuck off hihn there is no unalienable and or god given right to privacy you sure for the love of deutschland it s sieg heil you imbecile you know who else used to hail victory in german arminius wagner bastian schweinsteiger boris becker max von sydow it was a draw neither side got the victory and hatch could not be a good goalkeeper walt disney merkel g nter grass you know who else used to hail victory in german you know who else doesn t recognize ridicule pope benedict xvi for the love of deutschland it s sieg heil you imbecile i m not the nazi here biut i do count 20 of them who was hacked i heard podesta claimed on a phishing email claiming to enlarge his penis with this one weird trick and that basically gave the information away also accessing dnc emails does not equate to altering vote tallies also accessing dnc emails does not equate to altering vote tallies two totally different and unrelated issues it s damn scare how many commenters pose that wacky strawman fallacy it doesn t hurt to point this out given that the democrats are trying to portray the republican win and republicans in general as illegitimate plenty of uninformed people believe what the dems say incredibly sadly most of them won t be reading this article and the comments no it s not ok to break in or spy or hack or any of a number of other ways people get information that nobody wants the to have on the other hand it s unconstitutional to block the press from reporting on what they get no matter how they got it that was completely upheld in the pentagon papers supreme court ruling the person who turned over the classified material could be punished for doing so but the news organizations couldn t be punished for using it once they got it on the other hand it s unconstitutional to block the press from reporting on what they get no matter how they got it do you have anything relevant oh next person who turned over the classified material could be punished for doing so despite all the crackers and goobers here who mimic totalitarians that there is no right to privacy if violating your rights is for the public good whoever illegitimately broke into the system and gained information should certainly face criminal charges with due process in the appropriate venue if it was an insider with access then maybe only civil remedies should apply but that doesn t mean that it s wrong for the public to consider the information so revealed or that it somehow tainted the legitimacy of the election i suspect the leaking of the pussygrabber video did more damage to trump than the leaking of the dnc emails did to hillary but so what it s okay to commit a violation of personal privacy pretty sure the dnc emails were business emails on a business server there s no personal privacy in that arena pretty sure the dnc emails were business emails on a business server there s no personal privacy in that arena so when i go to work when do i lose my unalienable rights the parking lot the building my own desk or work station as old as i am i have never seen such childish behavior as i am seeing in obama and clinton obama is doing everything he can to make sure trump does not have a smooth transition and clinton is still stomping her feet and blaming everyone but herself i am really starting to wonder what the heck is going on with democrats lately have gone flippin bonkers lol the candidate you voted for won not you you re still the same loser you always were all obama has done on the hacking is to take action as any president would when warned of and given evidence of malfeasance this is no bin laden determined to strike but you do come across as a sore loser even as your candidate of choice won where did he say who he voted for one of the trolls is having a bad day zeb 1 4 17 10 08am where did he say who he voted for true many libertarians show the identical partisan bigotry he could have voted for gary welcome to retardation a celebration now hopefully i m gonna dispel a few myths a few rumors first off the retarded don t rule the night they don t rule it nobody does and they don t run in packs and while they may not be as strong as apes don t lock eyes with em don t do it puts em on edge they might go into berzerker mode come at you like a whirling dervish all fists and elbows you might be screaming no no no and all they hear is who wants cake let me tell you something they all do they all want cake oh i asked yesterday if marconidarwin was a new sock for any of the old favorites any info on that could be addictionmyth since he s been getting ignored lately doesn t sound like him he s just a partisan ass in the tony mold am dajjal has a personality disorder of some sort maybe not as bad as the last crazy forum stalker but still evident only problem is obama doesn t know for sure that the russians were the hackers who provided the information to wikileaks julian assaunge sp says they weren t and i tend to trust him more than i trust obama hey the democrats nominated clinton the republicans nominated trump who is an actual criminal with a long history of corruption and bribery it isn t really surprising that the democrats are doing what any responsible person would be doing to try and limit the damage so you think hillary isn t corrupt lol my best uncal ex wife makes bucks75 hr on the laptop she has been unemployed for eight months but last month her income with big fat bonus was over bucks9000 just working on the laptop for a few hours read more on this site http www homejobs7 com my best uncal ex wife makes bucks wait she works for unical no wait she is a former californian and she like photography if you know what i mean nudge nudge wink wink who do i look like john podesta i m not falling for that one nice try russia ot so it s safe to assume every article by the reason staff is just more hyperbolic pants shitting by the usual suspects yes didn t bother reading but it seems to be the prevailing tenor whenever i m fool enough to do so actually reads article wellhell that s a horse of a different color not in this case read it didn t bother reading you don t say glances up birds of a feather no it s just what they use now when the post is just a link to a real article or column so it could be anyone i did like it better when they had the author s name there though and it s annoying that they include chapman it s usually seems to be one of the unholy trinity and i ve started to skim right past the stories titled as such it s irritating when you feel like you ve been duped into begining to read something because of they omit the author s name usually the author s name is somewhere in the h r post i d much prefer they just keep it in the byline though hacking is ok if your candidate wins that s when you put election hacking in quotes and call it voter education general skullduggery up to and including attempts to rig the election are perfectly alright as long as no one finds out about it eh comrade he seems really chapped that the malfeasance of the dnc and the hillary campaign have been exposed but not chapped by the malfeasance of the dnc and the hillary campaign hacking is not ok the media publishing the information obtained by the hacking is ok please explain how you arrive at the election was hacked from a political operative got phished gave his email creds to a stranger and had same dumped into the public domain election hacking sounds like tampering with election results which probably explains why a lot of people now believe despite the fact that not even the media or government are claiming such that russia tampered with election results it s a deliberate disinformation tactic you re whining because people are pushing back against your propaganda and the only purpose of your propaganda is to delegitimize election results that were aside from the shittiness of the candidates more or less normal leaks and all progressives have done everything short of mounting an armed coup and attempting to coerce electors to change their votes through threats of violence is already practically there it just reinforces the idea that you needed to be cut off cold turkey from power even if trump was the only means of doing so needed to be cut off cold turkey from power we still haven t seen locked in a bedroom shitting in a bucket seeing shit crawling on the ceiling rock bottom yet 1 trainspotting if there was election hacking it s not likely to have been of russian origin anyway voting machine irregularities actually showed votes being thrown to clinton not trump you must have missed the part where reason has been and is consistently against trump it s okay i totally understand that you just can t help your love for the pantsuit would clinton have perceived the resulting expos s as undermining the electoral process or assisting it judging from the account in the times both the fbi and the dnc were remarkably lax in their initial responses to the intrusions that produced a bounty of newsworthy emails that s because it wasn t a story until clinton lost the whole thing is a fake news campaign using repetition for effect i e if you repeat a lie enough times it becomes common knowledge there is still no evidence of russian government involvement but that doesn t stop fake news outlets like nyt from sticking russia in their headlines as if the science is settled there is still no evidence of russian government involvement yes because the cia misled bush about wmds no because they haven t provided anything beyond simple assertions this the evidence is pretty pathetic not to mention they is some unnamed source talking to the press here is good example of media s actual insight into us intelligence agency workings on this matter http www nbcnews com news us ng n702906 from the article also a senior u s intelligence official with direct knowledge of the situation told nbc news tuesday night that the heads of the nsa cia fbi and the director of national intelligence were always scheduled to meet with trump on friday another official had previously told nbc news that the briefing was scheduled for wednesday but that was apparently wrong so trump was thinking tuesday for intelligence briefing and mr senior leaker thought tuesday as well but both were wrong including trump himself senior leaker is also entire credible underpinning of russian hacking conspiracy putin death star etc etc there is no other public evidence beyond senior leaker the ineptitude of the leaker narrative effort sure smells like a barry obama operation also other private network security firms have pointed out the the bits of software the cia etal claim came from russia has been available on the open market for several years meaning anyone could have done it even our own cia so you came to reason to argue that bush wasn t to be blamed good luck selling that one maybe find a few women wearing white gloves and sell them ketchup you ll have better luck that s because it wasn t a story until clinton lost it s just a fascinating collection of statements it s not true nobody can prove the e mails are real those issues were already dealt with months ago she wasn t found legally guilty the fbi stopped investigating the fbi shouldn t have started investigating again the fbi shouldn t have stopped investigating again russia hacked the election by releasing these emails we lost because of those e mails the emails that the fbi investigated were separate emails than the those leaked by the dnc when they realized they needed a backup plan incase they didn t win the first time i had a pc on my desk was the late 80s they taught us not to write anything in an email you didn t want to read on the front page of the newspaper many of us have learned the hard way that once you click send it is no longer under your control and can be copied sent and distributed by anyone down the line sort of like the you d had sex with your partner and everyone they ve had sex with and who they d had sex with ad infinitum but in reverse it s what used to be called journalism they used to find out interesting and controversial stuff about political leaders confirm verify the facts then publish them without running the story past a political campaign you support filtering out stuff that might damage political allies or might offend people who you like anarchy the u s government used to fund radio free europe and radio liberty which were intended to give people in eastern europe and the soviet union information that their governments didn t want them to have i believe they continued after the fall of the soviet union into the era where the russian people actually voted in contested elections did they supply any information about the candidates were they undermining russian democracy if they did its okay when the right people do it is russia times the new radio liberty wikileaks apparently or when obama went to britain and said they would lose all their trade agreements with us if they voted for brexit or when his administration financed netanyahu s opponent looks like this article attracted retards from both sides of the aisle well done jacob bitardisanship nice so using that thread winner stolen if the emails that embarrassed clinton had been swiped by americans would she still be talking about a democracy threatening attack on our electoral process only in regards to the survivors if the emails that embarrassed clinton had been swiped by americans aside from the podesta phish the only info that we have from a british diplomat for some reason is that the dnc emails were leaked by an insider if true those were actually swiped by an american no and as i ve mentioned we ve all been quite content to demean government drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry bill ivey so we re sure at this point it was the russians we re not being too credulous with the obama administration someone has independently verified their claim somebody with a russian ip address tried to phish a lot of american politicians podesta and others in the dnc were stupid enough to fall for it and their free e mail accounts didn t protect them that seems to be all that s known assange claims the leak actually didn t come from russia to quote hillary wdatpdim i should say assange claims the leak actually didn t come from russia but from a disenchanted democratic insider that seems at least as plausible when i check the security logs on my sites i regularly find hacking attempts from ips in russia along with germany china kenya brazil and even the good old us of a how many states have now claimed dhs hacked into their election systems whatever happened to that story anyway perhaps an intrepid libertarian reporter might follow up on it same here bots i m assuming besides i d easily believe that the phishing emails were being sent through a vpn somebody with a russian ip address tried to phish a lot of american politicians actually no somebody with a russian ip address tried to phish a lot of americans a few of whom were politicians did the hacks actually swing the election at least in the mainstream media i didn t see much reporting about the podesta emails comey and the email server issue probably had a much larger effect though which way may be hard to determine who knows the only thing that concerns them is whether or not it is politically useful neither had an effect people had already made their decision on the hrc server scandal before the comey announcement and the hacked emails only confirmed what everybody knew about the dem primaries being rigged the over under on the number of votes impacted in a swing state is about 10 agreed the only ones paying attention to comey were the horrified democrat faithful and those hoping for a perp walk the comey letter almost certainly had an effect the proximity of the letter to the election hillary s numbers dropping immediately after and not fully rebounding and the closeness of several races in very important states suggests pretty strongly that the letter did have an effect it would be even be plausible to say that all else being equal if the letter doesn t happen hillary is the president the thing is the race was really close so a bunch of different factors could be filled in change only x and the outcome is different just because there are multiple things to fill in for x though doesn t diminish the importance of any one of them the letter was extremely important and consequential hillary s numbers dropping immediately after and not fully rebounding the timing doesn t quite work her numbers were dropping before the actual comey announcement but because of the way the poll publications lag the actual polling those drops were published right as comey made his announcement i m not disagreeing with you outright and a part of me hates making such a blatant appeal to authority but nate silver at fivethirtyeight said it had a significant effect i m pretty inclined to trust his analysis so maybe i am disagree with you i m just spitballing here but i would bet cash money that her not campaiging in wisconsin eschewing michigan for wherever else she decided to focus can t be bothered to remember what the staffer said and demonizing west virginia and pennsylvania had a hell of a lot more to do with her numbers than comey s letter totally agree and that s kind of my point on top of being a fundamentally weak candidate hillary s campaign made some rather glaring strategic errors that cost her badly the point is though because of a variety of factors the race was almost certainly going to be close in a close race every little bit matters i think there s pretty compelling evidence to say that comey s letter was on of those things that mattered enough to say all else being equal if comey didn t write that letter we could very well be talking about president elect clinton it s obviously perfectly fair to counter with if hillary wasn t just a crummy candidate or if she only did x instead of y the letter wouldn t have mattered but that being true doesn t make the letter being important untrue not just a crummy candidate but apparently if your assertion is correct an extremely fragile one comey s letter was weak sauce vague delivered even after some had already voted and he gave a mealy mouthed retraction of his intent a day or so after farting it out iirc if that was enough to take down queen hillary protectress of entitlement to the throne then maybe instead of sniveling and endless blah blah about comey third party voters and candidates russia sexism and election fraud lockstep dems could in the future consider promoting candidates who can t be toppled by what amounts to no more than a sneeze if a candidate is crummy they are by definition also fragile no a candidate that is weak will win by a small margin if at all ergo things that wouldn t prove fatal to a strong candidate can do in a weak one generally speaking weak and strong are correlated to a candidate s opponent and are not strictly objective things i think you are gravely misreading the context of the letter the vagueness of the letter the weak retraction the amount of days it took for the fbi to formally announce there was nothing to make of the situation all of that made the situation worse for clinton have the democrats considered not being scumbags not yet they re still busy whining about how their previous scumbaggery got exposed how quaint in modern society we know that good guys and bag guys are teams if the bad guys do the right thing it s proof of their machiavellian intentions when the good guys do bad things it s because they had no other choice to bring about peace and order and economic growth for all there s no reason not to be a scumbag being a scumbag no longer says anything about who you are as a person so long as you have right and good on your side except the dems are claiming they lost beceause the russians unfairly revealed the dirt on their activities if being a scumbag does not matter then being revealed as one does not matter and what the russians may or may not have done is irrelevant 1 the coon cthulu how dare you make such a sexist suggestion hrc loss butthurt committee scumbags why don t you point out all the scumbag things from those emails oh wait you can t everyone who didn t vote for clinton is a scumbag some of the people who did are too it s just the way things are a calmer less partisan perspective suggests that what clinton and obama view as interference with the election process might more accurately be described as voter education the left is much more obsessed with appearances and that obsession permeates everything they do the left is much more comfortable with people being appointed just because of their race they re more prone to believing that having people of various races in leadership positions is important just because the appearance of inclusiveness is important the progressive social justice left is particularly obsessed with what other people call signalling which really underscores the importance they place on appearances their obsessions about how racist speech or various aspects of the culture that seem to favor one orientation or gender over another underscore how important appearances are to the left political correctness is all about appearances the left can be brutal to celebrities that don t tow the left s line because the re so concerned about appearances can t have common people thinking that the right is okay so we all have to work together to make sure the right seems crazy mkay we miss something important about the left when we dismiss the progressives signaling as a side show it s the main event the progressive social justice left is particularly obsessed with what other people call signalling which really underscores the importance they place on appearances the proverbial screaming sandwich board man also sees unspoken signals in everything and therefore the dark hidden agendas in everything from micky d s to disney to the squirrel looking at sandwich board man from perch in a tree coincidence i keep hearing about the russians and assange and comey and and and excuse after excuse what i don t hear in the incessant babble from the bobble heads on teevee is what the dems are actually saying the dem s argument is simple hillary lost because people found out the truth and that wasn t supposed to happen i said previously that the dems were pissed because the stupid and gullible voted republican this time instead of democrat thats okay with me since denial is the first step to not recovering but it will leave a lot of idiots thinking trump is not legitimate but then they never accepted bush as legitimate despite all the proof otherwise so i won t worry about them except of course idiot rinos like mccain can really fuck it up imagine if the mexican government had the infamous grab her pussy tape and had been behind its release that would have by the media s current logic been hacking the election somehow i doubt they would see it that way however beyond that the democrats spend the entire fall claiming the dnc emails were a big nothing have they changed their minds just exactly whose vote was effected by the release of the emails and why was that it would be nice if someone asked that question and if vladimir putin were personally complicit in the hacking what precisely do they want us to do about that the answer is that they don t really want us to do anything they just don t want us to think that average americans rejected progressives for being progressives lets not forget all the foreign world leaders and foreign actors telling us stupid americans to not fall for trump isn t that also hacking a mexican national is actually the largest single shareholder i believe in the nyt should we conclude that the nyt is a mexican false flag op barry and the gang were spying on angela merkel s personal cellphone among other things not hacking gadgets and accounts at all only unseemly russians do that i don t think the left trying to get people to believe that the election was about russian hackers rather than white blue collar voters rejecting progressives and political correctness is a distraction from the left s perspective i think it speaks directly to appearances which is a giant part of what being on the left is all about can t have people thinking that average americans reject progressives for being progressives it must be comey s fault citizens united the koch brothers fake news or russian hackers valuable journalism is often based on information that was obtained or divulged illegally by people with axes to grind valuable journalism police work is often based on information that was obtained or divulged illegally by people with axes to grind it s kind of a shitty double standard sooo does the tag do something different now kind of a shitty link too let s just pretend the original actually says this valuable journalism police work is often based on information that was obtained or divulged illegally by people with axes to grind i recommend more drugs because i m such a nice guy i ll let you have it all you re a pal parky link is still sf d because it wasn t a link it was a strike through tag i must have hit a instead of s to open or close it ah okay then journalism leads to soft sanctions policework leads to legitimized violence so there s that yes indeed it s different when they do it that s what makes it a double standard whether i believe one side or the other is more legitimate doesn t change that yes and that man was found dead but the robbers didn t bother to take his wallet or phone funny that and there haven t been any similar attacks in that neighborhood before or since its almost like he was targetted it s stupid to talk about this topic like the data breach and the actual votes are inextricably linked the left is being ridiculously dishonest by doing so the right at least parts of them are playing the left s game by defending the hacking as a public service it s entirely possible to be in favor of voting with the most information possible and still oppose invasion of privacy by anyone both foreign and domestic in summary that sucks dnc let s not let it happen again but it doesn t change the election or undermine the president s legitimacy so all of the people in wisconsin ohio michigan and pa who voted for obama twice suddenly voted for trump in this election and gave him the presidency because of what they read in the dnc s emails that is what the democrats are claiming here they just don t put it that way because if they did it would be obvious how stupid their claim is you said the exact thing glide claimed is nonsense obama and the dnc would be wrong to say that the entire election was fraudulent because of the email hacks if they re even saying that i don t think they really are trump supporters defending the hacks as being for the public good are being incredibly cavalier with national security if the hacks did originate from a foreign power and the goal was to swing the election that absolutely is something the us should investigate and respond to sorry but jon podesta s private email is not a national security issue moreover neither is the dnc s email the dnc is a private organization i am not going to war or starting another cold war because they are too stupid to maintain network security beyond that how is the russians leaking this any different than nbc leaking the pussy tape both were actions taken in what the parties at the time were private and were later leaked to the public over their objection in order to affect the election yeah the russians are a hostile power but so what either leaking something that is private to tip the election is bad or it is not if it is okay for nbc to do it and i think it was then why is it such a big deal for the russians to do it as has been pointed out previously our government and many ngos do the same or similar things in other countries in the name of spreading democracy and shedding light on the nefarious doings of dictatorships for that matter angela merkel would love to have a word about email security and us intelligence agencies yes america is being hypocritical about the emails we re a nation of hypocrites in other news the sky is blue ok that s really flippant but i don t mean it as a personal attack what i getting a though is just because we d be colossal hypocrites to cry foul over russian hacking doesn t mean we shouldn t have some kind of response honest question though what response do you suggest i don t know maybe it s a cop out but i m a political enthusiast amateur and keyboard warrior the correct diplo political response is beyond my knowledge the phrase diplomatic pressure pops up over and over around issues like this we should do that i assume that means our diplomats speak very angrily to their diplomats and we tell them how hurt our feelings are slightly more seriously though i m confident there are ways we can cause reasonable sized headaches for the russian government deny visas delay regulatory approval for russian businesses that sort of thing stuff that pisses off the russian elite who in turn get on the cases of russian politicians basically there has to be a consequence ultimately we can t just let a country have nothing bad happen after they intentionally undermined our sovereignty i disagree nbc is a domestic news and journalist organization and it s their job to get scopes and compromise security within the bounds of journalistic ethics russia is an increasingly hostile foreign power there is a fundamental difference between the former and latter even if the ends in this case might amount to the same thing you have a point in that the dnc s response should be the same no matter who hacked them review their security measures and try to make sure it doesn t happen again but the dnc is not the federal government it s not really tenable politically for the federal government to let this slide not having some kind of response sends a clear message that not only can the us elections be fucked with the country attempting the fuckery won t even be risking anything that s not a good message to send the worst case scenario is that the russian government was directing russian criminals to hack into the dnc to discover embarrassing communications if true the russians hacked the dnc they did not hack the election i am so fucking tired of seeing this misrepresentation repeated in the press particularly here at reason and in the end the only thing the russian s accomplished was to confirm what clinton s enemies already believed 1 clinton and her direct reports were collecting paychecks from both the government and the clinton foundation at the same time and were using the foundation to extract fees from foreign nationals that wanted access to the government 2 the dnc was actively working to help the clinton campaign and suppress the sanders campaign the response of clinton supporters was to say see the media is out to get clinton it is highly unlikely that any undecided voters really knew about or cared about the hacking of the dnc emails everyone in government and corporate america knows that you don t put anything in an email you are not comfortable with being public hacking is a fact of life the fact that the dnc was too stupid to secure its server and that podesta fell for a fishing scam that your great aunt mildred could have seen through and also showed no personal discipline whatsoever about what they put into emails says everything about why they have no business in power and nothing about the evil russkies see my first post above don t write anything in email you don t want to read in the paper the hacking incident really proved how stupid podesta and the dnc are this is basic shit that you learn as an intern it is so basic even people who work in government understand it the fact that these people work in politics and all have likely worked in government makes it even more amazing government is subject to foia and congressional oversight everything you write in a government email that is not classified is subject to be on the front page of the paper everyone in government knows that yet these idiots were so arrogant and so stupid they didn t think that was true of their private email account everything you write in a government email that is not classified is subject to be on the front page of the paper i guess your intern training didn t include the meaning of fouo i am well aware of that and the privacy act that however doesn t detract from the larger point just because they redact the names and privacy act info doesn t mean you should be any less careful about what you put in emails moreover you shouldn t be putting privacy act or fouo data in unencrypted emails in the first place on an internal server sending emails across the full blown internet is another thing but on an internal server you need to encrypt yet these idiots were so arrogant and so stupid they didn t think that was true of their private email account umm yeah because private email servers aren t subject to foia the only way the contents of private emails get in the newspaper is via illegal hacking or an insider s violation of nda they are not subject to foia but they can as we found out be hacked and the habits that you learn in government should have translated but dind t you are forgetting that we are referring to the dnc and hillary and they believed they could do anything because they are above the law which comey proved when he decided not to prosecute hillary for clearly criminal acts concerning classified emails this goes all the way back to bill clinton s presidency they have no fear of the government that s why you avoid foia by using a fake email address with a random name or put all your emails on a private server in your bathroom and then delete whatever you don t want people to see before handing it over what could go wrong don t write anything in email you don t want to read in the paper that might sound good when you say it but it makes email fairly useless for a lot of purposes if i order a gallon of personal lubricant from amazon i get an email confirming my purchase and giving tracking information with my name and address probably don t want that to be in the newspaper am i supposed to just not order anything i don t want the public to know about or go to a physical store to buy it not to mention that internal company email is fairly useless if you can t discuss proprietary business information note that the dnc had a private email server they weren t using gmail for these emails and you guys are complaining about the govt being able to read metadata not even the actual content of emails on friggin gmail how does that square with your maxim above nobody is saying email ought to be insecure they re saying that it is insecure it s a limitation of the technology it s no more secure than physical mail or passing a note through a classroom in that context your privacy exists largely at the mercy and discretion of the agents you re relying on to convey your message it s no more secure than physical mail or passing a note through a classroom internal email on a private server no way yeah if you send an unencrypted email to your friend on another network every node between you and them has access to it but that wasn t the case here even then there s a certain amount of protection from being a needle in a haystack discovery you should become familiar with this word i am familiar with it and it s a lot harder to do than intercepting a note being passed or raiding a physical mailbox and as i noted below proprietary info is privileged from discovery yes chip you should be very careful about putting proprietary information in emails i handle a fair amount of such at my regular job and i never put the details of it in emails if your employer doesn t understand that they have a problem as far as embarrassing shit you shouldn t be doing things at your job that would embarrass you it is the old rule don t do anything professionally you wouldn t be willing to tell your mother follow that rule and it won t matter if they hack your emails and you also can get your work done that would be completely unworkable especially with a distributed team at some point you have to trust that your company s email server is secure i m curious to know how you do discuss proprietary info with people who aren t sitting next to you phone even less secure than email morse code smoke signals as far as embarrassing shit you shouldn t be doing things at your job that would embarrass you i didn t say i was doing it with my work email my personal email on gmail or yahoo or whatever is far less secure than my work email so kinnath s rule should apply even more so buying lube is a lot different than selling government favors they overlap more than you might think email is useless for lots of purposes if you don t do end to end encryption even secure email systems are subject to discovery so don t write anything in an email you don t want to see on the front page of the local paper or talk about in the witness stand period even secure email systems are subject to discovery in which proprietary information such as trade secrets are considered privileged period that privilege is not absolute you may assert it but it can be swept aside by a judge you don t put anything in an email you are not comfortable with being public hacking is a fact of life so are misdirected emails which is the real reason you don t do that once you send it you can t control what happens with it forwarded email gets forwarded to all sorts of places and from what i ve been told those warnings some companies put at the bottom of emails about it being privileged information or something count for jack shit you already know that education must be avoided at all costs lack of transparency is a huge political advantage and basically you know call it the stupidity of the american voter or whatever but basically that was really really critical to getting the thing to pass jonathan gruber meanwhile democrats and their followers were offering money to anyone who could come up with info on trump by any means possible would that not also have been hacking if you use the democrats terms i am sure they would turn down useful and embarrassing information about trump if it were offered by the chinese the democrats are just patriotic like that who do they think they are kidding with this shit other than themselves so assange just came out and said that podesta s password was password top men what wasn t assange s claim that the emails were obtained via an insider not a hack then how would he know the password the dnc emails podesta s emails were obtained through a phishing scheme which apparently wasn t even necessary i use 1234 for my luggage someone here may have used this recently but since you took the spaceballs reference it could still be internal if one of his own lackys decided to down load the info and once that got out anyone could get in wasn t assange s claim that the emails were obtained via an insider not a hack when guessing passwords counts as hacking everything is hacking encryption is bad mmkay remember kids it s hacking if it hasn t been completely scrubbed by media government special interest groups before it gets in your hands it s one step above fake news and fake sports jerseys since romney s 47 speech got election hacked in 2012 i guess obama s actions for the last 4years are null and void and he owes a lot of rent back pay and 747 usage wasn t hacked just illegally recorded by somebody they were stupid to invite there is no evidence of a hack until there is this is just an un named dnc operative releasing the emails naturally the dnc wants you to believe falsehoods or a named and murdered dnc operative i personally am grateful for the information how it was hacked is one matter and may very well be illegal but having it released was nothing more than the public right to know and being informed about the shenanigans of those who would be president to wish this otherwise is nothing less than wishing you could have concealed the truth in the hope for a different outcome and that does not pass the billboard test if you are faced with a difficult decision consider the options the one you could paste onto an interstate billboard with your name under it may not necessarily be the most advantageous or desirous but it is most likely the one you can live with and not get your ass in a sling over it s not even clear that the dnc and podesta emails had an impact on the election results or why it would be so terrible if they did hillary lost it couldn t possibly be because she was a lousy candidate or that many voters didn t want nixon in a pantsuit as president so it s obviously the fault of those dastardly russian hackers it is known derp they ll reach for any excuse that doesn t require them to face the cold hard truth that hillary was quite probably the most corrupt person to ever the seek the presidency or that hard left progressive policies just aren t that popular outside of their little ideological bubbles if they didn t have the russian hackers to blame they d find something else to blame the loss on history s greatest scapegoats 1 the actual scapegoat from israel bce 2 patient zero 3 jonah 4 dreyfus 5 trotskey 6 the devil made me do it oh and now 7 the russians 8 the fbi her campaign literally couldn t get over its massive elitist sense of entitlement and self satisfaction long enough to save its own ass after cheating her way into the nomination like a fucking gypsy she or her handlers had to know they d need to win over the angry cheated and defeated bernieprogs but they couldn t even do that assuming they were entitled to the bernieprog vote they treated his supporters the same way they treat their el salvadoran nannies and housekeepers we need you but you re garbage they badly needed the millenials of the left but couldn t stop insulting and browbeating them long enough even to find out what might motivate them you kids get off my lawn you never show up to the polls anyway go back to taking selfies and let the adults talk was how they addressed the millenial bloc they would need to win so millenials peaced out maybe i just don t remember long enough back but i can t ever recall a campaign that tried harder than hillary s to alienate the very voters it would need to win so i assume you re against foreigners taking jobs in the usa because they re foreigners not citizens they don t have a right to work here and foreigners don t have the same rights to try to affect the outcome of american elections that americans do because this is really very simple they re not americans it s bad enough when american plutocrats union bosses and other special interests manipulate elections and get their hooks into our politicians but i have to put up with it because this is a democracy and they have a voice in the process just like everyone else but putin isn t supposed to have a voice in the process and if it s true that he put his thumb on the scale and made trump president then trump is going to be putin s bitch and that is very bad read george washington s freakin farewell address and you ll get the idea politicians with things to hide might want to be more careful about the security of the systems they use to discuss sensitive matters once again it shows that the more you lie the more you have to remember we all know how honest most politicians are unfortunately they are to dumb to remember that they are etching their lies in stone why don t you list off all the lies then the problem with this argument is that people believe blantantly untrue things about the emails people assumed that because they were private they had to contain something nefarious and the fact that they did not did not change anything people simply assumed they were nefarious as such claiming voter education is not something any reasonable person can claim it was a smear job pure and simple so yeah its origin should be suspect because the goal was to influence the election and there wasn t actually anything in there omg the lulz they had to contain something nefarious and the fact that they did not clearly spoken by someone who hasn t read any of them i ll just give you an appetizer clinton being the venal whore that she is voted for a 2001 bankruptcy restriction bill that had the prog vagina vote shrieking about her disloyalty because she s a coward who couldn t simply say she voted for it because people have a responsibility to pay back debt that they incur clinton got on abc news and lied out her ass about why she voted for the bill claiming that many women s groups had pressured her to vote for it because they wanted to ensure deadbeat dads didn t use bankruptcy as a way of escaping child support obligations in podesta s mails you see the thread where team clinton has to do damage control for that lie because contrary to what clinton told america women s groups were pressuring her to do the exact opposite preserve easy bankruptcy you get to read her aides scrambling to find any women s group or some female senator to back her up or cover for clinton s wholly fabricated claims they can t that s just one example there is a lot of nefarious stuff in these mails here find out for yourself sullum makes a good point would the left be so hysterical if it were american hackers doing the damage or if god help them american journalists uncovered some of this same information remember how liberals had no problem with mitt romney being illegally taped talking about the 47 but the dnc and podesta emails being hacked is a major crime that should be punished with death the hypocritical hysterics over the alleged russian hacking is simply meant to delegitimize trump s presidency i am certainly no fan of trump s but even i can see this is just liberals
