obama s re election campaign unveiled its new slogan some conservative critics were quick to pounce forward they asserted is a word long associated with europe s radical left its choice reaffirmed their contention that obama is to some degree or other a socialist a claim that surfaced early in the 2008 campaign and has persisted ever since fueling a lively industry of bumper stickers and books new obama slogan has long ties to marxism socialism read a headline in the washington times a column by russian immigrant svetlana kunin for investor s business daily said obama seeks to move america forward to total government involvement in people s lives top stories russian fighter jets intercept u s navy patrol aircraft over mediterranean coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history 500 doctors tell trump to end the coronavirus shutdown say it will cause more deaths this is far from a new phenomenon the use of socialist as a political epithet in the u s dates back to pre civil war days when abolitionist newspaper editor horace greeley was branded a socialist by some pro slavery adversaries in the 20th century many elements of franklin roosevelt s new deal including social security were denounced as socialist so was medicare when it was created in the 1960s but to many historians and political scientists and to actual socialists as well the persistent claim that obama is a socialist lacks credence he s widely seen as a pragmatist within the democratic party mainstream who s had ample success raising campaign funds from wealthy wall street capitalists even some of his strongest critics acknowledge that his administration hasn t sought one of the classic forms of socialism government control of the nation s means of production terence ball a political scientist at arizona state university said socialist has gained currency as an anti obama slur because the l word liberal has lost it shock value i grow weary of obama and the democrats being called socialist said ball who has written about ideologies if you talk to any real socialist they disown them very very quickly full fledged u s socialists are relatively scarce these days three socialist oriented presidential candidates received about 21 000 votes among them in 2008 and current socialist leaders don t share the right wing view that obama is a fellow traveler it makes absolutely no sense said greg pason national secretary of the socialist party usa obama s health care overhaul is anything but socialist it s bailing out for profit companies yet pason has been pleased by the socialist rhetoric we ve had an opportunity to talk to people and that s been a blessing he said people have actually researched socialist organizations one tidbit they might learn the pledge of allegiance the epitome of american patriotism was written in 1892 by a socialist clergyman francis bellamy when the 2012 republican presidential campaign was still competitive three of the leading candidates rick perry newt gingrich and michele bachmann depicted obama as a socialist mitt romney the eventual winner declined to go that far i don t use the word socialist or i haven t so far romney told cnn in an interview last year but i do agree that the president s approach is government heavy government intensive and it s not working in one of the gop debates romney asserted that obama takes his political inspiration from europe from the socialist democrats in europe radio host rush limbaugh was among several conservatives who chided romney for his reluctance to call obama a socialist outright you know i keep forgetting the fact that obama is black is why we can t call him a socialist limbaugh said on one of his shows that had slipped my mind because when i look at obama i don t see black i see a socialist i see a marxist a slew of books have been written by conservative authors trying to out obama as socialist among the more ambitious in terms of research was radical in chief by stanley kurtz a senior fellow at the ethics and public policy center a conservative washington think tank delving into obama s years as a student and a community organizer kurtz contended that obama is part of a coterie of stealth socialists over the long term obama s plans are designed to ensnare the country in a new socialism a stealth socialism that masquerades as a traditional sense of fair play a soft but pernicious socialism similar to that currently strangling the economies of europe kurtz wrote in much of today s world socialism lacks the contentious overtones that it has in america the new french president francois hollande is a socialist and most of western europe adheres to socialist style policies that endure under a variety of governing parties canada which resembles the u s in so many ways has a universal health care system and its main opposition party the new democrats is union backed and has socialist roots one of the few contemporary u s politicians to embrace the socialist label is sen bernie sanders of vermont he formally lists himself as an independent but throughout his career including stints as a mayor and house member he s described himself as a democratic socialist branding someone as a socialist has become the slur du jour by leading lights of the american right from newt gingrich to rush limbaugh sanders said in 2009 if we could get beyond such nonsense i think this country could use a good debate about what goes on here compared to places with a long social democratic tradition like sweden norway and finland where by and large the middle class has a far higher standard of living than we do the roots of socialism in america can be traced to the arrival of german immigrants in the 1850s according to rutgers university professor norman markowitz who teaches the history of socialism and communism the socialist party of america grew significantly in the early 20th century under the leadership of union organizer eugene v debs electing a congressman and dozens of mayors debs ran for president five times getting more than 913 000 votes in 1920 the party s high water mark at the time debs was in prison on charges that he had urged resistance to the draft during world war i the party s following eroded during the 1920s and debs was succeeded as leader by norman thomas a presbyterian minister in new york during the great depression thomas received 892 000 votes in the 1932 presidential election as franklin roosevelt won the first of his four victories after world war ii the anti communist crusade led by sen joseph mccarthy and the broader tensions of the cold war relegated organized socialism in the u s to the political margins the term creeping socialism emerged used by conservatives to denigrate various policy proposals and initiatives that involved a role for the government after the cold war s end use of socialist as a political insult also receded markowitz believes its recent revival relates directly to the animosity toward obama that is shared by a certain segment of americans there s this hysterical outbreak of abuse to prove that the president is not american that he s a secret muslim that policies that past republican administrations would have adopted are part of a socialist communist conspiracy markowitz said due in part to the multiple definitions of socialism some conservatives wrestle with semantics as they seek appropriate terms for obama s ideology instinctively the president is a collectivist said ken blackwell former ohio secretary of state and now a conservative commentator my fundamental belief is that he wants to transform our market economy into a government controlled economy not far afield from european style socialism steven hayward a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute and author of a two volume biography of ronald reagan said obama is not a socialist under the strict definitions of that term central economic planning and government control of production however socialism has a secondary meaning that is harder to explain government regulations supervision of the private economy hayward said the problem now with obama is what does he really think ezra klein a blogger and columnist for the washington post tackled the issue recently in a posting headlined barack obama worst socialist ever klein cited data indicating that the government sector of the economy shrank during the past three years if president obama is truly a socialist klein wrote then he s not a very good one copyright 2020 the washington
