apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russians prefer their lay s potato chips dusted in caviar and crab flavors the chinese like their oreos stuffed with mango and orange cream and in spain kellogg s all bran cereal is served floating in hot coffee instead of cold milk americans might get squeamish at the thought of their favorite snacks being tweaked but what works in the u s doesn t always work everywhere else in other words lee linthicum a market researcher said it can t be some generic mix of spices that might fool an american top stories oregon becomes first state to offer

19 funds food makers long have tinkered with their products to appeal to regional tastes but getting the recipe just right is becoming more important than ever that s partly because people in developing nations such as china and india are gaining more of an appetite for american style on the go foods as they work longer hours and have less time to cook but it s mostly because snack makers increasingly are looking for growth in other parts of the world as sales slow at home growth in the snack food industry has been virtually flat in the u s for the past two years according to market research firm euromonitor meanwhile combined sales in china brazil and russia three major developing markets rose 15 percent in 2010 and 11 percent last year to 17 billion that is half the size of the u s market but it s growing the challenge for snack makers is that people in other countries have different tastes consider the oreo which kraft foods inc introduced in china in 1996 sales of the vanilla cream filled chocolate cookie sandwich were respectable there but the chinese didn t completely take to it so kraft decided to tweak the oreo but executives of the northfield ill based company knew they had to proceed with caution when you have a brand that s 100 years old you don t mess with the recipe thoughtlessly said lorna davis head of the company s global cookies business in 2006 kraft began offering the oreo as a wafer a popular cookie throughout asia it is made up of cream sandwiched between crispy wafers the plan was to help familiarize more chinese customers with the brand three years later the company went a step further kraft worked with a panel of consumer taste specialists from around the world to identify the characteristics of the oreo including color crunchiness bitterness color that were likely to appeal to chinese consumers executives learned through research that the chinese don t like their treats as big or as sweet as americans do so the company rejiggered the recipe to create a cookie that was a tad smaller and a touch less sweet to test the recipe hundreds of chinese consumers tasted the new oreo it was a hit it made us realize the smallest of details make a big difference ms davis says but the company wasn t finished after noticing sales of oreos were lagging in china during the summer kraft added a green tea ice cream flavor the cookie combined a popular local flavor with the cooling imagery of ice cream the green tea version sold well and a year later kraft rolled out oreos in flavors that are popular in asian desserts raspberry and blueberry and mango and orange the result over the past five years kraft said sales have grown an average of 60 percent a year although it declined to give revenue amounts the oreo now is the top selling cookie in china with a market share of 13 percent the previous top cookie was made by a chinese company kellogg co the world s largest cereal maker also has intensified its focus on catering to local tastes as it attempts to expand its snack business overseas last year the company s revenue in latin america topped 1 billion for the first time in february kellogg said it agreed to buy the pringles chip brand from procter gamble co for 2 7 billion the deal will nearly triple its international snack business making it the world s second largest snack maker behind pepsico inc the company based in battle creek mich already sells products in more than 180 countries it is learning that on the ground insights can pay off in europe for instance kellogg for many years marketed its cereals there just as it did in the u s but it failed to take into account that many in the region don t drink cold milk in the morning now an american traveling in spain might find it surreal to see tv ads showing all bran cereal floating in a steaming cup of coffee kellogg which makes keebler cheez it and kashi bars declined to give details on how well the cereal is selling there but it said the marketing has resulted in great results a similar story played out for pepsico for the first time last year revenue from the company s international snacks division surpassed revenue in north america to achieve that pepsico has had to adjust its recipes in 2005 pepsico s food division began a quest to make its lay s potato chips more appealing to local tastes in russia it wasn t easy russians still like packaged versions of a soviet era snack stale bread slathered in oil and baked to a crisp to get a better sense of what russians like employees traveled across the country to visit people in their homes and talk about what they eat day to day that was a big task russia has nine time zones and spans 7 000 miles with eating habits that vary by region the findings were invaluable for executives at the company s purchase n y headquarters in the eastern part of the country pepsico found that fish is a big part of the diet so it introduced crab chips in 2006 it s now the third most popular flavor in the country a red caviar flavor does best in moscow where caviar is particularly popular pickled cucumber which piggybacks off of a traditional appetizer throughout russia was intr
