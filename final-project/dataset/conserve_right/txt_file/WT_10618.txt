apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap jittery chinese authorities wary of any domestic dissent staged a concerted show of force sunday to squelch a mysterious online call for a jasmine revolution apparently modeled after pro democracy demonstrations sweeping the middle east authorities detained activists increased the number of police on the streets disconnected some mobile phone text messaging services and censored internet postings about the call to stage protests at 2 p m in beijing shanghai and 11 other major cities the campaign did not gain much traction among ordinary citizens and the chances of overthrowing the communist government are slim considering beijing s tight controls over the media and internet a student led pro democracy movement in 1989 was crushed by the military and hundreds perhaps thousands were killed top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk ravi zacharias may be the

one of whom tried to lay down white jasmine flowers while hundreds of people milled about the protest gathering spot outside a mcdonald s on the capital s busiest shopping street in shanghai police led away three people near the planned protest spot after they scuffled in an apparent bid to grab the attention of passers by many activists said they didn t know who was behind the campaign and weren t sure what to make of the call to protest which first circulated saturday on the u s based chinese language news website boxun com the unsigned notice called for a jasmine revolution the name given to the tunisian protest movement and urged people to take responsibility for the future participants were urged to shout we want food we want work we want housing we want fairness a slogan that highlights common complaints among chinese the call is likely to fuel anxiety among china s authoritarian government which is ever alert for domestic discontent and has appeared unnerved by recent protests in egypt tunisia bahrain yemen algeria and libya it has limited media reports about them stressing the instability caused by the protests and restricted internet searches to keep chinese uninformed about middle easterners grievances against their autocratic rulers on saturday in a speech to national and provincial officials president hu jintao ordered them to solve prominent problems which might harm the harmony and stability of the society china s extensive filtering and monitoring of the internet meant that most chinese were unlikely to know about saturday s call to protest

sitting in the mcdonald s after the brief protest in beijing said he saw sunday s gathering as a dry run lots of people in here are twitter users and came to watch like me said 42 year old hu di actually this didn t have much organization but it s a chance to meet each other it s like preparing for the future with foot traffic always heavy at the wangfujing pedestrian mall it was difficult to discern who showed up to protest who came to watch and who was out shopping rubberneckers outnumbered any potential protesters many wondered if there was a celebrity in the area because of the heavy police presence and dozens of foreign reporters and news cameras as the crowd swelled back and forth and police urged people to move on 25 year old liu xiaobai placed a white jasmine flower on a planter in front of the mcdonald s and took some photos with his cell phone i m quite scared because they took away my phone i just put down some white flowers what s wrong with that mr liu said afterward i m just a normal citizen and i just want peace security agents tried to take away mr liu but he was swarmed by journalists and eventually was seen walking away with a friend two other people were taken away by police including a shabbily dressed old man who was cursing and shouting though it wasn t clear if he was there because of the online call to protest in shanghai three young men were taken away from outside a starbucks coffee shop in people s square by police who refused to answer reporters questions about why they were detained they trio had been shouting complaints about the government and that food prices are too high a couple dozen older people were drawn to the commotion and started voicing their own complaints and saying they wanted democracy and the right to vote one woman jumped up on a roadside cement block to shout the government are all hooligans then ran off only to return a bit later and shout again at the police and others crowded in the area before once again scampering away security officials were relaxed toward the retirees and the crowd eventually drifted away there were no reports of protests in other cities where people were urged to gather such as guangzhou tianjin wuhan and chengdu ahead of the planned protests human rights groups estimated that anywhere from several dozen to more than 100 activists in cities across china were detained by police confined to their homes or were missing families and friends reported the detention or harassment of several dissidents and some activists said they were warned not to participate
