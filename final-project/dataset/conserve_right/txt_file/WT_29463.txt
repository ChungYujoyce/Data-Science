both moves underscored trump s longstanding belief that he is his own best political strategist the president s volatile management style has shocked the nation before but the drumbeat of provocation emanating from the white house has grown undeniably louder in recent months trump aides such as economic adviser gary cohn who blocked impulsive actions by going so far as to remove rogue paperwork

and tweets for the sober analysis of professionals on matters of war and peace on sunday trump had his acting chief of staff mick mulvaney defend the offensive tweets on national television and furthered his divisive attacks on a veteran african american congressman claiming without evidence that rep elijah cummings of maryland a prominent administration critic was himself racist while republicans nervously consider an unconstrained trump 15 months from the election few have stepped up to challenge a president who has been emboldened by the conclusion of the russia probe and a divided democratic congress to conduct foreign policy and domestic politics as he alone sees fit the temptations for trump are only set to increase this week before two nights of debates by his would be 2020 democratic rivals then on thursday in ohio he ll have his first rally since the offensive chants of his supporters about democratic lawmakers of color trump disavowed the chants then

mulvaney has made no such attempt he s given the president space to tweet as he wishes according to nine administration officials and outside allies after his attacks against cummings trump asked advisers on monday how the tweets played on television yet made clear he was not asking them whether he should have posted them according to the people who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations the president has also in recent days expressed to kushner who many regard as trump s de facto campaign manager and other advisers on his re election team that he believed his broadsides against the minority democrats would help excite his core supporters though polling suggests the attacks could hurt trump with suburban voters and especially women whom he may need to win
