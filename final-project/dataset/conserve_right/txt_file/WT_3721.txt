apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump told supporters thursday night that democratic candidate joseph r biden was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss barack obama s ass and took aim at minnesota s influx of somali refugees including liberal democratic rep ilhan omar in his first campaign rally since democrats launched an impeachment inquiry against him mr trump went after mr biden and his son hunter over the younger biden s lucrative deals with a ukrainian gas company and with china while the father was vice president to a packed arena of 20 000 in minneapolis minnesota mr trump said i want to see hunter asked these questions you know nothing about anything frankly hunter you re a loser why did you get 1 5 billion from china hunter top

greatest christian expositor of the 21st century mr trump went on and your father was never considered smart he was never considered a good senator he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss barack obama s ass it was mr trump s fourth trip to minnesota a state he narrowly lost to hillary clinton in 2016 and is campaigning hard to win next year a republican hasn t won the state in a presidential election since 1972 the president was visiting the district of somali born ms omar with whom has been feuding continuously this year he didn t miss the opportunity to blast the freshman lawmaker in her own backyard during his 90 minute plus speech he told minnesotans of the liberal ms omar s election in 2018 i know you people how the hell did that ever happen congresswoman omar is an america hating socialist mr trump said she minimized the sept 11 attack on our homeland she pleaded for compassion for isis recruits right here in minnesota the president repeated his criticism that rep omar has a history of launching virulent anti semitic screeds whether you like it or not how do you have such a person representing you in minnesota i m very angry at you people right now the president said tongue in cheek before turning serious again she is a disgrace to our country and she is one of the big reasons that i m going to win and the republican party is going to win minnesota in 13 months mr trump said minnesotans should vote for him because he s kept his promise to crack down on liberal refugee policies as you know leaders in washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers he said i promised you that as president i would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls and i ve done that since coming into office i have reduced refugee resettlement by 85 he added to cheers from the crowd and as you know maybe especially in minnesota i kept another promise i issued an executive action making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state so speak to your mayor democrat jacob frey believe me no other president would be doing that the president said the impeachment effort is just the latest attempt by the wretched washington swamp to nullify his election they know they can t win the 2020 election so they re pursuing the insane impeachment mr trump said they want to erase your vote like it never existed they want to erase your voice and erase your future but they will fail because in america the people rule again amid accusations by democrats and a whistleblower that he pressured ukraine s president to investigate the bidens mr trump devoted a good portion of his speech to attacking the democratic candidate and his son the president said he would love to run against mr biden if you can t beat him in a debate you ve got a big problem he said he s totally owned and totally controlled by the washington swamp the president said hunter biden has now dropped out of public view since the controversy arose joe s son hunter got thrown out of the navy and then he became a genius on wall street in about two days he said by the way what the hell ever happened to hunter where is he let s do another t shirt where s hunter mr trump also referred to a report in the washington examiner thursday night that the anonymous whistleblower who launched the impeachment inquiry against him had worked with mr biden in the white house in a brand new report just came out as i m walking on the stage hard to believe actually it turns out that when joe biden was vice president he worked with the so called whistleblower mr trump said this is nothing but a partisan witch hunt sabotage and i m sure they the media are going to say it s a totally unsubstantiated story he predicted that democrats will suffer a backlash the likes of which we ve never seen because of their impeachment effort democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy mr trump said we will never let it happen we will defeat them the president also referred to turkey s military attacks this week on kurds in northern syria who have been allies of the u s in defeating the islamic state mr trump has been criticized for withdrawing u s troops and abandoning the kurds but he said it s time to bring american soldiers home from long term deployments in the middle east we left we won he said take a victory united states it s time to bring them home we ve lost thousands of brave soldiers we spent 8
