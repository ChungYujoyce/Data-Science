apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the so called battle for hong kong is still raging over the weekend the capitalist entrepot witnessed its 22nd straight week of protests against beijing s heavy hand while the demonstrations are both smaller and more violent than when they first erupted five months ago to protest a law now withdrawn that would have allowed extraditions from hong kong to mainland china this weekend s flare up saw numerous stores smashed and even a stabbing in a shopping mall their longevity has been extraordinary in 1989 tiananmen square had been occupied for barely a month when the tanks rolled in other mass movements across the world have fizzled in a matter of weeks as protesters were suppressed placated or simply grew bored top

doctors for coronavirus global survey hong kong s defiant spirit its will to battle is remarkable but the war is over and china won five months ago the hong kong protests looked to many like a genuine challenge to beijing one that could shake the foundations of communist rule the extraordinary mass rallies that characterized the beginning of the movement with roughly 1 million people taking to the streets in a city of only 7 million were by far the most profound challenge to the chinese communist party since 1989 china could not risk contagion and many agreed it would ultimately send in the army to put down the protests lest they spread to cities in the mainland in a classic episode of the simpsons mr burns is booed mercilessly at a film festival only to be reassured by his assistant smithers that the crowd was really screaming boo urns not boo no this has nothing to do with president trump at saturday s ufc fights rather as protests broke out in hong kong panicky unintentionally comical pieces appeared in communist run media organs like the china daily claiming to credulous domestic audiences that the hong kong protesters were actually coming out in favor of the beijing regime such laughable propaganda suggested a regime that was very very nervous weeks later the protests continue in hong kong and nowhere else contagion looks like an increasingly remote possibility crucially mainland opinion has turned decisively against what the chinese media refer to relentlessly as rioters and foreign conspirators the laughable attempt to claim that they are actually pro beijing was abandoned early on a perusal through my wechat account tells the tale wechat owned by chinese conglomerate tencent is both a chat app and a social network chinese users post photographs memes and status updates alongside their text message conversations and among my many mainland contacts on wechat sentiment is universally hostile to hong kong my feed is filled with condemnations of the vandals and rioters in hong kong note that many of these wechat contacts fit the profile of those who we might expect to be on the side of the protesters many were educated abroad have advanced degrees and work in professional fields yet on the hong kong question they are as nationalistic as their little red book clutching ancestors others with deep networks in china report similar among their friends and acquaintances meanwhile many chinese living abroad have staged actually pro beijing demonstrations in dozens of cities outside china hong kong in other words is isolated beijing may not have pacified the city itself but it has eliminated the far more dangerous possibility of protests spreading the 1989 student movement by contrast may largely be remembered for the atrocities that occurred in and around tiananmen square in beijing but there were pro democracy protests in dozens of cities across the country today rather than send in the pla and rerun a tank man style atrocity beijing appears willing to let the demonstrations continue beijing even celebrated the nation s 70th anniversary in grand style oct 1 in beijing while continuing to let hong kong smolder but this is in fact evidence of hong kong s weakness as opposed to its strength hong kong simply doesn t matter to china like it used to in 1997 when hong kong was handed over from the united kingdom to the people s republic its economy represented some 20 of total chinese gross domestic product hong kong was also a crucial gateway for foreign investment into china today hong kong s gdp represents less than 3 of china s total gdp foreign investment has poured into the mainland overflying hong kong entirely shanghai s stock market which didn t even exist before the 1990s now boasts a larger market capitalization than hong kong s it was reported last week that hong kong is in fact in recession but there s no sign that the rest of the country will follow the courageous hong kong protest movement will continue to irritate and embarrass beijing but fundamentally it won t threaten it ethan epstein is deputy opinion editor of the washington times contact him at emailprotected or on twitter ethane
