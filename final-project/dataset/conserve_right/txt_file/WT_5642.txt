apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic impeachment is backfiring on democrats by motivating more voters and donors to support president trump as his campaign operation expands into 17 battleground states campaign officials said thursday they have ignited a flame underneath that with 300 some days to go actually makes our job easier in some ways trump campaign manager brad parscale told reporters this lit up our base turnout for our rallies has increased since the impeachment process started i think it s a huge miscalculation by democrats officials said not only is impeachment generating more trump campaign volunteers and cash donations it s also swaying independent voters in swing states who want the election instead of an impeachment investigation to decide who will be the next president top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches in a briefing near the trump campaign headquarters in arlington virginia senior campaign officials laid out details of their field operations and fundraising for 2020 the campaign has 93 million in the bank and a goal of 2 million volunteers in the 17 states that will decide the election in 2016 the trump campaign focused on 11 states mr parscale also said the campaign has been working hard to overcome what he called deliberate voter suppression activity by google and other silicon valley companies targeting the trump campaign twitter has banned political ads and mr parscale also cited google s announcement late last month that it would no longer allow political advertisers to target voters beyond basic demographics such as gender age and location barring a campaign from targeting users based on email list uploads or interests there are places that are so liberal they re so progressive that they even think giving us an opportunity to talk to our voters is something they need to stop because it s their virtuous and righteous thing to do in this world mr parscale said what google has just done would be no different than the phone companies taking our phone list and saying you can t call your voters that is a complete voter suppression activity he said the campaign has guarded against such limitations by compiling tens of millions of phone numbers and other direct contact information from supporters and expanding its ground operation we will be ready and we have done the proper things that even if silicon valley decides they want to shut us off in every way we have plans to get around anything they want to do mr parscale said they can t take away from us knocking on doors they re a day late and a dollar short long term i think they re going to reverse on this because not only are they hurting us they re hurting the bernie sanders of the world and they re hurting those on the other side who need to talk to their people across the country this is just a deep state establishment activity to make sure that establishment candidates have the biggest voice the reelection campaign is especially targeting about 8 8 million voters who were very supportive of mr trump in 2016 but didn t vote in the midterm elections in 2018 when democrats took back the house from the gop i promise you they will show up in 2020 a senior campaign official said voter registration in conjunction with the republican national committee also is a key part of the campaign s strategy finding likely trump voters at rallies and other events who haven t voted in years since june the campaign has registered 38 119 new voters with a goal of roughly 200 000 by election day the 2020 general election will be fought in 17 states nevada arizona new mexico colorado texas minnesota iowa wisconsin michigan ohio pennsylvania virginia north carolina georgia florida new hampshire and maine one official said there is quiet confidence at campaign headquarters that mr trump will receive more electoral votes than the 304 he captured in 2016 we have several paths to victory now said a senior campaign official we have a lot of opportunities this time jared kushner the president s son in law and senior adviser said of the democratic field of contenders we don t see anyone who can put together the obama coalition we re on offense everywhere and we re very excited about that the trump campaign has about 300 paid staffers in field offices across the country but is placing more of an emphasis on an army of volunteers arranging meetups essentially neighborhood house parties to mobilize support there are also 110 paid campaign staffers at headquarters their goal by election day is to hold 25 000 volunteer led house parties in those 17 states to date the campaign has held 3 059 house parties with a total of 40 806 attendees analyzing election data from 2016 campaign officials say mr trump s strength in small counties in states such as wisconsin and pennsylvania will serve as a formidable firewall against any lackluster showing in urban areas such as milwaukee or in suburban swing districts such as bucks county north of philadelphia they also confirmed that the hidden trump voter will be a factor again in 2020 campaign officials explained that by showing that republican presidential nominee mitt romney in 2012 received votes from roughly 3 of people who viewed him unfavorably but in 2016 mr trump averaged anywhere from 12 to 19 support from voters who rated him unfavorably in wisconsin in 2016 21 of voters who said they viewed mr trump unfavorably voted for him anyway it s one reason that trump campaign officials say polling generally underestimates support for the president they may not love the guy but they think he s the right cure for the country s ills a senior campaign official said offering a possible reason for the phenomenon the left has made it not necessarily easy to be a trump supporter we were laughed at when we talked about the hidden trump voter this validates that the hidden trump vote was real in 2016 and it validates that the hidden trump vote is real in 2020 he said traditional polling methods of measuring approval don t necessarily apply to a candidate like donald trump who is completely unique campaign officials also noted that mr trump s approval rating is slightly better than president obama s was at the same point in 2011 heading into his reelection the campaign has created outreach efforts for women workers veterans black and hispanic voters with plans to launch similar efforts for evangelicals catholics jewish voices and cops for trump tom howell j
