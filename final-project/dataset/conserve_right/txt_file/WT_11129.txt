legendary film star and patriot john wayne as a model of moral leadership i referred to john wayne as a great american philosopher and he basically said there s right and there s wrong you can do one or the other mr gates told the pentagon channel this week if you do the one you re living if you do the other you may be walking around but you re as dead as a beaver hat and what he was trying to say is the importance of integrity and i think for a leader it s important to be seen to have your actions consistent with your words accountability is obviously very important to me taking care of our people mr gates said leadership is more than just making decisions on budgets and administrative matters it also is setting the tone not just of integrity but of caring of communicating to every person in the organization that their well being is important to you and that you want to know if somebody is not being treated right and that you ll take care of that and for the people to have the confidence that that s the attitude of the people that are making decisions that affect their lives bill gertz covers the pentagon he can be reached at 202 6
