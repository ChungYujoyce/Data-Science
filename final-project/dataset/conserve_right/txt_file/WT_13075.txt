president of pharmaceuticals for china and hong kong and former general manager for china police previously identified four chinese employees of gsk who they said confessed to bribery a second foreign drugmaker astrazeneca said in july that police in shanghai were investigating one of its salespeople the company has given no information since then chinese state media have publicized the investigations of gsk and astrazeneca but economists who study chinese health care say such payments are more widely used by china s domestic drug manufacturers doctors and hospitals routinely accept informal payments from patients and suppliers of medical goods to top up low salaries and cover gaps in budgets hospitals also raise money by adding surcharges to drug prices and assigning employees sales quotas that can also distort treatment by encouraging overuse of expensive drugs or procedures gao said reilly engaged in wanton bribery to meet high sales growth goals set by gsk s head office
