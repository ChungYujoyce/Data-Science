the funeral was the latest in a tightly orchestrated chinese government propaganda campaign seemingly aimed at countering criticism that beijing has failed to handle liu s case in a humanitarian way a video about liu s hospital treatment released on the website of the city s judicial bureau friday appeared aimed at the same objective the wife and other family members of china s best known political prisoner have been closely guarded by authorities and remain largely out of contact with the outside world even after liu s death governments around the world have urged china to free liu xia from the strict house arrest she has lived under for years even though she has not been convicted of any crime the handout images showed liu s wife who wore dark sunglasses being comforted by her brother in a funeral parlor as they stood in a row with liu s older and younger siblings and their wives liu s body lay in an open casket in the center of the room surrounded by an arrangement of potted white flowers a black banner strung on the wall said mr liu xiaobo s funeral in white chinese characters it was positioned above a framed picture of liu a press release issued by the government said the ceremony was held at 6 30 a m to the music of mozart s requiem and that the body was cremated shortly afterward the government also said the couple s friends attended the ceremony a claim that was disputed by people who have long been close to liu in the handout images none among a group of people standing by the casket were identifiable as any of liu s friends said mo zhixu a dissident writer who is friends with liu not a single one of his real friends were there mo said by phone adding that he thought the well built young men with buzz cuts in the photos resembled security agents who kept track of liu s wife this is just a big performance this regime has long been acting without humanity that s why they denied him even a minute of freedom even until his death i have nothing to say other than that i m extremely infuriated mo said in shenyang a spokesman for the city s information office said at the briefing that authorities were looking out for liu xia s interests and insisted that she is free as far as i know liu xia has freedom but she just lost her relative and is in deep sorrow spokesman zhang qingyang said after liu xiaobo s death let liu xia tend to his affairs and try to keep her away from external interference liu was only the second nobel peace prize winner to die in prison a fact pointed to by human rights groups as an indication of the chinese communist party s increasingly hard line against its critics the first carl von ossietzky died from tuberculosis in germany in 1938 while serving a sentence for opposing adolf hitler s nazi regime tributes have rolled in from around the world to mourn liu but there is little mention of him in china s heavily censored state media and social networking platforms one notable exception is a newspaper published by the ruling communist party which on saturday said the west was deifying liu a man the paper described as a criminal who was paranoid naive and arrogant liu s memorial tablet cannot find a place in china s cultural temple the global times newspaper said in an editorial deification of liu by the west will be eventually overshadowed by china s denial of him the newspaper s editorial marked a rare mention of liu in the chinese language media possibly indicating a desire to guide popular opinion amid widespread reporting of his death in the overseas press and on social media platforms such as twitter that are blocked in china while liu did have considerable renown abroad official censorship made him virtually a non person at home the party frequently uses the specter of western manipulation to demonize its critics liu rose to prominence during the 1989 pro democracy protests centered in beijing s tiananmen square and became one of hundreds of chinese imprisoned for crimes linked to the demonstrations after they were crushed by the military it was the first of four imprisonments his last was for co authoring charter 08 a document circulated in 2008 that called for an end to one party rule he was in prison when he was awarded the nobel in 2010 which beijing condemned as an affront
