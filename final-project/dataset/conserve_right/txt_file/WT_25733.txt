 house seat becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn as california democrats try to keep president trump off the state s republican primary ballot next year republicans in other states are pondering plans to cancel or modify their own 2020 presidential nominating contests and essentially affirm the party s support for mr trump before voters head to the polls a new california law requiring candidates to disclose five years of tax returns has raised fresh legal and constitutional questions on ballot access while nascent proposals to scale back republican nominating contests in states such as south carolina and nevada have drawn criticism from william f weld the most prominent republican challenging mr trump in 2020 shawn steel a republican national committee member from california called his state s law a political farce and predicted it would be struck down by christmas if not sooner top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time he said there is merit to simply allowing voters to express their will and that competition s always good denting the notion of state parties moving to quash dissent and save mr trump from having to dispatch any primary challengers i m not worried about trump in any way a lot of republicans that were not enthusiastic for him three years ago and there was a lot in california they re all on board because his production has been beyond anybody s expectation mr steel said so there is no real primary threat in any way that i can see and my answer is who cares trump s going to come out looking good no matter what the trump campaign and the republican national committee sued soon after gov gavin newsom a democrat signed the tax return ballot measure into law last month the lawsuit argues that the requirement infringes on mr trump s free speech rights mr trump citing an ongoing irs audit has broken with long standing precedent since his 2016 campaign by declining to release his tax returns he is fighting a separate legal battle with congressional democrats who have sued to try to get their hands on the president s tax information harmeet dhillon a republican national committee member whose law firm is representing the rnc in its case against california said the implications of the state law stretch beyond the presidential contest if the president isn t there there will be a lot of republicans who say i m not going to bother to vote i m boycotting voting this year ms dhillon said which means that in potential congressional races they potentially end up in democrat on democrat races because of our top two system mr newsom has defended the law by saying the u s constitution leaves it to the states to determine how their presidential electors are chosen rocky de la fuente a perennial candidate challenging mr trump for the 2020 republican nomination also sued over the california law even as he said he plans to release his past five years of tax returns voluntarily if voters want a candidate to release their tax returns voters are free to withhold their vote from candidates who do not mr de la fuente said all republicans must stand united in demanding that state officials be held to account when they threaten fundamental rights guaranteed under the u s constitution regardless of the court outcome the law likely won t have much practical effect on mr trump s status as the all but assured republican presidential nominee next year though it would be notable if an incumbent president fails to get his name on the primary ballot in the country s most populous state still republicans in other early presidential states are weighing plans to modify or even cancel their presidential nominating contests next year and declaring their support for mr trump before voters have a chance to express their choices in a primary or caucus in south carolina the party s executive committee will decide next month whether to hold a presidential preference primary said cindy costa a republican national committee member from the state which is famous for holding the first in the south presidential primary democrats didn t hold one when they had the white house in 2012 or 1996 and republicans didn t hold one in 04 or 84 so there is a strong precedent that the party that holds the presidency doesn t normally have a primary ms costa said republican parties in nevada and kansas are also weighing plans to modify or cancel their caucuses next year the nevada republican party is slated to decide next month whether to simply have the state central committee decide on committing delegates to mr trump the party said the move could allow them to divert resources elsewhere mr weld a former massachusetts governor said the president is trying to turn the republican party into yet another of his private clubs we don t elect presidents by acclamation in america mr weld said in a statement to the washington times the idea that any incumbent especially this one should be allowed to bypass facing voters in a primary or party caucus is an insult to the republican party and to the millions of voters who would be disenfranchised though mr weld is the most prominent republican challenging mr trump for the nomination scores of lesser known candidates routinely file with the federal election commission to run for president every cycle and could be affected by the changes mr trump s campaign said it is taking no position on whether state parties should opt out of primary contests and direct the money elsewhere regardless the president will dominate whomever has the wrong headed idea to challenge him in whatever contest is put in front of him said sarah matthews a spokeswoman for the president s reelection campaign states and parties cited cost savings as part of their rationale for changing practices in past election years said josh putnam an analyst on the primary process and editor of the blog frontloading hq this time around certainly trump is popular among republicans as polls continually tell us mr putnam said what s a little bit different this time around is that trump is broadly unpopular among the entire electorate and that may be driving what bill weld s responding to there the rnc passed a resolution supporting mr trump this year after members toyed with the idea of taking more far reaching steps to block potential primary challengers solomon yue a republican national committee member from oregon who helped draft the resolution that was approved said the parties in individual states and territories should have the right to determine how they want to run their nominating contests with that in mind i am very comfortable because you have to trust the people to do the right thing mr yue said ms dhillon likewise said other states can do whatever they want but she doesn t think it is right to disenfranchise voters any sort of caucus system is less small d democratic than allowing voters to vote on a primary ballot she said when you allow voters to vote they also come and vote for other candidates and for or against ballot measures and that s a right republicans have a right to have enthusiasm for who s on the ballot and have people turn out and vote as ms costa indicated both parties have histories of trying to do what they can to shore up incumbent presidents in their reelection campaigns and avoid major intraparty challenges in 2003 arizona gov janet napolitano a democrat vetoed republican authored legislation that would have canceled the state s 2004 primary during president george w bush s reelection campaign she said the state can well afford the price of democracy this cycle republicans in new hampshire the site of the first in the nation presidential primary that helped fuel mr trump s rampage toward the party s nomination in 2016 also considered changing rules that say the state party should remain neutral in primaries but they ultimately abandoned the effort amid complaints that the change could be seen as tipping the scales in mr trump s favor since when do republicans oppose competition steve duprey a republican national committee member from new hampshire wrote this year in the new hampshire union leader if the party starts favoring incumbents over primary challengers then what is the case for having the first in the nation
