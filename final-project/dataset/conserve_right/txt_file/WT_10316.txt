long rumored new doobie brothers studio album top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender question how hard is it to leave the beauty of your home in maui to hit the road answer laughs it gets kind of hard sometimes but i love playing and it s a great tour so i m happy to be out here i m glad to be standing q why is this show the perfect double bill with chicago a i think we did our first show with chicago in 1972 i love their music it is pretty complementary in terms of the kinds of audiences we attract even though their music is very very different they are a little more orchestrated whereas we are pretty much a straight ahead rock band with some orchestration but nothing as intricate as what they do they have that great horn section i think we both reach a certain age group that remembers our music q when two big bands share the bill is there ever any competition a oh yeah we re competing every night laughs no i don t think so in terms of that we have always gone out there and try to give it our all every night people pay to see a good show and we do our best to put all our energy into what we do every night all the musicians have a pride in what we do we want to give the people their money s worth q how do you decide what songs to play on tour a there are those certain tunes everybody wants to hear and we know what those are and we try to pepper that with some deeper cuts from the records we don t wanna just be one thing we want to do a wide variety we ve been lucky in our career to have so many different songs and styles everything from country to r b to sort of jazz and some more folky psychedelic stuff we re able to have all that different music in the set that gives us a lot of freedom q the band has evolved and gone through so many members over the years but you ve been there the whole time what s kept you loyal to the band a it is the songs and music for me pretty simplistic really there isn t anything deep i just have enjoyed playing the songs and feel fortunate to have the opportunity i always wanted to be in a band the fact that we have this entity that has been so successful is not something i take lightly i ve been lucky to be there when it happens and almost 50 years later i m still here q during the years michael mcdonald was in the band was there any jealousy that a lot of attention was on him a i was jealous of his voice and his incredible talent laughs and songwriting abilities when you re in a band like ours there are a number of songwriters pretty much everyone in the band writes and sings almost everyone in the band from one time or another has written a song that has ended up on the record we ve always tried to support each other the cream floats to the top in terms of who s gonna come forward with great songs this band has always been about the songs and the music i m always gratified if someone comes up with good songs because that s the hardest part q you wrote the doobies classic black water which has a distinct southern feel to it where did that song come from and how did a guy from washington state capture that southern vibe so perfectly a i listened to that kind of folk blues music if you will for so long before writing that song son house mississippi john hurt hot tuna jorma kaukonen from jefferson airplane was a big influence on me i love that kind of music when i started writing songs a lot of my songs were coming from that place when i wrote black water i already had the riff but the song really came together for me when i was down in new orleans we were down there doing some shows in the early 70s the song really is about my experience there in new orleans q this morning i heard china groove in a chili s commercial how do you feel about your music being in commercials a laughs it s now part of american culture i think it s cool and chili s i like food laughs it s flattering to be included in that context a little surreal i guess q is there a new doobies brothers studio album in the works a we ve been kind of scratching the surface we went in and cut four songs just recently before we hit the road they turned out really good we re not finished with them they are just basic tracks with rough vocals we re shooting to maybe do the record over this winter to put it out next spring the doobie brothers play alongside chicago at the veterans united
