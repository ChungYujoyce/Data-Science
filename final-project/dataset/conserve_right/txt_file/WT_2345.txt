apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic chicago ap donald trump s appearance next week at a police chiefs conference will be his first visit as president to chicago a city he has ridiculed for years the city s top cop plans to skip the speech even though he s hosting the event police superintendent eddie johnson s apparent snub of trump s speech monday at the international association of chiefs of police conference is the latest chapter in a long and contentious relationship between the republican president and the nation s third largest city a democratic stronghold the values of the people of chicago are more important to him than anything that could be discussed at that speech johnson s spokesman anthony guglielmi said shortly after the white house announced trump s planned address at the conference top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time guglielmi added that johnson will be hosting and attending several events at the conference since his campaign trump has repeatedly singled out the city both for what he says is its unwillingness to get tough on criminals and what he complains is a willingness to coddle immigrants living in the country illegally his mere presence in the city prompted him to leave without making a speech at a campaign rally in 2016 after protesters and supporters clashed even before he made it to the stage even before that he drew the ire of city officials when he attached 20 foot tall letters spelling trump on the side of his trump international hotel and tower trump took great pleasure when then mayor rahm emanuel concluded there was nothing he could do about the letters no matter how architecturally tasteless they were trump blamed the chicago tribune s architecture critic for stirring up opposition about the signage calling him a third rate architectural critic it was a precursor to his more recent ridicule of house speaker nancy pelosi as either a third rate or third grade politician more recently trump has used the city s surge in gun violence to call for a crackdown on criminals what the hell is going on in chicago he asked at a 2017 rally in florida there are those who say that afghanistan is safer than chicago ok you know what s wrong with chicago weak ineffective politicians democrats in another rally that year trump singled out emanuel telling the audience better tell that mayor to get tough because it s not working what they re doing trump has even suggested that chicago should embrace the stop and frisk policing method in which large numbers of people are temporarily detained questioned and sometimes searched for drugs even after it was deemed unconstitutional he has spoken numerous times about an unnamed chicago police officer who lamented that the department could stop the violence if they let officers do their job that story depending on the telling has the officer saying police could clean things up in immediately in one week or two days trump tweeted in early 2017 that he would send in the feds if chicago doesn t fix the horrible carnage going on johnson responded by saying he didn t know what trump was suggesting he was going to do and emanuel rejected the president s offer if that offer was to send in the national guard the president has made false assertions about gun violence in chicago starting with his contention during his campaign that the city has the toughest gun laws in the united states by the time trump the candidate was making that assertion in 2015 many of the city s gun laws had either been overturned or gutted then shortly after he was inaugurated in 2017 he claimed two people were fatally shot during former president barack obama s farewell address a few weeks earlier the tribune reported that its own database showed no slayings for about 24 hours before or after obama s speech a reference to the city made it into a statement former trump attorney michael cohen released earlier this year before an appearance in front of the u s house he spoke of trump driving through a struggling chicago neighborhood and remarking that only black people could live that way chicago also has taken a leading role in the president s battle with so called sanctuary cities after a federal appeals court ruled that then attorney general jeff sessions cold not tie the distribution of federal grant money to cities willingness to cooperate with immigration authorities a federal judge ruled in favor of the city in its lawsuit over the justice department s attempt to tie the money to new immigration requirements including giving federal agents access to local jails but just a few months ago a federal appeals judge ruled that the justice department could give preferential treatment in awarding community policing grants to cities that cooperate with immigration authorities when trump later said he was strongly considering placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only emanuel quickly shot back that chicago would welcome these migrants with open arms johnson s announcement about the conference comes just days after he told reporters that he was ordering an internal investigation of himself after he was found asleep in his suv at a stop sign officers let him drive home without a roadside sobriety test mayor lori lightfoot said johnson
