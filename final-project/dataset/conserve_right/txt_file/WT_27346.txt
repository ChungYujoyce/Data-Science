for themselves he said but over time i saw big corporations buy our democracy and set the rules for the sake of their profits not for the common good corporate lobbyists rigged the system leaving the

companies bleed them dry and walk away rich these firms are gobbling up more and more of the economy said ms warren who wants to change the tax code and bankruptcy laws to protect businesses from corporate raiders these types of messages resonate with democrats liberal base and give the candidates a way to diminish the trump economy said g terry madonna a pollster and director of the center
