first lady will make a difference for democrats des moines iowa democratic candidates finally have found an obama they apos re not afraid to be seen with while president obama dutifully avoids battleground races this midterm season first lady michelle obama is tiptoeing into the fray in a bid to drum up votes for party allies in tight contests the president apos s better half stumped for the first time in a 2014 race earlier this month hitting the trail for georgia senate democratic candidate michelle nunn and she apos s expected to travel to iowa soon in support of senate candidate rep bruce braley the logic behind dispatching the first lady isn apos t hard to grasp while the president apos s approval ratings are hovering around 40 percent rendering him political kryptonite to democrats in tough races michelle obama apos s are considerably higher 62 percent according to a summertime pew research center survey they are looking for an a lister they can find except for president obama said amos snead former spokesman for former house gop whip roy blunt now a senator he added i think it apos s telling that of the two six years into a presidency the first lady is the only one who can go out there with them david yepsen director of the southern illinois paul simon public policy institute and former chief political reporter for the des moines register said he sees no downside to sending michelle obama to help with turnout in close senate races he said the goal is to fire up voters and turn out those who normally do not show up in non presidential elections during michelle obama apos s visit for nunn she largely avoided controversial topics like foreign affairs she focused instead on the importance of voting and the effects a republican sweep at the polls could have on the remaining two years of the obama administration in iowa where democratic nominee braley is in almost a dead heat with republican state sen joni ernst the first lady apos s visit could help rev up a race which has no clear frontrunner braley also came under fire back in june for an ad against ernst that critics called sexist michelle obama could help shore up his numbers among female voters the first lady apos s planned visit to iowa in october has been confirmed by the white house and braley campaign though few other details have emerged yepsen said the first lady apos s late in the race appearances come at the right time for a greater impact he says if the democrats had tried to tout her a few months ago the hype would have been lost by election time her timing now falls when parties are pushing voter registration and early voting it apos s a good time these are less motivated voters they haven apos t been paying attention earlier he said however republican strategist tim albrecht former communications director for iowa gov terry branstad and current director of redwave digital in des moines believes the first lady won apos t have the impact democrats are hoping for calling it a pipe dream democrats are praying michelle obama is going to try to rev up some of their base that wasn apos t going to turn out it apos s just not going to happen he said if they weren apos t motivated to turn out at this point and less than a month before the election when she gets here they weren apos t ever going to turn out anyway he said an appearance by the president would be an anchor to any democrat apos s campaign and the first lady apos s appearance in iowa is little more than an attempt to get much needed positive press for braley jehmu greene fox news contributor and past president of the women apos s media center and rock the vote said she apos s not surprised that democrats are using the first lady instead of the president to rally support michelle has some of the highest approval ratings and will absolutely help these candidates accomplish what they apos re trying to do in last few weeks before election said greene the bottom line is with where we are in the world and what is on the president apos s plate i certainly want him behind his desk in the oval office greene said she hopes michelle obama apos s rock star status can connect rally inform and inspire voters democrats have more voters on their side the problem is in midterm elections our voters don apos t turn out she said braley told foxnews com in june that he would welcome the president to iowa however obama hasn apos t yet hit the campaign trail in iowa or other states with close senate races republicans need to pick up six seats in november to flip control of the u s senate and many are invoking obama to try and drag down their opponents yepsen said mrs obama has been able to keep her poll numbers steady because she apos s stayed above the fray unlike former first lady hillary clinton who dealt more in policy fights and made some enemies michelle obama pushes causes like childhood obesity which finds few critics aside from those who complain about changes in school lunches president obama apos s in the typical six year slump but michelle apos s numbers have stayed pretty good she apos s respected she apos s admired and she apos s a role model i think it can do a lot of good with excitement and buzz i think it apos ll do a lot of good for braley yepsen said full midterm coverage get all the stories you need to know from the most
