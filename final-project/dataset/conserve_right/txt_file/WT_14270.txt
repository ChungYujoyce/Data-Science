because of a personal animosity toward the united states and its criticisms of his human rights record jonathan miller asia correspondent for britain s channel 4 news spent more than a year interviewing duterte s family cabinet members supporters and critics to compile a biography largely in the words of filipinos it s called duterte harry a nickname duterte earned during 22 years as the gun toting mayor of southern davao city it s also a play on the clinton eastward movie title dirty harry the british journalist said duterte would like the philippines to be part of new sphere that included china and russia and abandon the old alliances including with the united states the country s former colonial power top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed china s greatest appeal to the 72 year old philippine leader for a realigned relationship was money miller said the chinese have actually promised a lot of investment and although duterte in the past has not been known for his infrastructure work there are few countries in southeast asia that are in more need of investment and infrastructure than the philippines they need rail and road transport desperately miller told the associated press in canberra during a book signing he s looking for a lot of chinese money in that but he s also doing it to punish the u s and he s got a personal chip on his shoulder over the united states which has criticized him for his human rights abuses miller said he values china because they don t criticize his human rights stuff he added many filipinos are unsettled by duterte moving away from the united states and closer to china which aggressively contests the philippines territorial claims in the south china sea the move toward china alarms a lot of filipinos who love america more than any other country in the world miller said duterte s gripes with the united states include being refused a visa apparently because of state department alarm at death squads that

the president withdrawing his country from the court s jurisdiction a filipino lawyer has complained that the anti drugs campaign could amount to crimes against humanity miller suspects the slayings

1970s more than 4 000 mostly urban poor suspects have been killed by police a staggering death toll officials blame on the suspects fighting back human rights watchdogs have cited much higher numbers of fatalities which the government disputes duterte denies condoning summary killings and has lashed out at critics including former president barack obama western governments and u n human rights

approval for president donald trump in canberra miller described duterte as an admitted liar thin skinned narcissistic vengeful angry and deeply misogynistic the book cites a 1998 psychologist s report used by duterte s former wife in a marriage annulment court application that described duterte as having a narcissistic personality disorder with aggressive features the diagnosis was drawn from the wife s testimony his daughter sara deturter carpio told the author that her father had been chivalrous in not contesting the report and allowing the marriage to end in a country does not recognize divorce miller approached duterte to be interviewed for the biography duterte referred miller to staff to set an appointment but staff never did duterte s top aide summoned the u s

the u s report said autocratic tendencies are expected to deepen in some governments in southeast asia and mentioned that duterte has suggested he could suspend the constitution declare a revolutionary government and impose nationwide martial law duterte s foreign policy critics argue his administration has not done enough to defend his country s sovereignty in the south china sea and
