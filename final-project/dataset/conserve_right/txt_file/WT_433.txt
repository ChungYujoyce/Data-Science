apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic ramallah west bank ap ninety four percent of palestinians reject president donald trump s mideast initiative according to a poll released tuesday which also found plummeting support for a two state solution with israel and nearly two thirds backing armed struggle the first survey of palestinian public opinion to be released since trump s plan was announced undercuts the administration s claims that opposition to the plan is largely confined to the palestinian leadership and raises concerns that the implementation of the proposal which heavily favors israel could ignite a new round of violence the poll by the well regarded palestinian center for policy and survey research was published as thousands of palestinians rallied in the west bank and gaza to reject the trump plan and express support for president mahmoud abbas in his efforts to gain backing at the u n security council for a resolution opposing it top stories bill clinton slams

christian expositor of the 21st century trump s mideast plan announced at the white house on jan 28 sides with israel on virtually all of the most contentious issues of the decades old conflict it would allow israel to annex large parts of the occupied west bank including jewish settlements that are home to hundreds of thousands of people and are considered illegal by most of the international community the plan would give the palestinians limited self rule in several enclaves connected by roads bridges and tunnels but only if they meet a long list of stringent conditions the palestinian leadership which cut off ties with the u s after trump recognized disputed jerusalem as israel s capital in 2017 have adamantly rejected the plan the opinion survey found that an overwhelming majority of palestinians in the west bank and gaza also oppose it i don t think we ve ever seen such a level of consensus among the palestinian public said khalil shikaki the head of the polling center shikaki said support for the idea of a two state solution with israel has dropped to the lowest level since the center began carrying out surveys nearly three decades ago with 39 in favor and 59 opposed support for a one state solution long rejected by both israeli and palestinian leaders jumped from 28 in december to 37 today the poll found that 64 of palestinians favor a return to armed struggle in response to the plan shikaki said the last time support was this high was during the worst days of the second intifada or palestinian uprising that convulsed the region from 2000 to 2005 in all the

actual behavior of the president shikaki said the public does not expect the president to go through and implement his own policy the survey had a margin of error of 3 abbas popularity has plummeted in recent years as he has failed to bring about an independent state or mend the internal rift with the islamic militant group hamas which seized gaza from his forces in 2007 his palestinian authority also faces widespread allegations of corruption but on tuesday thousands of palestinians packed into manara square in the west bank city of ramallah to vent their anger at the trump plan and express

abbas has tried to rally international support against the trump plan with limited success the u n security council had been expected to vote on a resolution opposing the plan tuesday but diplomats said the vote was delayed after several members including european countries objected to the language of the draft palestinian officials denied the resolution had been pulled saying discussions were
