to enjoy all the benefits of our website a new law allowing the hungarian prime minister to rule by decree has left his remaining political opponentstoothless get the new statesman s morning call email almost since the coronavirus crisis started there have been those whopredicted that it would be used by autocrats actual and aspirant to tighten their grip on power people are willing to overlook more during a crisis to give up their civil liberties and to listen to the authorities in exchange those authorities see them through the crisis on the promise that one day things will return to normal hungarian prime minister viktor orb n aided by his country s parliament has hinted that day might come later than expected and not because of the harm done by a virus earlier today 30 march hungarian mps voted for a bill that will allow orb n s power to essentially remain unchecked it declares a state of emergency it allows him to rule by decree it ensures there will be no new elections it renders misinformation presumably as defined by the hungarian government punishable by up to five years in prison and it makes disobeying quarantine or isolation punishable by five to eight years in prison it does all of this for an indefinite undetermined undefined period of time this is how it will be until orb n decides otherwise ahead of the vote opposition parties wrote a letter saying that they would not support orb n s dictatorship law but acknowledging that the prime minister would likely win his party fidesz controls two thirds of hungary s parliament since returning to power in 2010 orb n and his government have rewritten the constitution news outlets have been bought up by those reportedly close to the prime minister in 2017 the hungarian parliament passed a law forcing ngos that receive a certain amount of funding from overseas to register as foreign supported under threat of closure in 2018 it passed a stop soros law that criminalised helping asylum seekers the law was of course named for hungarian born billionaire philanthropist george soros on whose scholarship a young orb n went to oxford whose university central european university has largely been pushed out of budapest whose open society foundations moved operations out of that same city in 2018 under government pressure and who today announced that open society would give 1m to budapest to help carry the city through this pandemic over the same period of time orb n s hungary has fallen a full 14 spots from 50th in 2010 to 64th in 2019 in transparency international s corruption perception index there are some who believe that this alleged corruption and enrichment for his inner circle is the reason for orb n s illiberalism b lint magyar for example a sociologist and former minister of education ascribes to this view and has deemed orb n s hungary a mafia state but there are others who think that this too is but a means to an end charles gati a professor at johns hopkins university and a former friend of the hungarian prime minister told me in 2019 during reporting for my book on soros that orb n s number one motivating factor is to show his father he is a big deal to do that he needs to be bigger and more powerful than urbane liberals slick city boys who knew languages as gati put it the means to that end is the mafia state he told me then so that he and his fidesz will live forever in this context it is perhaps not unimaginable that orb n would look at a global health crisis and see another means to an end this bill once signed into law will almost certainly put even greater pressure on what s left of hungary s independent media one man s misinformation is another man s report on increasing illiberalism last year for example hungarian foreign minister p ter szijj

toothless in view of the pressure that orb n s government has put on migrants and asylum seekers this law may well be used to target them or to further strip the rights of the minority roma community about whom orb n announced a national consultation in february the survey his chief of staff said was about restoring moral order the pandemic is one crisis for others in hungary the passage of this bill is not a balm for that calamity but an additional one to put it another way at some point this pandemic will end it will loosen its grip on all of us whether orb n will loosen his newly tightened grip on power is another question as is the matter of who that grip squeezes out of hungary emily tamkin is the author of the influence of soros politics power and the struggle for an open society
