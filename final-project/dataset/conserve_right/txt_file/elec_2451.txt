that little girls will have to wait four more years for the chance of a female president reaction and analysis on outnumbered now that elizabeth warren has bowed to the inevitable the biden bernie matchup is either a battle for the soul of the democratic party or the typical dust settling of a conventional race that is one establishment candidate a veteran battle scarred establishment type who is not terribly exciting and an insurgent candidate a colorful more ideological provocateur who makes followers swoon in this view the voters who gave joe biden 10 super tuesday victories were simply coming home after flirting with two dozen potential dates biden was the safe dependable choice for those whose main goal is beating president trump and that includes some who feel more affinity with bernie sanders usually this plays out over a couple of months and the race is hardly over but in the space of four days biden transformed his fortunes and in what had seemed unthinkable passed sanders in the delegate count it didn t hurt that amy klobuchar and pete buttigieg closed ranks behind him followed by mike bloomberg or that he was lifted aloft by his first sustained burst of positive press but the breadth of his coalition african americans working classes suburban dwellers and older voters suggests he was always a likely front runner once folks were convinced he could win bloomberg investment bombs as press belatedly boosts biden it was as john harris puts it in politico a signal that not all the old ways of thinking about national politics are defunct in an age of disruption the 2008 contest was the exception with newcomer obama toppling semi incumbent hillary but harris recites the history jimmy carter in 1980 walter mondale in 1984 bill clinton in 1992 john kerry in 2004 hillary clinton in 2016 the party has ultimately coalesced over the more consensus oriented politician in the spring after a flirtation with more flamboyant or purely ideological insurgents and that means gary hart paul tsongas howard dean bill bradley and bernie last time didn t win the very factors that made biden seem like a plodding war horse nearly four decades in the senate eight as vice president lots of political baggage were why a majority of democrats have so far decided that he d be a reassuring choice as commander in chief and that brings us to why the race is now down to a 77 year old democrat a 78 year old independent and a 73 year old president when warren emerged from her cambridge home and made some humble withdrawal comments msnbc reporter ali vitali asked i wonder what your message would be to the women and girls who feel like we re left with two old white men to decide between we re left with subscribe to howie apos s media buzzmeter podcast a riff of the day apos s hottest stories warren replied that one of the hardest parts of this is all those pinky promises and all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years that s going to be hard the problem with this question is that warren was riding a wave of favorable press and voter support when she was leading the polls last fall then she started making mistakes from embracing and then fudging on medicare for all to migrating from an unabashed progressive to a unity candidate of course there is sexism in the press and in society but that didn t stop hillary from winning the nomination and the popular vote warren amy klobuchar kamala harris and kirsten gillibrand didn t drop out because america is wedded to male septuagenarians they just failed to get sufficient traction here s a different view of the former harvard law professor from megan garber in the atlantic warren had something about her apparently something that galled the pundits and the public in a way that led to assessments of her not just as strident and shrill but also as condescending the matter is not merely that the candidate is unlikable these deployments ofcondescendingimply the matter is instead that her unlikability has a specific source beyond bias and internalized misogyny warren knows a lot and has accomplished a lot and is extremely competent condescendingacknowledges before twisting the knife it is precisely because of those achievements that she represents a threat condescendingattempts to rationalize an irrational prejudice when i hear her talk i want to slap her even when i agree with her running for president is brutal only one person prevails in each party everyone s personality is mocked joe biden is routinely portrayed as a rambling forgetful geezer in snl terms kate mckinnon is warren the know it all larry david is bernie the ranting relative alec baldwin is trump the know nothing maybe it comes down to the fact that this was the first presidential campaign for warren who got into politics less than a decade ago but the second for sanders and the third for biden the former veep will need that experience if he s the nominee going up against another political newcomer who has come to dominate american politics get all the stories you need to know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox
