apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap as north korea celebrates a major anniversary this weekend the presence or absence of chinese president xi jinping could highlight just how much vitality has been restored to ties between pyongyang and its most powerful backer after a prolonged chill a visit by xi to north korea for the 70th anniversary of the north s founding on sunday is expected north korean leader kim jong un has made three trips to china since march this year and has invited xi to reciprocate but neither side has said whether xi will attend china could be keen to demonstrate the strong ties it has with pyongyang to ensure it remains a key player in efforts to dismantle the north s nuclear program but the celebrations come as president donald trump has blamed beijing for the slow progress of denuclearization top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots below is a look at issues affecting ties between the allies what s the trump factor trump suggests that china has been encouraging north korea to drag its feet with denuclearization to gain leverage against the u s in a trade dispute that has seen both sides leveling tariffs on 50 billion of each other s products last week he tweeted that north korea is under tremendous pressure from china because of our major trade disputes with the chinese government adding this is not helpful china wasn t having any of it foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said washington should engage in self reflection and stop flip flopping and blaming others regarding america s attempts to pass the buck i m sorry we d rather not accept hua told reporters china has already distanced itself somewhat from its significant cooperation with the u s on north korea after supporting tough u n sanctions and scaling back trade with the north after it ramped up nuclear and missile tests last year beijing has eased the pressure on its neighbor slightly what are the chances of a xi visit no chinese head of state has visited north korea since president hu jintao met with kim s father kim jong il in pyongyang in 2005 a time when beijing was urging pyongyang to reform its economy and take part in six nation denuclearization talks when the younger kim took power in 2011 exchanges slowed as kim sought to assert his independence and china grew impatient with kim s nuclear and missile tests ties frayed last year when china supported tougher u n sanctions on pyongyang and suspended coal and iron ore imports that made kim s three visits to china this year all the more striking a sign that the relationship was back on track a visit on such a symbolic occasion would underscore the unique historical ties between the two countries ruling parties mao zedong sent chinese troops to aid the north after the korean war began in 1950 setting up a relationship once described as being as close as lips and teeth xi would also use the opportunity to reassert china s claim to a place at the table when key decisions are made concerning pyongyang s relationships with both washington and south korea including over a possible formal end to the korean war beijing is determined to ensure its interests are

any diplomacy going forward said john delury a north korea expert at yonsei university in seoul i think beijing is worried that north korea will go its own way and work out new relationships with washington and seoul and move out of china s orbit what if xi doesn t go if xi were absent from the celebration it could be a sign that china was displeased with north korea s lack of progress with

still on track kovrig said xi may stay away for more practical reasons as well with china committed to u n economic sanctions on the north it may be looking for real signs of progress toward denuclearization before giving up any political capital for china all actions should serve the interests of denuclearization and a visit by xi will depend on whether there is an agreement on this said guo rui a north korea expert at jilin university in northeast china what s the state of relations kim s visits to beijing displayed all the customary pomp and circumstance bestowed on his father and grandfather a separate visit to the northern port of dalian showed the two leaders strolling along the beach and chatting amid lush gardens all apparently intended to imply a warm personal
