tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn detroit democratic voters are still enamored with former president barack obama but the party s 2020 presidential hopefuls are running away from his policies as fast as they can although many voters say they are searching for an obama esque standard bearer to run against president trump the candidates say the former president was a failure on immigration health care and trade even former vice president joseph r biden tossed overboard the man he called his brother from another mother he griped during the democratic presidential debate wednesday that obamacare needs changes the trade deal they negotiated falls short and too many illegal immigrants were deported top stories cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender absolutely not he said when pressed on whether he would continue obama administration deportation policies which resulted in 400 000 removals a year a figure that outraged liberal activists the obama legacy took hits from sen kamala d harris of california she described the affordable care act often touted as mr obama s biggest accomplishment as unacceptable status quo sen cory a booker of new jersey trashed the former president s immigration legacy deflecting criticism of his own administration new york mayor bill de blasio faulted the obama justice department s handling of the 2014 killing of eric garner a black man who died in a chokehold by city police during his arrest for selling cigarettes on the street mr biden pivoted thursday to more forcefully defend mr obama s record i was a little surprised about how much incoming there was about barack he said at a campaign stop at a detroit diner i m proud of having served with him i m proud of the job he did i don t think there is anything he has to apologize for mr biden didn t reverse course on where he distanced himself from the country s first black president however he defended the obama immigration record citing the deferred action for childhood arrivals deportation amnesty granted to illegal immigrant dreamers he said the number of deportations was a poor yardstick for the administration s accomplishments the idea it s somehow comparable to what this guy s doing is bizarre he said zach friend a democratic strategist who worked on mr obama s 2008 campaign said it was a mistake to mess with the former president whose popularity among democrats has been as high as 97 in recent polls it seems counterproductive to focus on concerns with his legacy rather than on president trump s current policies he said ultimately the differences in shades of blue between these candidates pale in comparison to the differences between these candidates and the policies of the current administration the focus should be united on how we will make the lives better for everyday americans and how to keep this president a one term president the rev wendell anthony president of the detroit naacp agreed that the focus should be on mr trump because his record is destroying the nation and who we are they spent a lot of time talking about the past rather than the present or future he said you don t want to cannibalize the whole team so no woman or no man is left standing if there was any doubt about the continuing appeal of mr obama democratic national committee chairman tom perez put it to rest with his opening remarks at the debate am i the only one who misses barack obama in this room mr perez called out to a roar of applause from the crowd at the fox theater the moment could have given pause to the 10 candidates about to take the stage and sow doubts about mr obama s legacy criticizing mr obama s time in the white house is a dangerous undertaking for any of the 2020 hopefuls because they risk alienating the party s voters who romanticize those not so long ago days it is particularly treacherous for mr biden who is running as mr obama s political heir with the promise of restoring the normalcy of the obama era obama voters were irked by the attacks on the former president s policies at the debates tuesday and wednesday francois demonique a professional chauffeur in detroit said he felt bad seeing mr obama s legacy dragged through the mud democrats are not supposed to sling at another democrat because they are giving president trump ammunition to use against them in the general said mr demonique who is backing mr biden because of his ties to mr obama mr demonique moved to the u s from liberia more than 30 years ago he said he got his u s citizenship so he could vote for mr obama he was especially distraught that sen bernard sanders of vermont and sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts want to replace obamacare with medicare for all government run health care that is like attacking obamacare if you want to take away current insurance that is scratching everything and starting all over he said jeff link an iowa based democratic strategist said it is smart for mr biden to keep mr obama close because the good in the eyes of primary voters far outweighs the bad i wouldn t put a lot of distance between mr biden and president obama on anything mr link said i think he is smart to embrace obama and why not embrace the whole thing obama is still incredibly popular and respected among democrats particularly democratic primary voters he said mr biden s words against the former president may have been in the heat of the moment of the debate and noted that he tried to repair any damage afterward i would hold on tight to barack obama if i were joe biden mr link said still the democratic party has moved dramatically to the left since mr obama was in office some of the strongest challengers to mr biden who remains the front runner are far left champions mr sanders and ms warren another powerful contender ms harris is more moderate but also is embracing parts of the far left agenda including a variation of medicare for all darrell west vice president and
