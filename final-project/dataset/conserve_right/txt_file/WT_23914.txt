apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic democrats continued to send mixed signals on impeachment thursday even as the house judiciary committee moved ahead with approving procedures for their investigation into president trump the committee voted 24 17 to implement four procedures marking the first time the panel voted on what judiciary democrats are calling an impeachment investigation however not all democrats are saying the same thing top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed the rules would allow chairman jerrold nadler new york democrat to delegate some of the work to subcommittees give committee staff extra time to question witnesses govern how information is kept private and allow for president trump s legal team to review and respond the vote thursday was not a question of whether to impeachment the president but merely lays out investigation rules that would determine whether democrats should offer articles of impeachment mr nadler has publicly said his panel is conducting formal impeachment proceedings with this investigation and attempted to brush aside the debate during thursday s vote some call this process an impeachment inquiry some call it an impeachment investigation there is no legal difference between these terms and i no longer care to argue about the nomenclature he said judiciary democrats have embraced that saying this impeachment investigation has been going on for a while other democrats have offered different descriptions of what they thought the committee was up to one member told the times it was crafting language to start an impeachment inquiry on thursday a handful of members took up the impeachment investigation term including rep hakeem jeffries who had avoided the i word just the day before house speaker nancy pelosi however is not wavering on her own messaging impeachment is a very divisive measure but if we have to go there we ll go there but we can t go there unless we have the facts she said notably she s avoided both explicitly shutting down the term impeachment investigation and using it herself rather she doubled down on the argument she s been using for months impeachment is a possibility but six committees first must finish their months long investigations i stand by what we have been doing all along i support what is happening in the judiciary committee because that enables them to do their process of interrogation and their investigation and i salute them for that work mrs pelosi told reporters on thursday that s all i m going to way on the subject and there s nothing different from one day to the next she added republicans argue the confusion and disarray from democrats on impeachment is because they re circumventing the proper process rep doug collins of georgia the top republican on the judiciary committee has repeatedly pushed back on mr nadler s claim that the committee was working on formal impeachment proceedings arguing that they would need a full house vote to authorize such an investigation the difference between formal impeachment proceedings and what we re doing today is a world apart no matter what the chairman just said mr collins said the ambiguity the confusion is a product of my colleagues own making because there is an easy way to know exactly whether this committee is in impeachment proceedings it s called a vote a vote of the full house of representatives he added at the gop retreat in baltimore on thursday afternoon both mr collins and rep jim jordan of ohio called this latest impeachment push a desperate play for democrats the reason they want to do this the reason they want to change the rules is because nothing else has worked for them mr jordan said minority leader kevin mccarthy said the democrats mixed messaging on impeachment is proof mrs pelosi is struggling to maintain control of her party she has the title but no longer the power to manage the floor he said you can t even understand what they re doing in committee especially when it comes to chairman nadler the top house republican said he is confident that the democrats work on investigating mr trump will be a boon for gop house candidates in 2020 he pointed out that republicans only need to flip 18 seats to retake the majority fewer than the democrats needed going into the 2018 election and there are 31 democrats in vulnerable districts the president carried in 2016 tell me how are democrats going to go back and ask for reelection on what they have achieved all they have achieved is investigations that have gone nowhere mr mccarthy said progressive activists however want democrats to fully embrace impeachment free speech for people by the people credo action courage campaign democracy for america mainers for responsible leadership and march for truth are demanding the committee vote on articles of impeachment by nov 1 and a full house vote by nov 15 some judiciary members have floated the possibility of reaching a decision on whether or not to move forward with articles of impeachment by the end of the year but haven t committed to any firm date we will not allow congress to run out the clock on impeachment read a joint statement from the activists congress has now had the mueller report only one data point in a comprehensive case for trump s impeachment for more than four months our democracy our communities that are under attack and our planet cannot wait any longer for congress to lead for his part mr nadler plans to hit the ground running with more hearings with these new procedures we will begin next week an aggressive series of hearings investigating allegations of corruption obstruction and abuse of power against the president he said after the judiciary meeting the investigation go well beyond the four corners of the mueller report the judiciary committee is also looking into potential corruption launching probes into vice president mike pence s stay at a trump owned property in ireland and the president s effort to host the group of seven summit at one of his miami golf resorts the first hearing under the new rules will be on sept 17 featuring
