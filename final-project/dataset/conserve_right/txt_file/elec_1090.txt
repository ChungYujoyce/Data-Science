with millennials and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton underperforming with the same demographic that helped president obama build winning coalitions in 2008 and 2012 a new york times cbs poll shows 26 percent of voters under the age of 29 supporting johnson and a further 10 percent supporting green presidential nominee jill stein similarly a quinnipiac poll shows johnson at 29 percent of young voters and stein at 15 in that poll clinton barely edges out johnson among young voters getting 31 percent republican presidential nominee donald trump is at 26 percent among that demographic in the poll further a global strategy group poll of millennials in 11 battleground states found 73 percent of millennials saying that trump was a racist and just 38 percent supporting clinton in a 4 way matchup the results have yielded unsurprising hand wringing from older liberals who feel the vote of millennials belongs to them clara jeffrey editor in chief of mother jones tweeted that she has never hated millennials more in response to the nyt cbs poll which earned refreshing responses from millennials new york times columnist ross douthat meanwhile quips that it looked like liberaltarianism is a real thing and that donald trump was very glad of it while republicans have a few politicians who could be called liberaltarian two former republican governors who might be called that are on the libertarian party ticket after all trump is not in a tight race those votes could be crucial and trump has nothing to offer them not something to be glad about the same goes for democrats whose nominee has nothing to offer a demographic that has increasingly become more libertarian friendly a reason rupe poll of millennials in 2014 found 66 percent of them believing government was wasteful and inefficient even as many said they planned to vote democrat in that year and in 2016 the drop off in support for democrats is unsurprising given that the rhetoric about government that democrats deploy does not match the reality on the ground that reality was bound to catch up with millennials who even when they are fans of government give authority the side eye many of the responses to jeffrey s tweets encouraged her sarcastically to keep alienating millennials if she wanted clinton to win the narrative of the older generation of liberals is that donald trump is so bad voters have to hold their nose and vote for clinton the option alone of a third party vote is skewered online mostly by establishment liberals who have increasingly come to represent the poor policy making that has led to a mammoth sized debt and veritable police state in the u s and u s warfare state abroad donald trump does not scare millennials as much as the mess older voters have made of the country clinton s courting of neo conservatives and figures like henry kissinger only serves to alienate millennials more johnson s refusal to play political games like powering through a question about aleppo without knowing what it s in reference to while it makes him an easy target for the media establishment to mock likely ingratiates him to millennials who see both trump and clinton as products of a corrupt political system their parents generation has glorified clinton and president obama s decision to call trump a break from republican tradition instead of the inevitable evolution of it as more dishonest partisans might frame it has also placed johnson and the libertarian party in a better position millennials are used to start ups they are early adopters whose behaviors and decisions are helping drive old giants of industry out of business from blockbuster to taxicabs the latest polls suggest they have the potential to disrupt the political industry in this country in the same way they ve disrupted so many others all the fearmongering over trump the cries of false equivalency and the attempts by millennial influencers like vox com to frame the clinton campaign as something transformative millennials ought to get behind won t bring millennials to heel in the way major parties were able to in days gone by neither will false alarms about spoilers spoiler third parties aren t spoilers shitty candidates are the persistence of never trump republicans even if they don t go for johnson combined with obama and clinton s refusal as of yet to smear the principles of limited government freedom and constitutionalism with trumpism because of republicans history of running on those principles while never acting on them and the libertarian party s decision to nominate socially tolerant and fiscally responsible candidates as many millennials describe themselves means millennials have the chance to catapult the libertarian party into major party status if not through this election cycle alone almost certainly in cycles to come both millennials and libertarians should expect the smears and attacks to become more vociferous and detached from reality as the old establishment partisan order slowly but surely comes to an end advertisement next do firms conspire by having governance rights in an association ed krayewskiis a

looking at the polls and in my own analysis it appears that the higher johnson is the more hillary goes down iow johnson is hurting clinton and helping trump for the last week hillary is pretty much in free fall with trump now ahead in oh fl and gaining pretty much everywhere else at this point though as it has been for the last couple of months it looks like pa will drag hilary s bloated corpse across the finish line i think stein might be the bigger thorn in her side johnson takes some votes from clinton but he also gets some from trump stein pretty much exclusively takes from clinton bernie has to wonder what could ve been bernie could ve made the green party relevant and shaken up democratic party as a result far more than whatever his deal cabinet post or something with hillary is to haul her water and otherwise be quiet all the stranger given bernie s not even a real democrat anymore than trump is a real republican he owes them nothing but contempt for way they treat him i wish rand had sought the libertarian nomination for the same reasons this with reservations that would likely mean no rand in the senate for the next 6 years yeah rand s more valuable as a voice of sanity in the senate imo as if his counterpart mitch is going to let anything useful happen in the senate the thing with that is that clinton could not win this race with sanders going third party imo and because of that sanders would get demonized even more than ralph nader was after 2000 i don t think sanders feels any loyalty to clinton or the dnc i think he thinks pragmatically he will be able to get more of his agenda passed if she s in office and that at a more opportune time in the future someone like him though obviously not him personally will get the nomination and if clinton loses with sanders supporting her then he minimizes his scapegoat culpability and it could potentially lead to a hard left turn in the democratic party in reaction to trump and in reaction to the democratic establishment favorite losing to him there will still be some blaming him for attacking clinton in the primaries thus reducing millenial turnout but there will many others putting the blame on clinton for failing to beat such a flawed opponent sanders could ve either historically shaken things up as a third party candidate or he could have a deal of actual power and get some of his agenda pushed while working with those who despise him it boils down to whether sanders wanted to be remembered by history or wanted things to get done i don t see why he should care he s an old commie who has never been a democrat anyway unless someone made some subtle suggestion about the possibility of his suffering an unfortunate accident unless someone made some subtle suggestion about the possibility of his suffering an unfortunate accident wouldn t be surprising and i assume he s at least as intelligent as the pneumonia virus sanders is wondering what his retirement would look like right now without that sweet sweet beach house they just purchased it s close to where mrs sanders lost all that money for the college that doesn t exist anymore you ve got it backwards the green party would have made bernie irrelevant i m sure there is a contingent of likely voters who poll for johnson as an anti clinton signal and choose stein when she s an option a lot of them are probably bernie millennials on election day if they bother to go to the polls i expect they ll vote clinton or stein if they have the option start working from home great job for students stay at home moms or anyone

millennials belongs to them what kind of ingrate youngster wouldn t vote for his or her sleazy deceitful grandmother it should be de facto it s getting more difficult to take voting blocs for granted for some reason thank you for bringing that picture to my attention gold star for ed clinton really might be fucked she s reliant on young people black people and latinos coming out to vote for her but two of those three groups will probably just not show up to vote for someone as terrible as she is and she won t get the same support from black people that obama did either frog text really ed you too should he get off your lawn no ed is a cultist by association riven have you not hear the word prepare your pants for repeated fecal removal the cult of kek ancient frog god of chaos is upon us at this point i appreciate any alt text from a millennial i just want to point out that it s warcraft orcish for lol so there not actually frog text i just want to point out that kek or kuk is an ancient frog god that symbolizes chaos and has been appropriated by the alt right kek s got a feminine form too which is keket double also kek is referred to as the bringer in of light for those of you who are running low on tinfoil kek bur i still have absolutely no idea what any of that means neither do i and i ll be perfectly happy to keep it that way methinks thou doth protest too much zeb methinks is trite and entirely over used on the inter webs i suggest kek would do us all a big favor by eating that bit of the language up whole in a single bite you re saddled with a ton of debt to buy your way into an uncertain job market courtesy of years of democrat economic policy you re silenced and marginalized by grievance group hysterics you re paying for entitlements to ease the burden on your much better off elders with no guarantee that you yourself will ever enjoy them and your children may not enjoy the standard of living you enjoy what have you got to lose by voting for trump life liberty and the pursuit of happiness but admittedly it s not clear which way of casting your vote is riskiest the only thing that is clear is that for the most part it doesn t matter since the trajectory is unaltered between the two of them there isn t a reason to vote for trump if you actually give a shit about spending or economic policy or haven t you been paying attention the bernie folks are not going to vote for hillary and that could help swing the election trump s way i do like how the millennial dems are incensed that there is corruption in politics though unfortunately they think bernie was the guy to fix corruption well who would you get to fix corruption huh i don t envy the bernie folk if trump loses their proggie social circles are gonna come down hard on them even if most of them voted for clinton it ll all be their fault i m not so sure about that at least outside the internet most young bernie supporters are surrounded by other young bernie supporters most the shit they ll get if clinton loses are from older not necessarily old but old enough that they re not in the same social circles democrats i d get joe don baker of course whatever the rock s name is in the recent version is the reference millennials would get old man even the millennials didn t watch that movie did they it was ancient like 10 years ago if the race is close it will be their fault they could split the democratic party up which would be wonderful then again those bernie lovers are insane the bernie folks are not going to vote for hillary maybe it seems like they wouldn t but most of the bern victims i know have quickly forgiven the dnc debacle and are now ready for hillary they re like battered wives i don t get it the bernie folks are not going to vote for hillary i know several people who were openly for bernie who are now going to hold their noses and loyally vote d including my gf dunno if anyone has polled these voters your gf has definitely been poled millennials just aren t that into hillary clinton bill clinton s into millennials all the time too bad he has to hide all that support from hillary because she could use some of that enthusiasm for sure btw don t look now but trump might be getting close in virginia although it s just one poll shitty as he would be seeing the wailing if he were actually elected would be the greatest source of comedy in my entire life http tinyurl com hl3g648 there are a lot of state polls with 5 or more point swings towards trump in the last 3 weeks its crazy the momentum is obviously going one way and accelerated after sunday either candidate could win by 5 points and a landslide or 271 electors i d be enjoying this more if it wasn t these two candidates or if it was happening in another country i d really enjoy the spectacle be honest if this was happening in another country we d have no idea it was happening it s all i can do to keep up with the austrian re re re elections i suspect that this is nothing more than trump s dead cat bounce in the polls i want trump for the entertainment value plus melania makes a much better looking first lady than bill another cosmo hops the maga train welcome aboard i m starting to think that the average libertarian e g me has been taking the short view regarding this election perhaps the long view is that the two major parties are such a turn off for millennials that they ll say screw these guys screw this system government sucks millennials will be running things soon perhaps we should be optimistic generation safe space gives me no reason to think that they re going to have a positive impact rejected the party duopoly is nice and all but there is little to suggest they have any movement towards a greater appreciation of individual liberty you know there are some libertarian millennials just like there s some libertarian boomers etc there s even some lady libertarian millennials whoa citation needed most of the young conservatives i meet and see lean libertarian but who the hell knows what will happen as they age the whole millennials are this or that now politically is kind of pointless as people age the right left divide tends to even out to some extent i have little faith that left leaning individuals who move to the right politically are going to sway libertarian most likely they ll just feel further alienated from the dems and the changing political tides hell asking a twenty year old to articulate a firmly held political belief system is like asking a eight year old what they want to be when they grow up there s a lot of idealism and a clear lack of understanding when it comes to how some things work but they really really believe that s what should happen rejected the party duopoly is nice and all but there is little to suggest they have any movement towards a greater appreciation of individual liberty this is why the lp needed a better candidate than gj if only to give these kids a better idea of libertarian operating principles as opposed to somebody who can pander and say milton friedman s name at the same time yeah this election was a missed opportunity for libertarians and libertarianism if the libertarians hadn t nominated a former governor they d be getting as much traction now as jill i don t buy that for a second if mcaffee behaved in an absolutely batshit crazy manner he could have lost some points relative to gj but the notion that gj is where he is because former governor ignores a the fact that he has to remind everyone in every commercial that he is a former governor and b his opponents are nowhere near as popular as the one s he faced in the previous election good points he was the 1 gov last time jill is far more articulate and lucid in making her talking points than gary is but absent any relevant job experience people just shrug her off with a meh which is why i believe that austin or mcaffee or darryl wouldn t be polling as well as gary now either two words kurt russell call me snake or you could skip the whole election thing and put your efforts into proselytizing millenials 24 7 shit man think strategically when generation safe space grows up all you need to do is set up some official safe spaces on election day and get some priests in dominican friar s robes to walk around and none of the safe spacers will vote they ll be hiding in your safe spaces from the scary klansmen roaming around the few good one s then get the whole millennial vote i think we are a bit too quick to assume that it is generation safe spaces the phenomenon certainly exists but no one i know who is under 30 is really like that kray kray that may may is some kronik shit dank memes 2016 yo a video follow up on robbie soave s post on james o keefe from earlier this week so y all aren t going to complain that you don t have free speech right i just want to make sure a berkeley student tells james o keefe project veritas founder and conservative activist http dailycaller com 2016 09 ion video when the left engages in violence against person spitting in your face etc or property it s just healthy counter protest no once bodily fluids are involved it s sexual assault and time to bring out the title ix inquisitors while republicans have a few politicians who could be called liberaltarian two former republican governors who might be called that are on the libertarian party ticket after all trump is not i can t 100 follow that sentence but apparently it says trump isn t a liberaltarian no he s a lefty democrat in drag he just proposed that companies be forced to give six weeks of paid maternity leave lessee promise target demographic handouts in order to secure votes and figure it out later with the magic wand of government sounds like a run of the mill populist to me not too far removed from our current president sounds like a run of the mill populist to me not too far removed from our current president this trump may not be an experienced politician but he s learning the art of pandering very quickly bold prediction if trump wins it ll be 4 more years of the status quo same as clinton it literally doesn t matter which shitheel wins just like always populists aren t exactly the same as marxists or the global technocracy you will certainly notice a difference in the flavor of big government you experience he just proposed that companies be forced to give six weeks of paid maternity leave oh that s where this shit is coming from i was in the doghouse last night because i disagreed with my pregnant and hormonal wife about guaranteed maternity leave she s typically pretty free market conservatarian but sometimes the emotional argument wins out for her i m pregnant too but i m with you i work for a small start up that isn t subject to fmla and i don t qualify for paid leave but they re giving me 8 weeks unpaid because my boss is nice like that it s ok that it isn t paid because i ve been saving money since i found out it s no one s responsibility but my own and my husband s to make arrangements for the childbirth and recovery if my boss had been a jerk and fired me over it it would have sucked but i would ve said good riddance i wouldn t want to work for him anyway it s no one s responsibility but my own and my husband s to make arrangements for the childbirth and recovery if my boss had been a jerk and fired me over it it would have sucked but i would ve said good riddance i wouldn t want to work for him anyway amen i tried with limited success to explain such things to her but she kept coming back to the emotional response that it s punishing mothers to not let them take maternity leave at the very least they should be guaranteed their job when they come back in her mind she tends to feel an issue out first before thinking about it telling her that maternity leave is a benefit with value attached to it that should be negotiated as part of a compensation package really wasn t hitting the feels the right way last night thankfully it s a moot point for us she s only going to be working a few odd hours a week once the child comes congrats by the way thanks same to you but she kept coming back to the emotional response that it s punishing mothers to not let them take maternity leave and i do think that is a valid reaction to an employer who doesn t want to let mothers take maternity leave but it s a cultural issue not a government issue the government is not capable of making the employer adopt a culture that is accepting of pregnant women just like they re not capable of making people not racist sexist etc so crafty employers can and do still easily find ways around those regulations you just force them to hide it personally i d rather let the jerks be brazen about it so i can easily avoid them they re giving me 8 weeks unpaid because my boss is nice like that it s ok that it isn t paid because i ve been saving money since i found out it s great that it worked out for you but expecting women in general to be responsible with money is manifestly unreasonable clinton and president obama s decision to call trump a break from republican tradition instead of the inevitable evolution of it as more dishonest partisans might frame it while i agree with this assessment didn t a certain online editor for reason make precisely the claim that s associated with dishonest partisans i d love to believe that this will manifest itself in some political sea change but i started high school the year of perot s first run and ended it during his second and while i recall a lot of enthusiasm amongst people my age and a shade older obviously we still ended up where we are today i mean the product of perot 92 was bill clinton for two terms then two terms of george w then two terms of obama iow dick of shit changed for all that a younger generation was enthused about outsider third party politics i m keeping my fingers crossed but i m not holding my breath i miss his powerpoint slides it will be interesting to see how many of the precious snowflakes are brave enough to pull the lever for a 3rd party candidate once election day rolls around it will also be interesting to see how many of them even bother to vote this time if the millennials go for johnson or stein in significant enough numbers to hand the election to trump look for dems to raise the voting age back to 21 as it was before 1971 or maybe even 25 or 30 they will argue that brains aren t fully developed until you reach 30 according to scientific studies causing the young uns to not know what s good for them clara jeffrey editor in chief of mother jones tweeted that she has never hated millennials more in response to the nyt cbs poll as someone born in 1978 and therefore on the border between gen x and millennial let me say the feeling s mutual you commie hag looking at the hag s twitter page and scrolling down through the responses i spotted this gem of derp d n nation dnnation 7h7 hours ago bwhalley clarajeffery the private prison industry which johnson is a tool for qualifies as corporate establishment no the fuck is this dipshit on about the fuck is this dipshit on about socialism i won t waste my vote on clinton the war monger and sworn enemy of individual liberty if i knew i was going to be stuck with the 20 000 000 000 bill from the profligate spending of those older and allegedly wiser than myself i d be pissed it s sure fun to see how many different people think i personally owe them my political fealty because of my age religion occupation and or place of birth so far i think it s up to literally every single human who is attached to the republicans or democrats my dear the next five minutes can change your life give a chance to your good luck read this article please move to a better life we make profit on the internet since 1998 http www jobsea3 com amusingly when donald was a democratic donor no one felt his supposed racism was bad enough to prohibit spending his dollars on their campaign if donald gave hillary money and he s a racist does that make her a racist by proxy for taking his cash hmm if one was going to troll the establishment it would be hard to find a bigger troll than trump i wouldn t vote for trump or hillary under any circumstances and i hate that the presidency has become a reality tv show but it s hard to deny that it s exposed the hypocrisy for everyone to see people ignore it but it s there if you bother to look millennials are used to start ups so are most every other generation of americans i would love to see an exit pol in which they asked had it been an option would you have voted shoot them both and start over black magic specialist baba solve all problems like love problem marriage
