expected to come for another two weeks top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century instead of relaxing recently issued federal social distancing guidelines he said they ll be very much as they are maybe toughened up a bit really we have no other choice mr trump said this is a very vital 30 days we re sort of putting it all on the line the president said that down the road he could potentially envision an america where everyone wears a protective mask in public it s certainly something we could discuss mr trump said we ll take a look at it for a period of time not forever residents in maryland virginia and d c were ordered to stay home except in extremely limited circumstances with exceptions allowed to obtain goods like groceries seek medical care or engage in outdoor activities like jogging or hiking as long as people adhere to proper social distancing guidelines maryland gov larry hogan called the covid 19 a deadly public health crisis we are no longer asking or suggesting that marylanders stay home we are directing them to do so said mr hogan a republican virginia gov ralph northam a democrat issued a similar directive we need everyone to take this seriously and act responsibly he said our message to virginians is clear stay home d c mayor muriel bowser said residents who willfully violate the city s new stay at home order could be guilty of a misdemeanor

fine of up to 2 500 and or up to a year in jail at the rose garden press briefing mr trump was asked specifically about mr northam s june 10 time frame for his order which extends far beyond the latest end date for the new federal guidance we re letting the governors do pretty much what they want with our supervision mr trump said some go further than others there are more than 775 000 positive coronavirus cases worldwide and more than 37 000 deaths according to a tracker from johns hopkins university in the u s there are more than 160 000 cases and more than 2 900 deaths mr trump on march 16 asked the american people to work and learn at home to avoid crowds and nonessential travel and to use carryout instead of dining inside restaurants he hoped to loosen those rules by the end of march and get things up and running by easter but on sunday he announced he was extending that guidance until april 30 after seeing models that said up to 2 million people could die if the virus was left unchecked dr deborah birx the u s coronavirus response coordinator said that collectively states are moving in the same general direction these recommendations are recommendations that the globe is using dr birx said and so we really do recommend that every governor every mayor looks very carefully and ensures that their communities are utilizing these guidelines in addition to the 8 100 ventilators already being shipped to states from the national stockpile mr trump said more than 1 000 additional ventilators are set to be shipped in the next 48 hours to states around the country that have been pleading for help he said there are about 10 000 ventilators in reserve and predicted there will be enough to go around in the coming weeks despite forecasts from governors across the country that they remain well short of their expected needs the president spoke by phone with governors monday to get an update on the supplies they need for their respective states he also touted several private companies that have stepped up to produce ventilators which are crucial for treating patients who have tested positive for covid 19 and that shipments would soon be going to italy france and spain the fact that we re doing so many so quickly is a tribute to our great companies he said the positive spin came amid grim projections about the expected death toll in the u s earlier in the day dr birx had said the u s could see hundreds of thousands of deaths from the virus even if americans almost uniformly stuck to the guidelines and actively worked to stop the spread if we do things together well almost perfectly we could get in the range of 100 000 to 200 000 fatalities we don t even want to see that dr birx said on nbc s today program the coronavirus was discovered in wuhan china in december it killed thousands in china before the epicenter shifted to south korea and then europe and the americas italy has seen the worst death toll with more than 11 500 followed by spain at more than 7 300 new york the hardest hit u s state in the coronavirus outbreak got some support on monday with the arrival of the usns comfort a floating hospital ship in manhattan the comfort has capacity for 1 000 beds which are expected to help free up space in the city s hospitals for covid 19 patients new york mayor bill de blasio said the arrival of the ship was welcome news though he estimated that new york city needs to triple its hospital capacity by may he said they started the month with about 20 000 working hospital beds in new york city it is a daunting task but we got a big big boost this is like adding a whole other hospital to new york city mr de blasio said the mayor said entire hospitals will have to effectively transform into all intensive care units to get through the coming weeks that s how dire that s how tough this situation is he said new york gov andrew cuomo said there are now more than 1 200 coronavirus related deaths in the state and at least 66 497 positive cases both numbers are far and away the most of any state in the country mr cuomo pleaded with out of state health care workers to come to new york to help out if they were in a position to do so as governor of new york i am asking health care professionals across the country if you don t have a health care crisis in your community please come help us in new york now he said we ll return the favor mr cuomo had already put the state on near total lockdown ordering non essential employees to work from home and shuttering bars and restaurants except for carry out orders the governor has suggested recently that some of the social distancing rules he imposed on new york could be working pointing to a declining rate of hospitalizations but he said monday there is still too much density in new york city saying the city has been unsuccessfully trying to reduce density in playgrounds if that continues we ll take a mandatory action to close down playgrounds as harsh as that sounds mr cuomo said but it can actually save people s lives in a grim reminder of the toll the coronavirus is taking on new york a makeshift emergency hospital site popped up in central park in recent days as the virus wreaks havoc on the u s economy mr trump last week signed into law a 2 2 trillion financial rescue package that includes 350 billion to help small businesses make payroll among other provisions treasury secretary steven t mnuchin said monday that the money for the small business loans should be available by the end of the week that will be at lightning speed mr mnuchin said on fox business network he said they expect the 350 billion in small business loans will cover about 50 of the private workforce the small business administration loans are intended to cover eight weeks of payroll and about 25 of overhead for qualifying companies with 500 or fewer employees if the companies use the money to bring back or pay employees the loan will be forgiven if we run out of money and this is a huge success we will absolutely go back to congress and ask for more money he said he also said that the direct deposit checks of at least 1 200 would be showing up in americans accounts in three weeks the checks were another major part of the package congress passed in response to the escalating coronavirus outbreak mr mnuchin said the existing package should help sustain the u s eco
