tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion two actors who are best known for a television sitcom that aired more than a decade ago have found a new lease on life exposing for all of us of the totalitarian instincts of liberals eric mccormack and debra messing of the 1990s tv series will and grace decided it would be a really good idea to use social media to call for a blacklist of conservatives in hollywood being oh so clever and knowing exactly what it was they were doing they opted to couch their fascist instinct as a personal inquiry so that they would know who not to work with in response to a hollywood reporter tweet announcing that president donald trump would be appearing in a beverly hills fundraiser in mid september mr mccormack tweeted hey kindly report on everyone attending this event so the rest of us can be clear about who we don t wanna work with thx ms messing issued her support for the creation of the list shortly thereafter tweeting the trade magazine should print a list of all attendees please adding that the public has a right to know top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick the two actors are friends so it s not a stretch to believe this to be a dumb but coordinated effort repeating what rep joaquin castro did in texas when he released the names and employers of local trump donors both ms messing and mr mccormack are middle aged they re not 20 somethings with no education about u s history which would include the 1950s mccarthy era and the blacklisting of actors and other creative people who were or just thought to be associated with the communist party the good news is they were confronted on social media and on various television programs for the obvious call for a blacklist after all there s only one reason you put out a public call to create a list of people and that is to invite shunning harassment and sometimes even violence against those whom you are targeting that didn t seem to matter until whoopi goldberg condemned them both on national television the cohost of the view did something remarkable not just because of her liberalism but because she is the only hollywood liberal so far to slam the two actors for calling for something that is in fact fascist the hollywood reporter said whoopi goldberg was not pleased that messing and mccormack would make such a request in a heated dialogue with fellow panelists joy behar and sunny hostin goldberg said that the last time people did this it did not end well we had something called a blacklist and a lot of really good people were accused of stuff nobody cared whether it was true or not they were accused and they lost their right to work in this country people can vote for who they want to that is one of the great rights of this country you don t have to like it but we don t go after people because we don t like who they voted for we don t go after them that way we can talk about issues and stuff but we don t print out lists lo and behold after that exchange mr mccormack issued a statement insisting that he doesn t support blacklists reports were that he was walking back his comments but that s not entirely accurate instead he insisted he had been misinterpreted and that while he doesn t support blacklists or discrimination of any kind he added on instagram i d simply like to understand where trump s major donations are coming from which is a matter of public record i am holding myself responsible for making educated and informed decisions that i can morally and ethically standby and to do that transparency is essential what utter nonsense i m sure if he could have added an insincere confused shrug he would have ms messing in the meantime retweeted that saying she agrees completely of course she does i couldn t of said it better is how she chimed in on twitter there is an importance to this charade in that it reveals and confirms what we ve seen the democratic party and liberals as they devolve back into the most natural state of the left slouching toward the desire to harm and even destroy those with whom they disagree keep in mind the call itself for the creation of a blacklist is actually the totalitarian aspect an overarching threat meant to frighten and intimidate people from acting on their own personal beliefs political social or cultural it is meant to stomp on the virtual neck of anyone who may dare think for themselves from rep maxine waters calling for personal direct harassment of trump supporters to mr castro who released the names and employers of trump donors in texas and now for these two sitcom actors calling for a list of political heretics the point is to frighten intimidate bully and threaten people into silence and retreat this tells you everything you need to know about the democratic party the liberal establishment and their enforcers and it is vital you remember in 2020 tammy bruce president of independent women s voice author and
