been in trouble in this world wallace we aposll talk live with one of president trump aposs top intelligence officials cia director mike pompeo to breakdown the situation in north korea mike pompeo in his first sunday show interview since taking the post then as tensions ramp up will the u s launch a preemptive attack on north korea we aposll discuss the president aposs military options with one of the top national security voices in congress republican senator lindsey graham it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive plus the president speaks against the violence in charlottesville but fails to call out the white supremacists trump we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence on many sides on many sides wallace voice over we aposll ask our sunday panel whether the president aposs comments went far enough all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the war of words between president trump and north korea keeps escalating with growing concern it will become a military confrontation in a few minutes we aposll talk with mike pompeo director of the cia about the situation on the korean peninsula but this weekend the president is dealing with a new problem and another controversy a white nationalist rally in charlottesville virginia turned violent when a car rammed into a crowd of counter protesters killing one and injuring dozens and a number of republican leaders have criticized the president for failing to condemn the white supremacist kristin fisher is covering the president as he continues his time at his golf club in new jersey kristin kristin fisher fox news correspondent chris it aposs not so much what president trump said it aposs what he didn apost say on twitter and in person he never even mentioned the white supremacists that had gathered in charlottesville ostensibly to protest the removal of a confederate statue but the fbi and the justice department have already launched a civil rights investigation and the governor of virginia has declared a state of emergency one woman is dead 19 other injured after a car plowed into the crowd of people who came to protest against the white supremacists police suspect a 20 year old james alex field was behind the wheel he aposs been charged with second degree murder and other counts two virginia state troopers were also killed when their helicopter crashed while patrolling the protest president trump now calling for unity and denouncing the violence begin video clip trump we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence on many sides on many sides end video clip fisher so president trump is declining to take sides while a growing course of republican lawmakers are urging him to call it what it is senator cory gardner said quote mr president we must call evil by its name these were white supremacist and this was domestic terrorism but no one can accuse president trump of not talking tough enough to north korean leader kim jong un begin video clip trump if he does anything with respect to guam or anyplace else that aposs an american territory or an american ally he will truly regret it end video cli fisher over the weekend president trump told the governor of guam we are with you 1 000 percent he also spoke with the chinese president xi jinping who urged mr trump to show restraint but despite this escalating war of words the u s military aposs posture towards pyongyang hasn apost really changed no deployments of ships or troops no evacuation of american citizens from south korea all signs that this may be more talk than action at least for now chris wallace we will have much more on the violence in virginia later in the program kristin thank you joining me now for his first sunday show interview is director of the cia mike pompeo and welcome to fox news sunday mike pompeo cia director chris it aposs great to be with you this morning wallace with the news this week and it call came this week the north korea can now put a warhead on a missile how close is that regime to being able to deploy a nuclear weapon that can hit the u s mainland pompeo well chris i don apost want to get into specifics but it is the case they are closer they aposve been growing closer for two decades plus now previous administrations haven apost taken this on president trump has made clear that it is his intention to protect the american people and you saw this past week we aposve made real progress my hats off to the president secretary tillerson ambassador haley they have united the world with sanctions against north korea 15 0 vote that aposs real progress we aposd seen the chinese now say for among the first times that they believe the correct answer has to be denuclearized peninsula and that aposs exactly the policy of the trump administration and from my perspective as the director of the cia we have been given the resources we need to perform our mission to collect intelligence to understand the threat and make sure we can deliver that to policy makers wallace when you say they aposre closer are we talking months are we still talking years pompeo so it aposs difficult to put a timeline to these things chris but each time they test another missile or if they should conduct a nuclear weapons test they develop expertise they expand the envelope and so it is probably fair to say that they are moving towards that at an ever alarming rate wallace i want to pick up on that because there aposs been criticism that the intelligence community including the central intelligence agency has been surprised over and over by how fast north korea is moving with its weapons program here aposs former u n ambassador bill richardson begin video clip bill richardson former u s ambassador to the u n that worries me because we should have been on this long ago we were caught off guard north korea was way more advanced than our intelligence people told us that aposs a massive intelligence failure that should never happen again end video clip wallace why were we surprised when north korea a couple of weeks ago we found they had an icbm capability why were we surprised to learn that they could put a warhead on a missile are those as bill richardson says intelligence balers pompeo with all due respect to governor richardson he aposs just flat out wrong the intelligence community wasn apost surprised policymakers weren apost surprised this was before my time most of this work i aposve been doing this just a handful of months now the intelligence community has done remarkable work to deliver the policymakers the progress that the north korean regime has been making but it doesn apost surprise me that folks who came before me now act surprised they did nothing the intelligence community has delivered a consistent message about kim jong un himself his capacity to develop missiles his intent and so i don apost think there aposs any surprised by policymakers who often following the progress the regime has been making to put an icbm into to launch an icbm with a nuclear warhead wallace what is your psychological profile of kim jong un pompeo well he aposs pretty isolated today for the first time we now have the chinese and the russians wallace yes but you give a political answer pompeo these aren apost political answers this is about what he aposs thinking this is what he is observing we are creating conditions for the leader there to make it clear to him that it aposs just going to be unacceptable to continue to develop his missile program wallace but what is your psychological profile of him is he rational is he disciplined is you tell me pompeo he i would describe him as rational he responds to adverse circumstances and as the trump administration continues to put diplomatic pressure on the regime i aposm confident that he will see that and that the people around him will see that they will become ever more isolated and will get to the denuclearized peninsula that this administration intends to achieve wallace well you say he aposs rational and he responds to outside situations given that i want to play some of what president trump has been saying this week here it is begin video clip trump north korea best not make any more threats to the united states they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen let me hear kim jong un say it ok he aposs not saying it he hasn apost been saying much for the last three days end video clip wallace can you be sure how kim will react to statements like those including some that call him out personally pompeo the president has made it very clear to the north korean regime how america will respond if certain actions are taken we are hopeful that the leader of that country will understand them in precisely the way they are intended to permit him a place to get where we can get the nuclear weapons off the peninsula it aposs that straightforward what we need from an intelligence perspective what is most important is that our communications are clear that the fella who intends to inflict pain on the united states of america understands the u s position in an unambiguous way that aposs the best message you can deliver to someone who aposs putting america at risk wallace but i think it aposs fair to say the whole world is kind of worried is concerned i talked to regular folks about are we headed for nuclear confrontation as the head of the cia your best intelligence because a lot of this depends the president has set a number of redlines how confident can you be as to whether he aposs going to step back from those red lines or step over them pompeo i can apost get into the details about what we know exactly the message is being received but make no mistake about it chris this administration has made our policy very clear we aposve engaged the world to support that policy crosstalk wallace but i was asking about the reaction in pyongyang pompeo yes so the reaction in north korea that we are intending to get is an understanding that america is no longer going to have the strategic patients that attached that has permitted him to continue to develop his weapons program it aposs that straightforward wallace but can you be confident that he aposs going to play your game pompeo it aposs a very difficult situation in north korea wallace so how worried should people be pompeo nothing imminent we aposve seen what the defense department has said on our side you aposve seen the reporting about what the north koreans are doing and not doing there aposs nothing imminent today but make no mistake about it the continuation the increased chance that there will be a nuclear missile in denver is a very serious threat and the administration is going to treat as such wallace you say that there aposs nothing imminent but you can only talk from the u s side can you be sure there aposs nothing imminent from the north koreans side pompeo we have a pretty good idea wallace and what aposs your idea pompeo i can apost can apost share with you about the information we have about what aposs going on in north korea but make no mistake the intelligence community does excellent work on understanding what aposs going on on the north korean side wallace just pompeo that aposs dangerous border ph wallace just to press because obviously this is something that aposs of huge concern and interest to people all around the world you are saying that you don apost believe there aposs anything imminent in terms of north korean action another missile test another nuclear test following those muscles towards one pompeo chris i aposm quite confident that he will continue to try to develop his missile program so it wouldn apost surprise me if there was another test he conducted two in july so it wouldn apost surprise me if there was another missile test wallace but when you say pompeo well there aposs no but to that wallace but when you say that there aposs nothing imminent pompeo what i aposm talking about is i aposve heard folks talking about that we being on the cusp of a nuclear war i aposve seen no intelligence that would indicate that we aposre in that place today wallace ok i want to talk to about another issue which kind of came out of the blue on friday president trump talked about the increasingly repressive regime of venezuelan president nicolas maduro here he is begin video clip trump venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and they are dying we have many options for venezuela including a possible military action if necessary end video clip wallace given the troubled history of u s intervention in latin america wouldn apost a u s military option in venezuela create a huge uproar and what is the justification for it in terms of u s national security pompeo well i aposll leave the defense department piece of this to secretary mattis i aposm confident that he could answer that question from an intelligence perspective we have watched in my seven months in office continued deterioration maduro continuing to assert more power inflict more pain on the people of venezuela you can see the beginning of fissures amongst various groups and what i believe the president was trying to accomplish this week was to give the venezuelan people hope and opportunity to create a situation where democracy can be restored in venezuela the intelligence makes very very clear that the maduro regime continues to put snipers in towers and do things that are horrible repressive and the american policy is to work with our latin american partners to try and restore democracy to that important country wallace could that ph would involve a military option for the u s i mean it aposs a civil war i understand it aposs a terrible situation but ultimately why is it our problem pompeo oh look venezuela could very much become a risk to the united states of america the cubans are there the russians are there the iranians hezbollah are there this is this is something that has a risk of getting to a very very bad place and so america needs to take this very seriously wallace we don apost get the cia director on this program very often so i aposm going to take advantage of your the fact that you are here to do a lightning round quick questions quick answers so we can cover a bunch of territory pompeo oh i aposm going to do my best chris wallace is it true that you went to afghanistan last week and that you left quite disturbed by the lack of confidence of the afghan leadership pompeo no so the predicate to your question is correct i did go to afghanistan i did not leave disturbed the united states is going to in a relatively short period of time develop the trump administration aposs policy for afghanistan and i want to be able to talk about what the cia is doing there and how we can be a part of achieving a good objective for america wallace after 16 years of war why do you believe sending in more u s troops will make a difference pompeo the president will make that decision we are presenting a wide range of options to the president of the united states and to cover a broad range of different alternative so that we can fundamentally change the trajectory of what aposs going on in afghanistan wallace and what if we don apost send in more troops what will the situation in afghanistan be pompeo it depends what other situations get made alongside of that there are questions not only about the number of troops but authorities capacity the way we coordinate how we bring in allies and partners to achieve the objective that we aposre trying to so it aposs not just about u s force numbers and getting the objective we hope to get to in afghanistan wallace before taking this job you are a member of the house benghazi committee a federal judge has just asked the state department to look again to see what emails were sent particularly by hillary clinton with regard to benghazi do you believe that we have gotten to the bottom of the benghazi attack and hillary clinton aposs role pompeo chris i will leave foia litigation to others i aposm pretty busy at the cia these days wallace as cia director well let me ask you about a different one this one is more directly in your wheelhouse now i assume that you have seen the unmasking requests by members officials of the obama administration was there an effort by people and the obama administration to spy either on the trump campaign or the trump transition pompeo so there aposs an active investigation going on all across capitol hill we have done our job as a cia we provided information in response to inquiries for multiple committees on senate and house side we aposll continue to do that to make sure that they can perform their oversight functions properly wallace have you seen all the requests for unmasking that were made by obama administration officials to find out when a trump person was caught up in foreign surveillance to try to find out who that person was have you seen all those requests pompeo yes wallace are you satisfied that they were all legitimate pompeo we provided that information to capitol hill wallace but you won apost tell us pompeo there aposs an active investigation going on chris we aposll let them we aposll let them complete their work wallace do you think it merits more investigation pompeo i think that as a former member of congress i want to give them all the headroom they possibly could want wallace finally there has been criticism you know about them i aposm not telling you something you don apost know that you are too political and that instead of being the honest broker of intelligence the cia director always is that sometimes you try to bolster the views and the opinions the policies of president trump your response to that sir pompeo yes it aposs just fundamentally false i do have biases there aposs no doubt about that i aposm going to be aggressive and we aposre going to win and we aposre going to perform our function we are going to be the premier espionage organization in the history of the world that aposs my only bias chris wallace in terms of being too political pompeo my team does their job we deliver truth to the president i get a chance almost every day to be with the president and deliver this exquisite information the truth as best the cia and intelligence community can understand it we do great work the president is incredibly demanding of us for that great work he relies on what we do at the cia and when we aposve asked for money or authorities he has given it to us he finds the intelligence community incredibly important part of his capacity to deliver national security for the american people wallace director pompeo thank you thanks for your time pompeo thank you wallace please come back sir pompeo i will sir thank you wallace up next is president trump aposs rhetoric inflaming the standoff with north korea or helping to resolve it one of the senate aposs top national security voices lindsey graham talks about that and the white nationalist rally in virginia commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway at the arthur ravenel jr bridge in charleston south carolina as tension ramps up between the u s and north korea president trump says our military is locked and loaded joining us now republican senator lindsey graham who aposs one of the key members of the senate on national security issues senator let aposs start before we get to north korea with that white supremacist rally in charlottesville virginia saturday thousands of people including neo nazis and members of the klan marching to quote take america back your reaction sen lindsey graham r south carolina well it aposs a nod to domestic terrorism and the groups you just mentioned are hateful groups they aposre enemies of freedom i aposd like to see a task force and the department of justice and homeland security to look at the size and scope of these groups report back to congress to see if we need to do more in terms of suppressing them but when it comes to president trump i aposm with cory gardner he missed an opportunity to be very explicit here these groups seem to believe they have a friend in donald trump in the white house i don apost know why they believe that but they don apost see me as a friend in the senate and i would urge the president to dissuade these groups that he aposs their friend wallace well let aposs talk about that because as you point out the president is being criticized for falling failing to call out the white supremacist the white nationalist graham yes wallace here he is yesterday begin video clip trump we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence on many sides on many sides end video clip wallace why do you think the president said that on many sides and never referred to white supremacist never referred to neo nazis and do you think you say that some of them feel they have a friend of the white house do you think that this president who has no problem talking tough to a lot of people is somehow not willing to take on that maybe a small part but that part of his base graham let me say this i aposm glad they don apost like me i aposm glad they believe that lindsey graham is not their friend it would bother me a lot if they did so if i were president of the united states and these people showed sympathy toward me and my agenda it would bother me and i would urge the president to dissuade them of the fact that he aposs sympathetic to their cause because their cause it aposs hate it is un american they are domestic terrorists and we need more from our president on this issue wallace and do you have any thought as to why he didn apost do that yesterday graham i like president trump it aposs up to him to correct the record here not me i know they don apost consider me as their friend and i think the president can be clear when he wants to be he needs to be clear here wallace let aposs turn to north korea how close are we to a military confrontation there has been no movement of troops toward south korea or even the region there aposs been no evacuation of americans from south korea so is this all just talk graham i don apost think there aposs an military action is imminent but we are on a collision course with north korea president trump inherited a mess all those smart people who are criticizing his rhetoric and his policy how well did you do so i aposm very pleased that donald trump has different rhetoric and different policies towards north korea his policy is never to allow the north koreans the ability to hit the home land with a nuclear tipped icbm that is the right policy wallace you have called kim jong un you yourself have a quote crazy man and i know that you graham yes wallace you have met with president trump on this issue here are some more about the president said this week begin video clip trump and he aposs not going to threaten the united states and he is not going to threaten japan and he aposs not going to threaten south korea no that aposs not a dare as you say that is a statement of fact end video clip wallace i take your point that all of the efforts by the wise men of the clinton regime graham right wallace the clinton administration and the bush 43 administration and the obama administration have the result of that is that they are closer to a nuclear weapon that could hit the u s mainland than they ever were but is that the best way to deal with a crazy man and more specifically you hear the president there setting redlines about kim making threats well he aposs continued to make threats and the president hasn apost acted graham i think it aposs absolutely the right rhetoric i have president trump aposs back on this it would be insane to talk the same and act the same as you have for the last 20 years because you aposre going to get more of the same do you understand what president trump is trying to tell kim jong un i do and i think he does too and more importantly so do the chinese the next time that president trump gets lectured by the chinese president about how he talks regarding north korea i hope you will remind the chinese president that you aposre 100 percent responsible china is for north korea in its current state you owned their economy and hold china 100 percent accountable for what happens in the future without china aposs help and empowerment there would be no nuclear north korea so it aposs now time to take the gloves off in terms of how we aposre going to deal with the threat to the homeland i aposm 100 percent certain that donald trump and his military force as a last resort to stop north korea from developing a missile to hit the american homeland i know he will do that i hope north korea understands it i hope china understands it and quite frankly he has no other choice and idea ph wallace i want to turn to another subject as i discussed with director pompeo out of the blue the president raise the possibility on friday of military option one assumes military intervention in venezuela graham yes wallace with the socialist regime of nicolas maduro why would we want to get involved militarily in what is in effect a civil war there and would congress support that graham i have no idea why we would use military force in venezuela i aposm a pretty hawkish guy i know if we don apost send more troops to afghanistan it aposs going to fail and every soldier in afghanistan is an insurance policy against 9 11 i know why we have troops in iraq and syria to train people to destroy isil i know why we have troops in south korea and europe to protect us against threats like north korea and russian expansion i have no idea why we would use military force in venezuela i aposm open minded to a reason but at the end of the day our military should be deployed when there aposs a national security interest that can be articulated to the american people i don apost see one in venezuela in terms of the military force wallace let me turn to another issue president trump has been going after your republican leader in the senate mitch mcconnell graham yes wallace raising the possibility that perhaps he should step down or at least not closing that off here he is begin video clip trump i said mitch get to work and let aposs get it done they should have had this last one done they lost by one vote for a thing like that to happen is a disgrace end video clip wallace is mcconnell aposs job in any trouble ultimately it aposs you republican senators who decide whether he aposs going to be your leader is his job at any trouble and do these attacks help or hurt the effort to get done all the things you aposre going to have to get done in september graham mitch mcconnell is not in any trouble in terms of his members we all like mitch we believe he aposs a good solid leader all of us are in trouble as republicans for promising for seven years we aposd repeal and replace obamacare and failing miserably i don apost mind the president being upset with us at the end of the day if we don apost deliver in repealing and replacing obamacare we aposre all going to be in trouble including the president i didn apost i don apost want to go from repeal and replace to prop up that aposs why i have a new idea to block grant all the money back to the states that we would spend on obamacare i hope the republican leadership will embrace it and help me get it on the floor in september if we move on and just ignore our failure on health care repealing and replacing obamacare we aposre going to fail miserably in 2018 and 2020 wallace i just want to ask you one last question about your health care plan which you said basically we would be federalizing giving the money to the states and letting them decide what they want to set up crosstalk graham yes wallace have you gotten any commitment from senate leadership that they will bring this to the floor in september when you come back rather than moving on to other subjects and how many cosponsors do you have graham well i think senator cassidy is my chief cosponsor i believe there aposs 50 votes for this i aposm hoping to have 25 republican governors come out the next couple of weeks for the block grant approach taking all the money and power out of washington and sending it back to the states by 2026 every state gets the same contribution from the federal government i think federalism is the right approach here lamar alexander is going to allow hearing on our bill if we can put it together there will be a tremendous amount of pressure on republican leadership to take this up i think mitch will but i want to stress again for seven years we aposve promise to repeal and replace we just can apost move on i think it would be a disaster to move on and the president is right to call us all out mitch mcconnell aposs job is not in jeopardy but the future of the republican party aposs in jeopardy wallace senator graham thank you thanks for sharing your sunday with us always good to talk with you sir graham thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in the sunday group to discuss the backlash president trump is facing following yesterday aposs tragic events in charlottesville commercial break wallace coming up president trump gets tough on north korea aposs kim jong un begin video clip trump if anything happens to guam there aposs going to be big big trouble in north korea end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel whether it aposs just rhetoric or a first step toward a military conflict commercial break wallace the moment when a car rammed into a crowd of counter protesters in charlottesville saturday killing at least one and injuring 19 and it aposs time now for our sunday group former speaker of the house newt gingrich marie harf state department spokesperson in the obama administration former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and tom rogan from the washington examiner congresswoman edwards let me start with you your thoughts about the rally in charlottesville yesterday the violence and the criticism that president trump is receiving for not calling out white nationalist specifically donna edwards former u s congresswoman d md well we start obviously the violence is not acceptable but what is more unacceptable is the fact that the president could not name this for what it was driven by white nationalist the kkk white supremacists and neo nazis and the fact that the president of the united states cannot say this out loud instead basically gives a green light to those who continue to perpetrate hate and violence in his name and they said it decidedly that it was done in his name in support of his efforts to quote make america great again i think it aposs unacceptable there were republican leaders across the board who spoke out and named this violence and he could not wallace and why do you think he didn apost edwards well i think he views those people as part of his base they stood out and said that they supported him and that they were doing this in his name and what an american president should do is stiff arm them and say i don apost care whether they say that they support me i don apost support them and what they stand for and this president of the united states failed to do that and he failed the american people wallace speaker gingrich newt gingrich former house speaker well first of all i do think the president should speak up more clearly and i suspect today or tomorrow he will i do think if you aposre if you aposre fair to him the statement itself was pretty strong and pretty direct about condemning the violence condemning bigotry i mean he talks very specifically about condemning racism but i agree i think that clearly he should talk out much more aggressively about it i aposd also point out though from a conservative perspective we aposve been watching a rising tide of violence in this country for good while now and you know when when the chancellor of the university of california berkeley is spending 9 000 for an escape door because they assume students will occupy his offense that just tells you that we have this pattern that aposs building and its building it aposs on both sides it aposs dangerous i aposm delighted attorney general sessions has sent a justice department team down there every person engaged in violence in charlottesville should be frankly locked up but the truth is the same on college campuses it aposs true ph across the country we have to decide violence is unacceptable even in free speech but you can apost have violence wallace i want to point out i aposm sure some people think that there aposs an overreaction to what president trump said or didn apost say i want to put up a tweet that ivanka trump the president aposs daughter put out this morning she says one there should be no place in society for racism white supremacy and neo nazis we must all come together as americans and be one country united charlottesville it aposs interesting a number of republicans i aposll include ivanka trump in that have have criticized the president for what he failed to say i want to put up some of those republican senator cory gardner tweeted mr president we must call evil by its name these were white supremacists this was domestic terrorism governor chris christie a staunch trump supporter wrote we rejected the racism and violence of white nationalists like the one acting out in charlottesville everyone in leadership must speak out when you hear those whether explicitly or not it aposs pretty clear they aposre saying the president didn apost do enough marie marie harf former state department spokesperson and senator graham was actually pretty explicit when you just spoke to him we need to hear the president say domestic terrorism and if you go back to ronald reagan or bob dole leaders of the party who explicitly condemned the kkk nazi affiliated groups bigoted groups when they tried to align themselves with the republican party this president hasn apost and i think he missed an opportunity to show leadership if he comes out three days later and calls it domestic terrorism that will not have the same impacts although i think it would be be helpful for him to do but i don apost want to get in a place in this country where we aposre equating violence on any side and basically saying it aposs the same thing as bigoted and racist speech because what i want to see happen even if there was no violence yesterday the president and his team should call out bigotry should call out hatred should call out these nazis and wallace well they did say that but then they said on many sides harf but by name but by name to call out these kkk affiliated groups and not do this false moral equivalence with the left or even some very extremist you know elements on the left there is no equivalence and that needs to be made clear wallace tom is this politics clearly these groups these hate groups are a very very small part of the of the millions of people who supported donald trump but they are a part of it the alt right has been supportive is this president unwilling to take them on tom rogan washington examiner i think to a degree that is true and i think there is the element of the liberal protest movement on college campuses that is perceived by conservatives as a problem the issue is though i think from the left it aposs this idea of silencing speakers they don apost like from the right this specific element that has to be identified as part of the right there is a problem with virulent hatred against people now i think there aposs a further point here the president is the commander in chief a role that he likes to play and is filling into but if you look at the tradition of the united states it was american service members whether in the air above germany or in the landing beaches at normandy who destroyed nazism they had never traveled outside small town america and they did that and so the president has to look at the patriotic notion of country against nazism and i think he for that reason as much as anything else he should have articulated why this ideology is protected by free speech but so despicable wallace i want to pick up on that with you the and marie mentioned the missed opportunities speaker because we remember in the apos92 campaign bill clinton and the sister souljah moment where he distanced himself from a violent rapper a black rapper and to a certain degree said i aposm not going to be and the democratic party is not going to be part of that in any way did this president miss an opportunity to say look i understand conservativism i understand conservative problems with liberals and some of the problems you aposve talked about on the left but there is no traffic there aposs not going to be any any relationship with that kind of speech and that kind of political belief gingrich yes he missed an opportunity and i think he in the next day or two will fill that out but let me also point out trump explicitly repudiated the kkk in the campaign i mean the elite ph media may not want to believe it go back and look at the videotape he explicitly repudiated it he explicitly repudiated david duke it is a falsehood to suggest the conservatism which believes in liberty has anything to do with nazism nazism is an anti rogan but but harf well then why doesn apost then why doesn apost the president come out and say that gingrich he should say it he should rogan right harf yes edwards and the fact is it took him days to repudiate david duke and now you aposre telling us that it aposs going to be a couple of days and he aposll come out and say we should gingrich i think edwards distance ourselves from the kkk gingrich well look ok edwards and white supremacists gingrich first first of all edwards this is not acceptable for a president of the united states gingrich first of all first of all in his inaugural he said all of us bleed the same blood he said there aposs no grounds for racism he said it is unpatriotic to be racism you cannot be a good american and be a racist that aposs the inaugural edwards and yesterday when racism was on the street he didn apost say it gingrich and then yesterday and yesterday he came out and he said he was against all all of the bigotry he was against racism if you read it he didn apost the one thing he didn apost say was i condemn white race supremacists harf he has weighted ph the two sides wallace oh ok harf which i think inaudible gingrich which i aposll be glad to i aposll debate you on that another time harf sounds good wallace well we can do it during the commercial they are usually pretty interesting here but we do have to take a break when we come back we aposve got to get to other big stories the panel aposs take on where we stand with north korea and president trump aposs surprise statement he aposs considering military options in venezuela commercial break begin video clip trump they aposve been doing this to our country for a long time for many years and it aposs about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries so if anything maybe that statement wasn apost tough enough end video clip wallace president trump refusing to back off his warning north korea will face fire and fury if it continues to threaten the u s and we aposre back now with the panel mr speaker you heard my conversation with cia director pompeo what do you make of the threat from north korea and is the president aposs very sharp rhetoric this week helping or hurting gingrich well i think the sharp rhetoric is trying to get through to kim jong un that we are deadly serious and i and general mattis secretary of defense mattis said this week we are militarily prepared if we have to move i mean those are fairly dramatic statements i worry a great deal about where we aposre at i we aposve had 23 years since clinton first announced that we had a deal ok and in 23 years the north korean model aposs been to nod yes and keep building nuclear weapons nod yes and keep building ballistic missiles and i i don apost think people yet even in the administration have fully appreciated how hard this is going to be i aposm in the process of doing a series of papers i did one yesterday at gingrich productions and fox news just looking at one nuclear event in one city because we i think we aposve gotten numb to how really bad this will be and i think that we have to take seriously that we can push him hard we pushed the japanese hard in 1941 they decided to go to war when we cut off their supply of petroleum their answer was pearl harbor and i think we need to understand yes maybe we can really squeeze him then he has two options cave or flight we have no proof today that he would necessarily cave and i think we have to see this as an extraordinarily dangerous moment in history and i would like to see a lot more intense effort on defensive preparations on our side to make sure that we minimize any chance of a single weapon reaching the united states wallace meaning anti ballistic missiles gingrich much more anti ballistic missiles much more civil difference preparation understanding this is one bomb in one city that would be the most horrendous event in american history and i think that wallace and you think we need to prepare for that gingrich yes sir absolutely one hundred percent wallace on that happy note congresswoman edwards i know a lot of democrats are upset with the president aposs rhetoric this week and challenging kim jong un sometimes in personal terms on the other hand as i aposve discussed earlier you aposve had three presidents two democrats one republican they aposve tried almost everything else enlisting regional neighbors they had six party talks sending secretary of state over to pyongyang the sanctions all kinds of things and we aposre closer to a nuclear armed icbm armed pyongyang than ever before so what aposs wrong with this edwards well i mean i aposve been very disturbed by the rhetoric as well but i do think that we aposre at a moment where we may begin to think in terms of containment and deterrence unlike we aposve thought before and i i have to tell you i mean giving a warning to guam to you know guamanians to you know go and run inside and hide is not an answer to a response for nuclear attack and you know it is clear that we haven apost changed our defensive posture in the region and on the peninsula but it aposs always at a high posture because of the nature of the threat from north korea and i think it aposs important for us to try to at least allow i mean the sanctions new sanctions haven apost even been in place for the better part of a week yet i think the response from china was a helpful one to send to the north koreans that they can apost expect help from the chinese when they act offensively but we aposre in a very dangerous moment wallace i want to i want to turn to another surprising moment and that was the president aposs comment this week i aposve i aposve discussed it with with cia director pompeo and with senator graham tom and that is the president volunteering raising out of the blue the idea of a military option dealing with the maduro regime in venezuela you heard pompeo say absolutely makes sense talks about castro talks about hezbollah other extremist groups there and you heard lindsey graham say it doesn apost make any sense at all rogan in policy terms it doesn apost make any sense at all i suspect what the president is doing there is that he asked in the national security briefings do we have a plan for venezuela and of course the plan at the j5 at the pentagon is yes we have a plan for everything we have a plan for probably bombing france but what i think also might be going on there is that a lot of the language on potential conflict whether it be venezuela or north korea is targeted at china china china china and i think with the president is trying to do behind the scenes is tell the chinese whether it be with the islands in the south and east china seas whether it be in terms of south korea and japan potentially developing nuclear programs that if you don apost deal with us on this the consequences for your regional environment and your inaudible of power are incredibly catastrophic and the advantage he has in making these threats is it aposs the perhaps the one good side of the tweets is the unpredictability is a force that compels the chinese to think maybe he aposs just serious and at any other level the united states does remain the world aposs superpower and that prospection of threat remains serious wallace marie as a former spokesperson for the state department under john kerry what are some of the military problems and the diplomatic problems with us getting involved with a military option as the president put it in venezuela harf well i think there aposs almost zero chance we will get involved militarily in venezuela it makes no sense and the department of defense actually this week had to come out and basically say that going to what tom said unpredictability can be a good tactic if underlying that there aposs a very clear strategy that the whole national security team has in place i aposm not sure they do when it comes to venezuela and i think the president aposs off the cuff remarks this week sort of belied that fact but on venezuela we could put more economic pressure on them we aposve avoided sanctioning oil in large part because doing so would probably drive our gas prices up here so there are more economic levers we could use but this kind of sort of bombastic rhetoric that everyone knows really isn apost based in a solid policy foundation doesn apost help a regional situation that quite frankly is engulfed in flames could have really serious impacts for regional security wallace i we aposve got less than a minute left speaker but if you believe that this was just off the cuff by the president that we aposre not seriously going to get involved in venezuela does that undercut his credibility when he aposs talking about a much more serious situation that we might get involved in like north korea gingrich well 44 nations in the western hemisphere have unanimously condemned maduro and i think there aposs a real sense of isolation my guess is if there aposs any meaning to this it is a signal in part of the venezuelan military that if you decide you want to take out maduro we aposre with you and i think that aposs our goal our goal is to have the venezuela military kick out the cubans kick out maduro and go back to a middle class democracy which they had prior to chavez wallace but i take it you you wouldn apost support u s troops gingrich i wouldn apost encourage u s troops going in unless they went in as part of an organization of american states unified effort such as we did in the dominican republic in apos65 wallace all right panel thank you see you next sunday up next our power player of the week a behind the scenes look at one of the hidden perks of the white house commercial break wallace in case you missed it yesterday was national bowling day which brings us to a white house gem that aposs been around since the 1940s as we told you in march the trump team is inviting members of congress to enjoy it and maybe pick up some support here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape jennifer korn white house office of public liaison deputy director welcome to the harry truman bowling alley come on in wallace thank you i can apost wait oh my gosh korn we are in the basement of the executive eisenhower office building wallace right korn and here is one of the pins that was signed by president nixon himself wallace voice over jennifer korn who aposs deputy director of the office of public liaison was our guide to the white house bowling alley korn this is president truman and he was the first president to bring bowling to the white house wallace on camera although he bowled in a suit which is korn he did very formal wallace i covered the white house for six years i never knew this facility existed korn it aposs a wonderful facility and we aposre really happy to have you here let aposs go bowl wallace voice over but before bowling jennifer told us about the alley aposs rich history korn president nixon was the most avid bowler of all presidents it is said that he took four hours at a time to bowl wallace on camera who can bowl for four hours straight korn i don apost know because i can apost but the president did he i guess that aposs the way he let off steam wallace voice over there aposs even video of nixon his high score 229 and some first ladies also hit the lanes wallace on camera here aposs lady bird herself i love it they had their own bowling bags korn they had their own bowling bags and also see that they are bowling in their dresses wallace voice over president trump hasn apost visited yet but his staff uses the alley often to make its pitch to members of congress and outside groups wallace on camera when you invite somebody to come bowl at the white house how many of them say no korn so far we haven apost had anybody say no wallace voice over but does it translate into political support korn i think it aposs less about the actual bowling and the personal touch the engagement wallace house democratic leader nancy pelosi is playing the grinch here calling the trump charm offensive offensive rep nancy pelosi d minority leader i think he aposs making fools of his own people quite frankly you don apost agree philosophically in what the legislation is let aposs go bowling at the white house korn that aposs a very simplistic way to look at it you can apost pass good legislation without having a great conversations wallace i couldn apost put it off any longer but i just want to say i haven apost bold in 15 years not bad but then i tried to pick up the spare wallace on camera oh that was terrible all right wallace voice over then it was jennifer aposs turn korn are you ready to talk about the afforda
