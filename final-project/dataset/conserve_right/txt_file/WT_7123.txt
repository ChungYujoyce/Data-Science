party committees governments and relevant departments at all levels must put people s lives and health first chinese president xi jinping said monday it is necessary to release epidemic information in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation under xi widely considered the country s most authoritarian leader in decades china has adopted a more proactive public relations strategy showing an ever greater determination to control the narrative by putting out large quantities of its own information as opposed to trying to make an explosive issue disappear the outbreak which has sickened more than 500 people and killed at least 17 is a major test of xi s leadership as he seeks to grapple with challenges such as china s slowing economy its trade war with the u s anti government protests in hong kong and taiwan s defiance said joseph cheng a political scholar in hong kong this could help him save face cheng said he knows the consequences to his leadership to his reputation if he fails on this front xi s comments monday were his first public ones on the outbreak and they seemed aimed at reassuring the chinese public that there wasn t another sars level cover up in the making for months in 2002 and 2003 even after sars had spread around the world china sought to conceal the number of actual cases by parking patients in hotels and obscure hospital wings and even driving them around in ambulances to avoid detection by world health organization experts china in that era was just beginning to embrace the internet and smartphones were years away beijing had yet to stage the 2008 summer olympics and the country was just at the start of an economic boom that has since made its economy the second largest in the world at the time people who revealed information about sars that the government hadn t publicized could be accused of leaking state secrets media outlets were muzzled leaving the public in the dark it was only after a retired high ranking physician spoke out that the true measure of authorities concealment became known in many ways china is a different country now more prosperous and equipped with far more advanced resources and infrastructure though the communist party remains largely opaque and intolerant of any dissent social media has made it much harder to contain news of accidents outbreaks or other non political events david heymann a doctor who headed who s global response to sars in 2003 said chinese authorities have become much more transparent since that outbreak and it appears the government began reporting cases of the new virus as soon as they were identified i think it s working pretty well compared to what happened initially in sars heymann said with the discovery late last year of the new type of coronavirus the same family of viruses that encompasses sars state agencies sprang into action with frequent public statements tv appearances by government experts and colorful graphics urging citizens to wash their hands and wear masks i m not very panicked said zhang wei a 27 year old office clerk in wuhan who went to a pharmacy to buy masks wednesday afternoon i think the government is quite organized and has attached great importance to the virus zhang said as long as we do as we re told in terms of protecting ourselves there shouldn t be a big problem following initial reports of people becoming ill with an unrecognized type of pneumonia authorities in wuhan swiftly announced they were investigating a seafood market frequented by many in the first wave of patients chinese scientists rapidly identified the virus as a novel coronavirus an action that who called a notable achievement once the chinese leadership is on the alert and would like to engage in a national campaign to stop it then the party apparatus is mobilized highly effectively cheng said at a wednesday news briefing a reporter asked a national health commission official whether the government was hiding any information the official xu shuqiang responded that they have been releasing up to date numbers from the start and will continue to do so until there is no more need for it that hasn t stopped chinese observers from expressing some skepticism about the official data when the state numbers last week were still below 100 despite cases popping up overseas users on the twitter like weibo platform quipped that china
