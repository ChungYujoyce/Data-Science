r persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump said wednesday that the official who blew the whistle on his interactions with ukraine is politically conflicted and should be exposed and questioned properly taking his three year fight against the so called deep state to a new level he ratcheted up his calls to unmask the anonymous whistleblower after it was revealed that he had a professional relationship with one of mr trump s potential 2020 democratic rivals the whistleblower was in cahoots with schiff said mr trump referring rep adam b schiff california democrat and chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence then it turns out that whistleblower is a democrat a strong democrat and is working with one of my opponents as a democrat that i might end up running against the whole thing is a scam it s a fix see also trump tells congress he won t cooperate with impeachment probe mr trump also said the whistleblower s leanings pose a potential conflict of interest he or she should be exposed and questioned properly he tweeted one of the whistleblower s attorneys mark s zaid responded wednesday evening by saying his client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials not candidates and never worked for or advised a political candidate campaign or party mr trump slammed the unidentified official three days after 90 former national security officials signed an open letter lauding the whistleblower for calling out mr trump s request for ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to investigate a democratic rival former vice president joseph r biden and his son hunter who had business ties in ukraine mr biden called wednesday for the president to be impeached he said mr trump is shooting holes in the constitution and we cannot let him get away with it the president says he has the right to confront his accuser while insinuating that aides who fed information to the whistleblower are double agents we could have a spy mr trump said i don t want to have spies when i m negotiating with china and syria and all of the countries vice president mike pence said mr trump s request for ukraine to investigate mr biden was in no way connected to the president withholding military aid to the country as far as he knew pressed by reporters in iowa whether he was aware that the military aid was tied to a probe of mr biden mr pence responded that s your question let me be very clear the issue of aid and our efforts with regard to ukraine were from my experience no way connected to the very legitimate concern the american people have about corruption that took place about things that happened in the 2016 election the episode is shining a bright light on a debate that has raged since mr trump swept into the white house are pockets of the nation s national security and intelligence apparatus intent on undermining an unconventional administration or is mr trump unfairly discrediting officials who call it like they see it and are alarmed by what they see donald trump has shown himself to be incompetent at times on foreign policy and the people who see that most clearly work in the foreign policy and intelligence communities they know it and don t like it and when they speak out about it he calls them the deep state one former high level intelligence official said i don t think there is any deep state it s a convenient way for the president s supporters to torpedo any legitimate criticism of him mr trump and his allies insist the deep state is real and kicking into overdrive as the ukraine scandal threatens to envelop the white house this is looking more more like a deep state scheme house minority whip steve scalise louisiana republican tweeted this month he accused mr schiff of plotting with the whistleblower mr trump says it s not just government he recently suggested big pharma might be gunning for him too we re lowering the cost of prescription drugs taking on the pharmaceutical companies and you think that s easy it s not easy mr trump told seniors in the villages florida last week they come at you from all different sides i wouldn t be surprised if the hoax didn t come a little bit from some of the people that we re taking on mr trump s suspicions are rooted in questions about his 2016 election victory mr trump is disgusted by the idea that his upset win was abetted by russia he said his unique brand of campaigning and populist message led to one of the most stunning political victories of all time for the last three years democrat lawmakers their deep state cronies the fake news media they ve been colluding in their effort to overturn the presidential election 63 million people voted and to nullify the votes of the american people mr trump told young black conservatives at the white house this month mr trump accused intelligence agencies in january 2017 of adopting tactics from nazi germany and about a week later boasted about himself in front of a wall honoring fallen central intelligence agency officers at langley virginia at a low point during a mid 2018 press conference in finland mr trump seemed to accept russian president vladimir putin s denial about 2016 election meddling over the u s intelligence community s conclusions although those moments are memorable some say the disconnect between mr trump and the intelligence community is philosophical what they re disagreeing on is the process republican strategist ford o connell said he is changing the way that we look at things and to them that s kind of a problem because they like the idea of we re going to see this in a certain way the whistleblower episode illustrates the divide the complaint cried foul over entreaties that mr trump s personal attorney rudolph w giuliani made to ukrainian officials and flagged mr trump s call with mr zelensky the document said the president used the phone call to advance his personal interests and that white house officials were deeply disturbed by what transpired michael atkinson the inspector general for the intelligence community deemed the complaint urgent and credible mr trump insists his tactics on the call were perfect and that the ukrainian probe amounts to hoax 2 0 after special counsel robert mueller s investigation found no criminal conspiracy between his campaign and russia mr trump riffed on his victimization repeatedly as he signed an unrelated pair of executive orders wednesday to alleviate regulatory burdens on small businesses and families no american should ever face such persecution from their own government he said at the white house except perhaps your president the justice department has tasked u s attorney john durham with exploring the origins of the russia probe a mission that white house allies refer to as investigating the investigators the president s latest fixation however is on mr atkinson and the whistleblower the whistleblower has ties to one of my democrat opponents why does the icig allow this scam to continue mr trump tweeted sen tom cotton arkansas republican accused mr atkinson on wednesday of playing it coy in sept 26 testimony to the senate select committee on intelligence you moralized about how you were duty bound not to share even a hint of this political bias with us he said but now i see media reports that you revealed to the house intelligence committee not only that the complainant is a registered democrat but also that he has a professional relationship with a democratic presidential campaign former u s national security officials said in their letter sunday that mr trump and his allies must leave the whistleblower alone while the identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known we do know that he or she is an employee of the u s government they wrote as such he or she has by law the right and indeed the responsibility to make known through appropriate channels indications of serious wrongdoing guy taylor and dave boye
