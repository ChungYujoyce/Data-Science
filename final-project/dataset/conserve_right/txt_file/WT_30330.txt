tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn rudolph w giuliani has become a prime culprit for democrats seeking president trump s impeachment but mr giuliani said thursday he is the hero of the ukraine story it is impossible that the whistleblower is a hero and i m not mr giuliani told the atlantic and i will be the hero these morons when this is over i will be the hero mr trump s use of mr giuliani his personal attorney for investigations in ukraine has infuriated democrats pushing for impeachment a house hearing thursday highlighted how much mr trump relies on the former federal prosecutor to find answers in murky places top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director rep adam b schiff california democrat and chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence said after the hearing that he intends to investigate mr giuliani s position as a quasi official emissary to ukraine the hearing examined a whistleblower s complaint saying mr trump pressured ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to investigate democratic presidential front runner joseph r biden and son hunter we want to know what role rudy giuliani had in all of this mr schiff said sen christopher coons delaware democrat and a member of the senate foreign relations committee said mr giuliani should be held to account for his role in this it will be interesting to hear how he tries to explain the way in which he served as an individual mediary here mr coons told reporters mr giuliani a former new york mayor said of his role you should be happy for your country that i uncovered this for months mr giuliani has been working at the president s direction to explore the origins of the fbi s crossfire hurricane investigation of the trump campaign in 2016 that probe led to a nearly three year long investigation by special counsel robert mueller who found no collusion between the campaign and russia mr giuliani also has been digging for dirt on mr biden and his son who received 3 million from a ukrainian natural gas company while mr biden served as the obama administration s top liaison with ukraine he has promised more to come on mr biden in the july 25 phone call at the heart of the whistleblower s complaint mr trump urged mr zelensky to cooperate with mr giuliani in his efforts democrats say mr trump withheld 391 million in military aid to ukraine as leverage to secure an investigation of the bidens a charge the president denies democrats say mr giuliani s involvement is inappropriate and that it is counterproductive for the president s personal attorney to conduct foreign affairs as a freelancer they also accuse the president and mr giuliani of seeking foreign help in a u s election but lawyer john dowd who represented the president during the mueller investigation is rooting for mr giuliani i m glad rudy s doing it mr dowd told the washington times everything that s gone on with the russia probe is an incredible fraud and a hoax and he s going to get to the bottom of why it happened mr giuliani s performances on tv defending the president range from combative to cringeworthy but mr dowd said he is a fearsome lawyer he s one of the finest prosecutors ever he said the guy knows what he s doing he defends the president and part of the defense is finding out how this all happened mr dowd said of mr trump s actions in ukraine he s not the first president to use private counsel private offices are sometimes more effective than the bureaucracy the president didn t lose his ability to defend himself or his constitutional rights because he occupies the oval office rudy s been very open about it with the media he s made no bones about it during meetings at the united nations this week the president said mr giuliani s work is very important you had a russian witch hunt that turned out to be 2 years of phony nonsense mr trump said rudy has got every right to go and find out where that started and other people are looking at that too where did it start it was out of thin air and i think he s got a very strong right to do it rudy giuliani is a great lawyer he knows exactly what he s doing there are few talents the president appreciates more than the ability to defend him well on tv i ve watched the passion that he s had on television over the last few days mr trump said i think it s incredible the way he s done the justice department confirmed wednesday that u s attorney john durham is investigating ukraine s role in potential 2016 election interference while a transcript of mr trump s phone call released the same day showed that he sought the ukrainian president s help in a probe of a missing democratic email server attorney general william p barr tapped mr durham this year to look into the origins of the fbi s russia probe some republicans also have qualms about mr giuliani s role as the president s overseas troubleshooter this is not how the greatest country on the earth should operate the president s lawyer going behind the scenes behind the state department s back and operating foreign policy on a parallel track brendan buck a spokesman for paul d ryan when the wisconsin republican was house speaker said on fox news but a republican close to the white house said it s typical of how mr trump likes to conduct business with people he knows and trusts to get things done trump directs his own stuff the republican said i don t see a problem with trump relying on rudy his mo is pretty much what s the best way to get this done it s not that he s trying to short circuit things he just doesn t understand objections to using a private lawyer and he s been ill served by the fact that a lot of republicans with government experience just don t want to work for him democrats at thursday s hearing on the whistleblower s allegations asked acting director of national intelligence joseph maguire whether mr giuliani has a security clearance mr maguire said he didn t know and about his role in foreign affairs my only knowledge of what mr giuliani does i get from tv news media mr maguire said i am not aware of what he does for the president mr schiff asked whether mr giuliani s work is improper i believe that mr giuliani is the president s personal lawyer and whatever conversation that the president has with his personal lawyer i would imagine would be client attorney privilege mr maguire said i m in no position to criticize the president of the united states on how he wants to conduct that and i have no knowing of what mr giuliani does or does not do mr giuliani called the accusations of interfering in foreign affairs total nonsense he told cnn that he has a nice little trail of text message conversations with the top u s diplomat to ukraine kurt volker to show he is working with the knowledge of the state department he also said he has received thank you messages i don t think they d thank me if i was interfering in foreign relations mr giuliani said i told them everything that i did there s nothin
