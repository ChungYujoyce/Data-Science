and economic policies in unusually candid remarks top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 adm mullen in response defended the exercises as small in scale and not related to growing tensions between china and regional states over the resource rich south china sea where china taiwan vietnam the philippines malaysia and brunei all have overlapping territorial claims u s forces last week conducted joint naval exercises in the strategically vital waters with japan and australia and last month held similar drills nearby with the philippines navy u s naval forces also are scheduled to visit vietnam at the end of this week for joint activities that officials from both countries have sought to avoid calling a military exercise the timing of these joint exercises is inappropriate as we see it gen chen said if the united states truly wants peace and stability in the region it should adjust the schedule of its military drills since may vietnam has twice accused chinese vessels of harassing its oil and gas survey ships in one case cutting cables used by one of the ships in turn china charged that one of its fishing boats was chased by armed vietnamese ships last month philippine president benigno aquino recently accused china of inciting at least seven incidents with its ships in contested waters including one involving a chinese vessel that reportedly opened fire on filipino fishermen

visit to the united states by the dalai lama the tibetan spiritual leader whom the chinese accuse of promoting independence for tibet the general also complained about the attitudes of some unnamed u s political leaders toward china and he said reconnaissance by u s aircraft and ships off the chinese coast was raising tensions the united states should be more modest and prudent in words and deeds gen chen said earlier adm mullen told reporters that he is concerned that ongoing incidents and growing tensions in the south china sea will trigger a miscalculation and an outbreak that no one anticipated and we should seek to avoid that under all circumstances adm mullen appeared to play down the general s comments stating on twitter that he held good discussions in beijing and noting that the u s and china will not agree on everything but now is the time to focus on those things that we can agree on in a speech to a renmin university on sunday adm mullen said the united states is a pacific power and would remain so while acknowledging china s emergence as a new global power contrary to gen chen s statement that the two sides found a lot of common ground during the talks the comments underline obstacles to what adm mullen said was a key objective during his four day visit improving military to military relations between the two superpowers in a news release issued after
