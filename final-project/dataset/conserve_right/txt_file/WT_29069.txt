tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn for republicans the 2020 presidential election is shaping up to be an all hands on deck event with one clear implication every gop vote counts a vote is a vote whether it comes from a fierce maga loyalist a wavering wanderer or someone driven by uneasiness with democratic socialists doesn t matter get that vote and now comes an eloquent call to arms aimed at a very specific demographic never trumpers who have rejected president trump for myriad reasons come back never trumpers all is forgiven writes frank miele a columnist for realclearpolitics top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey n y gov andrew cuomo s careless cruelty shows in coronavirus nursing home policy there are hundreds of thousands of erstwhile republicans who are on the outside looking in shivering in exile in a self imposed gulag of superiority who may just be ready to do a searching and fearless moral inventory of their fears and resentments about donald trump and admit that they were wrong sincere but wrong he says you surely know by now that you were dead wrong about him this is a president for the times we live in mr miele continues now think of the war against the fake news media without donald trump to fight it think of the supreme court without trump s conservative appointments to balance it think of the economy without the trump administration s tax cuts or its war on restrictive regulations think of the wasted billions of dollars if trump had not pulled the united states out of the idiotic paris climate accords think of the porous border without at least the promise of a wall think of the fbi still being run by corrupt james comey and andrew mccabe he says the columnist has a message for never trumpers and a warning that the presidential election is devolving into trench warfare with foes who play without rules the only person on the national stage who seems to consistently understand that is president donald trump but he can t do it alone he needs you and that means he needs you to stop being a never trumper and start being a republican again mr miele advises this is your destiny this is your calling this is your chance to make a difference if any democrat is elected president instead of donald trump there will be hell to pay not just for you but for the country you love he cautions the end is not necessarily near media coverage of the recent and

briefing some journalists are still squawking about the lack of a daily press briefing at the white house implying that its absence signifies a lack of transparency by president trump and his administration after countless melodramatic rude or inane incidents by reporters mr trump ended the briefings in march to be honest the briefings had become a lot of theater and i think that a lot of reporters were doing it to get famous they re writing books now i mean they re all getting famous off of this presidency white house press secretary stephanie grisham tells fox news i think it s great what we re doing now i think that it s so important that the spokesperson for the president can adequately speak to his policies and get his message out there i think the president saw that it was not what was happening it had become again theater and the press was not being good to his people and he doesn t like that he s very loyal to his people and he put a stop to it she told the network it s
