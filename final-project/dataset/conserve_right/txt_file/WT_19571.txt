statements about what cohen knew and when but davis need to correct previous claims has only been topped by that of rudy giuliani the trump lawyer whose job description at times has seemed to be

made more than 9 000 false or misleading statements since taking office so in a production filled with unreliable narrators who if anyone can be trusted my take is that it s all a mess and i don t know if we re ever going to know what really happened says former house speaker newt gingrich a trump ally who acknowledged that the battle over pardons has left him baffled it seems now that we live in an age of total confusion the latest act in the shakespearean tragedy farce over cohen s fall from grace in trumpworld came to light in the past week over a fierce debate as to whether the attorney had sought a pardon from the president after his office and hotel room were raided by the fbi last spring cohen who spent a decade working for trump before turning on him and cooperating with the special counsel investigating the president testified before congress last week that he had never sought a pardon from his former boss but in the days that followed stories changed davis who was not cohen s lawyer at the time said cohen directed his attorney to explore a possible pardon with giuliani and others on trump s legal team a statement that appeared to contradict cohen s sworn congressional testimony then giuliani said that two lawyers working for cohen approached him about a pardon last spring and davis then allowed in a written statement thursday that his client was open to the ongoing dangling of a possible pardon by trump representatives privately and in the media in the months after the fbi raid trump took it one step further on friday bad lawyer and fraudster michael cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a pardon his lawyers totally contradicted him he lied trump tweeted aboard air force one while en route to inspect damage from a deadly

trump giuliani again he said in an interview friday that he remembered trump telling him when he joined the president s legal team eleven months ago that cohen had asked for a pardon something the former new york city mayor had never previously revealed including in an interview about pardons the previous day this furor is far from the first time the players in this particular melodrama have to put it charitably arranged and rearranged their scripts long before he entered politics trump embellished his record posing as his own spokesman to plant flattering stories in new york gossip pages and declaring that the 58 story trump tower was actually 68 stories so it would be the tallest in that section of midtown manhattan that track record continued during his campaign and as president he trotted out big falsehoods claiming that barack obama was not born in the united states and later that he wiretapped trump tower and smaller ones including when boasted that the crowd for his inauguration was the largest in history his administration has had more than 9 000 misleading statements according to the washington post fake news according to the president cohen has become a key
