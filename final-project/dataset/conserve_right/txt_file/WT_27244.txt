tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn iowa city iowa ap grant ferguson was getting ready for work when a sheriff s deputy arrived at his iowa home with an arrest warrant to take him to jail the sales manager was stunned when he learned the reason his unsuccessful attempt to vote in the 2016 election the supporter of president donald trump would ultimately face 5 000 in legal costs to resolve the charges which stemmed from a bureaucratic error that unknowingly kept him on iowa s list of ineligible felon voters those caught trying to cast ballots in violation of iowa s ban

hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey the review comes as republican gov kim reynolds is pushing to eliminate iowa s lifetime voting ban for felons and restore rights once a sentence is served an iowa house committee advanced her proposal wednesday along with kentucky and virginia iowa is one of only three states with such a policy after florida voters last fall agreed to restore voting rights to ex felons a clinton man who is disabled from a brain injury was prosecuted after he mistakenly believed poll workers would alert him if there was a problem with his voting eligibility a low income muscatine man who cast a provisional ballot after disputing that he was ineligible still owes 2 300 in court costs the mayor of tiny moorhead was forced to resign and prosecuted for illegally voting after a judge revoked his deferred judgment in a drug case prosecutors pursued cases even when ex offenders such as ferguson believed they were

integrity of our electoral process said clinton county attorney mike wolf who prosecuted hook he said he shows restraint in deciding whom to charge because the consequences are huge under a policy implemented by democratic governors from 2005 to 2011 ex felons were supposed to get their rights back when they were discharged from prison or probation that order was rescinded by gov terry branstad who reinstated a process requiring them to apply to the governor before their rights could be restored reynolds has kept the application which is completed by few ex felons many are unsure whether
