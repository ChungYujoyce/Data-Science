evidence top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time however these boilerplate denials have caused strong reactions from all sides of the political spectrum in china the global times newspaper a subsidiary of the communist party of china central committee s mouthpiece the people s daily echoed official denials the newspaper called the american accusations lies and fabrications but also criticized beijing s official denials as being too officious lacking specifics and caused by china s habitual excessive politeness to the americans china should stop being nice and humble we should instead pierce wide open the thin veneer of pretentious mutual harmony with the american side and directly confront the united states the anti american global times said in an editorial thursday however waves of criticism from china s internet community emerged on many leading websites ridiculing china s official denials and hawkish rhetoric on the cyberattacks no denial means the accusations are false once the government denies the accusations are true an internet user with the surname ye commented on the popular sina com website a newspaper that makes up stories on a daily basis is now displaying righteous outrage another wrote on the phoenix website chastising the global times naval drill in pacific a three warship flotilla of the chinese people s liberation army navy s northern fleet based in qingdao held an 18 day drill in the western pacific that ended feb 15 the maneuvers were provocative because they were conducted close to the areas controlled by japan taiwan and u s troops based in okinawa billed by china s state run media as a high intensity and saturation drill during the holiday season of the traditional chinese new year the naval exercise was led by vice adm tian zhong commander of the chinese northern fleet the flotilla sailed by the narrow japanese strait of miyako which connects japan s miyako island and okinawa triggering intense japanese maritime monitoring of the chinese vessels the drills began jan 19 when the flotilla first sailed directly to the south china sea to greet pla soldiers stationed on the disputed spratly islands the warship column then sailed northward toward the east china sea near taiwanese and japanese territorial waters the exercise included anti submarine warfare tactics joint helicopter and ship operations and high seas armed pursuit as well as a series of patriotic propaganda activities that were covered extensively by an onboard chinese state run television crew a key feature of this drill marked the first time pla warships conducted long distance operations without supply ships sailing behind state media hailed the action as a key accomplishment that testifies to a navy s ability to obtain provisions fuel and ammunition from overseas land based supply depots japan won t release radar data a central point of contention between china and japan over the past few weeks has involved a dispute over whether a chinese naval ship aimed its fire control radar on japanese military units as japan s government has said japan accused china of recklessly locking the ship based fire control radar on a japanese military helicopter on jan 19 and on a japanese destroyer on jan 30 pushing japan ever closer to taking military action and possibly triggering a major conflict between the world s second and third largest economies after days of silence the chinese government denied the allegation and dared the japanese to provide evidence of the chinese action that in naval terms is considered a hostile act the japanese government initially said it would release the sensitive military radar data as proof but defense analysts think the chinese wanted to know how the japanese defense system obtained the radar detection data a senior japanese defense official was quoted by the japan times as saying that providing the data to china would have great risk in terms of defense as it would mean that chinese
