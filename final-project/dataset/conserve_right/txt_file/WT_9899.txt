offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the united states does not take a position on competing territorial claims but we believe the nations of the region should work collaboratively to resolve disputes without coercion without intimidation and certainly without the use of force she said that is why we encourage asean and china to make meaningful progress toward finalizing a comprehensive code of conduct in order to establish rules of the road and clear procedures for peacefully addressing disagreements indonesia has played a leading role in putting the six point plan together after asean was unable to reach a consensus on the matter in july mrs clinton said the u s is encouraged by the plan but wants it acted on particularly implementation and enforcement of the code of conduct which has languished since a preliminary framework for it was first agreed in 2002 mrs clinton said the u s wants to see the disputes resolved between china and asean it said the alliance has collective clout that its 10 members do not have individually she added that the u s sees it as important for asean and china to have something to show for their efforts by a november summit of east asian leaders that president obama plans to attend in cambodia it is time for diplomacy she said we have the east asia summit coming up this should be the goal that diplomacy pursues to try to attain agreement on a robust code of conduct to begin and begin to try to literally calm the waters and enable people to work together toward better outcomes i think we can make progress before the east asia summit and it is certainly in everyone s interest that we do so mr natalegawa agreed with mrs clinton on the importance of the code of conduct and the need to set it up quickly we must try to have the code of conduct he said absent a code of conduct absent the diplomatic process we can be certain of more incidents and tension for our region absent an asean unity the question will become like a loose cannon in the way the

china sea the u s position has riled china which has become increasingly assertive in pressing its territorial claims with its smaller neighbors and wants the disputes to be resolved individually with each country giving it greater leverage than dealing with a bloc in july china angered the united states as well as vietnam and the philippines by creating a city and military garrison on a remote island 220 miles from its southernmost province intended to administer hundreds of thousands of square miles of water where china wants to strengthen its control over disputed islands china which also
