republican frontrunner donald trump addressed the american israel public affairs committee on the second day of their annual conference in washington d c at a packed verizon center trump addressed the attendees the donald opened by saying that he was a lifelong supporter and friend of israel noting that he allowed then mayor of new york city rudy giuliani to fly on his airplane to israel during his visit to show solidarity with other terror victims in spring 2004 at the height of violence in the gaza strip i was the grand marshal of the 40th salute to israel parade the largest single gathering in support of the jewish state he said yet what appeared as a typical trump speech which is usually dotted by insults against his primary opponents and the press in prolonged ramblings about various subjects quickly turned into something slightly more presidential this was the billionaire magnate first attempt at delivering a written speech he said that he didn t come here to pander about israel like typical politicians who are all talk no action he discussed the future of american relations with israel which would begin with the dismantling of the disastrous iran deal i ve studied this issue in greater detail than almost anybody declared trump it s a bad deal that also gives 150 billion in unfrozen assets to iran while we get nothing in return trump added that the iran deal places u s in a horrific national security situation along with israel trump then discussed at length the islamic republic s penchant for aiding and funding global terror they ve sent sophisticated weapons to hezbollah in lebanon which was created by the iranian revolutionary guard corps when israel invaded the country in 1982 the donald added that hezbollah threatens israel s northern border yet they ve also aided or bankrolled terror attacks in25 different countries on five continents which is why a trump administration would work to dismantle their reach in spreading global terror healso pledged to hold iran accountable to the restrictions in the deal by restructuring them for starters he would tackle what he sees as a glaring misstep in oversight involving ballistic missile tests which isn t a violation of the current agreement thoughit does violatevarious united nations security council resolutions those missiles if left ignored could eventually reach the shores of the united states which is unacceptable they re also meant to intimidate europe and israel a trump white house won t tolerate this ongoing activity he made that explicitly clear realdonaldtrump says potus may be the worst thing to ever happen to israel aipac2016 pic twitter com hdvqkbrlrn the donald then attacked the utter weakness and incompetence of the united nations where he vowed as president that he would veto any resolutions that he felt would endanger the jewish state he also said that the un isn t a friend of freedom democracy the u s and certainly not an ally of israel he later added that president obama may be the worst thing to ever happen to israel he also mentioned how the president s push for a solution between israel and palestine is a horrible deal deals are made when parties come to the table and negotiate each side must give up something it values in exchange for something it requires a deal that imposes conditions on israel and the palestinian authority will do nothing to bring peace it will only further delegitimize israel and it would reward palestinian terrorism because every day they are stabbing israelis and even americans just last week american taylor allen force a west point grad who served in iraq and afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knife wielding palestinian you don t reward that behavior you confront it it s not up the united nations to impose a solution the parties must negotiate a resolution themselves the united states can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations but no one should be telling israel it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don t even really know what s happening trump added that there is no moral equivalency between israel and palestine because the former doesn t name public squares after terrorists they don t pay children to stab innocent people palestinians must end their culture of hatred against israelis another aspect of trump s speech was the plug for his book the art of the deal which he proudly claimed is one of the all time best selling books on the subject nevertheless he also highlighted the palestinians serial rejection of the peace process and that the day he becomes president will be the day israel stops being treated like a second class citizen he added that hillary clinton is a total disaster and that she and president obama have treated israel very very badly if elected a trump presidency would move the u s embassy in tel aviv to jerusalem the speech was more measured though it did contain the real estate moguls usual trademarks and phrases at several points in his address he received standing ovations this speech was seen as a rather important address for the businessman who would be speaking to a sophisticated crowd on middle east policy some of whom have thus far been eitherunimpressed with his grasp of foreign policy issues or looking for that in depth look atpolicy that s so visibly lacking this cycle moreover there was probably and after this speech still lingering skepticism about the billionaire s position on the israeli palestinian conflict since trump has said that he would take a neutral position on the matter tonight
