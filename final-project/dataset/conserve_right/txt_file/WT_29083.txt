congress and the back to back briefings show the wariness among democrats and some republicans over the white house s sudden policy shifts in the middle east trump veering between bombast and

activated we must deliver an overwhelming military response but democratic rep ruben gallego of arizona an iraq war veteran tweeted that after having received the same intelligence briefing that was
