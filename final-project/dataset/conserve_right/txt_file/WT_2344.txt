apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic house democrats announced wednesday that they will hold the first public hearings in their impeachment inquiry of president trump next week as they released the testimony of a key former ambassador who says the white house tied u s military aid to ukraine s promise to investigate democratic presidential front runner joseph r biden after questioning witnesses behind closed doors at the capitol for five weeks rep adam b schiff said public testimony will begin nov 13 with appearances by two top state department officials william taylor and george kent i think you will see throughout the course of the testimony the most important facts are largely not contested mr schiff california democrat and chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence told reporters top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender house democrats released a transcript of mr taylor s closed door testimony wednesday the fourth time they have released testimony since voting last week to move forward with a public impeachment probe mr taylor the top u s diplomat in ukraine has told impeachment investigators it was his understanding that the administration would withhold u s military aid until the ukrainian president agreed to investigations of political rivals sought by mr trump that was my clear understanding security assistance money would not come until ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky committed to pursue the investigation mr taylor told lawmakers he said he believed the requests for ukraine to investigate mr biden and possible interference in the 2016 u s presidential election came from rudolph w giuliani the president s personal attorney and a central figure in the ukraine furor but mr taylor acknowledged in his testimony last month that he didn t hear the july 25 phone call between mr trump and the ukrainian president he didn t see a transcript of the call until it was released in late september and he had never spoken with mr trump or mr giuliani has anyone ever asked you to speak to mr giuliani he was asked no mr taylor said have you spoken to the president of the united states a lawmaker asked him i have not he said you had no communications with the president of the united states correct mr taylor said another envoy to ukraine kurt volker testified that there was no linkage between the military aid and the investigations the white house again criticized the impeachment inquiry for relying on witnesses with secondhand information a monmouth university poll released wednesday showed 73 of the public has little or no confidence in the process the hearings should have been public from the beginning white house senior counselor kellyanne conway told reporters they can t cure a bad process and i think that s why no republican voted with the democrats and frankly two democrats voted with the republicans because the process has been ill conceived from the beginning you cannot unscramble that egg you cannot put the toothpaste back in the tube legal strategist mike davis whose name has been floated as a possible white house counsel for the impeachment proceedings said the public hearings would at least give mr trump s defenders an opportunity to put on display the bias of the house democrats effort what the house republicans need to message is this is an impeachment mob in search of a high crime and misdemeanor said mr davis a former chief counsel for the senate judiciary committee who led the effort to confirm supreme court justice brett m kavanaugh the overall messaging needs to be this is our president whether the swamp creatures like it or not and if you don t like our president vote him out of office impeachment overturns the will of the american people and should not be done lightly he said mr trump s allies have also called on jeff roe founder and ceo of political consultancy axiom strategies to get involved in the impeachment fight as a white house strategist mr roe managed the 2016 presidential campaign of sen ted cruz texas republican he was mum on the calls for him to get directly involved but had a harsh critique of the inquiry adam schiff s sham salem witch trial would make samuel parrish blush said mr roe referring to the puritan minister who prosecuted his own daughter and niece in the infamous witch trial the democrats verdict is already in they are now just orchestrating a show trial for the public after a highly secretive inquisition unlike other transcripts of witnesses testimony that have been released so far some of the beginning of mr taylor s transcript has been redacted the transcript also sheds light on the volatile proceedings behind the inquiry s closed doors in once terse exchange rep chip roy texas republican clashed with the committee s democratic leaders about republicans being shut out of the process the democrats running the hearing cut him off by declaring him out of order this whole hearing is out of order mr roy shot back rep lee m zeldin new york republican hammered mr taylor during questioning for giving hearsay testimony about an alleged quid pro quo this isn t firsthand it s not secondhand it s not thirdhand mr zeldin said but if i understand this correctly you re telling us that former presidential adviser tim morrison told you that european union ambassador gordon sondland told him that the president told ambassador sondland that zelensky would have to open an investigation into biden that s correct mr taylor said mr taylor told the inquiry that at the time of the july phone call between mr trump and mr zelensky the ukrainians were not aware that u s military aid had been put on hold it was only later that he learned there could be a connection between the aid and the request for investigations which he described as a stalemate holding up the money mr taylor said he connected the dots to figure out what was going on in early september after the delayed aid was made public in a politico article mr taylor said he still didn t know why it happened when asked by ukrainian officials i m a representative of the united states government out there and he asked me a perfectly legitimate question why are you holding up this assistance and i couldn t tell him mr taylor said mr taylor s transcript described in detail what he understood to be two channels of foreign policy an official one he operated that focused on institution building and an irregular channel led by mr giuliani that focused specifically on the 2016 election and the biden family s connection to ukraine when mr taylor testified last month democrats billed his meticulous timeline as one of the most disturbing accounts they had heard mr taylor became one of the house democrats most anticipated witnesses after text messages between him and mr volker showed that mr taylor was concerned about a trump quid pro quo the impeachment inquiry is centered on accusations that mr trump tried to pressure mr zelensky into opening investigations into mr biden s influence in ukraine where his son hunter held a lucrative post with an energy company and into alleged 2016 election interference the president is accused of holding up nearly 400 million in military aid mr taylor told lawmakers he was aware by mid july that mr trump and mr zelensky would not meet unless the ukrainians cooperated with the investigations about the same time the office of management and budget announced that military aid to ukraine would be delayed that decision came through mr trump s acting chief of staff mick mulvaney mr taylor said by early september mr taylor learned from mr sondland that military aid was also contingent on cooperation with the investigations and that the president wanted mr zelensky to clear things up in a cnn interview mr taylor said national security council officials fiona hill and alexander vindman told him that then national security advisor john r bolton stormed out of a meeting with ukrainian officials after mr sondland mentioned the investigations john bolton understood what the reference was and walked out of the meeting he said he understood more than i i guess at the time that this was this could lead to interference in u s political life and he wanted nothing of it even as the democrats open up the impeachment inquiry the closed door depositions continue undersecretary for political affairs david hale is the only witness to appear for his scheduled deposition this week he was expected to tell lawmakers wednesday about political influence at the state department particularly surrounding the ouster of marie yovanovitch as u s ambassador to ukraine rep mark meadows a north carolina republican who has consistently attended the closed door depositions said there was no mention of a quid pro quo in the deposition he made a compelling case that there was absolutely no linkage between suspension of military aid and political investigations he said democrats have a packed schedule for the rest of the week with depositions scheduled for mr bolton and mr mulvaney though neither man likely will appear mr taylor 72 is a graduate of west point who served for six years as an army infantry officer including with the 101st airborne division in vietnam he has served in administrations of both parties since 1985 one of his first jobs in washington was as a staffer to then sen bill bradley new jersey democrat from 2006 to 2009 mr taylor served as ambassador to ukraine he also has overseen u s aid to afghanistan mr kent deputy assistant secretary
