apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic taipei taiwan ap around valentine s day last year the decomposing body of a pregnant hong kong woman 21 year old poon hiu wing turned up in the tall grass near a riverside spot in a suburban area of taipei taiwan s capital her boyfriend also from hong kong was the prime suspect in her slaying but escaped to the semi autonomous chinese territory before taiwanese police could take him into custody the murder case was cited by hong kong s leader carrie lam as justification for amendments to the city s extradition laws a move that many said would make suspects vulnerable to being sent to mainland china where they could face torture and unfair trials the massive anti government protests set off by the legislation in june have grown increasingly violent top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the release of the suspect wednesday after serving a sentence for a separate offense and the legal tussle between hong kong and taipei over his fate underscore deep political divisions between taiwan s freewheeling democracy and independent judiciary and china s tightly controlled authoritarian one party system taiwan s china skeptical government initially said no sunday when it learned that the suspect 20 year old chan tong kai was willing to fly back to face a trial days later the taiwanese government s mainland affairs council said it would take chan if taiwanese police and prosecutors could enter hong kong first to be escorts on chan s flight hong kong has denied that request and chan appears to be a free man some questions and answers related to the case why can t chan just fly back hong kong is part of china which doesn t recognize taiwan as independent agreements signed during warmer relations didn t include extradition and china stopped talks in 2016 because taiwanese president tsai ing wen disputes china s condition that she acknowledge taiwan as part of a single china hong kong s citizens must get entry permits from taiwan s immigration agency but the chaperone who was proposed for chan the rev peter koon ho ming isn t eligible for a permit because he s also a delegate to the chinese government s legislative advisory body taiwan s mainland affairs council wanted to appoint an escort to prevent possible escape and destruction of evidence it also questioned whether chan really wanted to return

makes taiwan look like part of china said liu yih jiun public affairs professor at fo guang university in taiwan more than 80 percent of taiwanese oppose beijing s goal of unifying taiwan and china

taiwan suggesting that both belong to china taiwan s ruling democratic progressive party supports taiwanese self rule and tsai has spoken in favor of the millions in hong kong who protested the
