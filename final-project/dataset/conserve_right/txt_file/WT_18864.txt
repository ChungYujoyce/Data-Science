ion of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion sending armed troops into a foreign country for the purpose of seizing territory is an act of war and a line not often crossed in recent decades it s what president vladimir putin has done in ukraine in clear violation of the united nations charter the 1975 helsinki final act the 1994 budapest memorandum which guaranteed ukraine s territorial integrity in exchange for the surrender of its nuclear weapons and the 1997 ukraine russia bilateral treaty if the united states takes no serious actions in response lessons will be learned and not just by mr putin top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century what can an american president do no one expects barack obama to put boots on the ground serious economic warfare using banks instead of tanks as russian dissident garry kasparov has proposed may be impossible because europeans have grown dependent on russia for natural gas the answer is not to posture nor i think is it to punish russia directly instead recognize that mr putin along with iran s supreme leader china s rulers and other dubious international actors regard the diminution of american power as their strategic goal a necessary precondition for the achievement of their regional and global ambitions so make it clear that the weakening of america stops right here and right now do that by implementing policies to strengthen america this will frustrate our adversaries and enemies and bolster our allies the following are four such empowering policies first restore missile defense five years ago president obama canceled plans to build a europe based missile defense system why to please and appease mr putin who thought it possible and unacceptable that such a system might be used to protect americans from russian missiles in contravention of the cold war doctrine of mutually assured destruction we should make it clear that henceforth we intend to protect ourselves without apology america has the technological know how to build a system that could prevent any intercontinental ballistic missile from any country reaching its intended victims anywhere in the world what we ve lacked is the will to stand up to the self proclaimed peace activists who prefer voluntary vulnerability in addition cancel the 2010 new start arms control treaty which was a great deal for mr putin no cuts of deployed warheads or strategic launchers and a bad bargain for the united states we have reduced our arsenal as former sen jon kyl and other leading defense experts have long urged take steps to extend the life of america s aging ballistic nuclear warheads mr obama said he would do that he has not second get energetic two years ago mr obama promised an all of the above strategy for the 21st century that develops every source of american made energy he has done next to nothing to fulfill that pledge too energy abundance and diversity should be our goal that means more fracking that means tapping petroleum on federal lands that means ending the ban on flexible fuel vehicles capable of running on a variety of liquid fuels that means eliminating bureaucratic barriers to entrepreneurship and competition with investors not politicians attempting to pick winners that means eliminating environmental rules that impose more costs than benefits a byproduct of such policies they would create jobs and reduce poverty because the poor spend a larger percentage of their income on energy electricity gasoline and heating and cooling of their homes than do their wealthier neighbors cheaper energy also would stimulate economic growth a bigger american economy means a more powerful america third make a group of eight minus 1 the group of six was founded in 1975 as a forum of the world s leading industrialized democracies when canada joined the following year it became the g 7 russia was added to the club in 1998 despite the fact that it was not then and is not now an industrialized democracy on the contrary russia is an autocracy and relatively underdeveloped with per capita wealth about a third that of south korea what riches it possesses have not been created through invention innovation and productivity but through the exploitation of natural resources controlled by oligarchs let s return to g 7 and over time transform it into an association of free market liberal democracies an alternative to the united nations a broken institution beyond any hope of repair fourth respect the wisdom of si vis pacem para bellum that s latin for if you want peace prepare for war a doctrine dating back to plato mr obama does not subscribe to it instead he assures us that the tide of war is receding however iran the world s leading sponsor of terrorism continues to spin centrifuges al qaeda forces are fighting in syria iraq yemen and north africa china is throwing around its growing military weight including a 12 percent increase in military spending for 2014 again mr putin s troops have seized crimea six years after having taken two big bites out of georgia you don t have to be clausewitz to see that this is the wrong moment for the united states to take another peace dividend to shrink the military reduce capabilities and readiness the list above is by no means exhaustive the point is to adopt policies that will make the united states stronger economically militarily and by extension diplomatically nothing is more likely to cause mr putin to regret his actions and think hard before repeating them elsewhere nothing would send a clearer message to iran china and other aspiring empire builders you don t just in the 21st century behave in 19th century fashion secretary of state john f kerry said the other day that s true in the sense that top hats and petticoats are no longer stylish despotism however seems to be making a comeback in consequence the united states has 21st century responsibilities if we re unwilling or unable to shoulder them no one else will clifford d may is president of the foundation for defense of de
