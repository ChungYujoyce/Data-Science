apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion richmond democratic primary voters are obsessed with electability determined to choose the candidate most likely to defeat president trump in november and so to prove it they ve gone about systematically eliminating all the most conventionally electable candidates gone even before the iowa caucuses were the charismatic black sens cory a booker and kamala d harris so too was popular gov steve bullock of deep red montana sen amy klobuchar of minnesota with a history of mopping up big margins in the red parts of her light blue state is barely hanging on so the electability obsessed democrats are left to choose from the septuagenarian socialist sen bernard sanders pete buttigieg the 38 year old former mayor of south bend indiana s fourth largest city former vice president joseph r biden whose disastrous fourth place finish in iowa was actually the best performance he has ever turned in his three presidential campaigns and a late entry michael r bloomberg top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk electability focused democrats now seem to favor mr bloomberg the democrat turned republican turned independent turned democrat who served three terms as mayor of new york city mr bloomberg a plutocrat whose personal wealth surpasses that of dozens of countries has been carpet bombing the race with cash his advertisements across television and the internet are ubiquitous it turns out that money talks he s been rising in the polls both nationally and in individual states he came here to virginia s capital saturday for a rally mr bloomberg is targeting the commonwealth ahead of the super tuesday primaries on march 3 the largesse shows on the ground the campaign is a high tech operation too high tech for some of the attendees in order to enter the rally one had to answer several questions by text message an older man next to me struggled seemingly not understanding the difference between texting and emailing once inside the rally mr bloomberg s generosity was much appreciated the event was held in a microbrewery and the campaign was kind of enough to spring for an open bar there were probably as many people at this saturday event in a small city on the coldest day of the year than there were at mr biden s official launch last spring in downtown philadelphia the room where mr bloomberg was to speak quickly filled up overflow crowds were relegated to two adjoining bars the crowd was largely middle aged and mostly white a surprisingly hip soundtrack kept the waiting throngs entertained nowhere were the grimly predictable bruce springsteen or john cougar mellencamp anthems of middle american virtue that one usually endures at democratic campaign events instead we were treated to the likes of pharrell and fatboy slim thirty minutes after the scheduled start time mr bloomberg took the stage no doubt blessed with access to the latest in life extension technology he is a young 78 projecting vitality and reading from the teleprompter with ease and much appreciated speed his scripted remarks were crisp if banal he touted his record in new york citing crime declines and increased access to health insurance he lamented the president s record on health care and his behavior the plutocrat s only nod to this era of extreme income inequality was a vow of support for higher inheritance taxes mr bloomberg was interrupted briefly by a heckler who screamed that he was a fascist citing the stop and frisk policy that the nypd employed under his mayoralty a larger protest comprised of pro gun rights activists was set up outside mr bloomberg took the heckling genially he didn t call him fat or challenge him to a push up contest he instead chuckled that he appreciated the welcome the mayor did address the stop and frisk scandal later in his remarks however i wanted to save lives while many of the ways we tried to reduce gun violence were right and we did reduce murders by 50 in new york city there was one practice i deeply regret he said that was the police practice called stop and frisk i didn t fully understand the unintentional pain it caused this line like all of them was delivered without a quivering lip mr bloomberg recites every line in the same rote tone as if reviewing a company balance sheet his hurried delivery left little room for applause though the two biggest ovations were received when he cited his support for abortion rights and when he promised that he would not tweet as president really after 20 short minutes it was over for those used to the fidel castro length speeches of donald trump this was something of a relief as was the fact that the bar was still
