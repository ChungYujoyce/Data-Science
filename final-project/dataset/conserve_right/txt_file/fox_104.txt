hello again from fox news in washington even in donald trump aposs white house this has been quite a week sudden changes on gun control a surprise announcement to impose steep tariffs and a staff and turmoil this hour we aposll talk about the new tariffs and the potential for a trade war with white house advisor peter navarro and josh bolten head of the business roundtable a coalition of top ceos but first correspondent peter doocy with the latest from the white house begin videotape peter doocy fox news correspondent some of president trump aposs most loyal allies are dismayed by this week aposs oval office announcement of steep new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports hatch it aposs going to discombobulate a lot of our economy here doocy the commerce secretary is trying to quiet complaints wilbur ross secretary of commerce there aposs about 3 cents worth of tinplate steel in this can so if it goes up 25 percent that aposs a tiny fraction of 1 penny doocy the president has also been hearing it from governors demanding action on gun control unidentified male so i just suggest we need a little less tweeting here a little more listening doocy as republican leaders inched toward modest gun control measures the president had a warning for his own party trump some of you people are petrified of the nra you can apost be petrified doocy then he said he had a good meeting with the nra and seemed to back off with some proposals and the west wing policy debates continue as staffers shuffle or struggle to hold their ground jared kushner security clearance has been downgraded communications director hope hicks is leaving and attorney general jeff sessions was pictured dining with russia probe leader rod rosenstein hours after the president panned his handling of the fisa abuse scandal rep nancy pelosi d cali house minority leader if you want to work in the trump administration know your blood type because you will be thrown under the bus doocy but officials insist this week aposs real storm in d c was the nor aposeaster sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary i left three preschoolers and a bunch of flashlights with the power out at my house it was pretty chaotic and certainly far more chaotic earlier this morning that when i got to the office end videotape doocy the president took a night off from his feud with the mainstream media last night at the gridiron dinner to joke with reporters about the week aposs unflattering headlines for example one presidential punch line blamed a delayed arrival at the dinner on jared kushner not being able to get through security chris wallace peter doocy reporting from the white house peter thanks for that the biggest policy development this week is the president aposs announcement he is imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum joining us now one of the architects of that controversial plan white house trade adviser peter navarro mr navarro welcome to fox news sunday peter navarro white house trade adviser mr wallace good to be here my friend wallace the blowback to the new tariff policy is intense especially from conservatives who are here are two leading republican senators begin video clip sen orrin hatch r utah i hope the president doesn apost really do this because if he dos at the president doesn apost really do this because if he does it aposs going to it aposs just going to be a huge tax on american citizens sen ben sasse r nebraska if you own a steel mill today was great for you if you consume steel and every american family at the store tonight has something that has different metals in it today is a bad day for you end video clip wallace are sasse and hatch who is the chair of the senate finance committee are they wrong navarro of course they are wrong in terms of the republican party let aposs remember this donald trump ran against 16 republicans none of those republicans supported donald trump aposs positions on trade he beat every one of them and then donald trump went on to the democratic opponent who didn apost support his positions on trade and he beat them too what donald trump wants to do is fulfill his campaign promises to the american people and defend american workers and when we here about huge effects here let aposs do some of the numbers here i mean first of all the reason why the president is doing this because if he doesn apost do this we were will lose our aluminum steel aluminum industry very quickly and our steel industry very quickly thereafter if you look at the aluminum industry for example we are down now to less than 10 percent to fulfilling our demand with lost six smelters since 2013 we are down to five smelters only two of them are fully operational we are operating at a 43 percent capacity factor and only one of those smelters makes the high purity aluminum we need for our defense crosstalk wallace let aposs unpack some of this one of the things that both of those senators raised was that this is going to raise prices for american consumers and the fact is it will commerce secretary ross estimates that if you take the imported steel that goes into an american built car it will increase the price of that car 175 an analyst at the cato institute tweeted this so a new 175 per vehicle tax times 17 million vehicles sold in the usa in 2017 equals almost 3 billion in new annual consumer taxes just for steel and autos overall if i may sir if you talk about not just cars but all the products that use imported steel or imported aluminum we are talking about a tax on american consumers in the billions of dollars navarro i like secretary ross apos map of a whole lot better let aposs do it for aluminum if you look at a 10 percent tariff on aluminum a six pack of beer or coke that aposs a cent and a half if you look at the other end of the spectrum boeing 777 it aposs one of the best airliners ever made it aposs 330 million aircraft we are talking but it increased and caused at the worst of 25 000 so when you aposre talking about these massive costs or whatever is in fact it aposs not there are no downstream price effects on our industries that are significant what we are doing here and let aposs be very clear about the mission wallace wait a minute even if it aposs 175 a car and there are 17 000 cars 17 million cars that is a 3 billion tax navarro i guess we would disagree about how to do that math here 175 on a 30 000 car is less a small fraction of 1 percent wallace you add it up navarro now to get that well you can do that math crosstalk wallace wait a minute sir if you add it we are talking billions of dollars in added cost navarro let aposs see last time i checked we had an 18 trillion economy it aposs second inaudible small there aposs not enough zeros to get crosstalk wallace i mean i know you are a good economist but the fact is we are talking in billions of dollars correct navarro on a 19 trillion economy here wallace but you do agree it aposs billions of dollars increase in cost navarro what i agree is that the downstream effects of steel and aluminum tariffs are insignificant in the mission here is to preserve our steel and aluminum industries for national security and economic security crosstalk wallace all right no i want to pick up on exactly that point because the president is imposing these new tariffs under section 232 of the trade expansion act which says that all of this imported steel and all of this imported aluminum it threatens our national security i want to ask you about that here are the countries that we import steel from canada is number one with 16 percent of the market south korea is number three russia is number five and china is way down at number 11 with only 2 percent of our national steel imports question how can canadian imports be a threat to our national security when for the last quarter century under law canadian imports are the canadian industrial base is considered part of our defense the american defense industrial base navarro so let aposs tackle this in two ways first of all let aposs talk about the 232 when 232 investigation its national security and economic security broadly defined in this country agnostic it doesn apost matter who is sending us this product the fact is if we keep receiving at the way we are we aposre not going to have an aluminum industry we aposre not going to have the steel industry our aluminum industry make no mistake that thing is on life support that will be gone in a year or two if the president doesn apost take the courageous actions he aposs proposed so wallace so let me ask let me ask you this will the president navarro hang on crosstalk wallace no but let me ask you this will the president navarro you promised you asked me not to filibuster i would ask you to do the same thing crosstalk wallace i aposm asking a question will the president exempt allies like canada and europe navarro on thursday which was a great meeting with the ceos there was uniform consensus that what the president needed to do was tariffs not quotas and it needed to be across the board that was the president aposs announcement that aposs the direction it aposs heading so my expectation is that the direction it aposs heading wallace so in answer to my direct question will he exempt canada will he exempt the european union navarro that aposs not his decision and so wallace well i mean it is his decision navarro look you have to understand wallace you are saying he aposs not going to do it navarro you have to understand chris as soon as he starts exempting countries he has to raise the tariff on everybody else as soon as he exempts one country his phone starts ringing from heads of state of other countries wallace so just to make it clear navarro they say why not me wallace it aposs a global imposition navarro that aposs an answer wallace global imposition navarro yes yes and as it should be because let aposs think about what the mission is here ok the mission is to defend our steel and aluminum industries so that they survive it and as the president said clearly and correctly we can apost have a country without steel and aluminum industry wallace ok navarro would you grant me this that we are down now to less than 10 percent of meeting production and we aposre down to five smelters wallace i aposm just asking the questions so let me ask another question crosstalk navarro just asking the questions wallace the other concern is that prices will not just go up but that other countries will retaliate and slap tariffs on u s exports to their countries president trump tweeted this on friday about responding to u s trade deficits with countries trade wars are good and easy to win and here aposs what you said begin video clip navarro i don apost believe any country in the world is going to retaliate for the simple reason that we are the most lucrative and biggest market in the world end video clip wallace mr navarro do you really believe that navarro yes i do and let aposs give it some perspective we have the lowest tariffs in the world we have the lowest nontariff barriers we are the free tradest ph nation of the world and what do we get for that we don apost get fair and reciprocal trade we get every year a half a trillion dollar trade deficit that transfers our wealth to other countries and basically offshore our jobs and our factories and all we are asking for is fair and reciprocal trade now in this particular case we are defending national security but more broadly these countries that we are trading with they understand they aposd be getting a very good deal for many years all the president is doing he aposs been saying this for two years now actually for 20 that america first we want a fair deal we want reciprocal trade and i don apost believe you heard me say this crosstalk wallace if i may ask a question now you may that may be your argument but the european union for instance doesn apost believe it they say that they have already assembled a package of tariffs 25 percent tariffs on 3 5 billion of u s exports the head of the european commission said this we will put tariffs on harley davidson on bourbon and on blue jeans levi aposs question is he bluffing navarro well they already have tariffs on that if you go to india for example there aposs 100 percent tariff on our harleys but wallace i aposm asking you about the european union do you believe he is bluffing when he says they aposre going to impose new tariffs navarro i think what we need to do here what we need to do here is keep the rhetoric down it would be helpful if the media didn apost have all these crazy headlines about trade wars and just look at the facts facts are we are the biggest market in the world wallace wait a minute crosstalk navarro go no back and forth wallace trade wars are good it wasn apost a media invention trade wars are good was a tweet from the president mr navarro crosstalk wallace would you agree that trade wars are good navarro i aposm going to finish this argument and the argument is simply that wallace do you agree that trade wars are good was a tweet by the president navarro i aposm going to finish this point all of the countries in europe that we trade with run very large trade surpluses with us we run trade deficits with them who gets hurt if this goes the direction that you are suggesting i believe that these are measured tariffs crosstalk wallace i am not suggesting anything i aposm asking you questions and i take objection to the idea that talk of trade wars is an invention of the media when the president tweeted out navarro oh come on now wallace trade wars are good and easy to win i have limited time navarro you guys are fanning the flames here what i aposm trying to say wallace i aposm fanning the flames i didn apost write the presidential tweet navarro what i aposm trying to say in a measured way is that from the rest of the world aposs perspective they are getting a really good deal from america running big trade surpluses with us and we are asking for is fair and reciprocal trade in this particular case i would hope the allies would understand that we need to defend our aluminum and steel crosstalk wallace i have one final question for you i think we got the point navarro go ahead wallace to call you trade hard liner is an understatement in 2011 you wrote a book called death by china that you then made into a documentary here is the trailer for that documentary that shows a knife representing china going into the heart of the united states some white house senior staff accused you of guerrilla warfare saying that you sneak around the west wing and go into the oval office and runaround policy meetings to personally lobby the president and that frankly a number of senior staff were surprised when the president made this announcement on thursday how do you plead navarro i would say that sitting here on a sunday with you that aposs a bit of a cheap shot that there aposs no facts and evidence to support that and if i aposve learned anything in the 14 months here in washington on the white house it aposs that there aposs all sorts of malicious leaks that go into try to hurt us and the culture in the white house now is if they go after one of us they go after all of us we are a team together the president is doing a great job and i stand on my writings i can tell you that as the china issue is one that we have the country are going to have to address because it aposs a serious matter wallace mr navarro thank you thanks for your time please come back a spirited discussion up next reaction from the head of the business roundtable on what these tariffs will mean for american jobs in the u s economy commercial break wallace even before the new trump tariffs are officially announced there is fierce pushback to the policy some of the loudest alarms are coming from the business roundtable an association of ceos from leading u s companies joining me now josh bolten head of the business roundtable and former white house chief of staff under george w bush josh welcome back josh bolten ceo president business roundtable thank you chris wallace you were listening to mr navarro what you think of his defense of the president aposs new tariffs bolten i think it aposs a huge mistake and i aposm sad that president bush has been led by that kind of advice wallace president trump that was loss ph of memory there bolten well man thank you president trump i think is coming at this with the best of instincts he aposs trying to fulfill his campaign promises he aposs trying to help some workers in the united states specifically in the steel and aluminum industries what he needs to understand and what the overwhelming majority of the businesses in our organization are trying to say is this will cause huge damage across broad sectors of the economy you maybe will be able to give a little bit of help to the steel and aluminum industries you aposre going to cause damage across any number of downstream industries and any number of industries that export to countries that are likely to retaliate wallace but there aposs no question i think you would agree that the chinese aposs over overproduction of steel and their importing to the u s sometimes not only directly and through other countries has dramatically hurt the steel industry and cost american jobs are you saying the president should just stand there and let it happen bolten no absolutely not i mean the problem is the one you identified which is state subsidized overcapacity in china especially in steel and that aposs the issue that ought to be addressed ironically the announcement that president trump made this past week hits steel imported from all kinds of countries most of them are friends and allies many of them are free trade agreement partners and hits china only minimally china accounts for only 2 percent of the u s steel imports at this point so the remedies that peter navarro is pushing the president to impose doesn apost address the real problem which is chinese overcapacity now how do you address that it aposs really hard you aposve got to get together with our friends and allies who all face the same problem put pressure on the chinese jointly because you can apost do this individually and force the chinese to reform their practices but it aposs not an easy task it aposs not as easy as waving your hand and putting tariffs on a whole bunch of countries that are not the problem wallace let aposs talk about what you say are the downsides of this mr navarro says that the talk that this is going to increase prices for american consumers is overstated you know he talks about a penny on a beer can or 50 on an american car and he also says the threat of retaliation is overstated bolten dead wrong on both counts first of all yes it may be only a penny on a beverage can but let aposs be clear in the united states we make 88 billion beverage cans aluminum beverage cans per year that comes out to a tax of 880 million just on beverage cans and we are talking all kinds of products when you get to cars when you get to tractors when you get to airplanes the cost is really high making our products uncompetitive against their foreign competitors that aposs number one number two on the retaliation point i mean peter navarro seems to be very comfortable that we won apost get retaliated against i hope he aposs right but the history is completely against him on that and the statements of some of our trading partners already is against that now i don apost know if peter navarro would be willing to bet his job that he is right that there won apost be retaliation but he ought to be willing to make that bet because he aposs putting the jobs of tens of thousands of americans who depend on these export markets that there won apost be retaliation wallace what bolten and there aposs a lot of risk that he is wrong wallace what are the chances that this escalates into a global trade war and if so what with the impact be not just in the u s economy but the global economy bolten escalation into a trade war is what the businesses in my organization are really worried about i mean it aposs bad enough in the steel and aluminum case but the tweets by the president including the tweet about responding on german autos on friday suggests that he thinks a trade war is easy that it aposs winnable it isn apost nobody wins a trade war especially in these globalized days of the united states when we are so dependent on goods coming in and going out for our competitiveness you know every modern president has faced some trade skirmishes during their time but they aposve all been wise enough not to let it descend into outright trade war wallace let me ask you about that because you do have some experience with this you are the deputy chief of staff first in the bush white house and 2002 president bush bush 43 imposed steel tariffs of 30 percent on foreign steel imports now he did exempt some countries like canada which this president according to mr navarro is not going to do there was retaliation from european union and eventually less than two years later you rescinded you lifted the tariffs what lesson did you take from that experience into 2002 and 03 bolten well all of the economic studies that came after that show that we lost more jobs in the downstream industries than we saved in steel and steel wouldn apost be in the problem it would be today if those metrics had been effective there aposs a very important difference between what president bush did and what president trump is proposing to do and it aposs a little bit detailed but bear with me for a second because i think it is very important president bush and most trade remedy measures of this kind of been done under section 201 which is a legal procedure accepted in the world trade organization which requires going to an independent body to make a showing of injury if you succeed in making a showing of serious kind of injury the products get pared back as they did for president bush and then internationally that aposs generally accepted as a way to proceed now the europeans in that case took us to the wto when they won the case president bush immediately removed the tariffs and there was no retaliation in that case this is completely different president trump is proposing to proceed under a statute called section 232 crosstalk wallace we talked about that which is national security bolten national security and a statue that aposs only been used twice in this country aposs history to restrain imports from iran and libya of oil that aposs a real national security in this case even his secretary of defense doesn apost think national security is implicated and what that does is it frees up our trading partners to retaliate willy nilly which i think they will feel justified in doing wallace i got a couple of minutes left i want to squeeze in two questions i asked mr navarro about the policy process inside the white house and the fact that a number of senior staff people were surprised when the president actually announced the plan on thursday they thought there were still discussing it as chief of staff in the bush 43 white house what do you make of the way this white house operates bolten well it aposs a very different kind of place i don apost every white house is has its own style ours was a particularly disciplined style the current white house is much less disciplined i think john kelly has brought a substantial amount of coherence to the policy process wallace but do you find it in this issue and others where a major decision of this import is made and something the senior staff apparently didn apost know it was going to happen bolten yes that aposs a serious problem but i don apost think in this case the problem here is really the process the problem here is the instincts that the president brought with him from the campaign and you have to respect that i mean you have to respect what the president is doing here he aposs had really strong policies on taxes on regulation but the third stool of international trade on which he campaigned is weak and sometimes a president needs to you need to stick to your principles but you also need to recognize in cases where stuff you said in the campaign isn apost right and ought to be drawn back the president needs to have the courage to do that wallace josh thank you thanks for coming in today we aposll follow what the president formally announces this week bolten great thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the president aposs evolving position on guns and school safety and whether he can strike a deal with congress to get anything done commercial break wallace coming up president trump aposs comments on guns including whether to raise the age to buy a rifle worry some conservatives begin video clip sen pat toomey r pennsylvania we didn apost address it mr president trump do you know why you aposre afraid of the nra right toomey no end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the president aposs changing position on guns next commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states you know half of you are so afraid of the nra there aposs nothing to be afraid of and you know what i aposve been with you we have to fight them every once in a while that aposs ok end video clip wallace president trump telling the nation aposs governors not to fear the gun lobby during a white house meeting this week and it aposs time now for our sunday group the head of heritage action for america michael needham gerald seib from the wall street journal former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and josh holmes mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff and now a gop strategist michael how do you explain it because the president was almost taunting governors and republican members of congress in the two listening sessions this week not to be afraid of the nra then he meets with the nra and he appears to start backing off some of the things he said in those sessions what happened michael needham ceo heritage action for america yes look i think you have a president who wants to get something done he like all of us wants to find a way to increase school safety to make sure something like this doesn apost happen again i mean sum up what the president said really was unfair you look at somebody like senator toomey and his criticism of senator toomey i aposve disagreed with the senator on some things in the past he aposs somebody who aposs approached this issue with nothing but the utmost integrity what makes this issue so hard pressed as a country is it is one of the flash points in a cultural civic breaking apart that really does risk tearing our country you have one half of the country probably less than half of the country who literally doesn apost understand why somebody would want to have a gun doesn apost understand why somebody would want to use a gun then you have another part of the country that looks at it and says every opportunity that those cultural elites have they come and they try to take away the rights of law abiding citizens i think until we can get to a point where different parts of the country want to talk to each other want to understand each other and can start finding the types of policies that will actually make a difference we aposre never going to be able to have a country where people want to live and talk with each other wallace but but why would the president add to that by bashing the nra needham well i i don apost know that bashing the nra is is particularly adding to that look i think this is a president who is new to some of these issues he ran as an outsider he hasn apost lived the gun battles of the last several decades he aposs trying to get to policies that will get something done in an area that is as big a flash point in the civic breaking apart that is one of the real threats to our democracy and that needs to be addressed wallace in his session with the members of congress president trump seemed determined to take guns away from mentally unstable people like the parkland shooter here the president is begin video clip donald trump president of the united states it take so long to go to court to get the due process procedures i like taking the guns early so you can do exactly what you aposre saying but take the guns first go through due process second end video clip wallace congresswoman harman take the guns first then go through due process second was kind of extreme i would think even for the fiercest gun control advocates among democrats jane harman former u s congresswoman d california yes wallace what are the chances that for all the emotions when this thing is said and done nothing meaningful is going to get passed by congress harman well i think they they are significant and it aposs heartbreaking wallace significant chances harman a significant chance that congress won apost be able to do anything i would just say it aposs not a debate between guns and no guns it aposs a debate about what level of protection can we give kids in school how can we take guns away from mentally unstable people especially assault weapons and i was in congress when it did work in 1994 dianne feinstein had a bill to ban assault weapons which passed of course the democrats then lost their majority tom foley who supported it and was speaker lost so people were spooked ten years later it expired but i do think something like that more focus on mental health certainly wallace why do you think nothing aposs going to happen harman because there is no fundamental agreement about what should happen even this tiny little bill about registration is stuck because some democrats want more than that and they think that will be the excuse wallace well not registration about about filing with the don apost say registration but harman excuse me about filing yes wallace but fixing fixing the national instant criminal background system harman the nics system yes wallace whatever nics stands for harman fixing the nics system not a basketball team but the point is that even that is stuck because one side wants more and one side wants less and can apost we get it that our kids are going to go to fortress from now on or my grandkids are and that aposs just the wrong message for kids needham i don apost think it aposs fair to say though that one side wants less with regards to that the fix nics bill could pass if democrats want it to pass if democrats want to make a small step forward senator rubio gave a great speech this week on the floor of the senate where he was talking about specific pieces of legislation that have bipartisan support that actually could have prevented this attack from getting something like retraining orders from guns making it easier for school officials to take people who who are known problems and sending them to the cops we need to get those things done i think the question is going to be does the democrat party want to work with republicans to get things done or do they want the issue and you had a a meeting at the democratic senatorial campaign at the beginning of this week wallace all right let her answer i want to bring the other members of the panel in harman all right so let me just answer democrats want to get something done and and piecemeal reform at least to me is ok although we i think we should do more governors fortunately and the private sector these gun stores are moving into the vacuum and i applaud them for doing it wallace all right gerry this has always been an unruly white house but it really did seem to veer out of control this week let aposs put some of this up on the screen there were a series of leaks that seemed designed to weaken jared kushner the president called a decision by attorney general sessions disgraceful economic advisor gary cohn is said to be on the verge of resigning over the issue of tariffs and the president according to some reports wants his national security advisor general mcmaster out what is going on gerald f seib the wall street journal well so other than that it was a great week so look i i think that that there is a reality about this white house i aposve talked to some people who work in the white house about it which is that you aposre not going to change the way president trump operates he this is the way he is and so i think it aposs a mistake to try to have a staff structure that is designed to change him i think what you have to do is have a staff structure that works around the way he operates and it seemed to be in place for a while but rob porter who was the staff secretary who helped control things a lot is is gone general kelly who had seemed to have instilled some order has now found himself feuding with jared kushner that has created its own set of chaos and i think you also have the reality that some of the top issues that have been bubbling along have now come to the surface trade for example which you just had some very interesting conversations on was always going to split the white house staff i mean that was below the surface gary cohn is here peter navarro is there there aposs no getting around that when you get to the point where you want to act and that was actually the most amazing thing that happened this week was this decision by the president to announce on his own on the fly that he was going to impose tariffs on trade and aluminum imports because the staff at been telling people you know just an hour earlier it aposs not going to happen so when you bring that sort of question to the surface you aposre going to see the splits so you can apost keep them hidden any longer wallace josh how much concern among top republicans in this town i aposm mostly talking about in the building behind me about staff disarray and policy disarray in the white house josh holmes founder cavalry well i think the second piece is is the most important to that because the the largely the palace intrigue is something the media has been obsessed with since day one in any administration and this administration is no different it seems to be more of a central thesis with this administration than previous administrations but i think in terms of congress the only time they care about this is when it affects the policy and i think this week was the first week in many many months going back to probably july of last year that it did and we saw that with the rollout of this of these trade proposals a lot of misunderstanding about what they actually were and a lack of consensus internally that is a problem because congress reacts only and exclusively to consistency from the administration you aposve got to remember there are 535 different opinions up there at least 200 of them wake up every morning and look at the mirror and see the new president of the united states they all have their own individual opinions and so they need consistency from the administration to help guide their view wallace all right panel we have to take a break here but when we come back we aposll discuss vladimir putin aposs announcement russia has new invincible missiles that can penetrate u s defenses plus what would you like to ask the panel about prospects for a new cold war just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip vladimir putin russian president through translator russia was and remains a big nuclear state but no no one wanted to speak with us constructively no one has listened to us you listen to us now end video clip wallace russian president vladimir putin with an ominous warning after announcing a new generation of nuclear weapons and we aposre back now with the panel congresswoman harman how important was putin aposs announcement do we think he really has these weapons and if so does how does it change our relations with russia are we headed for a new cold war harman well let aposs focus on the fact that there aposs an election in two weeks in russia vladimir putin aposs essentially unopposed but it wouldn apost hurt to put out a big campaign speech which he did very effectively on the weapons themselves some of its new some of it isn apost new the footage he used or a lot of it was from a 2007 russian documentary which has been on youtube since 2011 so that aposs clearly not new and talking about his ability to be invincible well not so much but but cruise missiles are much harder to defend against than missiles that have a a parabola that goes up and then comes down that aposs what our defenses are geared for wallace but what but on the on the real issue i mean this clearly i mean the animation actually showed the missile headed towards north america i mean what does this say about u s russian relations harman well it it says saber rattling it say my button is bigger than your button and all of that we we aposve seen that movie recently and we also should worry about russia transferring technology to other countries we aposve just learned that russia has been laundering coal from north korea to other places so not so good but what i wanted to say was there is a missile defense review underway we should do more with our missile defenses they aposre never going to be perfect russia could overwhelm us but we could overwhelm them and as to a new cold war i don apost think so i think the world is multi pollard ph it aposs a very different world now but what happened to the vision that ronald reagan had about a shining city on a hill not just being tough on defense which we should be but where aposs the vision for america and our role in the world that we could do wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on twitter from alex atmore wouldn apost imposing the sanctions that congress approved of near unanimously be a good deterrent without further escalation josh how do you answer alex holmes well it aposs a great question and you know the irony of this administration and how they aposve dealt with sanctions is actually only fueled the greater speculation about all of the election of 2016 and all of the investigation that have gone into it had they implemented the sanctions i think without any question they would be in a much different situation with respect to the investigations so look i what we aposre doing currently is clearly not working you had dni director coats out you had cia director pompeo out all saying we aposre not doing enough to deter russia particularly with respect to our elections and the midterms coming up and so i aposve talked to a number of members of congress they all think that we aposve spent far too much time talking about 2016 elections not nearly enough talk about 2018 elections and it aposs time that we turn the page and address some of that wallace well as a matter of fact that brings us to a hearing on capitol hill this week were senator elizabeth warren was questioning the head of the national security agency admiral rogers mike rogers about given what happened in 2016 with russian modeling what about the dangers to 2018 here he is begin video clip admiral michael rogers director national security agency my concern is i believe that president putin has clearly come to the conclusion there aposs little price to play here sen elizabeth warren d massachusetts bingo rogers and that therefore i can continue this activity warren yes end video clip wallace michael has president trump been tough enough in forget 2016 let aposs just put that in a box for a minute has he been tough enough in saying to vladimir putin and the kremlin hands off this country in the 2018 elections needham he should be very clear about that and we need to protect our critical infrastructure and he should never miss an opportunity to make it clear how much and we aposre committed to that look i think writ large american foreign policy towards russia for a long time has been a little bit naive and i think that the trump administration writ large has been bringing it together into a very coherent national security strategy that they put out there that needs to be more aggressive in looking at how we aposre dealing with the russian threat recognizing that vladimir putin is not backing down he aposs doubling down and it aposs going to take a unified national response from our nuclear postural review from our relationship with ukraine from our relationship with the sanctions that you brought up i think the trump administration has done a very good job of taking our foreign policy unifying it around themes backing up our allies being more aggressive towards russia but clearly there aposs more that we need to do to make it clear that election meddling is not something that we aposre going to tolerate wallace you aposre shaking your head congresswoman harman i i i think it has the trump administration has no coherent world strategy and i don apost think the obama administration did either needham yes harman but now is the time our election is very vulnerable in 2018 and so are europe aposs elections and targeted sanctions that hit individuals and prevent them from traveling and prevent them from using international banks would make a huge difference in russia and i think trump missed an opportunity by just putting out there the fortune 500 list and not doing anything i think that was a strategic blunder needham and i think this is something the democrats and republicans are going to have to come together and say on this one we need to be unified harman right needham i mean if you look at the nuclear posture review what president trump put out in 2018 is very different from what president obama put out in 2010 but it aposs not really that different from what he was doing at the end of his administration i think that there is more bipartisan consensus that we need to come together on some of those issues that he needs to continue wallace but but gerry let me bring you in because there aposs been almost silence from this administration after a very provocative speech by vladimir putin the president said nothing the white house basically said nothing there aposs been no response from this administration seib well look i i think there aposs a an unfortunate reality here which is that the the debate about the 2016 election which has consumed this conversation about russia is probably something if you could do what you just suggested put it in a box and get onto the broader realities here that would be healthy that aposs not happening i think it aposs not happening in part because both ends of pennsylvania avenue are obsessed with what happened in 2016 but the deeper reality here is that democracy is is under attack and not just from russia and not just in 2016 it happened in europe in 2014 2015 2016 it happened here it aposs apparently happening here now both the russians vladimir putin and president xi in china would like to hold out other models besides democracy as the model that other countries in the world ought to follow there aposs a really sustained attack on the basically the institutions in of democracy and its role as a model for the world and that aposs the broader issue here and it aposs now being basically lost as a question that ought to be discussed because of this obsession with 2016 and i don apost know how you break out of that wallace well let and and let aposs end of that because it isn apost in a box it aposs you know it aposs on the front page of the papers today again seib right wallace i think sometimes the the incremental information we hear is significant sometimes i think it aposs meaningless you know robert mueller is asking about well he aposs asking about everything what is the price the opportunity cost of this obviously it has to be investigated but of this continuing now we are a year and a third into this administration seib well i think it aposs obvious that the the kind of broader issues we aposre talking about here don apost get raised don apost get discussed but at some point the robert mueller thing comes to an end i don apost know what the end point is but at some point later this year i assume it will be reached and then we aposll know the answer to some questions and maybe then we aposll move on to the broader questions holmes well and you asked what the price is i mean imagine just for a moment in the midterms let aposs say the state of ohio or the state of florida all of a sudden can apost trust the integrity of its ballots that were just cast seib right yes homes i mean that is a fundamental undermining of the american democracy that aposs what the price is harman which is huge and and the sadly congress could act on a bipartisan basis in many areas immigration obviously this issue about meddling election securing our election infrastructure in on a on a more sustained basis and it doesn apost do it wallace all right thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week dolly parton on why kids around the world call her the book lady commercial break wallace most of us know her as a legendary singer and songwriter but for millions of kids she aposs the one who help them start reading early here is our power player of the week
