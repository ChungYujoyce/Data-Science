lackluster showing at the first debate two weeks ago the race has tightened across the board both in national surveys and where it matters most in the 11 battleground states that will decide the election in every state still considered up for grabs nov 6 the real clear politics rcp average of polls shows republican nominee mitt romney has gained ground on the president and has taken the lead outright in colorado florida and north carolina there s a sense that romney is an acceptable alternative president right now republican pollster whit ayres said a great many people did not view it that way before that is critical for making this election a referendum on obama s record top stories australian researchers see virus design manipulation russian fighter jets intercept u s navy patrol aircraft over mediterranean coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history the two men face off again tuesday night at hofstra university for their second debate during which mr obama will try to make up for what he said was an uneven performance the first go around he also is hoping to tamp down the renewed enthusiasm for mr romney who voters said won the debate which helped propel him to gains in the polls in florida where mr obama held a lead of 3 percentage points before the first debate mr romney now leads by an average of 3 points in the rcp average in north carolina host to the democratic national convention mr romney is pulling away with a lead of 5 points after being tied with the president on the day before the oct 3 debate in virginia where the president led consistently before the first debate by 2 to 8 percentage points in the rcp average of polls his lead over mr romney has shrunk since the debate to less than 1 percentage point obama campaign spokeswoman jen psaki said the razor thin margins in swing states are no surprise and that the campaign always has expected a tight race but the campaign moved swiftly to discredit a usa today gallup survey released monday that gave mr romney a 5 point edge 51 percent to 46 percent in 12 swing states saying the poll also showed mr romney tied with the president among women who are likely to vote something the obama camp said is impossible to believe obama campaign pollster joel benenson said gallup s survey was an extreme outlier defying the trends seen in every other battleground and national poll this result underscores deep flaws in gallup s likely voter screen mr benenson said gallup s data is once again far out of line with other public pollsters he said in 14 state polls conducted across eight swing states since oct 4 mr obama led among women in every single one the president s pollster argued that bias was built into the gallup poll for example gallup asks voters both whether they have voted in their precinct before and where people in their neighborhood go to vote he said this creates a bias against registered voters who are more likely to move from time to time such as young voters renters minorities and urban dwellers all of whom tend to lean toward the president four years ago mr obama won among women by a 13 percent margin over republican nominee john mccain the complaints about polls are a reversal from three weeks ago when republicans were complaining that surveys were skewed toward mr obama gop pollsters said some polls were sampling a higher percentage of democrats than they should have been ms psaki said the polls are helping determine mr obama s campaign schedule after this week s debate mr obama will campaign in iowa ohio new hampshire and virginia but the polls have turned in nearly every swing state in ohio mr obama s pre debate lead of as much as 8 percentage points is down to about 2 points in the real clear politics average of polls that same slippage has happened elsewhere across the industrial midwest including in michigan where a 10 point lead for mr obama on oct 2 has slipped to 4 points according to the rcp average as the campaign heads into the final three weeks mr obama sent a fundraising email to supporters monday declaring this race is tied what we do over the next 22 days will determine not just the next four years but what this country looks like for decades to come mr obama said in his pitch for more donations one ominous development since the first debate has been a shift in florida polls among hispanic voters away from mr obama a tampa bay times bay news 9 survey released thursday had mr romney and mr obama in a virtual tie among that state s hispanics prompting a senior obama adviser to comment on the same day that s an impossibility but a florida international university miami herald el nuevo herald poll released monday also showed a tightening of the race among hispanic voters in the sunshine state with mr obama leading mr romney 51 percent to 44 percent just half the 15 point margin by which mr obama won florida hispanics in 2008 nationally the same survey showed mr obama leading mr romney 66 percent to 31 percent among hispanics pollsters said the difference in florida is the cuban american community which is largely republican and could be more enthused about mr romney s performance in the first debate a politico george washington university poll released monday puts mr romney in the lead 50 percent to 48 percent in the most competitive states colorado florida iowa michigan nevada new
