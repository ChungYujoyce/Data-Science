apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion democrats have this annoying habit of seeing race in places where race isn t even an issue it s called identity politics it s one of the left s favorite means of politicking and it s damaging to america because it immediately stifles all sane debate the left does it with gender as well top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens take a look at this point made by fox news pundit and five co host juan williams whose recent piece in the hill far too frequently represents the collective view of the left many people including me have been targets of president trump s twitter tirades but women of color provoke a special kind of trump ire his comments are already interesting because they actually acknowledge how president donald trump s twitter tirades encompass all that this president takes to task with his tweets many people of all walks of life and indeed trump does trump s called out the now deceased sen john mccain on twitter trump s slammed sen jeff flake on twitter trump s hit at his former attorney general jeff sessions on twitter and just this week trump called out the former senator from nevada harry reid on twitter the common denominator with these dudes they re all white they re all males yet when the left wants to criticize trump it s all about the minority races and female gender the sight of a young muslim congresswoman wearing a hijab holding a powerful 71 year old white republican accountable signals the dawn of a new day in american politics williams wrote in the hill in reference to recent congressional questioning by rep ilhan omar minnesota democrat of trump s special envoy to venezuela elliott abrams the heavily white older male party of trump is fighting to hold back what they see coming over the horizon which is well in leftist speak what s coming over the horizon that is leaving the ideological right in nail biting terror are women and women of color in particular trump last month dismissed rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y with a wave of the hand and a who cares williams wrote trump has been even more dismissive of other women of color imagine the bitter attacks if trump faces a strong woman of color such as sen kamala harris d calif in the 2020 election williams also mentioned omarosa manigault newman former rep mia love rep maxine waters rep frederica wilson and rep rashida tlaib as other women of color who ve been targeted and attacked by trump and other conservatives because of their sex and skin color but take a memo left conservatives oppose these women some of color some not because they press policies that are dangerous to the limited government tenets of america it has nothing to do with race or gender or race and gender it has everything to do with views pretending as williams did in the hill as many on the left are wont to do that trump regularly uses white identity politics to stir up his base is a clamp on sensible political discourse it s a deceitful argument that actually sends a subtle message to women and women of color especially that their race and gender matter more than their minds a slap in the face to equality in and of itself and it s the weakest method of politicking that exists because it says hey i ve no real ideas to sell so i m just going to guilt you into voting for me by using my sex and skin color enough already of race baiting and gender slinging enough already of the antics simply put if the left can t win based on policies and platforms and ideas then the left has no business being in the political race at all cheryl chumley can be reached at emailprotected or on twitter
