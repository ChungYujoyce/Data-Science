rituals usually unfold on capitol hill when a candidate wins a special election and joins the house in the middle of a congress at that moment they re just a face in the crowd but soon they ll be a member of congress the rookies show up on capitol hill wide eyed not knowing their way to the restrooms let alone the path to the house floor there s usually a small reception for supporters and family members featuring punch and finger foods in the bare bones stripped down capitol hill office that belonged to their predecessor then the victor heads across the street from the house office buildings to the capitol for a mock swearing in with the speaker of the house family members clamor around the congressman elect for the photo op an official photographer snaps photos of the speaker posing with the family the speaker usually jokes around and makes light conversation the lawmaker elect fumbles with the family bible and inevitably raises the wrong hand before the speaker corrects them finally everyone stands up straight and smiles for the money shot a few local reporters sometimes fly in from the politician s home state they furiously scribble down color in their notebooks for their pieces about the lawmaker elect s day p ryan taller in person jotted down an out of town female correspondent at one recent ceremony sometimes a camera crew or two shoots a few frames of video the networks may show up maybe not then the speaker s staff escorts the newbie to the house floor for the official swearing in that s where the real thing happens the house is almost always in the middle of a vote series the swearing in comes between the first and second roll call tally the speaker climbs to the dais to preside bipartisan members from the congressman elect s state squeeze into the well of the chamber sometimes the state s senators walk across the capitol to observe the most senior member of the delegation usually makes a few glowing remarks about the latest addition to the house the speaker then asks the member elect to present himself or herself in the well and raise their right hand the speaker administers the oath of office everyone cheers the speaker then asks the now congressman or congresswoman to deliver a short speech the most junior member of the house thanks a lot of people they hope they can work with members from both sides of the aisle to get things done they discuss what an honor it is to become a house member they acknowledge their family members sitting in the gallery above the floor then it s over the speaker announces the updated membership of the house and the body returns to voting someone has to instruct the new representative how to use the voting machine because well they re now a member of congress and voting is kind of important around here this ritual plays out multiple times each congress following a special election victory some newly minted lawmakers arrive on capitol hill with celebrity status that may command a few more reporters and cameras if someone emerges victorious from a high pitched special election their win could represent a political bellwether or forecast a trend for the next election the formalities to swear in rep warren davidson r ohio received sizable attention in june of last year davidson won a special election to take the ohio house seat vacated by former gop house speaker john boehner not as many reporters and cameras materialized in november of last year to swear in reps james comer r n y dwight evans d pa and colleen hanabusa d hawaii that trio was elected to fill out terms of members who either resigned due to scandal or died comer and evans were brand new to the capitol hanabusa returned to the house after an unsuccessful senate bid but these customs usually don t garner much attention amid the daily political maelstroms that consume capitol hill the new members usually fade into congressional oblivion unless they re a known figure a case in point was the 2013 return to elected office by rep mark sanford r s c the south carolina legislature censured sanford after lying about his affair and covert trip to argentina to visit his paramour maria belen chapur while he was governor sanford then succeeded now sen tim scott r s c in the house a position he held previously for six years there was a little bit of press for the ersatz swearing in of rep ron estes r kansas this spring to succeed cia director and former rep mike pompeo r kansas that s because democrats made the right leaning district somewhat competitive in hopes of stealing the seat but brace yourself for what will unfold when rep elect greg gianforte r mont arrives on capitol hill to be sworn in come early june the speaker s office hasn t yet set the date to swear in gianforte it s likely to be june 6 or 7 but reporters may well be staking out suite 1419 longworth vacated by interior secretary and former rep ryan zinke r mont now just to holler a few questions at gianforte one can only imagine how many cameras will cram into the speaker s ceremonial office for the mock swearing in to say nothing of those rubbering into the press gallery for the real thing how will lawmakers interact with gianforte will republicans shun him how jocular will house speaker paul ryan r wis be with gianforte compared to other special election winners what will gianforte say to the house will a din of applause and cheering swell in the house chamber once gianforte takes the oath will montana s two senators sens jon tester a democrat and steve daines republican appear for the ceremony the absence of either or both would be noticeable montana sends but a three person delegation to washington and gianforte will be the only house member how does gianforte comport himself after he s here does he deliberately fade from the public view it s hard to become a member of the invisible caucus on capitol hill when you ve done something as visible as gianforte gianforte is expected in court sometime in the next few days after the gallatin county montana sheriff s department issued a misdemeanor citation for body slamming reporter ben jacobs of the guardian don t think that democrats who are trying to put the house into play in 2018 won t notice with whom gianforte associates he apos sgoing tolearn very quickly that once you re a member it is a lot harder to run away from your partyor atough vote said a senior house democratic aide how will gianforte s relations with the press play out in 2014 then rep michael grimm r n y threatened to throw a new york tv reporter off a ledge in the cannon house office building i ll break you in half like a boy boasted grimm grimm later resigned and did time convicted of corruption charges gianforte never issued a threat he just upended jacobs ryan declared he wouldn t stand in the way of seating gianforte i m going to let them decide who they want he said it s not our choice but it is article i section 5 of the constitution grants both the house and senate the right to be the judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members there hasn t been a big brouhaha over seating a house member since 1984 85 democrats ignored the indiana election certification of republican rick mcintyre over rep frank mccloskey d ind in 1984 democrats refused to seat either candidate until a bipartisan task force investigated the matter months later the democrat controlled house decided mccloskey won the race by four votes gopers cried foul the house voted along party lines to seat mccloskey there s no active effort to oppose seating gianforte the house s code of conduct requires lawmakers to behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the house moreover the bylaws of the house ethics committee allows that panel to undertake an inquiry or investigation to probe a member s conduct the incident with jacobs unfolded prior to gianforte s membership in the house house rules and precedents limit the scope of a possible investigation to only when someone is a member the house has rules about barring members from sitting on committees or voting if they ve been convicted of a felony so far gianforte hasn t been convicted of anything and the charge is just a misdemeanor it s possible the quasi governmental office of congressional ethics oce could receive a complaint from a member of the public to probe gianforte but the oce may encounter the same problems as the formal ethics committee since gianforte s alleged transgression happened prior to his congressional service freshmen house members always face the challenge of standing out from their colleagues it s even tougher for special election winners it s hard enough to distinguish yourself from a pack of 434 other people gianforte won t suffer from that problem and he ll be a lot more than just a face in the crowd get all the stories you need to know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your
