 in 2009 the washington post randozens of stories on the burning issue of bob mcdonnell s grad school thesis week after week post reporters and editors cranked out investigatory pieces on the academic paper thevirginia gop gubernatorial nominee penned back in 1989 which touched on issues such as women in the workplace and same sex marriage democrats piled on making the thesis a central element of their campaign mcdonnell ended up winning ablowout victory despite the post s obsessivecrusade his subsequent public corruption conviction has been thrown out and it was announced this week that he willnot be retried today the same publication that engineered flood the zone coverage of a decades old masters thesis and that famously blew the lid offthe red hot scoop that rick perry s family had hunted at a ranch where a racially inflammatory word was painted on a rock in the early 1980 s is scolding the media for focusing too much attention on hillary clinton s email scandal that would be the same ongoing scandal about which one of the mostdevastating exposes was researched and printed by none other than thewashington post in march but now such scrutiny is givingwapo s liberal editorial board the vapors this is truly pathetic and bordering on disgraceful again this harangue comes from the editors of a newspaper who devoted enormous amounts of reporting resources and column inches to beating the drum on a graduate school paper thata candidate for governor had written decades ago yetthey cannot abide the supposedly disproportionateattention paid to the egregiously reckless veryrecent conduct of a secretary of state who is now seeking the presidency their whitewash of the seriousness of the issue is embarrassing mrs clinton s misconduct goes far beyond cavalier record keeping she set up an entireunsecure private server which colin powell emphaticallydid not despite the editors cynicaleffort to draw a falseequivalence to his actions on which sheimproperly conducted all official business she thendeleted thousands of work related emails that were wrongly withheld from a federal court ordered document release as her team began permanently scrubbing her email archives shortlyafter the existence of the server was firstmade public while elements of said archive were under active congressional subpoena she had sworn under penalty of perjury that every official email had been produced not even close the post says that a small amountof classified material moved across her private server setting aside hertotally false public insistence that her server contained zero classified material whatsoever it turns out thatmore than 2 000 classified emails had in factpassed through her system including many that weretop secret and above at the time they were sent and received some messages remainso sensitive to national security that the state department refuses to release even redacted versions of them in contrast with another oft repeated clinton claim there is evidence that her serverwas breached by an outside actor and everyone from the fbi director to the former secretary of defense to the former acting director of the cia agree it shighly likely that hostile foreign powers like china russia and iran had full access to the reams of classified information in hershockingly under protected emails no evidence that national security was harmed the post sniffs repeating the not obviously marked canard thathas beenobliterated from multiple angles this is all just a minor email scandal they sigh begging the media to stop asking so many questions about her scheme one would think that at the very least journalists collectiveinterest would be piqued by a presidential candidate who hasbrazenly and verifiably lied about almostevery single element of this controversy latching on to new and sometimescontradictory spin as previous explanations are knocked down by the facts not in the washington post s editorial conference room no sir they re

most experienced andcompetent person ever to seek the office her email scandal new revelations about which havebeen painstakinglydragged out from behind the clintons stonewall over many months via lawsuits and court orders demonstrates that clinton is at best stunningly incompetent andunconcerned with her solemnduties to safeguard state secrets it has also helpedexpose her habitual willingness to lie openly to the american people and to dodge press conferences for hundreds of days at a time the washington post s editors look at all of this and become furious not with her of course but with those benighted miscreants who think her pattern of behaviormight represent a threshold ordisqualifyingflaw for someone who now wants access to the deepest secrets on the planet it s time to get over
