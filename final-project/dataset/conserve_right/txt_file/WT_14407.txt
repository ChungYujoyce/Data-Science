elections ballots firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the letter singles out xinjiang s top official chen quanguo accused by many of turning the region into a police surveillance state and implementing a system of internment camps also known as re education centers where members of the uighur wee gur and other muslim minorities are locked up for months without trial the detention of as many as a million or more uighurs and other predominantly muslim ethnic minorities in political reeducation center or camps requires a tough targeted and global response the letter said former detainees who spoke to the associated press described the internment camps as facilities policed by
