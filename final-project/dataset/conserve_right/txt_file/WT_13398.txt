apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap when in asia make sure handshakes aren t too long or short don t bobble names or titles stifle the critical tweets don t question the food these points of etiquette and protocol are part of the region s core culture known as face keeping yours helping others save theirs in many ways they are the opposite of president donald trump s impulsive in your face style and he s not expected to soften it even in the shadow of north korea with whom he s rattled sabers about fire and fury and nuclear war the president will use whatever language he wants to use national security adviser h r mcmaster told reporters thursday on the eve of trump s 12 day tour through south korea china vietnam and the philippines i don t think the president really modulates his language have you noticed top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 so much for the prospects of trump and the finer points of protocol during the trip on which he ll be toting a hefty economic and national security agenda but he ll have a squad of white house and state department officials guiding the way on other more logistical matters in the ancient discipline of choreographing everything from how a room is set up to who stands where and avoiding embarrassments one of the things with protocol is obviously to do no harm sean p lawler trump s nominee to be to be u s chief of protocol said wednesday before the senate committee considering his confirmation as the director of visits and diplomacy for the national security council he will accompany trump on the trip we are the bridge said capricia marshall president barack obama s chief of protocol from 2009 to 2013 protocol experts say american informality frequently gets lost in translation in the traditional cultures trump will be visiting on wednesday trump showed signs of understanding the sensitivity even as he complained during a cabinet meeting about bad trade deals and deficits including with china trump was restrained i don t want to embarrass anybody four days before i land in china trump said before adding but it s horrible among the challenges trump faces as he heads to asia are the complexities of the asian face a concept that s foreign to many americans but lies at the foundation of societies across the region generally it means making sure behavior posture gestures remarks and more do not spark strong negative emotions in others or oneself so for example trump s 19 seconds of shaking patting and yanking the hand of japan s leader at the white house in february crossed all kinds of cultural lines prime minister shinzo abe responded with an on camera eye roll as trump looked away trump is playing golf with abe during the trip according to white house officials names and titles are important in asia in july the trump white house issued a news release that called chinese president xi jinping the leader of the republic of china xi is the president of the people s republic of china taiwan calls itself the republic of china china said it received an apology from the u s then there s trump s fondness for using twitter to respond to comments he doesn t like bing bing bing as he told fox business network this month in asia doing that in real time could offend the region s cultural aversion to confrontation i think you will find that they are very sensitive to slights said georgetown university professor dennis wilder who formerly served on the national security council he cautions trump against any kind of tweeting that would criticize the leader of a country he s visiting i think this can go well but he just needs to understand that face in east asian cultures is terribly important and he needs to make sure that he gives face to the other leaders particularly in china a breach of protocol can affect the content of the meeting according to peter selfridge the most recent holder of the chief of protocol post from 2013 to trump s inauguration in january the chinese appreciate precision when it comes to formal diplomatic engagements said selfridge americans certainly welcome this as well but are perhaps more accepting of improvisation and can even use it to their advantage trump wouldn t be the first u s leader to commit a protocol faux pas in asia in 2014 local bloggers huffed that obama looked like an idler or a rapper when he turned down a chauffeured ride to the asia pacific economic conference in beijing and arrived in his own more secure presidential limo and was chewing gum as he was known to do to fight nicotine cravings trump might consider advice from his predecessors if he finds he is served something other than his favorite steak with ketchup richard nixon the first president to open the diplomatic door to china advised ronald reagan on a 1984 trip there don t ask about the food just swallow it still i had difficulty identifying several items on my plate that first night reagan wrote in his memoirs so i stirred them
