not yet on a ventilator but was moved to intensive care to be near one if needed some medical experts forecasting this course of action is now very likely two thirds of patients in intensive care with coronavirus are sedated and put on a ventilator within 24 hours of arriving as the illness attacks their lungs but last night one doctor told the times mr johnson was conscious and had not been intubated the process of putting a tube in the windpipe to aid breathing he was said to have required around four litres of oxygen rather than the 15 litres used by an average covid 19 icu patient

government business will continue and said there is a strong team spirit rallying around the leader he also reassured that the premier was receiving excellent care and thanked the nhs staff who were treating him and other patients across britain mr johnson s handing of power to mr raab the second most senior cabinet minister after the pm himself came after days of insisting he remained in the driving seat of the uk s fightback against the virus but on sunday the tenth day of isolation in his number 11 flat mr johnson s declining health became clear to cabinet colleagues during a 10am zoom video conference call during the 45 minute meeting with ministers including michael gove rishi sunak and matt hancock insiders described the pm as pale and strained while some detectedbreathlessness as he spoke a number 10 spokeswoman said last night since sunday evening the prime minister has been under the care of doctors at st thomas hospital in london after being admitted with persistent symptoms of coronavirus over the course of this afternoon the condition of the prime minister has worsened and on the advice of his medical team he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the

hard work and dedication downing street has been accused of downplaying the seriousness of mr johnson s illness when he was admitted to hospital on sunday night number 10 made clear he was undergoing tests as a precaution on the advice of his doctor buta tory source said no 10 tried to play this down but think it through the prime minister was being taken to hospital in his car at 8pm on sunday the precise moment the queen was making her broadcast to the nation it therefore cannot have been completely routine insiders on the sunday zoom cabinet call also claimed it was clear mr johnson was not well a senior whitehall source said his symptoms were persisting he was plainly not getting any better in fact he d got worse determined to emulate the grit of his political hero winston churchill insiders said mr johnson was reluctant to go to hospital a source said do not underestimate the macho nature of the westminster political establishment boris will not have wanted to look weak however he eventually gave ground to his doctor and travelled to st thomas with bodyguards on sunday night there can be a time lag of more than three weeks between someone becoming infected with coronavirus and dying symptoms take days if not weeks to become life threatening the death has to be recorded and reported and the family notified in a process that takes days it was the first time mr johnson was believed to have left downing street since thursday when he stood on the steps of number 11 to applaud nhs workers at 8pm this was the last time the pm has been seen in public and came amid whisperings in westminster that he was not as well as aides were claiming as early as thursday a bed was being prepared for mr johnson at st thomas a source told the guardian the next day wearing an open collar shirt and looking exhausted the pm used a twitter video to reveal he had failed to shake off his high temperature and so would continue to self isolate while still keeping a firm hand on the tiller mr raab is now primed to take charge of the government s coronavirus response and deputise for mr johnson where necessary although it is understood he will not be a temporary pm at yesterday s downing street press briefing he confirmed a further 439 coronavirus deaths taking the toll to 5 373 while the number of patients rose by 3 802 to 51 608 st thomas hospital on the banks of the thames in london where boris johnson was last night moved into intensive care police remained stationed outside st thomas last night as prime minister boris johnson was treated inside for coronavirus mr raab also first secretary of state is primed to take charge of the government s coronavirus response but it is understood he is not a temporary prime minister pictured at today s no 10

incapacitated by illness while serving at the helm david lloyd george lloyd george served as prime minister from 1916 to 1922 in september 1918 he developed a sore throat after visiting manchester s albert square and mingling in crowds during a ceremony for soldiers and munitions workers it later became clear he had spanish influenza he spent 11 days inside and was hooked up to a ventilator harold wilson wilson served as prime minister from 1964 to 1970 and from 1974 to 1976 during his second term in office from 1974 to 1976 he suffered from colon cancer it was also suggested that he had suffered from alzheimer s after doctors analysed his speech patterns during his previous addresses winston churchill churchill served as prime minister from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955 his personal physician claimed he suffered from clinical depression throughout his time as prime minister in 1941 he suffered a heart attack at the white house and contracted pneumonia a few years

told the andrew marr show that this had made it difficult for him over the years he said i feel that i have done everything to show people that i can do the job even with the handicap that i ve had as a result of a rugby injury theresa may may served as prime minster from 2016 2019 in 2012 she visited the doctor because she thought she had bronchitis but was actually diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes health experts tonight appeared unanimous in their view that the pm s admission to intensive care means he is extremely sick but the four litres of oxygen which the times reports were given to mr johnson is below the 15 litre threshold for typical intensive care patients suggesting he is not as ill as most in icus world leaders and politicians around the globe rallied around mr johnson who received well wishers from david cameron emmanuel macron and donald trump japan s prime minister shinzo abe has sent a tweet saying his thoughts and prayers are with mr johnson this morning he said to my dear friend borisjohnson my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family as you fight for a swift recovery the people of japan stand with the british people at this difficult time the queen has also been kept informed by downing street about mr johnson s condition buckingham palace said mr raab last night vowed to keep the machines of government firing on all cylinders while the pm recovered the one time tory leadership contender said the prime minister is in safe hands with that brilliant team at st thomas hospital and the focus of the government will continue to be on making sure that the prime minister s direction all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and can pull the country through this challenge will be taken forward he added there s an incredibly strong team spirit behind the prime minister and making sure that we get all of the plans the prime minister s instructed us to deliver to get them implemented as soon as possible and that s the way it will bring the whole country through the coronavirus challenge that we face right now senior doctors branded the pm s admission to intensive care a huge concern and underscores how indiscriminate the virus is dr simon clarke a professor on cellular microbiology at reading university told sky news the nhs particularly in this moment doesn t give up intensive care beds just for people to be looked over it doesn t work that way even for pms he wouldn t be in intensive care unless he needed to be in intensive care especially not at this time he added it is probably about time that the press people in no10 started levelling with us about what his condition really is downing street sources confirmed mr johnson is not yet on a ventilator although medical experts forecast this course of action is very likely prof derek hill professor of medical imaging university college london said as often happens with covid 19 his condition has now deteriorated so he has been admitted to intensive care where he is very likely to have been put on a mechanical ventilator to breath for him he added one of the features of covid 19 in all countries seems to be that many more men become seriously ill than women especially in the over 40 age group also we know that people under about 60 seem to have a higher chance of making a recovery from critical illness with covid 19 than older people but there is no doubt this turn of events means boris johnson is extremely sick mr raab who tonight vowed to keep the machine of government ticking during the pm s recovery the prime minister was transferred to the icu at st thomas hospital in london at 7pm this evening armed police patrol st thomas hospital where the pm is in intensive care politicians of all stripes rallied around mr johnson including from ex prime minister david cameron and french president emmanuel macron professor chris whitty england s chief medical officer played down the prospects of a swift lifting of the coronavirus lockdown today professor chris whitty said that discussions about moving on to the next stage of the response to the pandemic would be premature until the nation has passed the peak number of deaths he downplayed reports that this figure could be reached this weekend as he returned to fronting the daily news conference following a week in self isolation flanking foreign secretary dominic raab he also warned people not to expect too much too soon from antibody tests that could give those who have had coronavirus and built up immunity a way to return to normal life he said the key thing is to get to the point where we are confident we have reached the peak and this is now beyond the peak and at that point i think it is possible to have a serious discussion about all the things we need to do step by step to move to the next phase of managing this but i think to start having that discussion until we re confident that that s where we ve got to would i think be a mistake mr johnson s pregnant fianc e carrie symonds who is due in the early summer is self isolating in her own camberwell apartment with the couple s dog dilyn after symptoms surfaced the 32 year old said on saturday i ve spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of coronavirus i haven t needed to be tested and after seven days of rest i feel stronger and i m on the mend politicians of all stripes rallied around mr johnson including from ex prime minister david cameron and french president emmanuel macron scotland first minister nicola sturgeon tweeted my thoughts are with the pm and his family sending him every good wish business minister nadim zahawi tweeted thoughts prayers for boris johnson carrie symonds and their family i have known boris for 20 years he is a fighter and will beat this virus chancellor rishi sunak tweeted my thoughts tonight are with boris johnson and carrie symonds i know he ll be getting the best care possible and will come out of this even stronger members of the newly formed shadow cabinet offered their support for the pm shadow justice secretary david lammy tweeted awful news my very best wishes to the prime minister as well as his partner carrie family and friends get well soon boris johnson mr johnson fell ill with the virus on the same day as health secretary matt hancock who has since recovered alarm bells started ringing that the nerve centre of the government s crisis response had been compromised when chief medical officer professor chris whitty and top downing street adviser dominic cummings also began showing symptoms meetings have since taken place via videolink why did mr johnson first go to hospital he was admitted to st thomas in london at around 8pm on sunday ten days after testing positive doctors advised him to seek treatment as his persistent symptoms including a cough and a temperature had not improved his slow recovery is a red flag for complications including pneumonia no 10 said it was a precautionary step so mr johnson could have routine tests which are likely to include procedures which can only be done in hospital what happens in intensive care downing street said the prime minister remained conscious last night and was moved to intensive care should he require ventilation there are two types of ventilators used non invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation non invasive ventilation means the patient stays conscious and is given a specialised mask which pumps air at high pressure into the lungs these are called continuous positive airway pressure machines if this does not work patients are intubated have a tube put down their throat into their airway and placed on an invasive ventilator they have to be placed in a drug induced coma and paralysed while the mechanical ventilator takes over their breathing icu ventilators have built in sensors to adjust the amount of oxygen the patient needs how common is it to be hospitalised and how high risk is he the prime minister 55 is one of 17 911 people to have been admitted to an nhs hospital with coronavirus so far latest research estimates between five and ten per cent of those who get the virus end up in hospital the older you are the more likely you are to need hospital treatment a study found that eight per cent of people in their 50s with the virus need hospital treatment and 0 6 per cent die mr johnson has no known underlying health conditions but he has struggled with his weight and in december 2018 revealed that he weighed 16 and a half stone obesity is a risk factor for complications and men are more likely to be hospitalised than women how long could he stay in intensive care some patients spend just a day there before recovering and going to a general ward others have spent more than three weeks in intensive care units what initial tests and treatment did he have and why coronavirus is a respiratory disease so initial tests will have focused on establishing how badly his lungs were damaged most patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus have difficulty breathing and get oxygen support mr johnson s oxygen saturation levels will have been monitored by a sensor clipped to a fingertip doctors will also have scanned his lungs other tests establish if major organs have been affected by a lack of oxygen this includes an ecg and blood tests for the liver and kidneys patients have their white blood cell counts monitored to show immune response his move to icu suggests these key measures most importantly oxygen levels were continuing to deteriorate yesterday what treatment could he receive the highest level is mechanical ventilation which requires patients to be fully sedated there are no established drugs for coronavirus and antibiotics do not work on viruses could continuing to work make it worse the prime minister did not take any time off and vowed to continue leading the government from his hospital bed but this went against nhs advice urging those with coronavirus to get plenty of rest and sleep exhaustion is a common symptom of coronavirus previous studies have shown that a lack of sleep and high stress can suppress the immune system boris johnson s coronavirus journey just four weeks on from shaking hands with everyone in sight the prime minister finds himself in isolation receiving oxygen treatment while struggling to shake off illness by david wilcock whitehall correspondent and james tapsfield political editor for mailonline a month ago boris johnson appeared to be on a mission to shake hands he locked paws with

not an emergency admission and the premier remains in control of the government s response despite staying in hospital with no clear timeframe for being discharged this evening no10 announced that the prime minister had been admitted to intensive care there are warnings from ministers that mr johnson has risked his health by keeping up a frantic workrate while one senior tory said he must learn he is not indispensable and has to rest but it marks a fast turnaround in the pm s personal situation and sets out how his initial softly softly common sense approach to the pandemic mainly focused on

coronavirus death lag explained how it can take three weeks between catching the disease and being hospitalised and three days for the nhs to record the fatality by connor boyd health reporter for mailonline the rate ofcoronavirus infections is starting to slow in the uk figures suggest but it could take weeks before death rates fall this is because there can be more than a three week lag between the time someone is diagnosed with the virus their symptoms become deadly and the death is recorded the number of people dying in hospital with coronavirus is still doublingevery three and a half days despite confirmed cases and hospitalisations are slowing down scientists say the death rate will also fall butthey warn britain could still suffer a record high number of casualties in the coming days due to the lag it takes several days for a coronavirus patient to develop symptoms and as long as a fortnight for the infection to become a life threatening illness there can be a time lag of more than three weeks between someone becoming infected with coronavirus and dying symptoms take days if not weeks to become life threatening the death has to be recorded and reported and the family notified in a process that takes days if the patient succumbs to the illness the death has to be recorded and reported and the family notified this process that can take up to three days the reporting delay means that once the uk has passed the peak of the outbreak it may take several days for the death rate to reflect this the uk today announced 3 802 new positive coronavirus tests 2 101 fewer than 5 903 yesterday and only the second time since march that the number has been below 4 000 the number of new cases is also lower than it was for almost all of last week suggesting the draconian social restrictions are working more than 51 000 people have now been diagnosed with the infection in the uk officials also declared 439 more deaths taking the total to 5 373 the number of people dying of covid 19 has now fallen for two days in a row and today dropped 30 per cent from 621 yesterday today s death count is the lowest since march 31 last tuesday when it was 381 and marks a 39 per cent fall from the uk s worst day so far saturday when the deaths of 708 people were recorded falling figures may be a reason to be cheerful but experts have warned against pinning too much significance to day by day numbers statistics recorded on sundays and published on mondays have since the outbreak in the uk began been routinely followed by an upward surge on tuesday last monday s figure was 13 per cent lower than sunday s over the past three weeks the number of new deaths reported has been doubling every three and a half days scientists expect this to continue nhs england revealed 403 more deaths have been recorded in its hospitals among people aged between 35 and 106 all but 15 of them had other health problems scotland which was the first to declare new cases today noted 255 new positive tests and just four new deaths taking its totals to 222 and 3 961 wales declared a further 302 cases and 27 more deaths meaning it has now had 3 499 positive tests and 193 people have died the majority of the deaths happened in london again with a total of 129 followed by 75 in the midlands 67 in the north east and yorkshire 44 in the east of england 43 in the north west 27 in the south west and 18 in the south east hopes are rising across europe now that governments drastic lockdown measures are working italy yesterday recorded its lowest one day death toll in two weeks since march 20 with 525 fatalities announced spain today revealed its fewest deaths in a day since march 24 637 and germany announced its lowest number in a week 92 the tumbling figures if they carry on show that strict government policies telling people to remain at home unless necessary are stopping the virus from spreading and some countries in europe have already started to draw up plans for their exits from lockdown with austria setting targets to start reopening businesses after the easter weekend austria today became the first country to set out detailed plans for ending the standstill with smaller shops re opening on april 14 and larger ones on may 1 denmark also plans to start lifting restrictions after easter but wants people to work in a more staggered way to avoid crowding into trains and buses meanwhile germany is willing to re open schools on a regional basis and allow a limited number of people into restaurants if the infection rate stays sufficiently low there have been more than 100 000 cases diagnosed in germany in italy which has been under lockdown longer than any other european country officials are talking about a phase two where society learns to live with the virus by wearing masks and carrying out more tests italy and germany are among the countries looking at smartphone tracking which could allow them to jump on new outbreaks without sending everyone back inside all of those countries along with spain have seen signs of improvement in their recent figures which offer hope that the crisis is past its peak that moment is still to come for britain and america which are bracing for one of their bleakest weeks however health officials across europe warn that life cannot go back from 0 to 100 immediately and many lockdown measures will remain in place for several more weeks at least italy is openly talking about a phase two in which society will have to create the conditions to live with the virus until a vaccine is developed health minister roberto speranza says more testing and a beefed up local health system would be necessary to allow an easing of the lockdown he said social distancing would have to remain in place with more widespread use of personal protective equipment such as face masks testing and contact tracing would be extended including with the use of smartphone apps in order to contain new outbreaks a network of hospitals would also be set up which are specifically dedicated to virus patients after doctors on existing wards described having to make life or death decisions over access to intensive care there are difficult months ahead our task is to create the conditions to live with the virus at least until a vaccine is developed the health minister told la repubblica newspaper the national lockdown strictly limiting people s movements and freezing all non essential economic activity will officially last until at least april 13 but it is widely expected to be extended dominic raab takes the reins foreign secretary is called on to deputise for stricken pm boris johnson while he is in intensive care boris johnson tonight effectively handed the reins of government to dominic raab as he battles coronavirus in intensive care downing street said the pm had deputised the foreign secretary who as first secretary of state is officially the second highest ranking minister before his condition became more serious however mr johnson has not resigned and so continues to be the formal leader of the government the uk does not have a written constitution and the chain of command is largely based on convention since the end of the tory lib dem coalition in 2015 there has not been a deputy pm instead mr cameron theresa may and now mr johnson appointed first secretaries of state to denote who was second in line downing street is said to have drawn up plans to ensure the continuation of government in all circumstances but details have not been divulged publicly it is not immediately clear what would happen if mr raab also became incapacitated with the uk not having a formal system of succession like other countries for example the us in a twitter video posted on friday from quarantine in no11 where he has been in self isolation an exhausted looking mr johnson revealed he was still suffering from a high temperature the prime minster deputised dominic raab as he was admitted to intensive care tonight police officers are seen today outside st thomas hospital in london a short distance from downing street after mr johnson was admitted for tests on sunday dominic raab a karate black belt is married without any children to erika together a brazilian born marketing executive mr raab s status as the person waiting in the wings reportedly sparked furious rows within the government a fortnight ago with other ministers adamant michael gove the minister for the cabinet office should be the one to take over the mp for esher and walton worked as an in

in 1938 to britain as a refugee before the second world war helped bring war criminals to justice in the hague during his first stint in the foreign office mr raab is a karate black belt and former boxing blue at oxford university in 1995 the 45 year old is married without any children to erika a brazilian born marketing executive who was wheeled out for photoshoots in his leadership campaign he has described how his father peter fled the nazis and came to britain aged six his father learned english worked for m s as a food manager and met his mother jean who was from bromley kent he died when dominic was 12 after losing his battle with cancer the appointment to foreign secretary was a major promotion for mr raab who up to then had just four months experience in the cabinet after a stint as brexit secretary last year last summer he stood in the tory leadership race on a hardcore brexiteer ticket even harder than mr johnson but after being knocked out he quickly backed his former rival and supported him in his campaign but number 10 is likely to face intense pressure in the coming days to set out exactly what would happen if mr johnson and other senior ministers can no longer work if mr johnson could no longer carry on in post and resigned the cabinet would in the first instance choose a successor they would need to carry the support of the conservative mps although it is unlikely anyone would force a leadership contest at a time of massive crisis at the weekend it was revealed that two of the most senior ministers leading the government response to the coronavirus crisis are locked in battle over when to lift the economically devastating lockdown chancellor rishi sunak has made robust representations to health secretary matt hancock arguing that unless a path is mapped now for a swift return to normal economic activity it could cause lasting damage to the country government critics of mr hancock argue his careerist fear of being personally blamed for a collapse in the nhs is blinding him to the dangers of a protracted lockdown but allies of mr hancock hit back saying he is just doing his job which is to protect the nhs one mp suggested that the pm was too keen to emulate his hero winston churchill and should rest but downing street described last night s shock move as a precautionary step insisting that he continued to lead the government and remained in touch with ministers and senior officials communities secretary robert jenrick stressed it was not an emergency admission and that he expected him to be back in downing street shortly he s been working extremely hard leading the government and being constantly updated he told bbc breakfast that s going to continue obviously today he s in hospital having the tests but he will continue to be kept informed as to what s happening and to be in charge of the government cop presses knee on man s neck until he s motionless woman calls cops on black man after he asks her to put dog on leash

somebody like boris who wants to be hands on running the government from the front but nonetheless he s still very much in charge of the government in a twitter video posted on friday from quarantine in no11 where he has been in self isolation an exhausted looking mr johnson revealed he was still suffering from a high temperature experts say there is a risk of pneumonia when a temperature lasts more than a week there have been claims mr johnson has been coughing heavily during conference calls the uk has four great offices of state prime minister chancellor of the exchequer foreign secretary and home secretary but beyond that there is no public plan on the line of succession should the pm be struck down the us is one of a number of countries which has such a plan if the president cannot work the vice president takes over and so on down a long list of government figures the us also has a designated survivor someone in the line of succession who is told to stay away from major events like inaugurations and state of the union addresses in case something bad happens and they can then step in as commander in chief successive prime ministers have resisted calls to formally set out succession plans because of the message they fear it would convey to the public and because of the damage it could do to their political standing but there have been repeated attempts by backbench mps to pass a law formalising the succession issue mr raab mr gove chancellor rishi sunak and health secretary matt hancock are widely seen as the most important ministers in the government at the moment in terms of combating coronavirus each chairs a committee coordinating different parts of the government s response to the crisis mr gove s is focused on public sector preparedness mr hancock s is

the prime minister was transferred to the icu at st thomas hospital in london at 7pm this evening 11 days after testing positive for the deadly disease he remains conscious and number 10 sources stressed he had been moved to the critical care unit as a precaution should he require a ventilator but mr johnson has asked foreign secretary dominic raab to deputise for him where necessary although it is understood mr raab will not formally become a temporary prime minister speaking tonight after the pm was moved to intensive care mr raab insisted that government business will continue and said there is a fantastic team spirit among ministers he also reassured that the premier was receiving excellent care and thanked the nhs medics who were treating him and other patients across britain the prime minister pictured on thursday evening who was admitted to st thomas hospital in london last night was taken to intensive care at 7pm this evening mr raab s role as first secretary of state the second most senior cabinet minister after the pm means he is primed to take charge of the government s coronavirus response at this critical period as cases approach the peak following the pm s hospitalisation last night on the advice of his doctor mr raab had already stepped up to chair this morning s daily meeting of top officials steering the nation through the health crisis and at this afternoon s downing street press briefing he confirmed a further 439 coronavirus deaths taking the toll to 5 373 while the number of patients rose by 3 802 to 51 608 mr johnson was still in charge during this press conference but his symptoms spiralled and he required oxygen prompting the move to critical care according to sky news health experts tonight appeared unanimous in their view that the pm s admission to intensive care means he is extremely sick what happens to coronavirus patients when they are admitted to intensive care british medics were clear last night boris johnson would not be in an intensive care unit unless he definitely needed to be the move marks a serious escalation in his treatment and will not have been taken lightly by his team of doctors at london s st thomas hospital the nhs particularly in this moment doesn t give up intensive care beds just for people to be looked over reading university s dr simon clarke said so what is in store for a patient battling coronavirus who requires icu treatment medical teams treating the most seriously ill patients will work one on one in the wards and have a host of equipment to measure every aspect of people s bodies from heartbeat and temperature to their exact blood oxygen level a key indicator in coronavirus deterioration police officers stand in front of emergency department outside st thomas hospital in london patients on an icu will be looked after closely by medics and will be connected to equipment by a number of tubes wires and cables there will normally be one nurse for every one or two patients patients equipment used includes a ventilator common among coronavirus patients monitoring equipment iv lines and pumps feeding tubes drains and catheters this equipment is used to monitor their health and support their bodily functions until they recover patients in an intensive care ward can often be sedated because some of the equipment used makes them uncomfortable intensive care units throughout the country have been put under immense strain by coronavirus such that they have stopped or restricted visits source nhs even within icu some patients will be better than others sources told the times last night that mr johnson had needed four litres of oxygen compared to 15l for some more desperately ill patients at one end of the spectrum those being treated will remain conscious and continuous positive airway pressure or cpap treatment is used with this patients are put in a hood or tightly fitting mask and oxygen is delivered at higher pressure to keep the airways open this is especially useful for people suffering pneumonia which sources denied was the case for mr johnson but at the other end of that spectrum mechanical ventilation will be necessary with the patient placed in a medically induced coma tubes will be placed into their windpipes to breath for them and their heart lungs and other organs will be constantly monitored drugs and fluids as needed will be dispensed derek hill professor of medical imaging at ucl said tonight a ventilator can be invasive involving a tube being put down the patient s throat or non invasive for example breathing through a specialised mask invasive ventilation tends to be recommended for covid 19 patients the ventilators which use sophisticated software and sensors to adjust the levels of oxygen required can be administered to a conscious or unconscious patient the prime minister may be put on an ecmo machine a highly specialised device that is more sophisticated than a ventilator st thomas is one of just six uk hospitals with a centre for adult ecmo extra corporeal membrane oxygenation the machines which take the blood out of the body to remove the carbon dioxide and replenish the oxygen are used on patients whose lungs are not working properly the treatment costs an average of 45 000 a head but makes recovery much easier because it allows the lungs time to heal cop presses knee on man s neck

said being on an intensive care ward even being in a private room would be frightening for a patient and could last days even if he is not hooked up to machines intensive care units can be overwhelming places for both patients and their loved ones although the highly transmissible nature of coronavirus means many hospitals have stopped or restricted visits mr raab also first secretary of state is primed to take charge of the government s coronavirus response but it is understood he is not a temporary prime minister pictured at today s no 10 press briefing ambulances outside at st thomas hospital in central london as prime minister boris johnson was moved to intensive care after his coronavirus symptoms worsened linda bauld a public health professor at the university of edinburgh said the admission of the prime minister to intensive care is of huge concern and illustrates just how indiscriminate this virus is anyone anywhere including the most privileged in our society can be affected and can become seriously ill it is imperative now more than ever that the rest of us comply with government guidelines to stay at home and not put others at risk all our thoughts will be with the prime minister and his family and the many other families who are facing similar circumstances with critically ill relatives st thomas is a major teaching hospital that specialises in critical care it is situated on the thames opposite the houses of parliament and has two intensive care units that house 19 permanent beds st thomas also specialises in heart and lung surgery obstetrics and gynaecology and children s medicine once a patient no longer requires intensive care they can begin what is often a long road towards a full recovery although sometimes there are lingering problems health experts say that as a general rule patients will need a week of convalescence for every week that they are in intensive care and they agreed tonight that the pm s admission to intensive care means he is extremely sick published by associated newspapers ltd part of the daily mail the mail on sunday metro media group
