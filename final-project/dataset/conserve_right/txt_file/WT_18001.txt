around the globe with the displacement of communities because of faith based persecution in 2013 the largest in recent memory the displaced include nearly all of syria s 160 000 christians driven from their ancient homeland by three years of civil war and 12 000 burmese muslims forced from their home by militant buddhist groups religious freedom is a human freedom and one that continues to be threatened around the world said secretary of state john f kerry monday as he presented the state department s international religious freedom report for 2013 top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time when 75 percent of the world s population still lives in countries that don t respect religious freedoms let me tell you we have a long journey ahead of us mr kerry said we have a long way to go when governments kill detain or torture people based on a religious belief last year was also a bloody one in the fight for religious freedom more than 400 shiite muslims were killed in pakistan while 80 christians died in a church bombing the report stated shiite muslims in egypt and saudi arabia were attacked along with christians and in eritrea more than 1 000 people were jailed because of their religious beliefs and for failing to belong to one of the country s four sanctioned faiths mr kerry said the central asian country of turkmenistan was added to the state department s list of countries of particular concern because of reports that people were being jailed beaten and tortured for their religious beliefs and the government had created laws prohibiting people from wearing religious clothing in public and distributing religious pamphlets see also chinese police tear down church cross in religion crackdown with this report i emphasize we are not arrogantly telling people what to believe mr kerry said we re not telling people how they have to live every day we re asking for the universal value of tolerance the ability of people to have a respect for their own individuality and their own choices we are asserting a universal principle for tolerance the report also shed a critical light on some countries that look the other way in terms of discrimination such as indonesia which was faulted for not adequately prosecut ing instances of violence abuse and discrimination against people based on their religious beliefs as well as nigeria for its failure to prevent violence related to the islamist boko haram anti semitism was also reported in belgium france germany hungary italy and the united kingdom the report does directly shine a light in a way that makes some countries even some of our friends uncomfortable mr kerry said but it does so in order to try to make progress mr kerry also introduced president obama s nominee for the position of ambassador at large for international religious freedom within the state department rabbi david saperstein rabbi saperstein is the director of the religious action center of reform judaism and if approved would be the first non christian to serve in the position encouraging signal in 1998 congress enacted the international religious freedom act which created the u s commission on international religious freedom and provided for the ambassador at large post in the state department mr saperstein was the first chairman of the religious freedom commission a position now held by katrina lantos swett ms swett called the nomination of her predecessor a very encouraging signal that the state department and administration wants to become more active advocating and really fighting for religious liberty ms swett said the report as a whole came as a good sign of progress including the department s decision to put turkmenistan on its cpc list however her commission was concerned that other offenders including pakistan and vietnam did not make the list in our view pakistan represents one of the worst situations in the world for religious freedom ms swett said pointing out the mob attack monday that killed two young girls and their grandmother who was a member of the ahmadiyya religious community rep christopher h smith new jersey republican and a leading capitol hill voice on human rights said that vietnam was glaringly absent from the list mr smith said the united states needs to become an advocate for human rights in china especially the right to religious liberty and use powers provided by the foreign terrorist organization designation of boko haram to investigate identify and punish those who provide support of all kinds to this group thomas f farr director of the religious freedom project at the berkley center for religion peace world affairs said the obama administration has too often failed to back its rhetoric with action when it comes to religious freedom while the degradation of religious freedom has not been caused by the administration he said this administration has said a lot but done virtually nothing to advance religious freedom one way to change this course mr farr said is for congress to confirm rabbi saperstein and then put the heat on the state department to deliver to this man what he needs to succeed including adequate resources and a status equal to his fellow ambassadors if we promote religious freedom successfully in our foreign policy we will be able to employ the reality that religious freedom can help in economic development it can sustain economic development and it is necessary for stable democracy mr farr said this administration has taught us that it s nothing but words until and unless they produce policy actions isaac six advocacy director for international christian concern called rabbi saperstein s nomination a good step but expressed his worry that the amount of pressure on the administration that had to be exerted before any action on this position took place is extremely disconcerting he said his organization s hope was that the nomination as well as the report would become a turning point for the united states and for the millions of persecuted individuals overseas as the administration and the state department take this opportunity to put international religious freedom back at the top
