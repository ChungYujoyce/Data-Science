tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn sen chris murphy of connecticut said the whistleblower who raised concerns about president trump s conversation with ukraine s new president should come forward so that congress can decide if punishment is in order mr murphy also said the white house s decision to release held up aid to ukraine as the whistleblower issue surfaced is incredibly suspicious mr trump says he didn t do anything wrong during a july 25 call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky though he appeared to suggest sunday he did bring up his democratic foe former vice president joseph r biden and possible corruption in ukraine involving mr biden s son hunter top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots mr murphy is among democrats who say the white house needs to let the acting director of national intelligence joseph maguire share the whistleblower s concerns with congress i think that if we do have the evidence from this whistleblower that the president indeed did try to bully a foreign power into affecting our elections then we have to do something about it mr murphy told nbc s meet the press mr trump released 250 million in u s aid to ukraine on sept 12 as capitol hill asked questions and as the whistleblower standoff began to surface the timing is obviously incredibly suspicious mr murphy said there was also a pending vote in the appropriations committee that was going to require next year s aid to be released outside of the discretion of the president there are likely a bunch of different explanations political pressure was mounting on the president from republicans but obviously the timing of this looks really terrible democrats are worried that mr trump held up 250 million in aid as part of a bid to dig up dirt on mr biden through his lawyer rudy giuliani the aid was eventually released sept 12 though ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky complained about the holdup during mr murphy s visit to kiev the government and zelensky was personally was really worried about these overtures he was getting from particularly from rudy giuliani and he didn t understand whether this was an official government position these requests to investigate the former vice president mr murphy said so i went here to make it clear to him that the worst thing that he could do for the u s ukraine relationship is to get involved in an election here in the united states he asked us what was going on with the aid why was it being withheld mr murphy said he seemed very concerned and out of sorts about it mr trump on sunday suggested the delay was related to his push to get other countries pony up a fair share for ukraine i backed ukraine from the beginning but i m very upset that other countries aren t doing the same mr trump said germany should be spending much more france all of the european union should be spending money why are we spending money and they re not or at least they re spending very little by comparison
