businessman again broke gop economic orthodoxy and one of his most prominent and earliest supporters said she would work to oust mr ryan from his post in an appearance on nbc s meet the press mr trump went beyond his disdain for free trade long a linchpin of conservative thought he also said he would be willing to raise taxes and that he favors increasing the minimum wage we have to negotiate the thing i m going to do is make sure the middle class gets good tax breaks for the wealthy frankly i think it s going to go up and it should go up he said in the interview which was recorded saturday and aired sunday see also donald trump says his statements about taxing the wealthy are being misrepresented also sunday former alaska gov and 2008 republican vice presidential candidate sarah palin announced on cnn s state of the union that she would support mr ryan s primary opponent businessman paul nehlen she said the speaker s political career is over because of his refusal to enthusiastically support mr trump the news highlights deep divisions in the republican party with many key gop figures reluctant to throw their support behind mr trump or in some cases vowing to never vote for him mrs palin last year became one of the first high profile republicans to endorse mr trump she attacked mr ryan just days after the wisconsin republican said he couldn t yet endorse mr trump the two men are set to meet in washington this week see also donald trump people are misrepresenting what i said about renegotiating debt mrs palin told cnn on sunday that mr ryan faces the same political tidal wave that doomed eric cantor the house majority leader who lost his virginia republican primary race in 2014 to tea party favorite david brat i think paul ryan is soon to be cantored as in eric cantor his political career is over but for a miracle because he has so disrespected the will of the people for him to already come out and say who he will not support was not a wise decision of his mrs palin said i will do whatever i can for paul nehlen this man is a hardworking guy and is so in touch with the people she went on to call mr ryan the latest example of a conservative going to washington and selling out paul ryan and his ilk their problem is they have become so disconnected from the people whom they are elected to represent as evidenced by paul ryan s refusal to support the gop front runner she said their problem is they feel so threatened at this point that their power their prestige their purse will be adversely affected by the change that s coming with trump and someone like paul nehlen that they re not thinking straight right now aside from deep concerns many republicans have about mr trump s comments regarding women muslims and hispanics there are serious differences on policy mr trump has vehemently opposed many of the trade agreements congressional republicans have supported and he put tax increases on the table something congressional republicans are sure to oppose while mr trump vowed again that tax bills would be lowered for middle class families and small businesses under his administration he said nothing is set in stone i have no illusions i don t think that s going to the final plan he said when it comes time to negotiate i feel less concerned with the rich than i do with the middle class mr trump on sunday also seemed to leave open the door to raising the national minimum wage an idea he previously rejected it s also a proposal that republicans especially economic conservatives at all levels deeply oppose they argue that artificially raising the price of labor reduces demand and will cost jobs other things being equal the tycoon previously said that u s wages were too high but he acknowledged that he changed his mind and now thinks wages are too low sure it s a change i m allowed to change he said on abc s this week program i m going to bring companies back into this country and they re going to make a lot more than the 15 minimum wage proposed by democrats even mr trump said the national minimum wage of 7 25 an hour is too low though he added that states not the federal government should make the decision i don t know how people make it on 7 25 an hour he told meet the press on nbc now with that being said i would like to see an increase of some magnitude but i d rather leave it to the states let the states decide mr trump s willingness to raise taxes on wealthy americans and raise the minimum wage indicates that mr trump understands the anger and frustration many working class voters feel toward the so called 1 percent while mr trump says all of his proposals are open for negotiation there is a belief inside his campaign that his agenda should win out over mr ryan s based solely on the strong support he has received from republican voters this primary season let s make something very clear donald trump just won the republican primary he won it overwhelmingly so it s his agenda that has just been cemented as what the american people at least republicans and independents who voted for him want trump senior adviser paul manafort said on fox news sunday his agenda is the people s agenda mr ryan is open to backing mr trump but has made clear that the businessman will have to earn his support i hope to support his candidacy fully but right now at this point i m just not there mr ryan told cnn last week copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view comments click to hide terms of use privacy
