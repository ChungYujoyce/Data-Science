apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic after a month of u s pleading china and russia reluctantly agreed to more united nations sanctions punishing north korea for illegal nuclear and missile tests on jan 6 and feb 7 performed despite already being under u n sanctions for a decade since 2006 it s time for a paradigm shift in thinking about the threat from nuclear missile proliferation sanctions will not work because russia and china are helping north korea s nuclear missile program accelerating capabilities to threaten the united states a process that might be termed hyperproliferation top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey supposedly north korea has evolved crude scud missiles into much more sophisticated medium range nodong missiles intercontinental missiles and the unha 3 space rocket that orbits satellites this mainstream view sounds increasingly preposterous reportedly according to u s strategic command north korea s unha 3 which orbited their first satellite in 2012 is much more sophisticated than expected first stage debris fished out of the yellow sea after the december 2012 launch came with a surprise as it showed that the unha vehicle was more advanced than previously believed employing modern aluminum alloys and showing much thinner tank walls than expected also the first stage was outfitted with four vernier engines with a gimbal contrary to previous reports that showed the first stage to be stabilized through the use of simpler jet vanes north korea tries concealing the design of its missiles by launching out of schedule and during the february 2016 launch of unha 3 rigging the spent first stage to self destruct according to u s strategic command this highly sophisticated denial operation should be prohibitively risky for the supposedly primitive north koreans russia sold to north korea supposedly for scrap a dozen golf class missile submarines and a nuclear capable ss n 6 missile unthinkable a few years ago north korea is now developing a fleet of nuclear missile submarines russian generals told the congressional emp commission in 2004 that the design for russia s super emp weapon accidentally leaked to north korea that there had been brain drain of russian scientists to north korea and that the north could probably test a super emp warhead in a few years a prediction that apparently came true in 2006 a single super emp warhead could blackout north america for months or years and kill millions north korea s two satellites orbit on a trajectory identical to that planned for a soviet era secret weapon called the fractional orbital bombardment system north korea s ksm 3 and ksm 4 satellites like the russian fobs orbit on the optimum trajectory to make a surprise attack and at the optimum altitude to generate an emp field over the 48 contiguous united states north korea s transporter erector launcher tel for mobile nodong medium range missiles is the tel from russia s ss 20 missile banned by the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty according to military and security developments involving the democratic people s republic of north korea 2015 a recent defense department report north korea s tel for its kn 08 mobile intercontinental ballistic missile is from china the only nations in the world with mobile icbms are russia china and north korea not even the united states has mobile icbms mainstream thinking is that north korea and other nuclear missile aspirant nations rely on home grown capabilities to develop missiles and nuclear weapons consequently the mainstream consistently low balls nuclear missile threats for example most analysts estimate north korea has 10 to 20 crude a bombs based on the yongbyon nuclear reactor s plutonium production and assuming that backward north korea must have conservative bomb designs using 5 to 8 kilograms of plutonium in each weapon this ignores that north korea is known to have a clandestine nuclear weapons program probably mostly underground using uranium centrifuges and perhaps other technologies unknown to us the mainstream view also ignores that north korea is obviously getting help from russia and china if north korea has more sophisticated bomb designs using smaller amounts of plutonium for example some analysts estimate north korea could have over 100 nuclear weapons this estimate is consistent with north korea s nuclear test program which has conducted four overt nuclear tests with reportedly a fifth test planned is it really plausible if north korea has only 10 to 20 a bombs that they would expend on testing up to half their scarce weapons the mainstream underestimated the nuclear sophistication of north korea as recently as jan 6 when with few exceptions experts claimed north korea could not have tested an h bomb only a few reported on jan 28 that the department of defense changed its mind that new evidence indicated as headlined by cnn north korea might have tested components of a hydrogen bomb the mainstream doesn t like to talk about the fact that no plutonium or uranium a bomb fuels have been detected from north korean tests but traces of tritium h bomb fuel have been found some of the implications of hyperproliferation are that russia and china are part of the problem not part of the solution that hyperproliferation by these actors is a weapon in the new cold war and that we should
