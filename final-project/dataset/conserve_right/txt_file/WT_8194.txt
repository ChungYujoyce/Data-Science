stand with hong kong before it was deleted within hours as the chinese backlash grew was not about its substance rather he wrote it was his belief that the rockets executive did not consider the

others and i believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen could have waited a week to send it he wrote on twitter reynolds reported from miami ap sports writers kristie rieken in houston
