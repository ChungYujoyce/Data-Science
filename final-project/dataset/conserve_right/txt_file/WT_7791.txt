cop bad cop diplomacy his role has sharpened in the great power competition it s game on see also trump says china could have stopped coronavirus it got out of control but mr carafano said the president s strategy has always been making across the board military diplomatic economic challenges to beijing where they are impinging on vital u s interests that s how to you get to stable relationship the escalating feud with china also meshes with the president s campaign strategy of portraying presumptive democratic nominee joseph r biden as too soft on china it s a subject of the campaign s 10 million nationwide ad blitz against mr biden that began thursday and aides say the theme will be prominent through election day in a fundraising email to supporters on sunday the trump campaign said the fake news media and their corrupt democrat partners will defend sleepy joe until the end they don t care that he s in bed with china and wants to see america fail the american public s views of china have soured during covid 19 shutdowns the pew research center found last month that 66 of respondents had a negative opinion of china the highest percentage recorded since pew began asking the question in 2005 only 26 of americans had a favorable attitude there is a domestic component mr carafano said across the board americans rightfully blame the failures of the chinese communist party for the global pandemic outbreak on the policy side the administration is showing no signs of revoking the china trade deal that the president has been hammering out since the start of his presidency asked friday whether he is considering new tariffs against china or ripping up the trade deal mr trump replied brusquely i don t want to talk about it china is buying a lot of our products the president told reporters but the trade deal the ink was barely dry when this coronavirus came in from china so it s not like we re thrilled he told fox business that the 4 month old trade deal doesn t feel the same to me i m not happy with anything to do with that particular subject right now mr trump said during an interview with fox s maria bartiromo right now i don t want to speak to mr xi white house economic adviser larry kudlow said the trade deal is continuing absolutely he said trade negotiators from both sides including treasury secretary steven t mnuchin and u s trade representative robert lighthizer had successful phone calls last week while the trade talks proceed however mr trump is ratcheting up pressure on china on several fronts the commerce department moved

ability to halt exports to the world s second largest maker of smartphones sen ben sasse nebraska republican and a member of the senate select committee on intelligence said the rule was long overdue to prevent the chinese communist party s tech puppet from obtaining u s semiconductor technology the united states needs to strangle huawei mr sasse said modern wars are fought with semiconductors and we were letting huawei use our american designs this is pretty simple chip companies that depend on american technology can t jump into bed with the chinese communist party in response china s governnment controlled global times said beijing was ready to put u s companies on an unreliable entity list china is lashing out at american lawmakers who are trying to hold it accountable in u s courts for spreading the coronavirus according a global times report beijing is ready to hit back with its own sanctions the communist government is suggesting that china s massive economy could halt investments in states represented by those who attempt to assign blame at least four members of congress will be put on china s sanctions list said the global times citing sources close to the matter a number of lawmakers were named in the story but those who drew particular attention from the chinese press were sen tom cotton of arkansas josh hawley of missouri and rep chris smith of new jersey all republicans american congresspeople who hold an anti china stance like smith have been long term hawks on china relevant topics such as taiwan and xinjiang and republicans like hawley are also backed by some u s defense companies and other companies that compete with chinese firms diao daming a u s studies expert at the renmin university of china in beijing told the newspaper last week mr smith who last year authored the hong kong human rights and democracy act said he wouldn t bow to pressure sanctions will not silence me or anyone who demands genuine accountability for this horrific pandemic he said in a statement over the weekend he pointed to the death toll from covid 19 in new jersey beijing cannot continue to hide lie and now threaten to stop us from demanding the truth mr hawley took to twitter on friday to call the sanctions threat a badge of honor mr hawley is a former missouri attorney general his successor eric schmitt has filed a lawsuit arguing that the chinese communist party directed the policies that have failed the world allowing covid 19 to spread and devastate the global economy in missouri alone mr schmitt said in the lawsuit billions of dollars have been lost to the coronavirus outbreak the global times said china will take steps to punish missouri s economy the white house pressured the board that runs the retirement savings program for federal employees and military personnel last week to halt at least temporarily a plan to invest funds in chinese businesses the federal retirement thrift investment board voted unanimously to pause its plan to shift billions of dollars in retirement assets to an index fund that includes about 8 chinese companies citing the covid 19 pandemic and a new slate of board nominees from mr trump labor secretary eugene scalia sent a letter to the thrift savings plan s governing board saying that at the direction of president trump the board is to immediately halt all steps toward switching to the broader international stock market index mr kudlow and national security adviser robert c o brien also urged the board to cease implementation immediately they said the chinese government hid crucial information about the virus from the u s and the rest of the world these events dramatically increase the risk that chinese companies could be subject to sanctions or boycotts that jeopardize their business and profitability and strongly militate against the board making a significant investment of federal workers retirement funds in chinese companies at this time they wrote white house trade adviser peter navarro said saturday that there needs to be a broader discussion on hitting china for compensatory damages because of the way it handled the coronavirus outbreak i think there needs to be a national discussion has to be bipartisan about compensatory damages by a country that inflicted this pandemic on the world mr navarro said on fox business this crisis and china s role in virtually manufacturing this whole crisis we need to have a national discussion the coronavirus has infected more than 4 5 million people worldwide and contributed to the deaths of more than 300 000 the u s with a population of about 330 million has recorded nearly 1 5 million cases and more than 88 000 deaths from covid 19 it should have been stopped in china before it got out to the world 186 countries are affected mr trump said russia is now badly affected france is badly affected look at italy look at spain all of these great countries in many cases have had to fight through this it s a terrible thing that happened it should have been stopped right at the source but it wasn t white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany said mr trump is very frustrated with china she said china slow walked information through the world health organization about human to human transmissions of the virus as well as information about its genetic sequencing and allowed flights out of china while the virus was spreading these decisions put american lives at risk not just american lives but lives around the globe she said while the u s grows more aggressive in economic competition the administration is challenging chinese influence in international organizations such as who nato put the issue of china on its agenda for the first time at a meeting in london in december mr carafano said he expects a lot more on that front including more robust action toward beijing from the quad plus partners the u s japan india and australia expect the u s to do more not less with friends and allies he said the u s push on china in nato context is just one example as is the increased level of activity among the quad plus partners david sherfinski and gabriella mu o
