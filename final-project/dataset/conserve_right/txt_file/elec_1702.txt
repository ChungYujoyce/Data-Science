nbc s matt lauer asked democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton on wednesday at the commander in chief forum in new york directly whether she would use military force or renewed negotiations if irancheated on the nuclear deal the former secretary of state dodged the question claiming that the she would enforce it to the letter asserting that iran was not cheating and claiming that she was focused on iran s ballistic missile tests and its support for terrorism worldwide the reality is that iran is already cheating on the nuclear deal and the obama administration is allowing it to do so last week reports emerged that the u s and other negotiating partners had allowed iran secret exemptions from parts of the deal that it had not complied with iran s ongoing ballistic missile tests also arguably violate the versionof the deal that was passedby the un securitycouncil which called upon iran to cease those tests for eight years clinton has said nothing about that furthermore the 1 7 billion in cold hard cash that the obama administration paid to iran as part of a side deal to settle past claims over an arms agreement dating back to the era of the shah and which was used as ransom for four americans who were released by iran in january will likely be used to support terrorismthroughout the region the cash was delivered in aircraft connectedto the terror linked iranian revolutionary guard corps and was formally allocated to military uses if she were truly concerned about iran s involvement in terrorism clinton could have used the commander in chief forum to denounce those cash ransom payments which congress is already attempting to ban in future but she said nothing about it one point missed by both lauer and clinton is that iran could develop nuclear weapons bycomplying with the deal it slows but doesnot prevent nuclear enrichment even president obama admitted iran could eventually emerge as a nuclear power here via time is the transcript of the entire exchange on iran between lauer and clinton lauer i m going to jump in thank you very much for your question let me ask you about the iran nuclear deal it was signed under secretary kerry it was begun under you you started those talks clinton right i did lauer you have said you expect the iranians to cheat you think they ll buy time and perhaps stay along their course to building a nuclear weapon if they cheat secretary clinton will you have any course of action other than a military course of action would you enter into negotiations with again ph would you go back to economic sanctions knowing they cheated and are then closer to a nuclear weapon clinton matt look let me put this in context because this is one of the most important strategic questions we face when i became secretary of state the iranians were on a fast track to acquiring the material necessary to get a nuclear weapon that had happened the prior eight years they mastered the nuclear fuel cycle they built covert facilities they stocked them with centrifuges and they were moving forward what was our decision our decision was to try to put together an international coalition that included russia and china to exert the kind of pressure through sanctions that the united states alone could not do lauer right but you ve said that you think they re going to cheat clinton now wait let me look this is an important issue i know we re on tv and we don t have a lot of time lauer i want to get to a lot of questions clinton i will talk quickly but i want people to understand this so yes i put together the coalition we imposed the sanctions we got them to the negotiating table and after i left we got the agreement that agreement put a lid on their nuclear weapons program and imposed intrusive inspections i have said we are going to enforce it to the letter lauer do you think they re playing us clinton on the nuclear issue no i think we have enough insight into what they re doing to be able to say we have to distrust but verify what i am focused on is all the other malicious activities of the iranians ballistic missiles support for terrorists being involved in syria yemen and other places supporting hezbollah hamas but here s the difference matt i would rather as president be dealing with iran on all of those issues without having to worry as much about their racing for a nuclear weapon so we have made the world safer we just have to make sure it s enforced joel b pollak is senior editor at large at breitbart news his new book see no evil 19 hard truths the left can t handle is available from regnery through amazon follow him on twitter at joelpollak national securitypoliticsballistic missilescommander in chiefhillary clintoniran dealiranian revolutionary guard corpsmatt lauerransomterrorism please let us know if you re having issues with commenting copyright 2020 breitbart
