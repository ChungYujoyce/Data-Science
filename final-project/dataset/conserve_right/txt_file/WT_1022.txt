stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century passage of the usmca checks off a major campaign promise that mr trump made in 2016 at the time he railed against trade agreements that many viewed as stacked against american workers his deal rewrites the rules of the road for digital trade opens new markets to u s farmers and steers higher wages and production to domestic auto workers the house passed the deal in late december after months of wrangling over labor standards and ways to enforce the deal it was hard work and it took way too long but we did it the usmca is on its way to president trump s desk and final ratification said sen joni ernst iowa republican and chairman of the senate agriculture subcommittee on rural development and energy business groups said the deal will prop up markets for everything from petroleum to footwear while mr trump urged key constituencies to take notice the farmers are really happy with the new china trade deal and the soon to be signed deal with mexico and

senate minority leader charles e schumer was among nine democrats who voted against the deal he said it didn t do enough to address climate change the vote also split 2020 rivals for the democratic presidential nomination with sen bernard sanders of vermont who rails against corporation friendly deals and voted against nafta decades ago rejecting the deal while sens elizabeth warren of massachusetts and amy klobuchar of minnesota backed it sen pat toomey of pennsylvania was the only republican to vote no he s slammed the deal for weeks saying it will dampen free trade and raise the cost of automobiles for the first time in american history we re enacting a trade agreement that restricts free trade and reduces economic growth mr toomey said unlike its predecessor nafta usmca contains many protectionist provisions that are designed to reduce the exchange of goods between the united states and mexico replacing the 1994 north american trade agreement is one of mr trump s top priorities heading into the 2020 campaign season he s called nafta perhaps the worst trade deal ever made the administration finalized terms of the usmca with mexico and canada in late 2018 though democrats who swept into the house majority that year sat on the draft house democrats demanded concessions that would protect american workers from being undercut by mexican ones today the senate passed a usmca that has been transformed by democrats leadership for american workers american patients and the environment house speaker nancy pelosi said the flimsy enforcement proposed by the trump administration has been rewritten by democrats into the strongest enforcement mechanisms of any u s trade agreement democrats like sen ron wyden of oregon said it will be easier for workers to call out mexican factories that violate labor standards and get them inspected and resolved yet mr schumer and other democrats said the deal fell short in other areas instead of advancing global climate security by outlining binding and enforceable climate commitments from all three countries the trump administration provides significant incentives for manufacturers to move their business and their jobs from the u s to mexico where clean air and clean water regulations are much weaker mr schumer said he said democrats should be commended for fighting for workers but on the greatest issue facing our planet addressing the climate crisis t
