abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots reviewed by john r coyne jr on his last trip to china in 1993 margaret macmillan tells us richard nixon observed i will be known historically for two things watergate and the opening to china i don t mean to be pessimistic but watergate that silly silly thing is going to rank up there historically with what i did here and so it has as an aging generation of journalists and historians with axes to grind publish excerpts from the tapes reinforcing those stock caricatures of richard nixon those tapes said bob woodward are a gift that keeps giving they are and what they give primarily is another chance for nixon s critics to kick him around while ignoring or downplaying his considerable accomplishments however in among this spate of stereotyped nixon studies works are surfacing by a new generation of authors like ms macmillan both an accomplished historian paris 1919 and a superb writer free from those archetypical preconceptions it may also help that ms macmillan is canadian uninfected by some of our more virulent ideological biases ms macmillan speaks to the problem even historians who disapprove of psychohistory she writes find themselves tempted irresistibly when it comes to richard nixon critics she says attacking his rhetoric of peace speak of nixon s cynical attempt to conceal his own moral vacuum but says ms macmiillan that is wrong nixon did many immoral things in his life but he longed to be good in notes he wrote endlessly to himself on his favorite yellow legal pads he exhorted himself to provide moral leadership to be the national conscience of his country as bill gavin one of nixon s first and best writers put it he was a better man than he thought he was with quick strokes ms macmillan touches on nixon s strengths and weaknesses as she does with mao tse tung henry kissinger and chou en lai the lead players in the high drama of the first visit by an american president to china that visit beginning on feb 21 and ending on feb 28 1972 frames ms macmillan s book the emphasis throughout is on the interactions among the four principals with mini histories biographies and flashbacks sandwiched between meetings machinations and events of the week ms macmillan writes with wit grace and precision covering an extraordinary amount of material in tightly packed pages her set pieces are superb the banquet at the great hall of the people for instance where the people s liberation army band played turkey in the straw and oh susanna and a flushed nixon toasted communist functionaries individually apparently fueled by a particularly potent variety of chinese white lightning a performance that caused bill buckley to write a brilliantly scathing critque of nixon s behavior nor does ms macmillian neglect the quirks nixon s inability to make small talk for instance at the shanghai industrial exhibition nixon observed machinery could be dangerous sometimes when you push the button it does not turn out all right nixon looked up at the giant portraits of communist luminaries we don t see many pictures of engels in america he said occasionally it s too much tired and cranky being entertained by the courtly chou nixon always treats chou with great courtesy who calls his attention to pictures of chinese life nixon tried to ignore him but was eventually forced to look his smile grew strained then disappeared what the hell are you talking about he snapped interestingly although he found jiang qing the dreaded wife of mao unpleasantly abrasive and aggressive he apparently thoroughly enjoyed the red detachment of women the opera she made him sit through staff speculation was that the screaming relieved him of the need to make small talk in shanghai at the end of the extraordinary trip nixon made a final toast we have been here a week he said this was the week that changed the world and it did at the very least says ms macmillan the breakthrough of the 1970 s most would agree now was good for both countries and their new relationship had great potential which still remains to act as a stabilizing force in world politics for nixon and the americans she writes the visit was a bold and dramatic move that placed nixon himself in the center of great events and the united states as the pivotal power between china and the soviet union for the chinese the visit was an acknowledgment of china s importance in the world and marked the end to the isolation of the 1960s although the legacy of the cultural revolution was to lie heavily until mao s death the beginnings of the reawakening and revitalization of china after 1976 lie in this period it s now generally accepted that rapprochement between the united states and china was inevitable that as ms macmillan puts it the gap between 1979 and 1941 was an aberration that could not last nixon s visit occurred because both sides came to the conclusion at the same time it was a good idea yet it took individuals four men in this case to make it happen nixon and mao mr kissinger and chou two men who for all their faults possessed the necessary vision and determination and two men who had the talent the patience and the skill to make the vision a reality as for the particulars of that vision which were largely to shape and inform the subsequent shanghai communique ms macmillan writes a couple of days before he left washington nixon jotted down his key ideas on one of his ever present yellow legal pads what they want 1 build up their world credentials 2 taiwan 3 get u s out of asia what we want 1 indo china 2 communication to restrain chinese expansion in asia 3 in future reduce threat of confrontation by china super power what we both want 1 reduce danger of confrontation conflict 2 a more stable asia 3 a restraint on u s s r what did we get a new relationship with the mainland while maintaining support for taiwan the soviets were thrown badly off balance which was to prove lasting as for indochina mao did take some steps to discourage the north vietnamese and later nixon and mr kissinger would engineer a successful end to the war a result ultimately negated by watergate as a result of that week in 1972 there was a distinct shift in the global balance of power a rare and remarkable example of a statesmanlike vision successfully shaping reality and at that particular moment in history only richard nixon with mr kissinger could have carried it off in one of their conversations ms macmillan reports chou told mr kissinger of an old chinese proverb the helmsman who knows how to guide the boat will guide it well through the waves otherwise he will be submerged by the waves a far sighted man will know how to till the helm or adds ms macmillan as mr spock will say aboard his spaceship many centuries from now quoting an old vulcan proverb only nixon can go to china john r coyne jr a former white house speechwriter is co author with linda bridges of strictly right william f buckley jr and the american conservative
