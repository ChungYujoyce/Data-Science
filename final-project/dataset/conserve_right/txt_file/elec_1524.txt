for any reason at any time report abuses his campaign strategy going forward he s going to try real hard to not be a dumbass in public i thought that was trump s strategy if it is it s not working well to trump not being politically correct apparently means being a dumbass in public make libertarians less cynical so that more vote for him on second thought no that never happens let s not be so crazy as to think that us libertarians have that much of an impact on election voting i make up to 90 an hour working from my home my story is that i quit working at walmart to work online and with a little effort i easily bring in around 70h to 86h go to this website and click tech tab to start your work visit this web http tinyurl com hygs5jl nobody cares if gasy was president would he nominate any very against police judges on the supreme court why is gary playing with himself while talking to matt can we please stop already for the love of god isn t there real news to report i will use my body as click bait katy perry announces plans to release a video of herself naked in a bid to help change the world ahead of us elections http www dailymail co uk tvs tions html dude russell brand has been all up in that ewwwwwww she s tainted yes but still has an amazing rack orlando bloom recently attracted headlines when he was photographed paddle boarding in the nude during the couple s summer getaway wait perry s gay she kissed a girl and she liked it or so i ve heard brings new meaning to the term polling station or should i say poling station i mean definitely would but she s like the classic example of someone who s like a 6 or maybe maybe a 7 prior to her army of stylists going to work on her mind you 6 or 7 is more attractive than average just not like would shoot myself in the knee to get her number attractive is that it what the fuck elections are the billboards of our faith dear creature vital information trump is literally falling into the same trap he fell into with the khans with alicia machado is he constitutionally incapable of shutting his fucking mouth i don t know if you ve noticed but trump is deeply insecure and profoundly stupid neither of which is conducive to exercising the better part of valor i don t think he s stupid he is or at least has been extremely smart and savvy when it comes to maintaining his brand he understands and can play the media like few others he is however extremely insecure part of prepping for debates is having somebody attack your weaknesses in private before being attacked by the opposing candidate in public trump even if he read the policy books his team meticulously put together would not have been able to go through anybody attacking his record to his face even if this person was honest to god trying to help him this failure showed itself on monday night clinton was needling and setting traps for him and he fell into nearly every single one so you think his public persona is just shrewdly calculated to sound like he never knows what the fuck he s talking about if so he s playing a game in dimensions even obama can t perceive he s playing a game in dimensions even obama can t perceive 11 dimensional m theory chess of course he is playing a game but no the dimensions are what they always have been for decades if there are striking differences in the campaign styles compared to eight or sixteen years ago they are related to the present distribution of the public s anxieties and opinions anyway obama ran with the hopey dopey dorm room bull shit artist persona he caught the mood of enough voters and he did pretty well trump is running with the get er done hypomaniac persona and he is doing pretty well now but the purpose of the debate for him was to assure enough fence sitters that he is not dangerous he appears to have done that and so he won the debate by the way if you re not just being tendentious and if it really does come across to you as if he never knows what the fuck he s talking about you should ask yourself why that perception is not shared by almost everyone a good two fifths of those who respond to poll either disagree or think that not knowing what he s talking about is not so bad a trait under the circumstances i think he isn t stupid at least not completely stupid he does have his talents i m sure but he also doesn t seem to know what the fuck he is talking about half the time ignorance and stupidity are different things i didn t watch the shitshow last night but from the excerpts i ve heard it does sound kind of like he just went in unprepared i used to believe that he was secretly a genius and all this is just a clever ruse but after last night i m more inclined to go with penn jilette s appraisal that he really is dumb as a bag of hammers but aggressive and wealthy enough to just sort of bully bribe or bluff his way into what he wants plus he s surrounded by handlers and sycophants for whom he is a meal ticket that can get you pretty damn far he really is dumb as a bag of hammers but aggressive and wealthy enough to just sort of bully bribe or bluff his way into what he wants or maybe his entire campaign is to guarantee hillary s election i know this sounds like a conspiracy theory but the debate last night definitely seemed staged since neither of them showed any emotional reaction i think we shouldn t confuse smart or even clever with being able to say do something that makes the media get weak in the knees plane crashes do that much a billion bills trucks a ton of trifles ahhhh a guy in a yellow tie and blue jeans now there s a guy i can get behind he ll begin to turn the tide making sound 1 5 2 changes to how things are as a beginning to bringing about the libertarian paradise by 2075 the impending corrections in the next 3 5 years of 100 000 000 000 000 of economic misallocations when people very soon learn they are half at best as wealthy as they think they are a guy in a sport coat yellow tie and dungarees comforts me every time we ve simply been missing the casual day but i m the coo hip dressing from the equation in the end it s the tennis shoes that seals the deal the hey i m looking off camera casually addressing that which is coming that you can t see and ain t concerned no how body language doesn t hurt either right we should keep voting for the shit we know doesn t work because that shit is better dressed the upshot to the comment had more to do with the marketing aspect reason is engaging in it most have hit close to home because they changed the picture and the office of presidency at it is currently constructed and empowered is beyond anyone regardless of how they are dressed that s the 3 000lb elephant in the room when it comes to these elections nobody seems to have the guts to point out no one person can be the ceo of a 4 000 000 000 000 budget oversee 375 000 000 lives in anyway materially and have a finger on the button to incinerate the world but that s just me it s along the same lines as to why do we send the vast majority of our tax money the furthest away it s that cognitive breakdown that makes choosing the person to do the enumerated things above come down to the best dressed for so many people if we don t keep electing more and more powerful presidents then we re never going to eventually get a king king pshaw we want an emperor i think gj should spend the next debate riffing it mst style just put him in a row of theater seats in silhouette at the bottom of the screen and mock the hell out of those two jackasses except trained comedians normally take at least 2 viewings to get all the riffs right so i d expect gary to take anywhere between 4 6 and still end up as a trade off between being funny and providing a solid libertarian message maybe if he got drew carey joe rogan and penn jillette they could do some nfl style pre post color commentary from gary s living room or something speaking of mst3k i think it got a reboot yep on netflix simple and most important difference between candidates this election imo clinton hates business she makes her money thru corruption trump only understands big business he wants huuuuuuuge deals its why he couldnt stand owning a minor league football team and tried to force a usfl nfl merger his hotels casinos must be bigger and better and regularly go broke johnson started a small business with a single employee himself and grew it to a large business over 20 years i would mention stein but i dont think that needs to be said less corrupt than clinton i would guess very nicely put stein less corrupt than clinton but a true believer in marxism socialism hence the no need to mention the u s is 20 trillion in debt trump the self proclaimed king of debt has stated now is the time to borrow this is a time to borrow how is that good for us hillary proposes 275 billion in spending plus 225 billion in loans for infrastructure according to trump her number is a fraction of what we re talking about we need much more money to rebuild our infrastructure i would say at least double her numbers and you re going to really need a lot more than that how about trumpcare s massive expansion of medicaid the heart and soul of obamacare in 2016 medicaid spending alone was 365 billion the cbo is expecting 6 trillion in spending over the next 10 years trumpcare will cost more how about trump s new entitlement for maternity leave he estimates the cost at 2 5 billion and he ll pay for it by wringing fraud out of the system how many times have we heard that lie moody s analytics projected trump s deficit spending would cause a recession run up 11 trillion in debt and cost 3 5 million jobs how s he going to pay for it it s called opm i do that all the time in business it s called other people s money there s nothing like doing things with other people s money whose money is that it s our money and out kid s money our grandkid s money and generations of americans unborn because we know from this campaign trump never pays himself i don t remember who the commentor was but i was relieved to know that debt isn t the same for the federal government than it is for us folk they tax to keep inflation down see me neither the only way debt is different for the government than individuals as they can use force if they repudiate they can kill the people trying to enforce their useless paper loans they can use force to control a fiat currency and debase it they can borrow money and use force far and wide to guarantee enough flow to pay interest and maybe some principal that s how it s different if individuals or a private association behave the same way it s called racketeering accepting the difference as just another to ma to to mah to variation of legitimate forms of governance is to accept tyranny as 1a of government privilege certainly not a government built on preserving peaceful and productive people s wealth from usurpation it s pretty much the exact opposite it s the monetization of people s stored wealth and future labor and artificially changing gravitational forces to spiral the output of people s labor past present future to the government it s using smoke and mirrors so that the laborers don t know they re slaves johnson blew the best opportunity for libertarians will have for probably a very long time did it occur to him since basically to tap the brakes on the quirkiness crap that the new party name positions is a lot for the public to absorb that beyond goofy sound bite last week the jeans suit ensemble the stint as ceo of pot firm while the public already misconceives the libertarians as a single issue pot movement all he had to do was act the conventional pol for a few weeks and maybe not scare off the public there s actually a big market for normal not crazy this time around if willing to take advantage idiot the major criticism here is the exact opposite that he went too far off the libertarian plantation welch said that trump was trying to out left the left on trade i didn t really see that from his comments he brought up a good point that our free trade agreements are not actually free trade we are the only ones holding up our end of the bargain in maine for example we compete with canada in the logging industry but canada is subsidizing their mills putting our mills out of business while maine mills can compete with other mills they cannot compete with other mills plus the government of canada you see this through most of our free trade agreements what trump is saying is that we need to ensure the deals are upheld not hold our nose while our companies and workers get screwed i think it is an extreme disservice to libertarianism when there is a blind support for these so called free trade agreements that are not actually free and they give a horrible name to actual free trade and free market capitalism what the hell was gj playing with during this interview so much for 2016 johnson fades from here the public doesn t care that he was not invited to the debates the one note samba is wearing thin strategy going forward well staking your candidacy on the debates is not going to work to build a 3rd party movement there s no energy or creativity coming from the johnson weld campaign with the internet and social media there s room for creative strategizing why should they let gary debate when he hasn t said anything of substance in his campaign his unprepared low energy campaign is one dimensional this is an example of how not to run a third party campaign why not debate jill stein then some might see him as a debater as a crabby old guy firing off irrelevant tweets i see him as out of ideas the question now is whether he can muster the focus and energy to win 5 in 2016 so that the libertarian party will have ballot access in 2020 then maybe a true libertarian candidate will use intelligence preparation focus and creativity to show how a minor party can gain attention and support and crash this fucking leviathan shitshow 2016 was a great opportunity now wasted holy smokes the audio for this was bad matt how could you let this happen go gary awesome the video and sound
