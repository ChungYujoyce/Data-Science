t becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn the trump administration will propose cutting the number of refugees admitted in 2020 to 18 000 and will also call for a major restructuring of the program to align it with u s interests including giving localities a say in whether they can accommodate the new arrivals the plan will also reduce the role of the u n in picking america s refugees and instead give priority to religious minorities and iraqis who have assisted the u s government and to refugees the u s has agreed to resettle on behalf of australia officials submitted the proposal to congress on thursday kicking off a consultation period that will conclude with president trump making a final determination next month see also refugees92719 but based on past consultations the 18 000 number is likely to hold firm it would be the lowest cap since the modern refugee system was created in 1980 and marks a 12 000 drop from the fiscal year 2019 cap and a major reduction from the 110 000 refugee target the obama administration tried to set for 2017 even though the refugee number is low the u s remains a leader in humanitarian protections with some 350 000 asylum seekers expected to begin claims next year asylum is protection granted to people already in the u s while refugees are those requesting protections from outside the country there s already a backlog of nearly 1 million asylum cases pending with homeland security and the immigration courts a senior administration official said they view asylum and the refugee program in tandem and as the number of migrants demanding asylum on the southwest border has surged it s natural that the government would cut the number of refugees it can handle given the massive backlog we ve got in humanitarian protection cases that are already in our country it makes sense to prioritize that caseload before we go abroad looking for new refugees to resettle the official told the washington times as striking as the smaller refugee cap is officials said the changes to the system are just as important chief among those is a new executive order mr trump issued thursday giving states and localities the chance to consent before refugees are sent to their jurisdictions the administration says refugees who are entitled to taxpayer programs such as medicaid and who often bring children who have special education needs can tax localities capacity it makes sense for both the communities and the refugees to make sure localities are ready to handle them state and local governments are best positioned to know the resources and capacities they may or may not have available to devote to sustainable resettlement mr trump said in his new order it s an issue a number of jurisdictions raised several years back when the obama administration was inviting refugees from the war torn terrorism hotbed of syria raising security concerns in some areas of the u s the administration will also change the way the refugee cap is allocated in the past each region of the globe had a limit which served to spread refugees around different regions but trump officials say those geographic divisions didn t align with the law which says the u s should prioritize important cases instead they will divide the 18 000 refugees into interest categories with 5 000 slots designated for religious minorities 4 000 slots for iraqis who have assisted the u s and 1 500 refugees from central america s northern triangle region those countries honduras el salvador and guatemala account for almost all of the border asylum surge and the administration hopes that carving out a set number of refugee slots will help separate valid claims from the mostly bogus cases coming through the asylum system the idea is if we can find them we can give them an alternative to having to make the dangerous trip here the administration official said refugee advocates were outraged by the lower refugee cap saying mr trump was betraying america s leadership role on the global stage they d hoped to see a cap of close to 100 000 refugees and they said congress should try to convince mr trump to raise the ceiling before he finalizes it next month we admit refugees not because they are american but because we are american said krish o mara vignarajah president of the lutheran immigration and refugee service the international refugee assistance project blasted the new executive order giving localities a say in resettlement saying it was likely illegal and unnecessary these policies will prevent refugees from being resettled even though communities across the nation stand ready to welcome them said betsy fisher strategy director at irap kevin mcaleenan the acting secretary at homeland security said the u s isn t shirking its leadership but is refocusing efforts on the border asylum seekers the united states has always been and will always remain the most generous nation in the world when it comes to welcoming those in need of humanitarian protection including refugees asylees and victims of trafficking he said the new refugee proposal will also reduce the role of the u n which traditionally has played gatekeeper in vetting and suggesting potential refugees to the u s officials said the administration will still rely on the u n high commissioner for refugees to suggest valid northern triangle refugees and the unhcr will also be able to flag potential applicants in other categories but religious minorities and iraqis can apply directly to the u s under existing laws replacing the need to rely on the u n as the chief source for selecting potential newcomers the 18 000 cap is a maximum number of refugees that can be admitted and administrations often fall well short of that number in fiscal year 2018 mr trump set a cap of 45 000 but resettled only about half that number in fiscal year 2019 the president set a cap of 30 000 as of thursday with four days to go in the fiscal year the government was only a couple d
