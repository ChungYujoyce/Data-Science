most expensive public housing complex in all america that would be the white house and he certainly is continuing to make a name for who else himself as he makes the rounds of the 2016 gop presidential nomination race with his own money top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 but in 2016 the donald is scheduled to hit another a high water mark when trump international hotel washington d c opens its doors during last year s ground breaking mr trump said trump international will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world he seemingly has read the business tea leaves perfectly and invested wisely the city s tourism cup runneth over drawing a record 20 2 million visitors last year and seeing increases in both domestic and international visitors sixteen percent 1 9 million of those visitors were from china the united kingdom germany france australia india south korea brazil japan and italy while those countries represent the top 10 overseas markets and a small percentage of the overall market those countries visitors represent 27 percent of travelers spending an average of 518 per stay now to be frank it is highly unlikely 518 will cover one night s stay at trump s place promised to become a five star hotel trump international started out as the post office in 1899 and as recently as 1998 underwent a makeover with shops and eateries and outdoor eating and sipping space but the popularity of the nearby ronald reagan building and international trade center became too tough a competitor enter the trump brand and a 200 million makeover the trumps said that while they will maintain the original grandeur of the post office building and its tower the trump international press release used the word luxury at least a half dozen times to describe everything from its spa and furnishings to retailers and guest rooms two hundred seventy guest rooms average more than 600 square feet and 16 foot ceilings the largest in washington d c as well as soaring windows restored historic millwork and glittering crystal sconces and chandeliers the trumps bragged in the press release in addition two extraordinary presidential suites will be located in

imagined but that s donald trump for you he doesn t do things quietly and he s not the ambiguous type even though some of his republican friends like sen lindsey graham of south carolina want you to think he is d c needs the trump international although the city already has other luxurious hotels and there certainly will be plenty of internationally well known and unknown newsmakers who will want to book a room or a suite there something mr trump understands this is not merely the home to embassies former and current diplomats but a draw for discreet jetsetters and big wheelers who roll in and out of washington sometimes using aliases and with millennials making a name for themselves in the travel industry who knows what the trump family millennials ivanka donald jr and eric have up their sleeves millennials are driving the travel and tourism industry to be sure and in washington that industry is second only to government it is so vital that mayor muriel bowser wants to pour another 3
