apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinon whatever they think of his social conservatism real friends of domestic manufacturing and by extension a genuinely healthy u s economy owe rick santorum a hearty thanks the republican presidential underdog has touted the importance of american industry with the type of passion and insight long missing among most democrats and republicans top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches mr santorum has not only pushed for special treatment for manufacturing in his economic policy platform the former senator from pennsylvania has provided a cogent rationale reminding dogmatic republicans and conservatives in particular that industry faces offshoring and foreign competition threats simply absent for most service sectors just as important mr santorum has eloquently explained the vital link between manufacturing s stagnation on the one hand and on the other the divisive forces fracking so many middle class families and breeding so many social and cultural pathologies it s an intelligently populist message that with a bigger dose of tolerance has extraordinary potential to unite blue collar reagan democrats and other downwardly mobile republicans and independents into a powerful and perhaps winning national political coalition consequently whatever mr santorum s short term political fate real manufacturing supporters should start showing him why the standard conservative cure all of tax cuts and even his proposal to end federal corporate income taxes for manufacturers can t significantly advance the manufacturing broader economic and core values goals shared by so many americans of course mr santorum also supports nontax economic measures such as cutting regulations and federal spending but even the biggest realistic regulatory and spending rollbacks would still leave huge gaps between government burdens on business in the united states and in third world economic competitors such as china in particular so clearly mr santorum like most other conservatives and even president obama to a much lesser extent lately has pinned his hopes largely on tax cutting unfortunately other countries market rigging dwarfs the effects of taxes on manufacturing for example in 2008 the last year for which internal revenue service data is available u s based manufacturers paid about 74 billion in federal corporate income tax the 161 000 plus s corporations listed as manufacturers paid about 5 7 billion of course their shareholders paid personal income taxes tax compliance headaches generate big but hard to quantify financial costs on all businesses and however they re structured most manufacturers paid a variety of state and local taxes beyond washington s control but in 2008 alone the chinese government in effect spent 235 billion to keep its currency considerably and artificially cheaper than america s this practice gives china based manufacturers equally considerable and artificial price advantages over u s counterparts over the next five years moreover beijing plans to spend 1 5 trillion to subsidize strategic sectors such as high end equipment biotechnology information technology advanced materials and numerous green industries such supports of course represent just the tip of a chinese manufacturing subsidy iceberg nor is the problem limited to china last year japan spent 175 billion to slow the yen s surge against the dollar and other competitor currencies and unveiled 26 billion in subsidies to keep factories and jobs from emigrating american officials estimate that a single airliner model produced by europe s airbus consortium the a380 has attracted more than 6 billion in subsidies indeed official foreign handouts for manufacturing have become so common that subsidization looks more like the rule than the exception in global industrial competition and this market rigging doesn t even include the foreign trade barriers that remain so pervasive as domestic manufacturers keep telling american politicians they re often competing not simply against foreign companies but against foreign governments that s why although tax and other domestic policy reforms can help industry only directly re balancing trade flows will matter decisively mr santorum is a potentially receptive audience with the mainstream conservative street cred urgently needed for trade overhaul to succeed it s time to start sending him the message alan tonelson is a research fellow at the u s business and industry council a national organization whose nearly 2 000 members are mainly small and medium sized domestic manufacturers author of the race to the bottom mr tonelson also is a contributor to the council s websi
