between their friends singapore s prime minister said thursday as he wrapped up a regional summit it s easiest not to take sides when everybody else is on the same side but if you are friends with two countries which are on different sides then sometimes it is possible to get along with both sometimes it s more awkward if you try to get along with both lee hsien loong said when asked about the competition between the u s and china in the region at a news conference lee who hosted the annual summit of the association of southeast asian nations said countries whose economies and strategic interests are deeply entwined with both powers would prefer not to have to decide but the circumstances may come where asean may have to choose one or the other i hope it does not happen soon top

coronavirus limits on churches the comments appeared intended to send a message to the u s represented this week by vice president mike pence in place of president donald trump and to china whose growing influence across the region is abundantly clear at such international gatherings trade tensions between the u s and china over beijing s technology policy and other market access issues have added to strains within the region especially since trump took office in early 2017 the two sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of each other s products in a standoff that has shown no sign of easing lee also remarked on trump s america first deal oriented diplomacy saying it was a departure from the past when they were generous they opened their markets they made investments they provided regional security and in the indirect benefits of a prospering region the u s prospered along but now they say no that s not good enough i want every deal to come and that will mean a different kind of relationship and we will have to get used to it if the u s decides that this is the direction which they would go in the long term lee said in comments to the gathering earlier in the day pence stressed the american commitment to the region where he said there was no room for empire or aggression in a veiled swipe at china s growing influence and military expansion in the south
