administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion i see from my private incarceration at home where i have languished for weeks that the new york times is accusing president trump of wasting as much as six weeks before taking action against the coronavirus for weeks i have been dutifully washing my hands and even taken extra care to wash my feet while mr trump and most of the white house staff were dawdling what were they doing wasting time did the white house s dilatory behavior have something to do with impeachment was that somewhat of a distraction to the assistant presidents in the west wing there was in the times report only one mention of impeachment and it was a fleeting mention otherwise it was just business as usual in washington with the white house ducking subpoenas and congress thinking up ever more fanciful charges against the president is the house of representatives still consumed with russian collusion how about the big fat american professor at cambridge stefan halper or about poor carter page is congressman adam schiff still coming up with whistleblowers of impeccable integrity and is he engaging in his usual heavy handed tactics with the republican opposition top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed on dec 18 2019 the house drafted a bill of impeachment on jan 16 the house submitted the articles of impeachment to the senate weeks passed sen chuck schumer had things to add mr schiff pounced on offbeat rumors finally on feb 5 the senate acquitted the president did all this hurly burly distract the president and his aides in any way i should think it did if anyone dawdled it was speaker of the house nancy pelosi she allowed the likes of mr schiff to conjure up conspiracies that were so far fetched that his constituents should vote him out of office this nov 3 or secede from the union then when the house settled on its bill of impeachment nancy sat on the bill for four weeks refusing to send it on until jan 16 and democrats in the senate still were not satisfied that there should be an impeachment vote only when senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ended this nonsensical travesty and put it to a vote was some sort of order restored in the meantime what was happening well the coronavirus we now know was spreading throughout the world in early 2020 with little action being taken by anyone did any of the aforementioned misbehavior by the democrats have anything to do with the president s action or inaction i think it did he now claims to have taken action on jan 31 to end flights into america from china had he not taken action it seems likely that thousands of more chinese would have arrived here and brought the infection with them yet still the democrats are going to hold president trump accountable for taking no action the times has found a memo from peter navarro of the white house staff that the times in its prolix style that is sprawled across three pages says the president should have read the times story is filled with information about the impending debacle it mentions dozens of people yet as i have said it mentions the impeachment only once in it three page story it charges the president with denying he read mr navarro the president says he is innocent just as he said he was innocent of colluding with the russians with the ukrainians and all the other fanciful figures that populated charges against him these last three years donald trump has now passed richard nixon as the most maligned american president in modern times his enemies have been calling him names since about the time he came down the escalator at trump tower they have called him a racist they have called him hitler interestingly they have not called him stalin that is probably because so many of his enemies are conflicted by stalin what do they say how about he made the kulaks run on time no no that would be confusing stalin with mussolini when the president stopped the inbound flights from china joe biden called him a racist and also a xenophobe joe did not know what that last word meant but he called the president a xenophobe any way of course mr trump is the duly elected president of the united states he is not only the most slandered man to enter the white house but he is the only man ever to have both the cia and the fbi plotting against him on nov 3 it will all be over r emmett tyrrell jr is founder and editor in chief of the american spectator he is the author most recently of the death of liberalism published by thomas n
