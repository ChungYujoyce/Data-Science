south korea where he said monday in seoul that there had been significant progress toward an agreement for the north to give up its nuclear weapons wang appealed to pompeo to cease actions that beijing sees as threatening its interests in order to avoid disrupting cooperation over north korea and other issues while the u s side has constantly escalated trade frictions with china it has also taken actions regarding taiwan that harm china s core interests wang said in their later meeting yang expressed chinese frustration with washington while avoiding specifics telling pompeo relations are facing challenges washington and beijing should and must make the correct choices yang said we hope the united states and china can meet each other halfway and conscientiously fulfill the important consensus reached by the leaders of both countries yang said in seoul pompeo said he and kim had agreed to soon begin working level talks on details of denuclearization and placement of international inspectors at one of north korea s main nuclear facilities pompeo said they came close to finalizing a date and venue for the next kim trump meeting it s a long process pompeo told reporters we made significant progress we ll continue to make significant progress and we are further along in making that progress than any administration in an awfully long time trump tweeting from washington shortly after pompeo left north korea cited progress pompeo had made on agreements trump and kim reached at their june summit in singapore and said i look forward to seeing chairman kim again in the near future pompeo said he and kim had gotten pretty close to fixing the logistics for the summit but stressed that sometimes that last inch is hard to close most importantly both the leaders believe there is real progress that can be made substantive progress that can be made at the next summit and so we are going to get it at a time that works for each of the two leaders and at a place that works for both of them he said north korea s state run news agency kcna meanwhile said monday that kim had expressed his will and conviction that a great progress would surely be made in solving the issues of utmost concern of the world in an early monday dispatch kcna called the talks productive and wonderful and said that mutual stands were fully understood and opinions exchanged in seoul pompeo said kim is expected soon to name deputy foreign minister choe son hui as a counterpart for his new special envoy for north korea former ford executive stephen biegun who accompanied him

tokyo with japan s prime minister he pledged the trump administration would coordinate and unify its strategy for denuclearization with its allies japan has been wary of the initiative but south korea has embraced it pompeo has refused to discuss details of negotiations including a u s position on north korea s demand for a formal end to the korean war and a proposal from seoul for such a declaration to be accompanied by a shutdown of the north s main known nuclear facility the united states and japan have pushed for the north to turn over a list of its nuclear sites to be dismantled as a next step in the process the north has rejected that and south korea has suggested it may not be a necessary next step pompeo however played down the differences i ve never been involved in an international discussion where there weren t differences of view not only between governments but inside of governments he said but if you look at the approach we are in lockstep with each of those two countries in terms of how we approach achieving the results that everyone is aimed at and so there ll be tactical places where we ll have debates and disagreements that is a necessary component of getting to the best deliverable but with respect to our relationship with the republic of korea and japan on this issue i have found that we are in lockstep on the most important issues and how to approach them pompeo said since the denuclearization effort got underway with a secret visit to the north by then cia chief pompeo in april there has been only limited progress even since the june 12
