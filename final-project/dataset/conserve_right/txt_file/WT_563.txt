infectious disease expert is by age in the demographic group at high risk for covid 19 but he s working round the clock and getting only a few hours of sleep he s a little hoarse from all the talking about coronavirus and he ll be on the tv news shows sunday yet his vigor belies his age and he credits it to exercise including running as of thursday he had not been tested for coronavirus the national institutes of health where he works said that s because he hasn t needed to be fauci uses a metaphor from one of the fastest moving sports to describe his strategy on the outbreak you skate not to where the puck is but to where the puck is going to be he told a house committee so he s simultaneously advocating containment to try to keep the virus from spreading mitigation to check its damage once it gets loose in a community immediate efforts to increase testing and short term and long term science to develop treatments and vaccines he s hoping a dynamic response will put the nation where the puck ends up going it s unpredictable he said testing now is not going to tell you how many cases you re going to have what will tell you will be how you respond to it with containment and mitigation serving a president who until recently dismissed coronavirus by comparing it to seasonal flu fauci has been even handed in public he s won the respect of democratic and republican lawmakers along with trump administration officials almost in matter of fact fashion fauci acknowledged to congress in recent days that the government system wasn t designed for mass testing of potential infections it is a failing let s admit it he told lawmakers but he also supported president donald trump s restrictions on travel from europe it s part of the containment strategy he explained it was pretty compelling that we needed to turn off the source from that region he said the threat of a pandemic has been on fauci s mind for years many scientists thought it would come from the flu but it turned out to be coronavirus fauci was unflappable answering questions for hours from the house oversight and reform committee last week except if there was any hint of questioning his scientific integrity i served six presidents and i have never done anything other than tell the exact scientific evidence and made policy recommendations based on the science and the evidence he said democrats and republicans have welcomed his approach the scientists i ve spoken with in committee see you as the lead man and i believe most of america does rep clay higgins r la told fauci democratic rep stephen lynch of massachusetts praised fauci for accurately stating that a vaccine would not be available in a matter of months contrary to what trump has suggested at times you have a certain level of credibility and honesty that i think should be persuasive to the american people lynch told him fauci s candor hasn t stopped trump from praising him tony has been doing a tremendous job working long long hours the president said friday at a rose garden event anthony stephen fauci was born in brooklyn new york on christmas eve 1940 into an italian american family president george

patients in the nih s hospital with nothing to offer after hours he d chat with then surgeon general c everett koop about what scientists were learning about aids influencing koop s famous 1986 report educating americans about the disease in 1990 when aids activists swarmed the nih to protest what they saw as government indifference fauci brought them to the table fast forward and he helped to shape trump s initiative to end hiv in the u s although he s spent his career in government fauci doesn t seem to have lost the human touch and that may be part of the key to his success as a communicator during the 2014 ebola outbreak many americans panicked when a u s nurse got infected by a patient she was caring for a traveler from west africa ebola can cause deadly bleeding fauci confronted those fears by setting a personal example when the nih hospital released that nurse not only did he say she wasn t contagious h
