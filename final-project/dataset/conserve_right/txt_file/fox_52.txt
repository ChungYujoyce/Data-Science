vative talk show titan weighs in on preventing mass shootings in america s schools this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday february 18 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news host i aposm chris wallace on this special edition of fox news sunday the gunman charged with murdering 17 people out of florida high school left a trail of warning signs why were so many red flags missed begin videotape donald trump president of the united states no child no teacher should ever be in danger in an american school gov rick scott r florida we aposre going to find out what happened here and what we aposre going to do is we aposre going to have a real conversation about how we aposre going to stop it wallace this hour we aposll get the latest on the investigation into this school massacre the lives lost unidentified male i sent her to school yesterday she was supposed to be safe wallace and what led a troubled teen to buy a semiautomatic rifle and use it to kill we aposll discuss the latest mass shooting and how to prevent more with rush limbaugh who joins us live for a rare television interview and we aposll talk about where this leaves debate of gun control with mark kelly the retired astronaut husband of gabby giffords and a leader in preventing gun violence plus we aposll hear from a group of survivors who want to rally young people across the country and force action to stop the bloodshed unidentified male politicians can make all the promises they want and they can give all their condolences but at what point do we say that aposs not enough and we call for action wallace then rod rosenstein deputy attorney general the indictment alleges that the russian conspirators want to promote discord in the united states and undermine public confidence and democracy wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about a sweeping indictment presenting new evidence of how russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington we are still feeling the shockwaves from yet another school shooting the massacre at a florida high school has reignited the debate over guns and mental health and there are troubling questions about the fbi aposs failure to follow up on warnings about the shooter in a few minutes we aposll discuss all of this with rush limbaugh and gun control advocate mark kelly but we begin with breaking news students from a high school are making an announcement today five of them have joined us and i want you to know how sorry we are for what you went through and for the loss of your friends cameron what aposs your announcement today cameron kasky high school junior today i aposd like to announce that we have an event coming up to have everybody in the nation talking about what we are talking about and one of the things we aposve been hearing is that it aposs not the time you have to talk about gun control and we respect that we aposve lost 17 lives in our community took 17 bullets to the heart and it aposs difficult to come back from that so here is the time that we are going to talk about gun control march 24th we have the march for our lives which you can find at marchforourlives com and expect to us a lot the march for our lives is going to be in every major city and we are organizing it so students everywhere can beg for our lives because at the end of the day this isn apost about the red and blue the gop and the democrats this is about adults and kids and at this point you aposre either with us or against us we are giving all our politicians a clean slate and in the next election we are saying if you are accepting money from the nra there is a badge of shame on you because you are enabling things like this to happen wallace david do you have a specific agenda on how you think you can protect kids are these marches going to be mostly politicians talking to the crowds or is this going to be students trying to mobilize other students david hogg high school senior this is a student led grassroots movement and this is not a debate this is a discussion between americans because we aposve had too many debates before and they aposve gotten nowhere we need a discussion where we are both sides from the republicans they can talk about mental health care and from the democrats they can talk about gun control but what we need to do but what we need to do here is come together not as democrats or republicans but as americans and work together to solve this issue through love and compassion because this event occurred on valentine aposs day sadly and sadly 17 people had to take a bullet to the heart and so did our community this is a time for change and we can apost let this ever happen again wallace well let me pick up on that because as terrible and you know i can apost even imagine what you kids went through as terrible as what happened at your school i don apost have to tell you there have been other schools sandy hook and columbine and so many others and you know the nation mourns we are all very upset and then we move on and nothing much happens david what makes you think this time is going to be any different hogg i think this time is different because immediately the same day as the shooting i immediately went on fox news and talked about how this needed to be different how this could not be just another mass shooting we aposve had 18 this year since new year aposs eve and now is the time for discussion it aposs not time for debate it aposs time to work together our elected officials need to get together overcome their political differences and get some things done because they need to save the future of our country in the future of our country are those children that are currently dying because politicians refuse to take action and continue to take money from the special interest groups wallace finally emma take us back to the shooting how terrifying was it and is this called for a national march on march 24th is this an effort to give some meaning to the senseless murder of some of your classmates emma gonzalez high school senior this is a case of simple please stop please stop allowing us to be gunned down in our hallways people are telling us that we should run for president we want an education you know like at this point we are trying so desperately hard to communicate what we aposre feeling and so many people are listening to us you know the older generations are every generation is supporting us with countless countless amount of energy so many people are coming up to us in the street saying thank you and we want to thank them by communicating what we are trying to communicate we want to get the support for march for our lives the website is going up today that is up currently we want people to we want students to be at that march and to be with us we want to be with those students who we didn apost understand their pain before and it aposs all too tragic that we all have to understand the same pain now kasky we aposre here for everybody aposs kids wallace guys thank you thanks for joining us today and i want to invite and if you will come to the march here in washington next month to come back on this program thank you group thank you so much for having us wallace now let aposs bring in the king of conservative talk radio rush limbaugh live from his eib studio in florida rush welcome back to fox news sunday rush limbaugh radio talk show host thank you chris great to be here with you wallace what do you think about this idea of students mobilizing across the country a march on washington march in communities students trying to get politicians to act limbaugh what i found interesting about the students and they are very articulate and you have to feel for them and i mean this is it aposs with their lives they are a combination scared and angry but chris i have to ask if anybody is really serious about solving this because none of this by the way i couldn apost care less about the gun angle of this none of this is going to solve prayers and condolences don apost solve it and marches aren apost going to solve it chris the next shooter is out there the next shooter probably has the gun that he aposs going to use the next shooter is known by many people in his community who are concerned that this guy may do what everybody is afraid he aposs going to do now how is anything that we are talking about going to stop that we have got to realize this is what our country has become we can wish that it worked this way and we can wish that congress could legislate it away but they can apost it aposs not the fault of the nra it aposs not the fault of any it aposs the fault of the people doing this and our inability to deal with that and stop them we have security armed security at virtually every public entity in this country except schools for some reason they are a gun free zone and everybody wants to shoot up a school knows that they are going to be the only one armed until we aposre willing to get serious about where we are and how do we they stop this from happening and marches aren apost going to do it saying no more guns isn apost going to do it bashing the nra isn apost going to do it crosstalk wallace let me ask you let me ask you about one aspect of this though because we have now learned of two cases where the fbi failed to follow up on credible information about the shooter and we aposve now learned that just last month that someone close to nikolas cruz the shooter called the fbi tip line and according to the fbi said this he talked about cruz aposs gun ownership desire to kill people erratic behavior and disturbing social media posts as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting but that information was never forwarded to the miami field office how do you explain that limbaugh well i could be snarky and i could say maybe the fbi should stop trying to find every case of sexual harassment in the white house and maybe they ought to give up on this ridiculous pursuit the russians colluded with trump in the election but clearly this is my point a lot of people knew a lot of people had every bit of knowledge they knew to act on this guy to surveilled this guy you know we aposre told well we can apost do anything until the crime has been committed that aposs what has to change and is going to take some really smart people to figure how to do that without violating civil liberties and the fourth amendment and so forth but it aposs clear that the way we deal with this now this chris this is totally political the students think they are taking politics out of this the minute they bash the nra it aposs politics and the point for many of this is this is an event that advances a political agenda for the american left and the democrat party wallace let me limbaugh to bash the nra wallace let me pick up in something you said because you just said at the beginning i could be snarky and i could say well maybe the fbi should stop wasting so much time and you have suggested this in a kind of provocative way on your radio show that the fbi is spending too much time on the trump investigation but in fact the president tweeted just that last night i want to put his tweet up the president said limbaugh i said it friday i said it friday wallace i know well maybe he listened to you very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter this is not acceptable they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign there is no collusion get back to the basics and make us all proud do you really see a connection between the fbi investigating the russia investigation of potential trump connection and the fact that they miss the signals here limbaugh no that aposs why i said i could be snarky but i am trying to make the point the fbi is engaged in a bunch of stuff that aposs the waste time wasting and isn apost going to take us anywhere and it aposs all chris everything has become politicized political in this country and that aposs why we can apost solve anything the minute and i will tell you with a primary perpetrators are of making it political is the media the media carries one side of this argument the antigun anti nra and they promote anything and anybody that is promoting that and advocating that wallace well let me at the risk limbaugh once that happens once that happens you can forget about a solution we are never going to get one because politics enters the scene and corrupts it wallace let me at the risk of raising your ire and those of your millions of followers let me ask you a question about guns to buy a handgun you have to be 21 years old and undergo a three day waiting period back limbaugh right wallace but to buy an ar 15 a semiautomatic rifle you can be 18 years old and the background check takes just minutes question is that sensible limbaugh it may not be sensible i don apost know my point is that aposs not the problem if you ban the ar 15 they aposre going to find something most of these are handguns anyway if you ban that they aposre going to find some other way to do this until we stop them until we affix blame where it belongs until we are ready to admit that this is what our country has become we can apost go back to the apos50s and ozzie and harriet and wish it weren apost so crosstalk limbaugh ban the gun wallace what is the single thing you say identify them i mean look there are a lot of disturbed people out and the vast majority don apost do anything nikolas cruz did do something and yes there were warning signs limbaugh right wallace but how do you identify them limbaugh this guy was identified by everybody that knew him the fbi knew who he was the solution to me and i know this is going to cause all kinds of angst but the solution is we need concealed carry in the schools if we are really serious about protecting the kids we need a mechanism to be defensive when this kind of things if we aposre not going to take action to stop it we better have mechanisms in these schools to stop it when it breaks out if we don apost do that then all the rest of this is nothing more than political posturing for the 2018 midterms and the 2020 election wallace rush thank you you aposre coming back later in the program to discuss a number of other issues i aposll talk to you in a few minutes but first let aposs turn to mark kelly the retired astronaut who became a leader in preventing gun violence after his wife former congresswoman gabby giffords was severely injured by a deranged shooter in 2011 mark welcome back mark kelly gun control advocate thanks for having me on chris wallace in the wake of yet another tragedy and unfortunately the only times you and i talked tend to be after these tragedies how would you stop more school shootings and what you think about what rush just said the idea of concealed carry i know it aposs one of the things you aposre fighting against kelly well let me let me start with at the top of what rush just discussed with you he says first of all the next shooter is out there has their firearm ready to do this there aposs nothing we can do to stop it well i would admit that in florida law enforcement has very few tools to be able to prevent one of these things from happening even the fbi but in some states we have been instrumental and have successfully passed things called extreme risk protection orders or gun violence restraining orders the state of california the state of washington oregon indiana already had one in place connecticut law enforcement can be notified by a family member or maybe they find out about a situation themselves and there aposs a very short and abbreviated process to temporarily take the firearm away from the person that they believe is you know having some mental issues and are struggling so we have already multiple times probably dozens of times prevented these things from happening wallace ok let me kelly you just don apost ever know for sure so that situation that you can apost stop it that aposs actually not true wallace ok but one of the other questions is the gun and i know one of the things you would like to see is a renewal of the assault weapon ban that was passed in the 1990s and may be a limit on the capacity of these high capacity magazines in fact gun rights groups point out that the vast majority of murders in the country are not committed with assault weapons they are committed with handguns i want to put up some statistics on that according to the fbi in 2016 murder victims by handguns over 7 000 all the murders from rifles shotguns and other guns all in the hundreds so are these assault weapons the semiautomatic weapons the ar 15 are they the real problem kelly that aposs 100 percent correct what you are saying most of murders suicides are committed with handguns clearly but when an individual goes into a school or another place with a lot of people with an ar 15 or ar 15 like weapon he has the ability to kill a lot of people much more quickly the 223 round that aposs fired out of an ar 15 moves at over 3 000 feet per second it tumbles when it hits a body it is much more effective at killing a lot of people all at once that aposs why you see it aposs often the gun of choice of mass shooters should a 19 year old be able to buy an ar 15 but he can apost buy a bud light that probably doesn apost make a lot of sense you see we have come out you know for an assault weapons ban you know we often don apost talk about the hardware you know our organization is focused on keeping guns out of the hands of people that shouldn apost have them felons people who are you know show some form of dangerousness domestic abusers suspected terrorists wallace but let me just tell you and i we got limited time the fact is he went through a background check and he passed it so none of the alarms went off for him kelly that aposs right wallace i want to switch if i can though one of the kelly but however florida if florida had one of these extremist protection orders may be local law enforcement would have had the tools to take that firearm away from him months before this happen wallace president trump spoke to the nation after the school shooting and here was his focus begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health end video clip wallace in all of his reactions since the either tweets or statements since the school shooting he has not once mentioned guns which raises the question how much confidence do you have you heard the students at the beginning that the president and congress will it will be different this time that they aposll actually take action kelly well these kids are incredibly articulate and certain members of congress are really good at not listening to their constituents i mean these you know these reforms are supported typically by 70 to 90 percent of americans and to have high school kids who went through this horrific shooting calling for change should matter i would hope in our society that that would make a difference this is a very political issue though we aposve got to get people to vote on this issue i can guarantee you that those kids you had on today are going to vote on this issue probably for the rest of their lives they aposre going to encourage others to do to do that as well wallace and mark as i say goodbye i always whenever i see you i want to ask how is gabby doing kelly she is doing well she aposs in a great mood she aposs working hard obviously like most americans she aposs devastated by what happened in parkland and we are going to continue to work hard to do whatever we can to try and make sure this doesn apost happen again we aposve got to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn apost have them you know we aposve got 4 4 percent of the population 44 percent of the firearms you know if you listen to the national rifle association or the rush limbaugh you would think we would live in the safest country in the world with a number of firearms and i aposm a gun owner i aposm a supporter of the second amendment wallace right kelly you know we can apost let these dangerous people have such easy access and people are going to vote on this issue and i aposve got to believe it aposs going to change it aposs changing in the states we helped pass 200 piece of legislation in 45 different states wallace our best to gabby mark thank you thanks for your time today kelly thanks for having me on chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the fallout from the florida massacre will washington do anything to stop more school shootings commercial break begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif house minority leader i would rather pass gun safety legislation than win the election because people die from this rep paul ryan r wis speaker of the house this is not the time to jump to some conclusion not knowing the full facts we aposve got a lot more information we need to know end video clip wallace house democratic leader nancy pelosi and house speaker paul ryan with very different reactions to the shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school and it aposs time now for our sunday group the head of heritage action for america michael needham charles lane of the washington post julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and former press secretary to vice president pence marc lotter julie as i talked about with the students i don apost want to call them kids they are far too mature and articulate for that we aposve seen the frustration the anger after previous massacres whether it aposs newtown or las vegas or on and on we all wring our hands we all call for action nothing gets done is there any realistic reason to think this time will be any different julie pace washington bureau chief the associated press i haven apost seen any realistic reason to feel like this is going to be different other than the fact that these students are quite articulate and quite powerful in their messaging and certainly seem a couple of days after the shooting like this is going to be something that they aposre going to be continuing to push but i mean i remember these days after newtown in washington it was as rattled that as i have seen this city lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for a period of time or calling for action across a pretty wide spectrum of programs and still nothing really got done after las vegas we saw a call from again both democrats and from republicans on the bump stocks which is something that the shooter there had used we aposve seen no action on that so continuing the momentum that these students have started is going to be a real challenge the one place i would say where we have seen some action and you could potentially see the possibility for more is at the state level places like new york and connecticut after some of these shootings have taken action that seems to be more realistic than some kind of national legislation wallace of course the problem is as we aposve seen in chicago with the gang violence you can have tough laws in the state and the guns still come in pace yes wallace marc i think a lot of people have been struck by the fact that president trump and all of his responses has not once mentioned the word guns as a candidate and as a private citizen actually before that he was strongly in favor of the assault weapons ban as a citizen of new york but he became a very strong supporter of the nra as a candidate and as president and here he is talking to the group last april begin video clip donald trump president of the united states you came through for me and i am going to come through for you cheers and applause end video clip wallace do you see the president supporting any new gun controls marc lotter former vp pence press secretary i think the question is going to be is what do we do to prevent and to secure the schools and that aposs where the president is focused right now whether it aposs working with state and local officials on securing the schools mental health issues and then also identifying those areas possibly where the ball was dropped from an investigatory and law enforcement standpoint to prevent a person with this kind of potential mental illness and these kinds of thoughts having the gun and being able to get into the school wallace all of those are clearly legitimate but what about the argument that you heard from mark kelly that when you get a disturbed person like nikolas cruz and yes he should have been stopped long before gets into a school not with a gun not with a knife but with an ar 15 with high capacity magazines it becomes a weapon of mass destruction lotter i think again we are pushing on one specific gun but as you showed earlier in the segment you know handguns can commit far more crimes or more people die with handguns we aposve had mass shootings with handguns not just the ar 15 so i think you aposve got to balance all of those very real issues and i think that aposs why you know maybe there are loopholes we can close maybe there are some things we can do and i think that aposs probably where the congress is leaning right now it aposs where the president is leaning and working with states on that wallace chuck charles lane the washington post well i think everything we aposre hearing almost everything everyone says has some truth to it you can apost stop every single one mental health is important but it aposs not the whole story handguns kill et cetera et cetera but you know when you reduce this all out what distinguishes this country for most of its peers in the world is the easy availability of guns and whether that aposs going to be dealt with at the state level the way i was very interested to hear about this extreme emergency provision they have in some states that they don apost have in florida there has to be something done at the margin to make it a little more difficult for a person with a lot of trouble to get a weapon like this and so the politics of it at a certain point are going to have to catch up with the policy but i have to say i do agree with julie i don apost see the politics being there yet one of the most interesting things in the wake of this was the arguments coming out of a democratic candidate in a swing or sorry special election in western pennsylvania trump country where he was the one shying away from more gun control this in some parts of this country this isn apost even a democratic republican issue it aposs very regional rural populations will resist this and we aposre going to be stuck where we aposve always been wallace michael i want to pick up on another aspect of this because sometimes the shooters come out of nowhere nobody oh i aposve never dreamt that he would do it but there were warning sign after warning sign more than two dozen times local authorities were called with concerns about this kid and then we aposve learned about these extraordinary failures by the fbi including the one as we mentioned at the top of the show were somebody called the fbi to plan and identified cruz as a threat here was the fbi response begin video clip robert lansky fbi special agent in charge under normal protocol of this information should have been provided to the miami field office there appropriate investigative steps would have been taken the fbi has determined that protocol was not followed end video clip wallace michael how do you explain that and should there be repercussions michael needham ceo heritage action for america well there should be an investigation we should find out what happened and if protocols weren apost followed that should be followed up on i mean we should also keep in mind the men and women of the fbi are incredible they aposre out there every single day keeping us safe and i aposm sure they aposre as devastated as anybody is about what happened i think the question is you know chuck said that what differentiates america from the rest of the world is easy access to handguns that aposs not true what actually differentiates america from the rest of the world is that we have a system of government which protects people and their rights from an oppressive government from tyranny and we shouldn apost be as casual as some of this conversation is about taking away people aposs second amendment rights their fourth amendment right to due process and so even if we knew all of this even if the red flags had been identified the way they should have been and those errors hadn apost happened what do you do next is the question it aposs very easy in the light of tragedy to say it aposs very simple to take away people aposs rights but we should be hesitant to do so wallace so knowing what you know about nikolas cruz should he have been able to get an ar 15 needham i think there aposs a long conversation about everything that should have happened obviously nobody thinks that nikolas cruz should have had an ar 15 obviously tragedy could have been avoided how you get from that statement which 100 percent of americans could agree with to an actual public policy that achieves that while also respecting the rights of millions and millions of americans is why this is such a difficult issue and we shouldn apost be casual about that wallace all right panel we have to take a break here we aposll see you a little later but when we come back the one and only rush limbaugh is back live to discuss the other news and there was a lot of it this week including what aposs next for the dreamers after the senate rejects plans from both the left and right commercial break wallace coming up the president aposs national security advisor says the new fbi indictments prove russia interfered in the 2016 election begin video clip unidentified male as you can see with the fbi indictment the evidence is now really incontrovertible end video clip wallace rush limbaugh is back after the break to discuss that and more on fox news sunday commercial break chris wallace fox anchor this has been another one of those weeks in the trump era with major developments in a number of areas from an immigration deadlock in the senate to an explosive indictment in the russia investigation rush limbaugh is back with us again to discuss it all and rush as i try to explain to your listeners if interrupt you it aposs just to move you along so we can cover more territory so let me start with rush limbaugh host the rush limbaugh show i have given you the wallace go ahead limbaugh i aposve given you the disposition on that they aposre very much aware of this that might happen and you aposre cool you you you wallace ok i aposve painful ph dispensation limbaugh you aposre gold you aposre gold wallace let aposs start with the russia investigation and the announcement of the indictment alleging a sophisticated russian scheme to try to interfere with the 2016 presidential election here aposs what candidate trump said about all of this during the campaign and what the deputy attorney general said on friday begin video clip donald trump president of the united states it could be russia but it could also be china it could also be lots of other people it also could be somebody sitting on the band that that weighs 400 pounds ok rod rosenstein deputy attorney general the defendants allegedly conducted what they called information warfare against the united states with the stated goal of spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general end video clip wallace now i want to emphasize that there is no evidence and the deputy attorney general made it clear no evidence of any collusion between the trump campaign and the russians but doesn apost this indictment disprove what mr trump has been saying all along that any talk about the russians is a hoax and that the special counsel investigation is a witch hunt limbaugh i would be very careful if i were president trump here you know this is just one of many different areas the special counsel is investigating and without getting into details of this because i think this is everybody aposs trying to affect the outcome of elections chris and everybody aposs poisoning the internet everybody aposs doing it both parties insane lunatic individuals the russians are pikers ph actually compared to americans doing this the problem is that it aposs illegal for them to do it the danger for the president is it would be very i think seductive for him to embrace this total embrace say see see i aposve been vindicated the worst thing he could do in his in his world is to validate this whole investigation by claiming victory here because what if down the road there is another indictment or series of indictments that do name trump or do name the russians and trump campaign colluding because that aposs what this is about this is about getting trump chris this whole thing is about setting trump up for impeachment if the democrats win in 2018 this donald trump remains in the crosshairs he is the target and there is no let up in that wallace well let me let me limbaugh no matter what the indictment does or doesn apost say wallace let me pick up on that because you say that the real scandal here is the effort by the clinton campaign and the obama administration to try to sabotage candidate trump and now president trump limbaugh oh there aposs no question about it and if you look at this indictment and i aposve had people say does this mean that hillary could be indicted or or fusion gps no because this indictment doesn apost charge anybody with with collusion it says they aposve defrauded the united states with mail fraud and wire fraud and you can apost get the fusion gps or steele people the real collusion and there aposs no question about this this is a paid political opposition research document that was made to look like legitimate intelligence it perhaps was used to defraud the fisa court the real collusion wallace you aposre talking about the dossier the steele dossier her limbaugh steele dossier and and pretty much everything that they aposve used i mean in every story i i was on this program one year ago one year ago and i told you that this whole thing that trump colluded with the russians was bogus that there was never going to be any evidence for it and did not happen every news story about it since then has included that just like this indictment right here no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant nor is there any allegation the scheme affected the outcome of the election wallace but but what limbaugh bingo wallace but rush let me ask you i mean limbaugh there isn apost wallace the president aposs limbaugh there isn apost going to be wallace the president aposs top foreign policy advisor in the campaign in the first couple of weeks of his white house general michael flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi so has another campaign advisor george papadopoulos aren apost you at least curious to find out what they have to say limbaugh well in the flynn i aposm glad you bring that up in the flynn episode we have learned sense that the people that conducted the interview with flynn peter strzok did not believe he lied a number of other people in the fbi did not believe flynn lied and yet flynn aposs under indictment cops a plea for lying wallace so why limbaugh was flynn told wallace so wait a minute why do you think he pleaded guilty i mean it was an indictment he pleaded guilty limbaugh maybe he wasn apost told well because they had run him dry his family was being destroyed his his financial net worth was destroyed he was being broken he had to he had to stop the bleeding the question was what was flynn told by the fbi by james comey was flynn told by the special counsel by the way the fbi does not believe he lied in their interview in your interview with them that seems to me to be crucial and the new judge in this case i think is going to take that up so i i i think this is all politics and it aposs chris it hasn apost changed from from the get go it is about protecting hillary and obama obama is the primary person being protected here because all of this spying and all of his collusion to destroy trump happened with his knowledge and probably encouragement wallace all right limbaugh and the reason hillary isn apost charged is because that would mean obama would have to be exposed as participating in the scheme too wallace all right let aposs move on to immigration the senate voted down four proposals this week everything from the president aposs basic plan to a bipartisan plan on your radio show you recently said that you would be willing to grant citizenship to all of the dreamers in return for full funding for the border wall and at a certain point after a lot of pressure the democrats seemed to agree to that of the president demanded more so what aposs what aposs going on here limbaugh well i this is actually take a lot to unpack i don apost it aposs a political issue that the democrats do not want solved well all this is is an effort by the democrat party to provide for themselves a current underclass they need a permanent underclass that is dependent on the government for their survival that aposs why they weren apost illegal immigrants granted citizenship they don apost want the issue solved they don apost want any issue solved legislatively or otherwise before the 2018 elections and i think trump is partially exposing that with the various different proposals that he aposs making he aposs giving them pretty much what they want and they aposre turning it down because they don apost want solved i i i tell you what i aposll i aposll make you another deal right here i aposll make a i would be willing right here to support an effort to grant permanent citizenship to whatever number of illegal immigrants there are in the country tomorrow if you will make as part of a deal they can apost vote for 15 to 25 years and if they will agree to that then i aposll grant them amnesty wallace well that aposs pretty interesting it let turn to a couple of other limbaugh well you see how many takers you get you aposll get zero takers on that on the democratic side wallace well unfortunately you aposre not able limbaugh inaudible but they don apost want wallace you aposre not able you aposre pretty powerful but i aposm not sure you can make that deal on behalf of congress and the president but it aposs a pretty interesting offer limbaugh inaudible wallace let me let me turn to the president limbaugh all right wallace you say in year one that donald trump has had one of the most productive years not first years any years of any modern president explain limbaugh well it aposs it aposs undeniable i mean you look at the economy just this first year and compared it to the eight years of obama or even the last the last 12 years if you want to we have not had this kind of economic revival in the economy wall street aposs been going crazy for a long time but in the economy in the you know in the the place where people work the people who make the country work their lives are changing dramatically overwhelmingly economically look at all the wage increases the new jobs the bonuses and the expansion of of benefits the president is delivering on many of the things that he committed to and promised and the democrats who demagogued and lied about this tax cut telling everybody there taxes were going to go up the democrats now are beginning to regret they can see the polling data they can see that people are starting to really love this tax reform bill because they aposre finding out the democrats lied to them about it and there aposs not one democrat fingerprint on it there aposs not a single democrat that can claim any credit for this massively booming united states economy wallace but rush limbaugh they wallace let let limbaugh yes wallace let me just pick up on one last thing because he certainly deserves credit for a lot of things but he failed to repeal obamacare he and the congress he has approved this new spending plan which is going to add half a trillion dollars to our national debt over the next two years does that disappoint you do you hear about it from any of your listeners limbaugh you know it that that is now that is a fascinating question in terms of this budget busting spending i haven apost had one call or complain about it not i aposm sure i will now but i haven apost had one and it aposs been surprising to me that there hasn apost been a single complaint compared to the spending complaining it was doing like in 2010 when the tea party was founded but i think this the massive size of these deficits is not going to be as large as predicted because of the tax cut there aposs going to be revenue flowing into washington that they aren apost counting it aposs still going to be i mean it aposs deficit building there aposs no question but it aposs not going to be nearly as high and as bad as people think it is what what was the other thing you asked about before the wallace you aposve got you aposve got about 45 seconds limbaugh oh obamacare wallace obamacare limbaugh well we got rid of the individual mandate that aposs that aposs been proposed that aposs the guts of it informal repeal and replace yes that that hasn apost happened may be a mistake to do it first not sure but hey this is just the second year there aposs all kinds of time of come back and fix a bunch of things if you want we aposre just getting they they are just getting started wallace rush thank you thank you for joining us again today folks again when i interrupted it was just to move along so you could hear rush on more subjects limbaugh it was fine wallace rush it aposs always a pleasure to talk with you come back limbaugh it aposs any time you want me i aposm here wallace up next our sunday group returns to discuss new charges in the special counsel aposs investigation the indictment of 13 russian nationals for trying to disrupt the 2016 election commercial break begin video clip rod rosenstein deputy attorney general there is no allegation in this indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election end video clip wallace deputy attorney general rod rosenstein announcing the indictment 13 russian nationals and three companies by the special counsel but taking pains to emphasize what is not being alleged and we aposre back now with our panel chuck what do you think the new indictment of the russian shows and what about the fact that here aposs another example where there aposs not a scintilla of evidence of collusion between the russians on the trump campaign charles lane the washington post it aposs a fascinating document on many levels on the legal level of course none of these russians are ever going to be prosecuted we can forget about that wallace because they aposre all in russia and they won apost be extradited lane yes and but but to your point about the collusion clearly they were at pains to show there aposs no collusion in this part of the story left open still is the question about the donald trump meeting with the people allegedly peddling dirt on hillary that hasn apost been resolved so that could raise collusion in some form and then of course the big open question is obstruction and whether there was anything in that regard but what i see is mueller sort of going piece by piece and he has sort of finished off this piece the russian toll farm and propaganda between the lines of this indictment i especially since it aposs not going to lead to any prosecutions i read it almost as robert mueller aposs statement almost like a warning to the american people see how evident it is to our adversaries that our internal divisions are getting to the point where they can be manipulated from the outside and he was almost i think in the form of this indictment issuing a wake up call to the american people about the need for more national unity wallace michael president trump treated the indictment as a kind of vindication that all the allegations against him had been dismissed let aposs put up one of his tweets after the indictment the trump campaign did nothing wrong no collusion is the president jumping the gun claiming that he aposs been exonerated here and are you struck as a lot of people are that you know even if he aposs off the hook this indicates a real russian interference in our election the president aposs not talking about that needham well and i think the last point is where the focus should be i mean look the president obviously feels there wasn apost any collusion there aposs been no evidence that collusion has come up and the rest of the investigation will show whether or not that plays out there aposs an interesting tidbit that the head of advertising of facebook put out in the last couple of days the russians actually spent more money after the election than they did before the election and that goes to chuck aposs point right now there is a hostile foreign power that is trying to sow discontent in this country that is trying to tear us apart and all of us as americans need to be aware of that and need to come together and to move on from this wallace but the president isn apost talking about that and there are reports that he hasn apost had a single national security council meeting a single cabinet meeting about forget his involvement or complete exoneration about what everybody in the intelligence community says and the law enforcement community says is a real threat what they aposre going to do in 2018 needham yes there aposs no doubt that the president is extraordinarily frustrated that people are using this story and a story that so far has no evidence to try to discredit his presidency and his ability to get things done on behalf of the american people that doesn apost excuse the fact that all of us in all parts of government all of us on the outside need to care about our critical infrastructure we need to care about election integrity and we need to come together as americans and make sure that we don apost allow a hostile foreign power to tear us apart wallace let aposs turn to another big issue this week and that aposs immigration and daca and the failure of the senate to pass any of the four proposals that were up there president trump says it aposs all up to the democrats begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we think there aposs a good chance of getting daca done if the democrats are serious and they actually want to do it end video clip wallace marc do you think the president and republicans can sell that to voters that if there is a failure on daca and the dreamers it aposs the democrats apos fault after all it aposs the president who rolled back who rescinded the daca protections last fall marc lotter former vice president pence press secretary well and many people let aposs remember too that most people thought that that was an illegal program to begin with so the court was likely to roll it back regardless but wallace well wait but don apost we need to point out that there are two courts that say the president aposs rolling back of the program is illegal and they aposve stopped it lotter and and that is likely to be taken up by the supreme court and i have a feeling that the president aposs the president aposs legalities legal standing on that will be upheld by the supreme court but here aposs the thing once we get the democrats got what they wanted supposedly they shut the government down for this they got a pathway to citizenship they and the president was very firm in saying i want money to secure the border to build the wall and to reform the immigration system and yet they still can apost get to yes on this i know there aposs going to be an effort in the house to continue to move this discussion forward and maybe because the deadline of march 5th right now is under a temporary hold because of the court action once congress faces a deadline that aposs typically when they when they start moving again wallace julie what do you hear from your sources at the white house have they given up on on getting a deal with the dreamers because whatever the house passes is going to be even more conservative than what was rejected by the senate and are there any second thoughts because yes the president made a huge concession in saying i aposm willing to give a path to citizenship for 1 8 million people more than the democrats were even asking for democrats have made a concession and said we will fund the wall are is there any second thoughts about walking away from that julie pace the associated press no it aposs actually the opposite i mean the loudest and most influential voices in the white house right now on immigration are actually people who opposed that deal because they felt like it was too forward leaning it would have given citizenship to too many people in this country right now so the president is clearly being influenced by those voices they feel very comfortable with where they are on this issue i do think that it is an open question on whether the president himself will end up on this you know he is someone who does see himself as a great dealmaker he aposs someone who also sees himself as needing to fulfill this promise of the border wall i mean marc will remember this from the campaign i was always struck going to campaign rallies for trump that the people in the crowd whether they believed that trump would fulfill most of his promises or not actually did largely believe in the immigration principals and trump understands the need to fulfill those promises for his base so if he does see that there is an opening in a couple of weeks to move on this to be able to fulfill this promise of funding for the border wall will he then override some of these advisors who have been so influential the past couple of weeks wallace and what aposs your bet pace it aposs hard to know i mean the president has publicly flip flopped on this over the last couple of weeks in these meetings that he aposs had with lawmakers publicly versus what he aposs said privately i think it aposs a real open question at this point wallace and how do you think we aposve got about 30 seconds how do you think it plays i mean let aposs assume that the court issue gets settled and we shouldn apost assume that and dreamers start getting deported how aposs that going to play pace i think the dreamer issue is one that has a lot of support from both republicans and democrats i think it is a wallace the idea of protecting them pace the idea of protecting the
