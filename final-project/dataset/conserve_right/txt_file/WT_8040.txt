school trip to italy together in february a third person from the trip is being tested and the school is shutting down for the week in new york officials confirmed sunday that a woman in her late 30s contracted the virus while traveling in iran she has been quarantined to her home in manhattan the centers for disease control and prevention said sunday that it was retesting someone in san antonio texas who had been released from isolation saturday but later returned after a lab test was weakly positive the patient had been treated a local medical facility for several weeks after returning from wuhan china the agency said the patient had met the criteria for release and was asymptomatic bexar county judge nelson wolff told the san antonio express news that the patient was a woman who had come into contact with around a dozen people at a hotel both wolff and san antonio mayor ron nirenberg expressed concerns over the patient s initial release in a statement as the fallout continued vice president mike pence and health and human services secretary alex azar sought to reassure the american public that the federal government is working to make sure state and local authorities are able to test for the virus both said during a round of tv talk show appearances sunday that thousands more testing kits had been distributed to state and local officials with thousands more to come they should know we have the best public health system in the world looking out for them azar said adding that additional cases will be reported and the overall risk to americans is low as the cases ticked up some americans stocked up on basic supplies particularly in areas with diagnosed cases and began to take note of the impact on daily life stores such as costco sold out of toilet paper bottled water and hand sanitizer outside portland oregon where a case was announced friday sports games and practices were canceled into the coming school week some churches said they would not offer communion because of fears of viral spread as americans prepared researchers at the fred hutchinson cancer research center and the university of washington on sunday said they had evidence the virus may have been circulating in the state for up to six weeks undetected a finding that if true could mean hundreds of undiagnosed cases in the area they posted their research online but it was not published in a scientific journal or reviewed by other scientists trevor bedford an associate professor who announced the preliminary findings on the virus in washington state said on twitter late saturday that genetic similarities between the state s first case on jan 20 and a case announced friday indicated the newer case may have descended from the earlier one the jan 20 case was the first known case in the u s i believe we re facing an already substantial outbreak in washington state that was not detected until now due to narrow case definition requiring direct travel to china he said on twitter bedford did not immediately reply to an e mail requesting an interview sunday scientists not affiliated with the research said the results did not necessarily surprise them and pointed out that for many people especially younger healthier ones the symptoms are not much worse than a flu or bad cold we think that this has a pretty high rate of mild symptoms and can be asymptomatic the symptoms are pretty non specific and testing criteria has been pretty strict so those combinations of factors means that it easily could have been circulating for a bit without us knowing said justin lessler an associate professor of epidemiology at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health dr adam lauring of university of michigan called the findings high quality work from scientists who ve done similar work with the flu virus for years they show their data and they show their work lauring said it s more than a series of tweets because the researchers back up what they found with data that they ve shared online if there s something wrong someone will find it dr carlos del rio of emory university school of medicine said the findings are from respected researchers in genomic sequencing and they make sense because of the geographic proximity of the two cases this is a good time to reinforce the things we all should be doing to stop the spread of flu wash your hands don t touch your face if you have a cold stay home it s a good time to remind ourselves of that he said pence named by the president to be the point person overseeing the government s response said more than 15 000 virus testing kits had been released over the weekend and the administration is working with a commercial provider to distribute 50 000 more he said the vice president said testing was among the first issues raised by governors he s spoken with so far several states have begun their own testing including washington state oregon and illinois we re leaning into it pence said azar said more than 3 600 people already have been tested for coronavirus and the capability exists to test 75 000 people he forecast a radical expansion of that in the coming weeks pence and azar spoke a day after president donald trump approved new restrictions on international travel to prevent the spread within the u s of the new virus which originated in china there are now more than 80 000 cases worldwide and about 3 000 deaths the number of known coronavirus cases in the u s had reached at least 80 as of sunday counting people evacuated from a cruise ship and wuhan trump said saturday at a white house news conference that he was thinking about closing the southern border with mexico as a precaution azar said sunday that mexico has few coronavirus cases and that it would take a dramatic change in the circumstances there to prompt serious consideration of a border shutdown the president azar said was trying to say everything s on the table we will take whatever measures are appropriate and necessary to protect the american people but we don t forecast doing that any time soon he said of closing the border this story has been corrected to reflect that the hospitalized patient in rhode island is a man not a woman who traveled to italy in february flaccus reported from portland oregon ap writers darlene sup
