apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinion the obama administration wants to pivot u s foreign policy toward asia there are far too few details to know exactly what that means in the meantime the administration is right to highlight america s enduring interests in that region why is asia important the u s trades more with asia than with any other region including europe and the rest of north america with its forward deployed military forces and five formal security alliances the u s underwrites the security that has been trade s sine qua non in the region top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey asia is at the tipping point between free and unfree america s five allies and india are democracies half of southeast asia and china are not in an upcoming paper my colleagues walter lohman and robert warshaw outline a diplomatic strategy for securing american interests in asia they argue that for u s diplomacy in asia to have any real effect and to make the new expressions of resolve credible american military power in the region must be augmented it s difficult to see how this can be done given president obama s plans to cut the size of u s armed forces the administration is working with australia for greater access to the indian ocean and will deploy littoral combat ships to singapore at the same time it is gutting the shipbuilding budget we should never forget that america s military power not the finesse of our diplomats alone gives the u s credibility in asia this doesn t mean that we should not take regional meetings seriously far from it we should work aggressively to set their agenda and produce more concrete outcomes the list of such groupings is long including the asia pacific economic cooperation apec meeting the asean regional forum the east asian summit and the u s asean summit the challenge is to make these meetings more than mere talk shops or worse places where china uses consensus to block our interests we should also be seeking binding economic agreements we should look to the forums for real action on international issues such as territorial disputes and arms proliferation mr lohman and mr warshaw suggest that in addition to making these regional multilateral meetings more effective the u s should rely more heavily on minilaterals i e initiatives such as the lower mekong initiative lmi and the proliferation security initiative psi and various trilateral dialogues yet none of this will work if america s traditional security alliances in asia are weak specific things to do in this regard include building a road map for revitalizing the u s thailand alliance strengthening the armed forces of the philippines preserving the american presence on okinawa and expanding the operational significance of the u s korea alliance beyond the korean peninsula it would help american diplomacy immensely if we changed the way we engage china we are currently investing far too many diplomatic resources on dialogues with china that produce far too few results much of that time money and attention should be turned to more actively managing u s alliances in asia and to cultivating new economic and security partners lastly the united states must do a much better job expanding american trade in asia the obama administration took far too long to approve the free trade agreement fta with south korea it has been wise to take up the bush administration s transpacific partnership initiative which should be actively promoted as the basis for a broader apec wide trade agreement bilateral ftas should also continue to play a role in our trade policy taiwan and thailand remain prime candidates the united states is indeed a resident power in asia we have just conducted political primaries not only in hawaii but in guam the northern marianas islands and american samoa as well but just being there is not enough we have to work at securing our interests and be seen making the investment that gives our presence the credibility of a superpower kim r holmes a former assistant secretary of state is a vice president at the heritage foundation www heritage org follow h
