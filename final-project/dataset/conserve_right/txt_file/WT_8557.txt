about politics mr pompeo added it s not about bullying it s not about blame it s about the ongoing need to save american lives this is an ongoing threat today the comments were the latest salvo in a war of words between washington and beijing china has denied covering up the virus outbreak and claimed it acted appropriately in recent days chinese government spokesmen have denounced the united states and singled out mr pompeo for comments criticizing china s mishandling the outbreak chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said in beijing wednesday that mr pompeo should show proof the virus originated in a wuhan laboratory mr pompeo cannot present any evidence because he hasn t gotten any she said i think this matter should be handled by scientists and professionals instead of politicians chinese authorities initially said the virus began from tainted meat at a wild animal market but some have since tried to shift blame to the united states claiming the u s military brought the virus to wuhan during a military sporting event in wuhan last october mr pompeo has said there is strong circumstantial evidence the virus came from one of wuhan s research laboratories we need countries to share reliable data in a timely way now and the next time that a calamity like this hits we need reliable partners he said on the world health organization mr pompeo said i also call upon who director general tedros ghebreyesus to invite taiwan to observe this month s wha as he has the power to do and as his predecessors have done on multiple occasions mr pompeo said at the state department china has sought to block rival taiwan s participation in u n organizations including the world health organization a lack of participation that hindered a rapid response to the coronavirus pandemic taiwan based on travelers from wuhan to taiwan learned early in the outbreak that a contagious disease was coming from wuhan and tried to provide early warning to the who about the outbreak the warnings were ignored because taipei is not a member and the organization has been influenced by china china regards taiwan officially the republic of china as a breakaway province instead of an independent nation on the repression of wuhan doctors chinese police arrested eight doctors in december for sounding the alarm on social media warning of the new type of pneumonia in wuhan it s been 128 days since chinese doctor ai fen the director of the wuhan central hospital s emergency unit shared information on the internet about a patient with a sars like virus mr pompeo said her colleague dr li wenliang shared dr ai s report online with medical colleagues by dec 31 health officials in wuhan were treating dozens of patients suffering from the disease but days later chinese police arrested dr li and the other doctors claiming they were spreading false statements on the internet china saw then that it had an emerging public health crisis on its hands they knew china could have prevented the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide mr pompeo said china could have spared the world a descent into global economic malaise they had a choice instead mr pompeo said the chinese covered up the outbreak in wuhan the china national health commission ordered virus samples destroyed on jan 3 and chinese police disappeared chinese citizens who tried to sound the alarm the government s state controlled media also targeted chinese who called for the government and party to be transparent mr pompeo said that as a result of china s mishandling of the disease outbreak many nations are beginning to understand the risk of doing business with the chinese communist party in recent weeks nigeria kazakhstan and france have demarched the chinese communist party ambassadors for a whole host of lies and misdeeds mr pompeo said both the australian and swedish governments have called for an investigation of china s handling of the outbreak britain also has and the european union are questioning their dealings with beijing as well mr pompeo said there is no true win win relationship with a communist regime unless fair terms of trade and other relations can be established the secretary also said president trump is seeking to build new ties based on greater reciprocity now countries have a chance to further insist on what s right for their people mr pompeo said on hong kong mr pompeo also signaled that the trump administration is considering restricting hong kong s favorable trading status based on growing mainland encroachment a recent u s law requires the administration to review the trade status in light of a crackdown against pro democracy protesters opposing new beijing restrictions right now we are delaying our report to congress that will assess hong kong s autonomy to allow us to account for any additional actions that beijing may be contemplating in the run up to the national people s congress that would further undermine the people of hong kong s autonomy as promised by china when they entered the agreement with the people
