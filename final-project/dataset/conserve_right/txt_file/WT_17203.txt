apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic new york ap when julian erskine last saw the american touring company of riverdance he had to smile he was in the segerstrom center for the arts on an october night in costa mesa calif watching the high stepping cast electrify the crowd once again despite more than a dozen years crisscrossing the nation to be at the back of a hall with the audience jumping to their feet at the end of the show after all these years it s just so gratifying and just so pleasing says erskine the show s senior executive producer by phone from dublin top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time even so the end of the road is nearing riverdance is currently on an 82 city farewell north american tour that s winding across the u s and canada and ends in june this month the show left texas hit the southeast and next goes to the plains it s certainly emotional to be saying goodbye says erskine the show has been touring continuously in north america since 1996 sometimes with two companies simultaneously while organizers insist there s still interest in the u s new markets beckon in south america india and china the touring company includes six principal dancers 18 troupe dancers a live five piece band flamenco dancer and two american tap dancers one of whom is also a baritone soloist padraic moyles one of the principals is dancing with a heavy heart he joined riverdance in 1997 and fell in love with his co star and now wife niamh o connor while in the show while he has performed elsewhere he says american audiences are special anybody who joins the show from here on out and doesn t get the opportunity to perform it in america will be missing something he says i hope that someday whether its 10 years from now it does come back so that people get to experience that reaction again riverdance opened at dublin s point theatre on feb 9 1995 at a time of renewed irish optimism and pride surrounding the onset of the booming celtic tiger economy years of relative poverty were disappearing and being irish had a new cool thanks to a new generation of athletes and musicians like u2 and the cranberries the timing couldn t have been better we just picked up on a vibe that was happening in this country and we suddenly felt maybe it s not so bad being irish maybe we don t have to be the butt of every joke says erskine it couldn t have happened five years earlier it just wouldn t have happened i don t think we would have had the courage to have done it it has since been seen by an estimated 22 million people in 40 countries from red square to the great wall of china it made its american debut in 1996 at radio city music hall in new york city and packed the gershwin theatre on broadway for 18 months in 2000 2001 not bad for a show that first premiered on the 1994 eurovision song contest as a seven minute segment the two hour riverdance show is loosely based on the story of irish culture and mass immigration to america the story woven through music and dance styles including flamenco and tap most of the dancing is drawn from traditional irish step dancing in which the arms and body move little while the feet create the sound and action erskine attributes the show s success to the fact that it isn t a cookie cutter experience it wasn t pulled together to make money but to blow the dust off irish folk music and dance he says and that purity of creation shines through plus the sound seems to touch a very human part of us that pounding out of rhythms i suppose is quite primal that goes back into all our cores no matter where we ve come from the beating of drums is how we first communicated he says the show has lasted despite losing original stars jean butler and michael flatley who also was co choreographer flatley went on to create his own shows lord of the dance and feet of flames moyles suspects that although riverdance is pure irish americans have embraced it so strongly in large part due to their own immigrant heritage many of them have their own folk dances they probably see their own heritage within riverdance he says the final north american tour at least for now will take the show to such irish heavy cities as chicago kansas city philadelphia st louis and boston and will conclude at wolf trap national park in vienna va which will represent the 14th time riverdance has played there while the show is leaving america it has tours planned for belgium new zealand and australia the show is also going to india in october and plans a 10 week tour of china there are also dates set in argentina and brazil which excites erskine because riverdance hasn t been farther south in the americas than mexico before as we are saying goodbye he says we are also saying hello online https www riverdance com fo
