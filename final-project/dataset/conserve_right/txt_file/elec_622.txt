national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions is joe biden hillary clinton or george w bush the first most obvious and literal answer is he s neither he s joe biden one of the most known and familiar personalities in american politics matt continetti editor of the washington free beacon recently asked is biden the new hillary trump plans to wage the same sort of campaign against biden that he did against hillary clinton in 2016 continetti wrote for national review back then trump defined hillary as the candidate of entrenched interests who used a long career in politics for familial gain he highlighted clinton s support for the 1994 crime bill and for nafta and tpp driving wedges between the former secretary of state and important democratic constituencies and he went after hillary s foreign policy credentials painting her as an interventionist who had weakened america s standing in the world continetti is surely correct that this is team trump s game plan both d c scuttlebutt and public reporting suggest that they see biden as the biggest threat to trump s reelection prospects that s certainly borne out in the polls which show biden leading trump by 8 points according to the realclearpolitics average biden s lead in some crucial states is even more worrisome for trump jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup

percent to 42 percent in pennsylvania biden has a 10 5 percentage point lead in michigan 8 points in wisconsin though polling there is sparse and 4 points in ohio and is tied in florida according to the realclearpolitics average trump won the electoral college by taking a handful of states out of the traditional democratic column with razor thin margins it s insanely early but the scary part for trump is that biden is not only wildly beating the other democrats in the field he s also outperforming clinton at a comparable time in 2015 and this points to a possible flaw in the effort to turn biden into another hillary clinton ran as an experienced washington hand continetti notes but after 16 months of trump attacks 77 000 voters in three states denied her the presidency he adds the same could happen again to a nominee easily caricatured as the epitome of beltway cluelessness what looks like joe biden s greatest strength electability born of experience may also be a debilitating weakness maybe but while trump s attacks on clinton were surely effective at times trump was aided enormously by the fact that americans particularly republican and republican friendly ones were skeptical or outright hostile to her already thanks to decades of experience with and criticism of her trump didn t define clinton as much as she did moreover implicit to her campaign was the promise of both a third obama term and a restoration of the clinton dynasty trump did not need to work all that hard to convince voters exhausted or frustrated by the obama years or disdainful of clinton inc to vote against her biden occupies a different space psychologically and politically there s a lot of conventional wisdom in washington that the early front runner always loses and that s true except when it isn t in 2003 former vermont governor howard dean dominated the polls then he lost iowa screamed and eventually skulked away but in 1999 george w bush dominated the polls and except for a brief scare from senator john mccain in the new hampshire primary essentially cruised to victory a key part of bush s early success not just in polls but in fundraising stemmed from the fact that he was promising a bush restoration indeed some of his early approval ratings were a direct result of nostalgia for his father with whom he shared a name also he was offering a referendum on the incumbent president and the scandals and partisanship that defined the end of his administration he vowed to restore honor and dignity to the oval office and to be a uniter not a divider the very different context notwithstanding this is pretty much biden s campaign message the ideological activist and twitter obsessed base of the democratic party may not like biden s pitch but it sure looks like rank and file democrats do particularly african american women who may see in biden something of an obama restoration of course biden can blow it as he did the two previous times he ran for president but counting on the past repeating itself is a good strategy only when you pick the right example from the past 2019 tribune content agency llc get our conservative analysis delivered right
