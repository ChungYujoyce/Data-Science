Elected officials sometimes 'have to show as much courage as someone in battle'
Democratic Minnesota senator and 2020 presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar commented that “there are times in your life when you’re an elected official, you have to show as much courage as someone in battle.”

“Whether or not anyone said that to them directly, let’s face it. It’s kind of a metaphor for what’s going on,” Klobuchar told CNN’s Manu Raju. “What Adam Schiff was saying is there are times in your life when you’re an elected official where you have to show as much courage as someone in battle.”

"I think about the example of John McCain voting against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. I think of some of the Republicans that actually voted for Sonia Sotomayor or voted for Elena Kagan,” Klobuchar continued.

“I think about Claire McCaskill and Heidi Heitkamp when they voted with their party but against their own political interest when they voted against Judge Kavanaugh. There are so many examples of that in our country’s history of profiles of courage, and that’s what Adam Schiff’s pleaded to them.”
