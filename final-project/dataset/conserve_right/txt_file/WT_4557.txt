rsecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion history will note that in 2019 america saw the culmination of a coup attempt by democrats which commenced the day after president trump shocked the world by winning the 2016 presidential election the supposed democratic juggernaut hillary clinton was chugging down the tracks until the trump train derailed it with the promise to drain the swamp he vowed to change the status quo that allowed for people like the clintons and other elites two systems of justice and opportunities for enrichment by raiding the cookie jar with corrupt schemes democrats and never trumpers did not like mr trump s ascension and his promises at all really they did not and still do not like those who support mr trump either top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey so mrs clinton whose campaign actually colluded with foreign agents claimed that it was the russians fault that she was defeated with the help of deep state elites several investigations were commenced into the trump campaign and his administration the attempt was to find something anything to remove president trump from office we ended up with the mueller investigation that included a team of 19 lawyers most of whom were anti trump acolytes there were 40 investigators spending more than 30 million in taxpayer dollars that produced hundreds of witness interviews millions of pages of documents and proof that there was no collusion cooperation coordination or conspiracy between russians and the trump campaign the house judiciary committee chairman jerry nadler new york democrat wouldn t take the report as conclusive the report he had anxiously awaited debunked his narrative but he still wanted to reopen the investigation people like rep eric swalwell california democrat and house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff california democrat still clung to their belief that there was a there there when there wasn t in dismay the democrats have attempted to gain support for impeachment with a host of trumped up charges that end up being exposed as utter nonsense the american people have been subjected to three years of hatred being spewed by the left that has included the russian hoax claims of obstruction of justice and several other zany allegations which have been completely destroyed now we get the wandering ukrainian fable never has a single phone call provided so much hope to trump derangement syndrome infected democrats as president trump s rather innocuous conversation with newly elected ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky this one started with a mysterious whistleblower who claimed the conversation included multiple threats and bribes by the president it was terrifying then the unthinkable happened president trump released the transcript of the call and the whistleblower s complaint immediately the new narrative was ruined and it was demonstrated that this whistleblower doesn t qualify as a whistleblower at all the credibility of the whistleblower was blown much of what the whistleblower said was inaccurate the whistleblower and most of his sources had no firsthand knowledge of anything moreover there was no extortion or promises mr zelensky and his foreign minister acknowledged that first the whistleblower s credibility and then the whole story itself was emasculated by the truth you have to give the democrats credit when their narratives collapse they invent a new one their misrepresentation of the phone conversation and the president s inquiry into ukrainian corruption and potential influence in our 2016 election are somehow being conflated into a most amorphous allegation of abuse of power unlike the trump administration the obama administration refused to provide lethal military aid at all to ukraine further former vice president joe biden threatened to withhold funding to ukraine unless an investigator was fired because he was looking into corruption of a company involved with mr biden s son hunter these so called corrupt practices of president trump have been shamelessly and skillfully made to look nefarious by the impeachment obsessed left if the american public is ever able to see what is going on in the soviet style hearings they will be outraged at the manipulation of facts and downright abuse of the truth that democrats have used in their coup attempt thus the slowest moving coup in world history persists not out of love for country but out of hatred for the president and those who support and voted for him andy biggs is a republican u s representative fro
