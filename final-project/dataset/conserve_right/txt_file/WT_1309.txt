apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap on the eve of the new hampshire primary president donald trump told a rally that people who are in the united states illegally are paying for his mexico border wall it was the latest iteration of his effort to convince the public that mexico is covering the cost just as he promised throughout his 2016 campaign and since evidence to the contrary came three days later the pentagon announced it is taking 3 8 billion approved by congress for fighter aircraft ships and other military programs and using the money to pay for the wall the defense department took a similar step last year and may yet again u s taxpayers are paying for the wall not mexico as has been the case from the start trump spread a variety of distortions at the rally and still more in other venues during a week that came to be dominated by machinations involving the justice department the release of his proposed budget prompted democrats to wrongly accuse him of undermining medicare top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots the week in review the wall trump you do know who s paying for the wall don t you redemption from illegal aliens that are coming the redemption money is paying for the wall new hampshire rally monday the facts to date the money is coming from the u s treasury meaning today s taxpayers and the future ones who will inherit the federal debt to the extent any people who came into the u s illegally are kicking in for the wall it s because they re working and paying taxes like other workers redemption payments don t exist trump apparently meant to cite remittances that refers to money that immigrants in the u s send to their countries of origin often to family members trump has at various times talked about taxing or blocking such money but that has not been done mexico flatly refused at the outset to pay for the wall that has given rise to creative formulations by the president about how mexico in some way is contributing for example he has projected that his updated trade agreement with mexico and canada will stimulate enough extra growth over the years to cover the cost even if that happens which analysts widely doubt the wall will have cost the u s money that it could have used for something else it s not a payment from mexico trump freed up 3 6 billion for the wall last year by diverting money from military construction projects as well as 2 5 billion from approved counter drug spending voter fraud trump remember last time we won the primary tremendously we should have won the election but they had buses being shipped up from massachusetts hundreds and hundreds of buses rally monday in new hampshire the facts trump is once again trafficking in the unfounded conspiracy theory that buses of illegal voters traveled in from massachusetts in 2016 to deprive him of a new hampshire victory in the general election against democrat hillary clinton the accusation that people from more liberal massachusetts crossed state lines in buses and voted in 2016 was made by republican chris sununu who at the time won election as governor sununu quickly backed down saying his talk about busloads of illegal voters was more a figure of speech in other words not reality sununu later told the new hampshire news network nh1 that he was not aware of any widespread voter fraud in the state more broadly trump has repeatedly asserted but produced no evidence of widespread voting fraud in 2016 by people in the country illegally or by any group of people he tried but the commission he appointed on voting fraud collapsed from infighting and from the refusal of states to cooperate when tapped for reams of personal voter data such as names partial social security numbers and voting histories studies have found only isolated cases of voter fraud in recent u s elections and no evidence that election results were affected loyola law school professor justin levitt found 31 cases of impersonation fraud for example in about 1 billion votes cast in elections from 2000 to 2014 401 k trump on workers 401 k investments up 90 up 104 is there anybody doing badly with the 401 k don t put up your hand i don t believe you the 401 k s they re up 90 95 new hampshire rally monday the facts that s misleading at best there have indeed been 401 k increases of 100 or more since 2017 but those were largely among workers with fewer than four years at their job according to the employee benefits research institute the increases are big for recent and younger employees because they generally start with meager savings the gains come in part from workers setting aside money from their own paychecks and contributions from their employers not just market returns in that circumstance it s unremarkable to see a 1 000 401 k account double in a year for example when a young worker and perhaps the employer is paying into it older workers with more than 20 years on the job have seen gains of roughly 50 over three years in their retirement accounts thanks both to contributions from paychecks and market gains moreover the s p 500 the broadest measure of the u s stock market was up 47 6 from trump s inauguration through monday s close some 401 k averages are problematic for trump s claims to be generating prosperity because many workers lack the savings for a comfortable retirement the median account balance was 22 217 in 2018 in 401 k and similar plans for which investment giant vanguard was the record keeper that s down from 26 331 in 2017 impeachment trump on impeachment it wasn t even close i want to thank our republican senators and our republican house members they were tremendous in the house we won 196 to nothing and then we got three democrats the facts by that measure the san francisco 49ers won the super bowl 20 0 they actually lost it 31 20 to the kansas city chiefs if you only count your own score you win every vote and every game the house impeached trump on a 230 197 vote on the first article outlining abuse of power charges and a 229 198 vote on the second article covering obstruction of congress that s because most of the majority democrats backed impeachment trump went on to say in the senate other than romney we had we got 52 to nothing again he ignores votes from the democrats trump was acquitted of impeachment charges after senators in the republican controlled senate narrowly rejected democratic demands to summon witnesses and extend the trial the senate acquitted trump by votes of 52 48 on abuse of power and 53 47 on obstructing congress utah sen mitt romney was the only republican to vote for conviction doing so on the abuse of power charge democrats on medicare joe biden on trump s proposed budget look at the budget he just submitted he eviscerates medicare cbs interview monday house speaker nancy pelosi one week after the president paid lip service to protecting the health care of american families his budget betrays his values with cruel cuts to medicare and medicaid vulnerable families and seniors deserve better tweet monday senate democratic leader chuck schumer by proposing severe cuts to medicaid and medicare president trump s latest budget is simply a continuation of his war to rip away health care from millions of americans including people with preexisting conditions statement monday the facts the leading democrats are engaging in a timeworn political tactic known as mediscare trump s budget doesn t gut medicare and it wouldn t reduce benefits to seniors the budget s 465 billion over 10 years in medicare cuts would come from lower projected payments to hospitals and other service providers for example the budget calls for equalizing medicare payments for similar services delivered in a hospital owned facility and a doctor s office saving about 164 billion over 10 years hospital based services generally command higher reimbursement now a practice that has prompted criticism the budget also underscores trump s support for legislation to lower drug costs for seniors enrolled in medicare s part d prescription plan the outlook is worse for medicaid which covers low income people including seniors and disabled people who qualify for both programs trump s budget signals his intention to press for significant medicaid cuts which could lead states to scale back some benefits veterans trump boasting of accomplishments for veterans something that couldn t be done for 44 years they say and that s veterans choice that s one of the reasons i think the va is doing so well veterans event tuesday the facts actually president barack obama won passage of the veterans choice program which gives veterans the option to see private doctors outside the va medical system at government expense congress approved the program in 2014 and obama signed it into law trump expanded it the program s impact on improving va care has been unclear the va has said it does not expect a major increase in veterans seeking care outside the va under trump s expanded program partly because wait times in the private sector are typically longer than at va the care in the private sector nine times out of 10 is probably not as good as care in va va secretary robert wilkie told congress last year in 2019 35 percent of all va appointments were with outside physicians slightly lower than the 36 percent in 2017 philippines trump responding to word that the philippines will end a security pact allowing u s forces to train in the country we helped them defeat isis but if you look back if you go back three years ago when isis was overrunning the philippines we came in and literally single handedly were able to save them from vicious attacks on their islands wednesday at the white house the facts he s wrong in saying islamic state fighters were overrunning the philippines and that the u s single handedly saved the country from them only dozens of is fighters are known to have gone to the philippines since the rise of the group in the mideast and the local militants who aligned with the organization number in the hundreds in may 2017 in the operation touched on by trump more than 600 is aligned local militants backed by a smattering of foreign jihadists laid siege to marawi a small islamic city in the largely roman catholic country they
