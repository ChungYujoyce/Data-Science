traditional stronghold of emilia romagna following lega s advance at the 2018 italian general election salvini was so confident of victory that he taunted the democratic party s pd local leadership revered and legendary old communists he declared would today cross the street to avoid meeting the present day leadership today said salvini the old communists would vote for lega but on 26 january

from erc which was only formed two months ago toured workplaces even sitting down with groups of lega voters to hear their concerns we came met the fishermen for example took notes tried to listen even when people were angry we showed that there s another way of doing politics the listening exercise resulted in two main proposals a pact for the climate and a pact for jobs the left imposed these

that with the rise of the far right some senior figures told me two years ago that social democracy was finished but bonaccini s personal authority as a competent administrator and the emergence of new charismatic figures on the left such as schlein allowed activists from both the party s left and its right from pro eu liberal and green parties to be part of a project that was untainted by the pd s damaged brand there are lessons for the left across europe including in the uk though the fractured nature of the italian centre left is spectacularly unique first that if the social democratic brand is damaged it might be more effective to fold it into something bigger an electoral pact that can stretch from the anti capitalist left through to greens and liberal centrists second that it is
