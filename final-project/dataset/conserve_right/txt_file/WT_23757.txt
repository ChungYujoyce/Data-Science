icy florida race for house seat becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion psychiatrists detect liars by certain tells eye movement physical posture repeating questions to buy time to think of lies whenever moscow starts talking about preserving world peace through arms control we should know from long experience they are lying indeed russia s arms control proposals are a perfect tell about which u s weapons should not be limited or eliminated arms control for russia is an instrument of aggression used by moscow to disarm the united states while moscow cheats on treaties for strategic advantage top stories cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender on july 17 russia s deputy foreign minister sergey ryabkov told the u s delegation meeting in geneva switzerland to discuss extending the new strategic arms reduction treaty new start that any hypothetically possible new agreement or treaty with the united states in the area of arms control must necessarily limit u s missile defense capabilities or as russia s sputnik news service headlined new start treaty must link control over offensive defensive strategic threats july 17 2019 in other words if the united states wants new start that supposedly limits russian long range nuclear missiles and bombers to continue the united states must lower or eliminate america s and nato s missile defenses what moscow wants especially is a guarantee that president trump s u s space force will not resurrect president ronald reagan s strategic defense initiative and space based missile defenses to shield america and nato from russian nuclear aggression so what russia is telling us in geneva without meaning to is that the best way for the united states and nato to deter and defeat russian nuclear aggression is to build space based missile defenses as soon as possible pollyannas in the state department and the arms control association foolishly believe russia really feels threatened by u s space based and other missile defenses because protecting the peoples of america and european nato betrays mutual assured destruction mad but moscow never believed in the principle of mad moscow used the anti ballistic missile abm treaty to ensure mutual assured destruction would not be mutual the abm treaty left americans unprotected from nuclear annihilation while moscow s abm system today protects european russia where most of its population is located subsequently moscow cheated on the abm treaty by deploying nationwide defenses comprising thousands of surface to air missiles sams capable of intercepting everything missiles cruise missiles and bombers the united states dismantled its abm system in 1975 resurrecting in 2002 an inadequate dumbed down national missile defense that is challenged to defend americans even from north korea moscow fears mr trump will deploy space based missile defenses that would be highly effective and defeat russian plans to win a nuclear war for example ambassador henry cooper former director of sdi proposes deploying brilliant pebbles a space based missile defense canceled by president clinton brilliant pebbles would cost 20 billion could begin deployment in mr trump s second term and could shield america from hundreds of nuclear missiles launched by russia china north korea or iran a russian disarming nuclear first strike against u s missiles and bombers has very high damage goals seeking to destroy 90 percent of u s strategic forces even if u s space based missile defenses are only partially successful degrading a first strike from russia or china by 10 percent to 20 percent this would very significantly erode first strike effectiveness and greatly strengthen deterrence in geneva russia s highest diplomatic priority is to prevent the u s space force from becoming a space based missile shield against moscow s nuclear first strike capabilities why are we in geneva begging russia to extend new start anyway have we learned nothing from moscow s long history of cheating on arms control agreements see the case against arms control realcleardefense com june 24 2019 the state department asserts russia is in compliance with new start but how do they know the heritage foundation report new start potemkin village verification june 24 2010 got it absolutely right the new start verification regime is not sufficient to detect large scale cheating by the russian federation as past experience has shown inadequate verification measures are likely to be exploited russia can deploy many more warheads and missiles than allowed by the treaty with little risk of detection for example new start inspections 18 annually are limited to declared missile and bomber sites short notice verification inspections have essentially been abolished providing more time to hide or remove items from the inspection site under new start there is no limit on the size of russian missile bases the entire country can now be a mobile missile base the verification of actual deployed ballistic missile warheads is made much more difficult by the elimination of start limits on the size and power of ballistic missiles and the removal of all constraints on the number of warheads that can be tested on ballistic missiles and deployed bombers under new start it is clearly legal to encrypt telemetry for every flight test new start allows the inspected party to place covers over the reentry vehicles which russia has used to impede the visual counting of the number of reentry vehicles actually deployed on missiles president trump america doesn t need another worthless arms control treaty with russia china north korea or iran we need space based missile defenses like brilliant pebbles peter
