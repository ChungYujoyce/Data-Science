val demings d fla told fox news that she is absolutely honored to be on the list of potential running mates for the presumptive democratic presidential nominee former vice president joe biden i aposve worked extremely hard to try to improve the quality of life for people living in the greatest country in the world demings told fox news i aposve tried to make my community stronger safer and better and i guess the vice president and others have taken a look at that work and we aposll see what happens demings has dedicated her life to being a public servant she was alaw enforcement officer of 27 years and became orlando s first female chief of police in 2007 in an interview with fox news demings sharedher insights into the shooting deaths of unarmed 25 year old ahmaud arbery and 26 year old louisville emt breonna taylor arbery wasthe georgia jogger who was allegedy shot by a white fathergregory mcmichael 64 and son travis mcmichael 34 on february 23 the elder mcmichael is a former police officer who spent nearly 40 years in the law enforcement field for the entire month of march and april arbery aposs family had to see gregory and travis mcmichael walk freely around their glynn county town justice has to be fair but justice has to be swift said demings i think it was a painful reminder to ahmaud s parents that their son for some reason deserved to lose his life in such a tragic way if you review the video it is clear and convincing that there is enough probable cause to have made those arrests that day several days after arbery s death brunswick district attorney jackie johnson recused her office from the case arbery s case was then assigned to the waycross district attorney george barnhill who also recused himself barnhill did argue however against filing charges in a letter he sent to law enforcement prior to removing himself from the case in the april 2 letter he wrote it appears their intent was to stop and hold this criminal suspect until law enforcement arrived under georgia law this is perfectly legal demings noted that lawmakers must scrutinize the circumstances of the case including the citizen s arrest statute that barnhill cited this went all bad and we as a nation have an obligation to do a complete and thorough investigation not just in terms of the prosecution of the persons who murdered him but also to look at our laws and change that which needs to be changed said demings this is yet another critical moment for our nation it s another critical turning point and we need to get it right new video shows ahmaud arbery chased for 4 minutes by father and son who shot him lawyer demings continued that local jurisdictions must also reevaluate their policies and procedures as they pertain to no knock warrants which allowpolice officers to enter certain premises without first knocking and announcing their presence or purpose beforeentering the premises no knock warrantsare at the center of the police killing of breonna taylor they aposre extremely dangerous explained demings they aposre extremely high risk and this is just the tragedy that has occurred that obviously should not have occurred the louisville metro police department police were reportedly advised to carry out a no knock warrant on taylor s home as part of a drug investigation on a home 10 miles away neither taylor nor her boyfriend kenneth walker were the investigation aposs target or had any criminal history police shot taylor eight times and she died whilethey were executing the warrant my advice at this point in the investigation would be to look at aposno knock aposwarrants said demings i understand as a law enforcement officer why they are done and they aposre done to make sure that evidence is not being destroyed but human life the preservation of human life especially the life of the innocent is the most important responsibility that we all have family of kentucky emt shot by police executing search warrant files lawsuit walker wasinside taylor s home when officers executed the warrant according to a lawsuit filed by taylor s family walker shot at officers with his licensed weapon when they attempted to enter without announcing who they were and why they were there kentucky is a castle doctrine state and has a stand your ground law but walker was arrested and is facing charges of first degree assault and attempted murder of a police officer i aposll put it this way said demings if i believed that someone was breaking into my house and there was no warning from the police i would do everything within my power to defend myself and my family taylor s case is currently being investigated by federal authorities demings said she is glad to hear that the department of justice is looking to see if hate crimes would be appropriate in this case she noted however
