iraq and syria he said the u s will not relent in fighting remnants of the extremist organization despite his decision to withdraw u s troops from syria over the objections of some of his most senior national security advisers the president told representatives of a 79 member u s led coalition fighting is that the militants held a tiny percentage of the vast territory they claimed as their

weeks that is has lost 99 5 percent of its territory and is holding on to fewer than 5 square kilometers in syria or less than 2 square miles in the villages of the middle euphrates river valley where the bulk of the fighters are concentrated but there are fears the impending u s pullout will imperil those gains trump told coalition members meeting at the state department that while remnants of the group were still dangerous he was determined to bring u s troops home he called on coalition members to step up and do their fair share in the fight against terrorism even as trump and secretary of
