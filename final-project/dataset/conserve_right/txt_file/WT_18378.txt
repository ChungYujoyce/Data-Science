apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic following recent tests of anti satellite missiles and near space hypersonic vehicles china s military will soon create a new space force within the people s liberation army a sign beijing is preparing for future space warfare military analysts say there has been no official announcement of the new space warfare unit however unofficial sources in china revealed the unit will be part of a new strategic support forces service that will include nuclear missiles currently under the second artillery force along with an electronic information forces cyber warfare units and electronic and signals intelligence the shift to space and information warfare is part of a major military reorganization that has been underway in china for the past several years it s designed to transform the once ground forces heavy pla into a high technology force see also terrorism pulls an anti war president back onto the battlefield china conducted the sixth test of a hypersonic strike vehicle on nov 23 after having carried out an anti satellite missile test on oct 30 both weapons are part of china s large scale high technology arms buildup a chinese internet military blogger posted photos of a purported flight test on dec 13 in northwestern china of what was described as either a missile defense interceptor test or anti satellite missile test as reported by inside the ring on oct 15 the annual report of the u s china economic and security review commission warned that china is pursuing a broad and robust array of counterspace capabilities which includes direct ascent anti satellite missiles co orbital anti satellite systems computer network operations ground based satellite jammers and directed energy weapons see also white house urges ethiopia to release journalists the strategic support forces appear to have been inspired by the u s strategic command which also controls missiles space assets and cyberwarfare said rick fisher a chinese military affairs specialist it appears that the space force will control china s military and commercial satellite program its manned space program plus an increasing number of space combat programs the new unit also is expected to control china s future strategic missile defense forces mr fisher with the international assessment and strategy center said in addition to ground launched anti satellite missiles future pla space weapons may include aircraft launched asats laser armed low earth orbit combat platforms low earth orbit bombers and dual use civilian military space shuttles mr fisher said there are increasing signs that china plans to send astronauts to land on the moon in the late 2020s to early 2030s and the missions will include military capabilities it is also possible that the first commander of the space force has real star wars experience mr fisher said an unofficial list of new pla commanders listed maj gen li shangfu as the first commander of the space force gen li currently is deputy chief of the pla general armaments department and the manned space program and is likely chief of the xichang satellite launch center where the pla has carried out early asat tests perhaps including its first successful satellite interception on jan 11 2007 that missile test against a chinese weather satellite created tens of thousands of pieces of space debris that still threaten both manned and unmanned space flights mr fisher believes the primary mission of the new space force is to achieve control of low earth orbit in order to defeat the united states on earth there should be no civil space cooperation with china as long as there is any chance its exposure to u s space technology could help china to kill americans he told inside the ring the dissident chinese news outlet bowen press reported dec 8 that the space support forces will include three branches strategic missiles electronic warfare and space forces the space support forces will be headed by gen wei fenghe current commander of the missile forces and its political commissar will be lt gen wang jiasheng the space support forces will have standing within the pla to the chinese

china s development of hypersonic strike vehicles the report chinese ballistic missiles using hyperglide vehicles a quick reference guide reveals several strike vehicles are being developed by the chinese military for use on beijing s arsenal of missiles the list includes the df zf hypersonic glide vehicle that u s intelligence agencies believe will be used to deliver nuclear warheads against strategic missile defenses the pentagon also is developing hypersonic strike vehicles but u s weapons designers are focused on non nuclear high speed maneuvering attack vehicles as part of the prompt global strike program the program is seeking advanced conventional weapons and technologies that can strike any place on earth in minutes chinese hypersonic gliders also are expected to be used for conventional precision strike in much the same way as the new df 26 intermediate range ballistic missile the road mobile df 26 was unveiled during a military parade in beijing in september and can be armed with either a nuclear warhead or a precision guided conventional warhead capable of hitting ships at sea chinese officials have claimed china is building up both nuclear forces and conventional military as part of a strategic forces modernization that remains hidden behind a cloak of secrecy china has conducted six tests of the df zf all boosted with ballistic missiles the vehicle is estimated to fly at speeds of between mach 5 and mach 10 between 3 836 mph and 7 680 mph in october the chinese military technical journal winged missiles stated hypersonic guided weapons which are based on boost glide ballistics can score long range rapid precision strikes they demonstrate excellent defense penetration performance which is in line with u s mindset navy adm cecil haney commander of the u s strategic command said in an interview in july that the hypersonic glide vehicles are an emerging threat as i look at that hypersonic threat clearly the mobility the flight profile those kinds of things are things we have to keep in mind and be able to address across that full kill chain he said contact bill ge
