i think there will continue to be questions in people s minds about the russians he noted that mueller s mandate was narrow he that frankly if i were a prosecutor trying to find evidence of criminal intent in donald trump i don t think he has criminal intent i think he s just got a basically empty skull so it would be very hard to prove that and i think mueller probably realized that pretty early on solberg said the conclusion of the mueller investigation doesn t mean trump is in the clear noting that he remains under investigation by the federal prosecutors in new york trump supporter richard

one witch hunt after another basically if they could have found anything they would have tucker says he s confident that mueller did what he was hired to do and has mixed feelings about whether democrats should have pressed for an investigation into trump s russia ties tucker said he considers himself an independent voter but would vote for trump again compared to anyone currently in the

think he went with russia at all he added he s a businessman he was never a politician politicians to me they re just a bunch of crooks they promise you one thing and they do another while democrats

2016 election former secretary of state hillary clinton and the whereabouts of thousands of deleted emails in detroit 36 year old william braasch has been following the mueller probe from its start and while disappointed in what barr released sunday afternoon he s not surprised braasch a registered nurse said i honestly doubted that much would come out given that barr was appointed by trump i m not any more let down than i would have been before with this administration and the investigations braasch added that he is looking forward to congressional investigations of trump and investigations

has been a us citizen since 1981 she describes herself as republican leaning but says she voted for hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential contest arani said the full report should absolutely be made public immediately in the name of full transparency she says the public must see the report especially before the next election she also says the white house shouldn t be allowed to spin the results trump is famous for lying too much arani trusts mueller i m sure based on his excellent reputation that he did a complete job in his investigation but he is in between a rock and a hard place politically arani personally believes that there was likely collusion between the trump campaign and russia but it s possible that a lot of stuff wasn t disclosed from the lower levels to the top within the campaign they might have kept trump in the dark on purpose so he could stay beneath it all maybe that was his idea too nora kubiaczyk pronounced koo bee ah che lives in minneapolis works in advertising leans democratic and considers herself pretty liberal she voted for clinton in 2016 in an interview sunday in downtown minneapolis she said i m not shocked it seems like with each of these investigations there s always going to seem like something like it s a coup or there s somebody that seems like a smoking gun and then it will be like yesterday s news in no moment and trump will keep walking on she said it seemed there moments where mueller was going after trump and others where there were a couple fumbles 7 10 p m many republicans are cheering and democrats are scoffing as first word on the details of special counsel robert mueller s investigation emerge for supporters of president donald trump the four page summary of the investigative findings released by attorney general william barr felt like an exoneration of the man they back for trump s opponents some of whom had visions of the mueller s work ending with the president being led away in handcuffs it is a disappointment what seemed certain in the wake of sunday s release was that it marked no end to the political divide to the fierce criticism of trump or to calls for more of mueller s report to be
