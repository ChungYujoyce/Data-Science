tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion here s how truly detestable america s media has become on easter sunday msnbc decided to ambush special counsel robert mueller as he attended services across from the white house at st john s episcopal church we knew that he was going to be he s been there he s been there in the past so we waited for him msnbc reporter mike viqueira proudly said on air he came out the side door of the church i did have a couple of prepared questions to ask him top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century then msnbc showed the footage sir could i ask you a couple of questions will you testify before congress sir mr viqueira asks mr mueller right next to him as the special counsel tries to get into his car no comment mr mueller answers are you sure about that sir mr viqueira says no comment mr mueller repeats if he were anybody but the president would mr trump be indicted sir mr viqueira says nearly shoving the microphone into mr mueller s face no response sir why didn t you make a recommendation to congress one way or the other sir did the attorney general accurately characterize your positions on conspiracy and obstruction sir mr mueller again stays mum then climbs into his car and nearly closes the door on mr viqueira and his mic the shot cuts back to mr viqueira now outside the white house i think it s accurate to characterize director mueller as being tight lipped to my questions mr viqueira says smiling smugly msnbc host joy reid can be heard laughing at the reporter s incredible wit condemnation for the episode of ambush journalism was universal but actress patricia heaton had the perfect tweet hello msnbc the everybody loves raymond actress tweeted today is easter sunday the holiest day of the christian calendar some of the faithful were murdered today while they worshiped but you ambush robert mueller outside of his church and chuckle about it afterward this is loathesome shame on you others joined in on twitter msnbc just proved itself to be the human troll network and is also doubling down apparently proud of this grotesque display of human indecency after a worship service on a spiritual holiday one user tweeted this harassment outside easter service is outrageous msnbc often typifies the very worst of the dismal state of journalism in america today fourth estate please do better another tweeted and then they laughed after they shared their clip on the air wow a third tweeted the ambush came after mr mueller s long awaited report failed to establish any smoking gun in allegations that president trump or members of his campaign had colluded with russia to alter the outcome of the 2016 election before the report the mainstream media blasted the trumped up charges for more than two years the noose is tightening msnbc s joe scarborough said does the public understand just how much trouble the president is in if not that is a failing of the press cnn s brian stelter said there is tons of proof of potential collusion cnn s chris cuomo said mr trump was investigated for 675 days by mr mueller and a team of 19 lawyers despite 2 800 subpoenas and 500 witness interviews the counsel s office found no evidence that any u s person or trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the russians with that poof the story fell apart yes angry democrats in congress will demand testimony from top administration officials subpoena reams of documents and perhaps even pursue impeachment but the failure of mr mueller who had been widely praised by the liberal media and democrats for being a fair and impartial judge means the story is at least in the minds of most american voters over the real fallout though will come for the media they had hyped this story often with unnamed sources and virtually no real facts for so long that giving it up will be next to impossible and so far they ve learned nothing from the debacle cnn president jeff zucker said in an email to the new york times that he was entirely comfortable with cnn s trump russia coverage adding that the news network was simply reporting facts for his part cnn s mr stelter said speculation actually has value too it helps open our eyes helps open our minds to what s possible that s where america s media is today they re speculators they all come with a viewpoint even though the dishonest like mr zucker and mr stelter say they are journalists and they don t much care about facts which is exactly what mr trump has been saying for years on tuesday he went even further i wonder if the new york times will apologize to me a second time as they did after the 2016 election but this one will have to be a far bigger better apology on this one they will have to get down on their knees beg for forgiveness they are truly the enemy of the people he tweeted don t hold your breath mr president joseph curl covered the white house and politics for a decade for the washington times he can be reached at emailprotected and on twitter j
