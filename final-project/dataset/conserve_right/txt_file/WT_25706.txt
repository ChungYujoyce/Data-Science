 home policy florida race for house seat becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn for nearly two years democrats figured rod rosenstein was their man in the mueller investigation they fought vehemently to keep him from being fired they even went to court to try to make him acting attorney general republicans meanwhile were so furious with the deputy attorney general that some drew up articles of impeachment last year yet it was mr rosenstein who spent the weekend ensconced with new attorney general william p barr reading special counsel robert mueller s report then joining in the conclusion that president trump not only didn t engage in any conspiracy to subvert the 2016 election but also should not be charged with obstruction of justice top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey experts say democrats unfairly decided mr rosenstein was their trump slayer when he was simply a government official trying to manage a fair investigation i remember when rosenstein supposedly was going to be fired and all the democrats were increasingly concerned thinking that he was on their side said ian prior a former justice department official he wasn t on anyone s side he was on the side of the rule of law and a fair but thorough investigation in the aftermath of mr mueller s report and its no collusion conclusion democrats feelings toward mr rosenstein have shifted sen sheldon whitehouse rhode island democrat said sunday that senators must haul him along with mr barr and mr mueller up to the capitol and have them sitting side by side to talk about how they reached their conclusions mr rosenstein has gone from democratic darling to democratic whipping boy but analysts say documents from the mueller investigation better reflect the complex role he played in the probe of russian meddling in the 2016 election mr rosenstein signed off on some of the most controversial decisions involving the probe s investigation of mr trump including the fourth search warrant authorizing the fbi to spy on former trump campaign official carter page and the rosenstein authored memo that mr trump used to justify firing then fbi director james b comey in 2017 little more than a week after that mr rosenstein created the special counsel s investigation and tapped mr mueller to lead it now mr rosenstein has signed off on mr mueller s conclusions as expressed by mr barr s summary matthew miller who served as justice department spokesman for obama era attorney general eric h holder jr is among those who say mr rosenstein s legacy is tainted i think his role in the comey firing was inexcusable and part of the reason he appointed mueller was to repair the damage that did to his reputation mr miller said that will always be a black mark on his record he did the best he could to remove that black mark but it doesn t fully expunge the record more broadly mr miller said mr rosenstein managed to protect the mueller probe itself despite fears to the contrary mr trump never fired either mr mueller or mr rosenstein yet mr miller said protecting the probe meant giving in to the president on things he shouldn t have among those was caving to mr trump s demand for an inspector general s probe of whether the fbi inserted a spy into his campaign that was such a dangerous precedent to set giving the president that investigation because he asked for it mr miller said mr trump for his part appeared on the verge of firing mr rosenstein last year after a raid on the office of his personal attorney michael cohen the cohen case was based in part of a referral from the special counsel and mr rosenstein personally approved the search at the time senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat warned mr trump not to go down that path any attempt to remove rod rosenstein will create the exact same constitutional crisis as if you fired special counsel mueller mr schumer said don t do it do not go down this path for the sake of our country we plead with you don t put this country through a constitutional crisis from the right meanwhile staunch trump ally rep jim jordan threatened to impeach mr rosenstein if he did not hand over documents related to the justice department s probe into hillary clinton s use of an email server the impeachment articles also accused mr rosenstein of failing to appoint a second special counsel to review the fbi s actions in the russia probe and the proposed impeachment demanded mr rosenstein recuse himself from the russia probe tensions boiled over in a hearing last year after a stern line of questioning mr jordan told mr rosenstein it wasn t personal sometimes it feels that way the deputy attorney general replied you saw when jordan went after him in the hearing you saw him say i take a lot but don t tell me that i m dishonorable said jim trusty a former justice department official who has known mr rosenstein for 20 years when you get to the core of suggesting he s corrupt he ll fight back a spokesperson for mr jordan did not return multiple calls and emails requesting comment mr rosenstein survived another rough patch after it was revealed he d suggested wiretapping the president and according to the new york times discussed invoking the 25th amendment to remove mr trump from office mr rosenstein called the claims factually inaccurate he and mr trump would later clear the air in an air force one meeting and the president s public criticism of the man he appointed to the no 2 post at the justice department diminished this isn t inside knowledge but i think the president recognized that rod is truly an honorable guy and not a contestant on the apprentice that the president could shake up with threats mr trusty said it is the classic schoolyard situation where trump realized this guy is not rattled by his stuff and there is begrudging respect for that mr rosenstein is set to exit the justice department shortly a move announced just after mr barr was confirmed to helm the department both mr prior and mr trusty say mr rosenstein s stewardship of the mueller probe will be well remembered by history it s going to be interesting to see whether people who were drawing red lines to protect rod will suddenly remember he is a conservative hack just out to protect his friend the president and on the other side if you have freedom caucus people say i threatened to lock him up but he s
