barrage of attacks on their characters republican presidential contenders ben carson and marco rubio have started to fight back against their party rivals and the news media mr carson took the most aggressive stance sunday blasting news outlets for what he described as unfairly targeting him with unsubstantiated accusations that he lied about events in his inspirational life story the retired pediatric neurosurgeon said he had no choice but to go on offensive see also republicans media bias claims boosted by scarcity of right leaning journalists i simply cannot sit still and watch unfairness i m always going to call it out mr carson told cnn while on the campaign trail in puerto rico he said a report by politico that he fabricated a story about being offered a scholarship to west point a report that the carson campaign disputed was obviously a hit job the u s military academy at west point does not offer scholarships and mr carson never applied to the military university but he insisted that as a top rotc student he was offered an appointment which amounts to a full scholarship photos ben carson marco rubio fight back against media republican rivals in a separate interview aired on nbc s meet the press mr carson said the scrutiny he is receiving has gone far beyond what other candidates have been subjected to mr carson said the news media s treatment of him was not even close to that of president obama including questions about mr obama s birth certificate and whether he was eligible for the presidency as a natural born u s citizen he said he was being targeted because i m a threat to the progressives and the secular progress movement in this country i m a very big threat they can look at the polling data and they can see that i m the candidate most likely to beat hillary clinton meanwhile mr rubio released reams of credit card statements to answer accusations that he mismanaged his personal finances and misused a florida republican party credit card when he was speaker of the florida house of representatives the statements from 2005 and 2006 showed that mr rubio used the party s american express card to pay for a portion of a trip to las vegas auto repairs tiling and charges at a children s sports activity center but mr rubio paid the credit card bills out of 484 charges that totaled 64 777 eight were for personal expenses that totaled 7 243 the rubio campaign said the disclosure showed that the attacks were a nothingburger the west point story was one of several reports by news outlets that challenged accounts in mr carson s autobiography gifted hands which chronicled his rise from severe poverty in a detroit ghetto to become an acclaimed neurosurgeon at johns hopkins hospital a report in the wall street journal raised doubts about mr carson s account of standing out as the most honest student in a psychology course at yale university a report by cnn questioned his claims of having a violent temper as a youth and having protected white students during 1968 race riots mr carson said his campaign easily found evidence to support his story about yale and he questioned why a major newspaper failed to do the same he said his campaign would soon release the information he faulted the cnn report for being based on its failure to find eyewitnesses to events that occurred more than 40 years ago there s no question i m getting special scrutiny because there are lot of people who are very threatened and then they have seen the recent head to head polling against hillary and how well i do and they are worried mr carson said on the cbs program face the nation there is no question about it he said the whole point is to distract distract the populace distract me trump s take as they have risen in the polls and established themselves as top contenders in the race mr carson and mr rubio increasingly have become focuses of investigative reporters and for republican presidential front runner donald trump mr carson has been running a close second to mr trump in recent polls while mr rubio vies with ted cruz for third place the standings in the polls will place mr trump and mr carson at center stage for the republican debate tuesday in milwaukee they will be flanked by mr cruz mr rubio and four other contenders for the prime time debate six other republican candidates will face off at an earlier debate for those with the lowest poll numbers mr carson and mr rubio also fired back at mr trump who has been quick to use news reports to criticize and discredit his rivals mr trump recently said mr rubio was a disaster with his credit cards he has a very bad record of finances with his houses he certainly lives above his means there is no question about that the real estate mogul said mr rubio responded i find it ironic that the only person running for president that has ever declared bankruptcy four times in the last 25 years is attacking anyone on finances confronted with mr rubio s statement on meet the press mr trump said he declared bankruptcy for his corporations taking advantage of u s laws to succeed in business all of those deals in a sense they worked out and worked out in some cases really really well but i used the laws of the land no different than many of the names that you talk about all the time the billionaire businessman said adding that he hopes the credit card thing works out for mr rubio if he gave the information it will be easy probably very easy to see whether or not anything was done wrong mr trump said and frankly i hope nothing was done that was wrong because that would be really terrible to be disqualified for that mr carson said mr trump s rush to join in the attacks raises doubts about whether he has the temperament to be commander in chief mr trump last week tweeted that the reports exposed one of many lies by mr carson and called it the beginning of the end of the carson campaign it s been proven that it wasn t a lie and none of the things are lies mr carson said on abc s this week what does it say about people who immediately jump on the bandwagon when they hear something bad rather than waiting and finding out what the truth is let me put it this way mr carson said i would not be anxious to have a commander in chief who acted that way mr trump who followed mr carson on the show said the stories of violence in mr carson s childhood were disturbing whether true or fabricated look i hope it all works out for him it s a strange situation though when you talk about hitting your mother in the head with a hammer and hitting your friend in the face with a padlock when you talk about stabbing somebody but the belt buckle saved them mr trump said in his book and speeches mr carson has told about how he overcame a violent temper and became a successful student and doctor it s a weird deal going on said mr trump and i hope it all works out because i don t want to see ben have problems over this stuff and you know it is a very strange situation mr trump also took a jab at mr carson for describing his violent temper as a pathology in the book which mr carson co wrote he said he had pathological disease when you have pathological disease that is a very serious problem that s not something that is cured mr trump said that is something that you have to live with and that is a very serious thing to have to
