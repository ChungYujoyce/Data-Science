democrats would cost too much harm the economy and worsen americans health m4a will be neither more efficient nor cheaper than the current system and it could adversely affect health said the report from the white house council of economic advisers with democratic presidential contenders pushing a far left agenda to appeal to primary voters some such as sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts have raised the idea of packing the nine seat supreme court with as many as six new justices reporter saagar enjeti of the daily caller asked mr trump if he would entertain such a proposal for the high court which has a conservative majority thanks to mr trump s two successful nominees justices neil m gorsuch and brett m kavanaugh i wouldn t entertain that mr trump replied i can guarantee it won t happen for six years we have no interest in that whatsoever mr trump said the only reason democrats are pushing the idea is that they want to try to catch up if they can t catch up through the ballot box by winning an election they want to try to do it a different way mr trump said as long as the gop holds the majority in the senate it s unlikely a democratic president could add more justices it would take an act of congress to change the number on the high court president franklin d roosevelt attempted to pack the high court with new seats in 1937 after watching the justices deal setbacks to his new deal initiatives that legislation was not popular with the public and ultimately stalled having beaten back the surging tide of liberal ideas for one more day at least the president also went

court documents revealed that mr mccain sent the fake dossier to the fbi and media hoping to have it printed before the election he the dems working together failed mr trump also criticized mr mccain for failing to provide the crucial vote to repeal obamacare in july 2018 shortly before his death from brain cancer the criticism prompted meghan mccain the late senator s daughter to say of the president he will never be a great man mr trump said of mr mccain tuesday i m very unhappy that he didn t repeal and replace obamacare he campaigned on repealing and replacing obamacare for years and then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down if mr mccain had provided the decisive vote the president said our country would have saved a trillion and we would have had great health care i think that s disgraceful he said of the late senator s action the president s remarks prompted sen mitt romney utah republican to tweet tuesday night i can t understand why the president would once again
