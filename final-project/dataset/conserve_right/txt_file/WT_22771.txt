apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion precipitously and with no plan in place president trump late last year announced his intention to withdraw all u s troops from syria until then roughly 2 000 special operators backed by combat aircraft had exemplified the concept of economy of force achieving a lot with a little enabling local allies to fight much more effectively than they could have on their own they decimated the islamic state and helped contain the islamic republic of iran it seemed to me and others mr trump s top military and national security advisers among them that he had made a significant and unforced error one that could only encourage america s adversaries in the middle east and beyond e g pyongyang moscow beijing and suburban kandahar top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties then last friday the president changed his mind deciding to leave about 400 troops in syria can a force of that size do the job that needs to be done no but some european allies who have been sharply critical of mr trump s decision to bug out are now considering committing more of their own troops to make up the difference in other words mr trump may succeed in getting europeans to do serious burden sharing in this by no means ended conflict if so credit is due to sen lindsey graham who pushed hard for such a plan both with the president in private and publicly at the annual international security conference in munich earlier this month mr graham was quick to praise the commander in chief for deciding to follow sound military advice thereby ensuring that we will not repeat the mistakes of iraq in syria for a small fraction of the forces we have had in syria we can accomplish our national security objectives well done mr president this episode raises a broader strategic issue significant factions on both the left and right are adamant that america not be the world s policeman a question that should arise if the united states won t do that job who will not denmark japan or costa rica the united nations isn t up to the task and never will be but if no one stands up to international thugs and gangsters we know what happens they take over country after country region after region isolationists on the right say so what beyond our borders it s not our business they will appear to be correct until it becomes obvious they were disastrously wrong as they were in the 1930s when they contended that the united states should do nothing to stop the nazis and japanese imperialists the most hardcore isolationists on the right still believe that isolationists on the left agree but for a different reason they see america as oppressive and they are oddly unconcerned about what chinese communists do to uighurs and tibetans what bolivarian socialists have done to venezuela and what theocrats in tehran are doing to syrians lebanese yemenis and iraqis the most hardcore isolationists on the left still blame the united states for the cold war nevertheless i m not going to make a case for america as global policeman but is it not possible to steer a path between interventionism and isolationism what if the united states were to see itself not as a policeman but as a sheriff instead unlike the cop on the beat the lawman in the wild west isn t expected to make arrests for every transgression he doesn t worry about the painted ladies and the gamblers in the saloon but he will appoint deputies and raise a posse to stop the worst outlaws from riding roughshod throughout the territory this concept is not new back in 1997 a time when most people still believed russia was democratizing and china moderating a time when jihad was a word seldom heard richard haass a diplomat and scholar now president of the council on foreign relations wrote a book titled the reluctant sheriff the united states after the cold war in it he noted that the policeman has a greater degree of authority a greater capacity to act alone and a greater need to act consistently than is being advocated here by contrast a sheriff must understand his lack of clear authority in many instances his need to work with others and above all the need to be discriminating in when and how he engages mr haass likened posses to coalitions that will vary from situation to situation as will the purpose and even authority what will be constant is the requirement for american leadership and participation from states and actors willing and able to contribute in some form in an email exchange with me last week mr haass wrote the bottom line is that the u s as sheriff is essential because the world doesn t order itself and there is no other candidate with the capacity habits etc he added what trump seems to miss is that the benefits of our fulfilling that role far outweigh the costs and the costs are high if we do not assume that role yes but with prodding from sen graham and other wise men the president s views appear to be evolving no less consequential europeans may be recognizing that they sometimes have to load their six shooters saddle up and join the posse the alternative is to be left alone watching the sheriff ride off into the sunset clifford d may is president of the foundation for defense of democracies and a columnist for the washing
