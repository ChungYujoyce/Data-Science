apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion president trump climbed up to the rostrum in the house chamber tuesday night believing he could convince democratic leaders to give him the 5 7 billion to build his wall along the mexican u s border his speech was thickly layered with pleas for bipartisan unity but they came across as phony as a three dollar bill house speaker nancy pelosi sat behind him with a stone faced expression on her face that said you ve got to be kidding me top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender for the past two years democratic leaders have been pummeled by mr trump with an assortment of name calling while they made it clear the money request was a non starter he had threatened democrats slapped his hand on the table and walked out of a negotiating session believing this was the way to get things done it wasn t mr trump thought she was a lightweight and ordered a partial government shutdown the longest in u s history to see who would blink first in the end as polls showed that americans didn t like mr trump s tough guy tactics and as the shutdown hurt the economy he grudgingly caved in still warning that he could reignite the shutdown or declare a national crisis on the border and use existing budget funds in the defense department to build his wall the u s constitution declares that only congress can appropriate public funds but mr trump said he would ignore that and go ahead on his own a risky undemocratic play that would end up in the federal courts certainly for weeks or months compare mr trump s bullying style with president ronald reagan s personal negotiating approach in 1981 when he and democratic house speaker tip o neill would get together at the white house in the afternoon over a beer reagan needed to get his tax cuts passed and mr o neill wasn t budging but the two of them continued talking as the president s men lobbied conservative democrats like phil gramm of texas among others and reagan got his tax cuts without a cross word between them as for mr trump s sotu speech it was a lot of sound and fury held together by a grab bag of exaggerated facts and dubious economic figures take for example mr trump s statement that wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades wages rose 3 1 percent from december 2017 to december 2018 according to the labor department says glenn kessler the washington post s fact checker but he adds that when that figure is adjusted for inflation wages for all workers grew 1 3 percent from december 2017 to december 2018 making the increase only the largest since august 2016 mr kessler reports but how about the whopper mr trump told about the tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars but the exporters do not pay the tariffs it is the importer who in turn passes it on to consumers mr kessler says he adds that a study by the council on foreign relations estimated that 115 percent of the money raised from tariffs is being used by the administration to aid farmers hurt by tariffs so it s a net loser then mr trump declared as he has many times before that tens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities including meth heroin cocaine and fentanyl it is true that most drugs come into the united states across the southern border with mexico writes mr kessler but a wall would not necessarily stanch the flow as much of these drugs are smuggled through legal points of entry or underground tunnels mr trump further declared that the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety security and financial well being of all americans but by any available measure there is no new security crisis at the border mr kessler says apprehensions of people trying to cross the southern border have been in decline since 2000 he reports that decline is partly because of technology upgrades tougher penalties in the wake of the 9 11 terrorist attacks a decline in migration rates from mexico and a sharp increase in the number of border patrol officers that 5 7 billion mr trump wants to build his wall can be better spent on far more important problems donald lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to the washing
