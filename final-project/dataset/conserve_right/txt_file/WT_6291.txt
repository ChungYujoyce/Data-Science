be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion getting out of afghanistan leaving the inf treaty iran s nuclear program dealing with north korea and china are perhaps the most significant national security issue sets of the day however many will continue past the 2020 election the trump administration is dealing with these matters with the most reality and efficiency seen in washington since the reagan administration however the realities of these complex matters continue to have both positive and negative aspects for us leaving afghanistan will basically concede that region to taliban isis tribal rule and most experts understand this in short it will be similar to how the vietnam war ended when we left vietnam and basically conceded the south to the north as long as we understand this reality it is a sound move to get our troops out of afghanistan top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens leaving the inf treaty was long overdue the soviets now russians sign arms control agreements to control limit our military capabilities and not their own the agreements they negotiate are replete with built in cheating scenarios and written in two equally authentic languages facilitating unilateral interpretations that violate even the most basic terms of the treaties we see this with their goofy explanations and denials of cheating in both the inf and start agreements cheating on arms control is a very basic policy of russia and former kgb thug putin iran has had a nuclear weapons program for many years a poorly kept secret do they have the technology to make nuclear weapons for sure have they produced the necessary special nuclear material they need to do it seems little doubt about this either could they build a nuclear weapon with a high degree of confidence that it would work without testing it good question has little kim already tested one for them even better question perhaps if they perfected nuclear weapons would they actually use them or allow them to be used by the many radical terrorist factions they have long supported it seems an unacceptably high risk that this could happen because fanatical iran is not likely motivated by traditional mutual assured destruction or mad concepts this is why our policy through democratic and republican administrations has long been that iran will not be permitted to develop nuclear weapons could this also mean pre emptive strikes another good question and one with a large international consensus if it was necessary north korea will likely not give up its nuclear weapons and we are seeing the same behaviors from new kim that we saw from his corrupt family regime perhaps a reality mr kim would respond to is the nuclearization of the pacific region for example if japan and or australia or others in the pacific region began to seriously consider nuclear weapons or establishing joint nuclear arrangements with us china might actually take custody of mr kim s nukes meantime however china will continue to be totally complicit with mr kim s aggressive behaviors each missile and nuclear test mr kim conducts is with the express permission approval of china china has been in an undeclared war with us and the west since the 1950s and regards americans as fat lazy and stupid and they steal us blind this includes masses of our exploitable personal data technology and intellectual property they always have and always will the only factor motivating them in these matters and in trade disputes is money money in the form of fines penalties sanctions and tariffs which sharply reduce their profits accordingly our leverage with china is simple they have to trade with us and they know it as far as dealing with the chinese in arms control national security discussions we must realize that they view deception as the most important and basic concept of their long term war with us for example do we know or will we ever know how many nukes the chinese have i think not and we also could never believe information they provided about their nuclear weapons sun tzu s famous quote on the art of war is that all warfare is based on deception little of significance may happen with these matters excepting afghanistan and inf until after the 2020 election this because the other parties to these dynamics believe they will get a better deal with a new administration in other words dealing with mr trump is something none of them prefer to do but that aspect demonstrates the important leverages we have now and we should continue to use them and if there are breakthroughs with these matters before the 2020 election it will likely be the result of determinations that mr trump will win in 2020 and china may have already determined this however for china even 2050 is short term planning for their worldwide geopolitical economic and military ambitions daniel gallington served in a
