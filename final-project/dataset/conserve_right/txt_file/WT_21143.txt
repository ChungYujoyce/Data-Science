apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion in one six week period rep alexandria ocasio cortez was mentioned 3 181 times on fox news and fox business that s an average of 75 times a day not a single day went by between feb 25 and april 7 in which the conservative networks did not mention the democratic socialist lawmaker from new york repeatedly according to media matters for america since then she s garnered nearly endless coverage both on conservative and liberal news outlets top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century she s become the darling of the democratic party tom perez the head of the democratic national committee has called her the future of our party former secretary of state john kerry recently sang her praises too congresswoman ocasio cortez has in fact offered more leadership in one day or in one week than president trump has in his lifetime on this subject said the failed 2004 democratic presidential candidate about climate change but has she has she provided leadership on anything and if not why on earth does she get so much coverage aoc as she is known has millions of followers on social media and she s on tv almost non stop holding court on cable news stations and getting comfy on all the liberal late night talk show couches but she has sponsored or co sponsored just two bills in the house since she took office one bill which she dubbed the green new deal after fdr s momentous depression era new deal package came in with a hefty 93 trillion price tag over 10 years when the bill went to the senate floor for a vote in march the measure failed 57 to 0 every republicans and four democrats voted against the legislation and the rest of the democrats fearing consequences if they supported it simply voted present not exactly a tour de force start of course she has been in the house only since jan 6 and she does sit on several powerful committees despite her lack of tenure the house oversight and reform committee and the house financial services committee which isn t bad for a newcomer but for all the coverage she has generated ms ocasio cortez hasn t actually done anything dozens of other democrats were elected in november with aoc and they haven t received one minute of news coverage or one drop of ink in headlines aoc is not loved by all in the democratic party while some are embracing her at least those on the progressive side of the democratic caucus many others are keeping their distance after the release of the green new deal house speaker nancy pelosi said dismissively it will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive the green dream or whatever they call it nobody knows what it is but they re for it right and there s a reason some are hesitant to be mentioned in the same breath with aoc although the 22 democrats now vying for the democratic presidential nomination are lurching hard left few except for sens bernard sanders and elizabeth warren have gone quite as far as ms ocasio cortez the longtime politicians know that while they may have to shift left to win the nomination they ll have to rush back to the middle come general election time so what s up with the breathless coverage from conservative media it s a simple and time tested concept they re seeking to make one person the face of the entire party hillary clinton did so with donald trump in the 2016 election in fact it can be argued that her campaign made mr trump into the force he became an email released in november 2016 by wikileaks showed how the hillary rodham clinton hrc campaign set out to make trump the face of the republican party our hope is that the goal of a potential hrc campaign and the dnc would be one in the same to make whomever the republicans nominate unpalatable to a majority of the electorate the plan called for forcing all republican candidates to lock themselves into extreme conservative positions that will hurt them in a general election in this scenario we don t want to marginalize the more extreme candidates but make them more pied piper candidates who actually represent the mainstream of the republican party the clinton campaign wrote named as pied piper candidates mr trump texas sen ted cruz and ben carson we need to be elevating the pied piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and tell the press to take them seriously the clinton campaign concluded the hrc campaign played the media just right they took trump seriously even made him the face of the republican party that didn t work out so well so that s why the conservative media is covering the 29 year old former bartender from brooklyn so heavily but wait what happened the last time one party sought to make a pied piper the face of the campaign oh right joseph curl
