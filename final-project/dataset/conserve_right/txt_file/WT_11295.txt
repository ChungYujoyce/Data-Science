ted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion in the same weeks that are seeing the middle east with all its oil and geopolitical significance begin to transform itself into we know not what important economists are predicting that if current trends continue not only china but india will have an economy larger than ours within a generation of course with strong economies almost inevitably come equivalently strong military capacities so as we enter the great deficit and debt fights of this budget season in both washington and the states the question that enters my mind is will the people of the united states be content merely to settle down and let their country become a relatively affluent second level satellite to a great chinese colossus are we americans prepared to play britain to a post world war ii america also is it likely that china is prepared to be so benign a giant as we have been and are assuming that most americans are adamantly not willing to roll over into a national economic fetal position certain implications certain actions must follow from our intent to remain on our hind legs strong right arms uplifted to the world it begins with the current deficit fight top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed first and most obviously we must have this fight it is economically naive to think we can continue to be the world s strongest largest economy if we don t soon get our fiscal books in order moreover huge and painful as that task will be it will not assure our economic strength it is merely one of several necessary preconditions to such economic health it also is naive to believe it possible for about 10 trillion to be taken out of anticipated federal budgets and perhaps a trillion or more dollars out of the 50 state budgets over the next decade without beneficiaries of such spending not organizing to defend their pots of gold we see a first example of this in wisconsin where the public employee unions are going beyond both law and decency in their furious effort to keep a grip on their bounty it is not enough that we get our deficits and debt down it centrally matters how we do it this agonizing national civic task either can be merely the tiresome squabbles of discontented affluence as economic historian adam tooze described postwar west european politics or a new birth of economic greatness for those who don t want to assume a national economic fetal position this budget fight must lead to the latter president lincoln in january 1863 transformed the civil war from merely an attempt to hold the union together a good and important thing into a new birth of freedom with his emancipation proclamation by expressing the national intent to free the slaves he directly connected the war with our first and incomplete birth of freedom the revolutionary war it may not be a coincidence that within 10 years of that new birth of freedom america became the largest economy in the world a condition we have maintained to this day so today we must not only fight the war to bring the deficit and debt under control we must do so in a way that strengthens our economy vis a vis china and the other aggressive economies brazil india etc fundamentally that means not only reducing our spending but doing so in a way that increases the proportion of government money and policies going to capital investment and reducing the amount that subsidizes operating costs it not only means reducing anticipated spending on medicare and medicaid but probably means getting more of the precious dollars to improve the health of our soon to be productive children even if it means spending fewer tax dollars on end of life care for elderly people justice fairness and equity despite the desirability of such objectives cannot be the primary guides to spending decisions the guide must be what makes our economy more competitive what increases american manufacturing mining commercial construction and intellectual property value what increases our domestic energy production what puts the most productive tools in the hands of our children what trains our children to compete economically and defeat able children around the world what is needed to keep us militarily strong enough to protect our interests by way of example on the latter point last week our navy s storied 6th fleet which for 65 years has maintained the mediterranean sea as an american lake could not muster a single destroyer frigate or other modest naval ship to save a few hundred americans stranded in libya the state department had to rent a ferry that was not seaworthy to do the job the whole world is watching and drawing its cruel conclusions you can be assured that china too is watching if you doubt it read the excellent review in this week s weekly standard of the groundbreaking scholarly book red star over the pacific china s rise and the challenge to u s maritime strategy by toshi yoshihara and james holmes naval institute press 2010 before we conclude that the defense budget must take its fair share of cuts we should understand that it is not the pentagon that will be hurt it is 309 million americans and our economy that are threatened by a weak military that cannot protect our interests where cuts can be made because of inefficiencies such as in procurements excellent but whether it is in education where unionized work force rules protect the destructive work of the worst 10 percent of teachers or health care or military spending the watchword for budget cuts should be what is best for america s continued and expanding economic greatness whatever its short term consequences tony blankley is the author
