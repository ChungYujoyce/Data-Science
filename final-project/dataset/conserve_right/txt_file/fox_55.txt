charge of the henhouse wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel where relations stand between the u s and iran all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington as house democrats pursue the possible impeachment of president trump we have new information to report fox news has learned the president aposs private attorney rudy giuliani was not acting alone in trying to get dirt from ukrainian officials on 2020 rival joe biden two high profile washington lawyers joe digenova who aposs been a fierce critic of the democratic investigation and his wife victoria toensing were working with giuliani to get oppo research on biden according to a top u s official all three were working off the books apart from the administration the only person in government who knows what they were doing is president trump fox news has also learned the pentagon state department and national security council were unanimous in supporting military aid to ukraine president trump decided to withhold that aid this summer on his own in a moment will speak exclusively with senior advisor to the president stephen miller but first let aposs get the latest from kevin corke live at the white house kevin kevin corke correspondent chris a lot of moving parts here in washington but were it come to pass president trump would be the fourth u s president to face impeachment begin videotape pelosi we cannot have a president of the united states undermining his oath of office corke explosive charges from the house speaker in a week that saw her declare without a single vote on the house door an impeachment inquiry but that didn apost stop house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff who promised that his panel will be working through the two week congressional recess indeed along with the foreign affairs and oversight committees schiff aposs intelligence committee issued a joint subpoena for secretary of state mike pompeo demanding records of the president aposs communications with ukraine by an october 4th deadline a decision that rocked washington but appeared to seal the resolve of an embattled and defiant president trump trump what aposs going on now is the single greatest scam in history of american politics they are trying to stop me because i aposm fighting for you and i aposll never let that happen corke this is the mystery deepens over who is the alleged whistle blower and who changed the intelligence community aposs rules just last month eliminating a requirement that whistle blower complaints contained only direct first hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoing end videotape corke chris if democrats have their way this could all move very quickly including more subpoenas this week hearings scheduled and a possible vote to impeach by november chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks for that joining us now stephen miller senior advisor to the president stephen welcome back to fox news sunday stephen miller white house senior policy adviser thanks for having me chris wallace well let aposs start with the house democratic subpoenas of the state department of a massive set of documents as well as five witnesses for this week will president trump comply with the house subpoena miller that aposs going to be between the president aposs attorneys white house counsel aposs office and the house committees so i have no news unfortunately to make on that issue chris but what i do want to say is that i think it aposs unfortunate that the media continues to describe this individual as a whistleblower and honorific that this individual most certainly does not deserve a partisan hit job does not make you a whistleblower just because you go through the whistleblower protection act wallace well first of all how do you know that this is a partisan hit job and how do you know that this is not a whistleblower in fact under dni the department of national intelligence rules well you know what let aposs go back to this and we aposre going to jump around a little bit because i didn apost know you were going to go here here is the comment from the dni the acting dni before congress joe maguire in his testimony this week take a look begin video clip joseph maguire acting director of national intelligence i believe that the whistleblower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout i have every reason to believe that they have done everything by the book and follow the law end video clip wallace that is the director of national intelligence joe maguire a lifetime servant of this country a navy seal he says that the whistleblower was acting in good faith and acting by the book on what basis do you say that this was a partisan hit job miller first of all if you read the seven page little nancy drew novel that the whistleblower put together it drips with condescension righteous indignation and contempt for the president it aposs also ludicrous on its face it describes an elaborate cover up that also by the way the president discussed on sean hannity april 25th what kind of secret cover up are you also discussing on the airwaves of fox news furthermore the inspector general found evidence of political bias in the individual which is not disputed by anybody crosstalk wallace wait a minute he also both the inspect the director of national intelligence and inspector general said they also found his comments to be credible and a matter of urgent concern and they turned it over to the justice department crosstalk wallace so despite all that they thought that this was a credible a complaint miller and they aposre wrong chris crosstalk wallace well on whose basis miller chris i aposve worked in the government now the federal government now for nearly three years i know what the deep state looks like i know the difference between whistleblower and a deep state operative this is a deep state operative pure and simple people who haven apost been in the federal government who haven apost worked in the white house may not appreciate this but the situation is you have a group of unelected bureaucrats who think that they need to take down this president i aposll attend interagency meetings chris where i know for certain fact if i don apost invite the right people the meeting will leak if i don apost say the right thing they aposll go to the hill if we propose a policy idea that they don apost approve of they aposll work with democratic appropriators to try to block it they leak this president aposs phone calls they publish hit pieces they publish fake stories they aposve been doing this continuously for nearly three years and their motives and their agenda is clear this is about do you want a democracy in this country or do you want a deep state it aposs a binary choice for the american people wallace again this person that you aposre accusing of all these the director of national intelligence joe maguire a lifelong servant of this country said was acting in good faith and going by the book let but enough with the rhetoric let aposs talk about some specific facts in this why did president trump use his private attorney rudy giuliani and as we just reported to other private lawyers to try to dig up dirt from the ukrainian government on joe biden rather than going through his state department miller first of all and most importantly when we could talk about quote digging up dirt it aposs an interesting choice of words one of two things is true chris either the ukrainian government or people associated with it possess real and actual knowledge of corrupt dealings by the biden family or they don apost if they do is it not in the interest of all americans to know that is wallace we aposre going to get to what ph the bidens in a minute but i aposve asked you a specific question i aposd like a specific answer the president has the state department he aposs got the cia he aposs got the pentagon he aposs got a number of other agencies why did he use three private lawyers to get information on biden from the from the ukrainian government rather than go through all of the agencies of this government miller two different points number one wallace how about answering my question miller john durham as you know wallace wait a minute john durham is investigating some a completely different stephen i aposm asking you a direct question why did the president use private attorneys rather than go to the state department if you don apost know that aposs an acceptable answer but let aposs not talk about john durham who was investigating the trump crosstalk miller chris there aposs two issues that were brought up in the phone call wallace i aposm not asking two issues why did he do it miller chris i understand i understand that you have your question i have my answer there aposs two issues that were brought up a phone call wallace you have your non answer at this point miller there were two issues brought up in the phone call one was ukrainian knowledge about the nature of the collusion investigation that is inflicted so much pain and damage on our country my point is is that the attorney general has appointed somebody from the justice department to look into that issue then there aposs the additional matter of ukrainian corruption which giuliani among others are looking at and it is proper and natural for frankly anybody concerned about the future of ukraine and the united states to want to know information about corrupt dealings what i find astonishing chris is that the people that are so enraged about an effort to find any true and actual knowledge of foreign corrupt dealings related to ukraine are the same ones who have been using the foreign produced dossier by a british spy to put this country through unending political turmoil wallace i aposm simply asking question as to why miller is adam schiff guilty of interfering in our election crosstalk wallace i aposm simply asking you a question as to why the president didn apost use his government you apparently are not going to answer that i aposll ask you another question why did the president decide to withhold 391 million in military aid to ukraine last july miller the president has been wallace that had been approved by congress miller the president has been clear and consistent on this issue not merely for the time he aposs been in office his whole time as a candidate and frankly decades before that wallace i aposm just simply asking why in july did he decide to withhold the aid crosstalk miller about the problem of burden sharing in ukraine and with our nato allies he aposs been clear and consistent on this issue plus the matter of ukrainian corruption and for reasons i cannot fathom the media which is ordinarily interested in sunshine and transparency above all else is remarkably uncurious about the information ukraine possesses about the corruption of the previous administration wallace ok but let aposs just let aposs just make this point in may as part of a regular interagency process in may two months before he withheld the aid the pentagon certified to congress certified a formal process certified to congress after a rigorous process and after consultation with the state department that ukraine had made dramatic progress in fighting corruption and that the aid should be released why did the president if the argument is corruption why did the president go against his own pentagon and his own state department miller chris i don apost understand how you can ask that question while at the same time admonishing the president for wanting to get to the bottom of perhaps one of the biggest corruption scandals concerning ukraine in the last few years which is burisma holdings wallace i i aposm not admonishing anybody absently asking why did he go miller chris chris wallace i mean this is miller i like a lot crosstalk wallace with all due respect this is an exercise in obfuscation why did the president go against his own pentagon and state department miller there aposs a tone of judgment there aposs a tone of judgment in all of your there aposs a tone of judgment in all of questions so yes you are admonishing and i can apost speak to every wallace no that aposs that aposs judgment on your part sir miller i can apost speak to every single mid level and low level bureaucrat in the u s government crosstalk wallace this is the deputy secretary of defense for policy what you considered john rood a minion in the state department in the pentagon miller it aposs the president aposs it aposs the president aposs job and sworn duty to safeguard taxpayer dollars and the united states government aposs foreign policy getting to the bottom of a corruption scandal in ukraine is in the american national interest and if you want to understand why that complainant is so obviously politically biased when he says that the president is threatening national security by trying to expose corruption when he says or she that the president is hurting national security by trying to get to the bottom of a gigantic scandal that nobody has unearth the president is the whistleblower here the president of the united states is the whistleblower and this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government wallace saboteur is he a spy is he committing treason miller i do not know wallace but the president said that you know miller the president correctly pointed out that the behavior of this individual is close to a spy i don apost know who the individual is all i know is at some point chris we have to focus on the real scandal which is three years of deep state sabotage wallace ok i aposm going to talk about a different scandal and you aposll be very happy that i aposm headed here the president says the real story is the corruption by vice president biden and his son hunter biden who was on the board of the ukrainian energy company how specifically i aposm going to give you one minute uninterrupted how specifically did the bidens break the law in ukraine miller the burisma company as you know was under investigation it has a ukrainian oligarch behind it who was under investigation we know that there was severe concern in the obama administration at the time about biden being appointed as the lead on ukrainian policy and then his son getting a lucrative 50 000 a month deal with the company the son had no experience in the legal issues he was supposed to advise on wallace how did then he break the law miller he knew nothing about ukrainian law and he knew absolutely nothing about natural gas the issue at the heart of the company the biden then threatened to withhold a billion dollars in aid unless the prosecutor was fired it is wallace you realize that also the international monetary fund almost every other government in the west was also asking for that prosecutor to be fired and that in fact in fact there was no investigation going on of burisma the name of the company at that time miller i don apost know that to be true but wallace it is true but let me crosstalk miller i know what people have said but the reality is is that why is the media so obsessed with every single aspect of this investigation but they don apost want to uncover the potential corrupt dealings of hunter biden and his father why they don apost want to know crosstalk wallace potential let me i have one less question to ask you miller why don apost they want to know wallace and i do want to put this on miller about his dealings in china why don apost they want to know about wallace here is yuriy lutsenko he was the prosecutor general of ukraine for three years including the period during which president trump spoke with president zelensky in july of 2019 here he is lutsenko this week take a look begin video clip yuriy lutsenko former prosecutor general of ukraine i don apost know any possible violation of ukrainian law once again ukrainian law by biden and biden jr end video clip wallace this was lutsenko who was the prosecutor general at the time the president called the ukrainian president says joe biden and his son did nothing wrong wallace if you aposre going to use lutsenko as a witness then you have to also know that he aposs made incredibly damning allegations against ukraine and against the u s government involving the origins of the 2016 russian collusion conspiracy so if you aposre going to use him as a witness you aposve got to take all of it or none of it you can apost pick and choose it aposs not a buffet crosstalk wallace ok but i guess the point is if he is clearly saying those things about ukraine and the 2016 election he aposs not carrying water for joe biden he says joe biden you can apost pick or choose either miller i aposm not i aposm saying wallace you aposre saying well ok we agree with him on this but we don apost on the other welcome to the buffet miller i aposm saying an investigation is urgently needed when you look at the full pattern of facts but the single most important point is this the american people in 2016 said we want in a completely new direction for our country they elected new lawmakers and they elected a new president to deliver that direction he is the sole elected person in the executive branch and yet wallace well that aposs not true actually you got the vice president as well miller yes and the all executive power is vested in the president but there are deep state operatives who for three years have done nothing but try to leak undermine hurt and harm the ability of this president to institute this change do we want to be governed by an unelected bureaucracy or by a democratically elected president that aposs the sole issue facing the american people wallace the only point i would make it and i have to move on is that in 2018 the american people elected democratic house so they are a coequal branch of government stephen thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir miller thank you wallace up next we aposll ask a house democratic leader where they aposre headed on possible impeachment of president trump congressman and chair of the democratic caucus hakeem jeffries joins us next commercial break wallace house democrats have now fast tracked the impeachment inquiry into president trump issuing a subpoena to secretary of state mike pompeo with promises of more to come joining us now congressman hakeem jeffries of new york chair of the house democratic caucus and a member of the judiciary committee congressman welcome back to fox news sunday rep hakeem jeffries d n y good morning thanks for having me on wallace so let aposs start with that subpoena of the state department documents and witnesses if president trump refuses to comply with that subpoena is that an impeachable offense jeffries well we hope that the administration will cooperate that certainly hasn apost been the case up to date though there is some reason to believe that moving forward given the seriousness of these allegations that we will see cooperation from secretary pompeo we aposre going to follow the facts we aposre going to apply the law we aposre going to be guided by the constitution we aposre going to unearth the truth for the american people which relates to the fact that the president has betrayed his oath of office he aposs engaged in serious wrongdoing here he pressured a foreign government to target an american citizen for political gain that is classic abuse of power which undermines our national security this is as serious as it gets wallace it but to press my point in previous cases i certainly know in the nixon case that one of the things that the house impeached nixon for was failure to cooperate to he was in contempt of congress would failure to comply with the subpoena be an impeachable offense jeffries we aposre going to remain focused on the abuse of power that clearly exists there aposs evidence that is hiding in plain sight of that fact including the rough transcript of the july 25th phone call between the president of the united states of america and the president of ukraine but chris to your question as adam schiff indicated in the letter to the extent that there is continued obstruction to the extent that there is a continued cover up that could provide potential grounds for an obstruction of congress charge wallace democratic leaders are talking about a tight process focused just on ukraine with a potential vote on the house floor and articles of impeachment by thanksgiving isn apost that a bit like the queen of hearts in alice in wonderland sentence today verdict afterwards you aposre already are deciding when and how you aposre going to proceed before you actually conduct the investigation jeffries speaker pelosi has been tremendous and strong as she has laid out the focus of the impeachment inquiry moving forward we aposre operating under an umbrella the intelligence committee is going to take the lead what she has said and the only thing she has said publicly or privately about timeline is that we are going to proceed expeditiously we of course are going to proceed fairly we aposre going to proceed comprehensively we aposre going to unearth the truth we aposre going to provide it to the american people and then we aposre going to make some decisions wallace you say make some decisions but you have already laid out a pretty dramatic case about betraying the country betraying the oath of office based on the evidence you aposve seen while the house vote to impeach donald trump jeffries that remains to be seen because we are in the middle of a process but here aposs what aposs clear and here aposs the story that needs to be told to the american people that the congress on a bipartisan basis allocated 391 million in military and state department aid to the ukrainian government ukraine is an ally they aposre under attack right now by russian backed separatists in crimea in february the administration said to the congress that the aid to the ukraine is on the way yet it never was sent then in may the administration again said to the congress that the aid to ukraine is on the way and that all necessary preconditions including as it relates to anticorruption activity has been met yet the aid never made it then comes the july 25th call where the president of the united states pressures the president of ukraine to commence an investigation against a political opponent thereby soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election the president of ukraine agrees as based on the rough transcript sometime thereafter all of a sudden in september the aid is released after it aposs clear that there was a whistle blower complaint these are very troubling facts here and we aposre going to bring them to the light for the american people wallace all right but i want to pick up on exactly that point that aposs the basic charge of the whistle blower that the president used the leverage of aid to try to get the ukrainian president to dig up dirt on vice president former vice president joe biden here this week the ukrainian president zelensky met with president trump and here aposs what they said begin video clip volodymyr zelensky ukrainian president it was normal we spoke about many things and i so so i think and you read it that nobody pushed it pushed me yes donald trump president in other words no pressure end video clip wallace zelensky says right there nobody pushed him jeffries he can say that nobody pushed him but understand that the united states is the most powerful country on earth and that we in many ways are the only thing standing between vladimir putin and ukraine being totally overrun by russia the united states is strong ukraine is vulnerable so when the president of the united states withholds military aid that had been duly authorized by congress and then on the july 25th phone call says do us a favor for words chris that will likely live in infamy in terms of the history of our republic that is what you call a high pressure tactic and of course the ukrainian president got the message wallace what about the argument sir that that impeachment is a drastic action you basically are talking about the possibility of overturning a democratic election in which donald trump was elected president of the united states we are basically already in the presidential campaign why not wait until next november and let voters decide whether or not they want donald trump as their president jeffries well as the whistle blower has indicated as the trump appointed inspector general to the intelligence committee has indicated as the acting director of national intelligence who was himself appointed by donald trump has indicated this is a matter of urgent national security concern and that is why we aposre compelled to act we aposre going to continue to work with the president on a host of other issues of importance to the american people like driving down the high cost of life saving prescription drugs enacting a real infrastructure plan to fix our crumbling bridges roads and tunnels as well as trying to get to yes on the renegotiated united states canada mexico trade agreement but chris the the the house is a separate and coequal branch of government we don apost work for this president or any president democrat or republican we work for the american people we have a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance on the executive branch that is not the nancy pelosi playbook that aposs not the adam schiff playbook that aposs not the house democratic caucus playbook that aposs the james madison playbook he said that we should be a rival to the executive branch because the founders didn apost want a monarch they didn apost want a king they didn apost want to dictator they wanted a democracy and these allegations strike at the heart and soul of our democracy wallace finally and we aposre running out of time i want to talk a little politics with you there are 31 house democrats moderates who won in districts that president trump had carried in 2016 and the republican national committee is already going after them about the possibility of impeachment here is an rnc ad targeting new york congressman max rose begin video clip unidentified female instead of fixing health care and lowering drug prices rose votes with the radicals for endless investigations of president trump end video clip wallace are you putting those moderates and in effect the house majority in jeopardy by look for two years you pursued russian collusion that fell apart now you aposre going to spend another few months at least pursuing the president on ukraine are you putting all of them and the house majority in jeopardy jeffries well we aposre going to continue to focus as i indicated on the kitchen table pocketbook issues to make life better for everyday americans wallace but you know this is going to soak everything up congressman jeffries well we have this constitutional responsibility and we aposre going to undertake it with the seriousness and the solemnity that it requires this is not about politics this is about betrayal this is about abuse of power this is about national security this is about the integrity of our elections and this is about the united states constitution wallace congressman jeffries thank you thanks for coming in today we aposll be tracking this week aposs developments thanks sir jeffries thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the impeachment inquiry the risk to democrats and the potential damage to joe biden commercial break wallace coming up president trump starts to make his case against the formal house impeachment inquiry begin video clip trump it aposs a disgrace to our country it aposs another witch hunt here we go again it aposs adam schiff and his crew making up stories end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what to watch for as democrats hit the gas next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif today aposs release of the notes of the call by the white house confirms this behavior which undermines the integrity of our election the dignity of any presidency and our national security trump when they look at the information it aposs a joke impeachment for that when you have a wonderful meeting or you have a wonderful phone conversation end video clip wallace president trump and house speaker nancy pelosi with very different reactions to the release of that rough transcript of his call with ukraine aposs president this summer as house democrats launch a formal impeachment inquiry and it aposs time now for our sunday group rich lowry of national review mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and fox news correspondent gillian turner rich how much trouble is donald trump in what are the chances for impeachment what are the chances for removal rich lowry national review well i think he aposs obviously in trouble and there aposs some idea what he wants to be impeached or welcomes the politics of impeachment and from people that talk to him it aposs what you see in public he hates the idea of being impeached he doesn apost want this to happen and i think what happened this week last week is nancy pelosi was really pushed by her own caucus it became unsustainable for her to oppose this anymore but i think it aposs a sign of weakness that she didn apost have a vote on the house floor to actually open the impeachment inquiry the way you did with nixon and with clinton and that aposs a sign it would be a very narrow partisan vote it might be awkward for some of her members and i just think this was improper the president shouldn apost have done it but if he was impeached and removed on the basis of anything like this universe of flexible fact it would blow a hole of legitimacy in the center of our politics that wouldn apost be healed for years the right way to do this if you oppose the president want him to go there aposs an election 12 months from now wallace gillian you have an advantage over all of us you actually worked in the national security council under both bush 43 and obama so i want to ask you a couple of and you aposre going to have to go through it quickly specific things about what stands out for you what stands out for you about the phone call what stands out for you about the president aposs handling of the aid and what stands out to you about the president aposs use off the books of several private attorneys gillian turner correspondent so the first point quickly on the transcript a lot of hay being made about the fact that white house officials ordered the transcript moved from a top secret system to an even more highly classified code word system way way not enough information is known at this point to make a determination that was problematic people are saying that move is unprecedented it aposs not people are saying it shows and proves in and of itself there was a cover up wallace all right turner it doesn apost that happens it aposs done wallace what about the call itself turner the call itself what stuck out to me about the call in terms of things that were problematic was rudy giuliani aposs involvement running point man on ukraine anytime you have somebody who aposs not a government official purporting to represent the united states purporting to represent the president it aposs highly unethical not saying it aposs illegal not saying it aposs impeachable obviously that aposs not for me to decide but it is unethical and i think that aposs what the administration is going to have to contend with now if they aposre not upset with giuliani already they aposre about to be wallace and what about the fact that the state department the pentagon they all said congress let aposs put this aid out and the fact that the president sometime in july just before the phone call goes against all of them and withholds the aid and then makes his call to the president how troubling is that to you turner well we don apost know if it aposs true yet right i think presumably the investigation congresses apos investigation will get to the core of that wallace we do know he withheld the aid and we do think that that turner we know that he withheld the aid and we know what he said in the phone call reportedly but there aposs the correlation has not been proven yet that aposs what the congressional inquiry will get to wallace congresswoman edwards speaker pelosi didn apost want to go down the road of impeachment she now has decided to and you have some problems with the process of having six committees all do their thing why donna edwards former congresswoman d md well i mean first of all i think that the speaker didn apost want to do this and she went down this road because the president actually forced her hand and i think that the process has to be really narrowly circumscribed it aposs really important not to spread it across six committees six chairman six different investigations i do think the later the move later in the week to try to contain this within the intelligence committee is probably a smart one but you know we need to i think we need one lawyer one committee one chairman asking questions you know in a sequence that really makes sense so that the american people can understand what happened and so that congress can get to some of the real answers wallace the president aposs focus at least part of this focus in all of this apparently was to dig up dirt on joe biden who at the time of the phone call perhaps not so much now was his clear top rival the frontrunner for the democratic nomination here is former vice president biden this week begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate it seems to me it aposs awful hard to avoid the conclusion that it is an impeachable offense and a violation of constitutional responsibility end video clip wallace mo i don apost want to ask you a legal question i want to ask you a political question there is no hard evidence that that either as i presented to to stephen miller that either biden or his son did anything illegal but you aposve got to admit it sure looks bad that when joe biden is vice president of the united states that hunter biden his son is doing business with all of these countries that joe biden is also doing business with i mean it seems to be just kind of a perfect example of the swamp mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public services well that aposs what the president aposs hoping for right i mean look the facts we do know is that hunter biden went to work for this company or to consult for this company but all the allegations of corruption against this company took place two years before that we know that we know that the vice president and others in the obama administration specifically went after the prosecutor for pulling back on its on the ukrainian investigation not for being too aggressive for not being aggressive enough and tying foreign aid to that we know that much so wallace but i aposm asking you the appearance of it elleithee the political right so this is what the president is trying to do the president now is one of the few lifelines he has right now is to obfuscate and confuse and make this look like some sort of false equivalency here there is not the reality is that the president went to the ukrainian government and asked them for help that would benefit him politically forget about the whistleblower for a second at the president admitted it and the white house released a memo that corroborates it wallace ok i elleithee that aposs the conversation we aposre having wallace i aposve got 30 seconds left how damaging to joe biden lowry i think it aposs pretty damaging the the arrangement with hunter was corrupted not in any legal sense but this is the worst aspect of our public life that if you are in some proximity to power people throw money at you for nothing and he got 50 000 a month from this company just on the basis of being the vice president aposs son and if biden is a nominee which i have a lot of doubts for trump would hammer this every single day wallace all right panel we have to take a break here when we come back iranian president hassan rouhani did not meet with president trump this week at the u n but we sat down for a wide ranging interview we aposll play the highlights and get reaction from our sunday group next commercial break wallace now our interview with iranian president hassan rouhani the big question this week at the u s general assembly was whether rouhani and president trump would meet and try to ease tensions based on our interview it may have been just as well they didn apost meet rouhani accused president trump of economic terrorism for his stiff sanctions on iran and he pushed back on u s charges iran was behind that missile and drone attack on saudi arabia suggesting yemen struck back against saudi aggression here are highlights from our interview begin video clip wallace this week the european countries who signed onto the iran nuclear deal i aposm talking about britain and france and germany now say that they agree with president trump that it was iran that was responsible for the saudi attack the attack on saudi oil facilities and like mr trump they say iran should now agree to a bigger new deal on nuclear weapons and on regional stability and your missile systems will you agree to reopen the talks hassan rouhani president of iran through translator the most basic needed issue is trust and mr trump damaged the trust between the two countries so this is very important trust must be restored and the restoration of trust consists in taking away the pressure imposed upon the nation and the people of iran which show that clearly there is animosity even towards our children our ill people because we they even have difficulty in obtaining basic medications and medical equipment this is a type of terrorism this is inhumane and if there is a cessation to this then of course the atmosphere will change wallace but it seems for the last year and a half since the u s pulled out of the agreement as if iran aposs policy has been to drive a wedge between the u s president trump and europe which has stood by the agreement now this week it seems because of the fact that iran was responsible for this attack on saudi oil facilities that you have in fact united the countries it has backfired on you and now europe has agreed with the u s that they need to reopen new talks rouhani the people of yemen have the inherent right even brought in the united nations charter to defend themselves when have been the subject of bombardment for over five years of course the people of yemen have the right to defend themselves wallace but but rouhani and attack wallace but mr president but mr president the saudis say the drones were not yemeni they were iranian they were delta wings and delta waves ph the saudis say the cruise missiles were not yemeni they were iranian and even your closest partner in europe french president macron seems to agree he has agreed he says that it is iran that was responsible for the attack on saudi arabia rouhani well because you are quite an experienced reporter mr wallace you did not allow me to complete my previous answer not a problem i will return to what you were speaking of see mr trump has leveled an accusation an unfounded accusation against iran but let aposs assume if it was from iran all of the moneys received from the united states for these defensive systems for these weapons systems radar systems installed in saudi arabia and throughout the arabian peninsula how come they were not able to prevent that missile from hitting the target and if we accept the u s accusation then it is even more embarrassing perhaps for the united states and they must answer as to why they were not able to stop and intercept the system wallace you are bringing to the u n a new peace plan called hope the hormuz peace endeavor but there are many nations in the region that say that iran is the last country that should be proposing peace since may they say you have mined tankers in the persian gulf you have seized a british ship you have shot down a united states drone and now the saudi oil attack they say and iranian peace plan is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse rouhani iran during the past four decades fought against terrorism unequivocally so iran is a country that has brought peace in the region wallace but excuse excuse me sir and i say this respectfully you have given hundreds of millions perhaps a billion dollars to hezbollah to hamas to various groups that is not a support of terrorism rouhani well when you label people who fight for the defense of their country and their land as terrorism so those who are the subjects of occupation what should they do be passive and just look wallace we aposre talking about firing missiles onto civilian areas we aposre talking about blowing up people in in civilian areas of israel that aposs not terrorism rouhani there is no terrorism throughout the world that matches the activities of israel that has been seeking for the past 71 years since its inception since its founding so those who fight for the freedom of their lands and their homes are not terrorists wallace have you made a calculation to wait until after the 2020 election to wait and see if president trump is defeated do believe that perhaps mr biden or another democratic president would be easier to negotiate with rouhani we say that america should live up to her commitments be the democrat or republican president the commitment is something that was given by the government of the united states of america so it really doesn apost matter for us our counterparts which political party they come from wallace mr president thank you so much for speaking with us rouhani on camera thank you end video clip wallace and we aposre back now with the panel gillian you know there was a lot of talk at the u n this week and apparently french president macron was really pushing to get trump and rouhani in a room together what struck me is just how far apart these two sides are i aposm not sure a meeting would have accomplished anything turner anything at all that aposs absolutely right there aposs also this unprecedented reversal of international norms right now where the u s apos closest european allies germany france the u k are teaming up with iran siding with iran to pressure the u s back into the 2015 nuclear deal it was just i think now like ten days ago maybe that french president emmanuel macron floated this 15 billion bailout package for iran to return to the 2015 deal they aposre still legally beholden to the terms of that deal wallace congresswoman edwards iran is clearly being hurt by the sanctions you could hear that as rouhani was talking about you know we can apost get medicine for our children on the other hand you can just tell that there is a sense of anger about the fact that the u s did pull out of this deal that president obama whether it aposs a good deal or not people can judge agreed to as one iranian official said you don apost buy the same rug twice edwards well you know when i was in congress i supported the president obama going into the deal not because it was perfect but because it had the measure of containing the iran nuclear program with the idea that in the future you could leverage more negotiation with them around some of their other bad acting around the world and when the when president trump pulled out of that deal i think he lost some of his leverage and what was protectable is that iran would escalate and escalate and escalate because that aposs what it does so i think that we have to get back to someplace where all of the united states and its partners are acting in unison with respect to iran and i do think that there aposs got to be a level of trust built up that it took several years to happen to even get to the nuclear deal that we had wallace rich looking back on it now was president trump right to pull out of the nuclear deal and do you see since then a clear trump strategy at work here to try to make a new deal and and and deal with not just the nuclear issue but also missiles and regional terrorism lowry i think that aposs the ultimate end game and i think actually over the past week you saw some progress in that regard because the european allies are now talking about a new deal that would bring iranian behavior as part of it that would bring missiles in as part of it and that was the trump position at the outset so that aposs progress the question is how you get there and i think the iranians want to get back to negotiation but they don apost want to give anything up and they aposre the strategy has been provoke and provoke to try to scare the europeans create a pain for trump by disrupting the international oil market which they haven apost had success at doing even after such a brazen attack on the saudis so this is where i agree with donna they aposre going to continue to escalate and go up further wallace and and mo as i discussed with president rouhani their plan clearly was to try to drive this wedge between the u s which pulled out and the other european signatories which had stayed in the deal but it does feel in their effort to escalate that maybe they aposve gone too far because you know it was the attack on the saudi oil facilities and suddenly this week just before the u n general assembly they were france and germany and britain were all saying well you we need to come back and it needs to be a bigger deal what trump aposs been saying president trump has been saying which is not just the nukes but also missiles and regional stability elleithee sure but you aposre still seeing some fissures between the western coalition that weren apost there before and i think that aposs the most dangerous part of the u s strategy since president trump took over if he wants if he wanted to scuttle the deal and put forward something new he didn apost do the work he needed to do to bring the rest of the western coalition together that was the strength of of the obama deal was that it brought the western coalition together behind this common goal and put real pressure on iran since then iran has felt emboldened to be more aggressive and the west has been fractured wallace and in less than 30 seconds gillian where do you see this headed between washington and tehran war peace or continue stalemate turner well you aposre such an experienced reporter chris wallace and i didn apost even interrupt you turner i don apost unfortunately think it aposs going where president trump wants it to go which is a trump nuclear deal 2 0 even though the european allies are now showing an openness to doing that i don apost really see a way forward for that unfortunately because as your sources told you you can apost buy the same rug twice there aposs no real legal framework without the deal dying
