apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap president donald trump directed the u s trade representative to prepare new tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports on monday as the two nations moved closer to a potential trade war the tariffs which trump wants set at a 10 percent rate would be the latest round of punitive measures in an escalating dispute over the large trade imbalance between the two countries trump recently ordered tariffs on 50 billion in chinese goods in retaliation for intellectual property theft the tariffs were quickly matched by china on u s exports a move that drew the president s ire china apparently has no intention of changing its unfair practices related to the acquisition of american intellectual property and technology trump said in a statement monday announcing the new action rather than altering those practices it is now threatening united states companies workers and farmers who have done nothing wrong top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump added these tariffs will go into effect if china refuses to change its practices and also if it insists on going forward with the new tariffs that it has recently announced china s commerce ministry on tuesday criticized the latest threat of tariffs saying it was an act of extreme pressure and blackmail that deviates from the consensus reached by both parties after many negotiations and is a disappointment to the international community if the u s becomes irrational and issues this list china will have no choice but to adopt strong countermeasures of the same amount and quality the ministry statement said trump said that if china responds to this fresh round of tariffs then he will move to counter by pursuing additional tariffs on another 200 billion of goods it wasn t immediately clear when the new tariffs could be put in place as the trade office has yet to identify the chinese goods to be penalized or conduct a legal review the first round of penalties announced by both nations is set to take effect july 6 the intellectual property sanctions were the latest in a spate of protectionist measures unveiled by trump in recent months that included tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the u s and a tough rhetoric on trade negotiations from north america to asia the escalation in the dispute with china may also serve as a warning to other trading partners with whom trump has been feuding including canada and the european union the move quickly drew praise from former trump senior adviser steve bannon who told the associated press president trump told china and the world tonight that america will not back down when it comes to economic aggression but wall street has viewed the escalating trade tensions with wariness fearful they could strangle the economic growth achieved during trump s watch gary cohn trump s former top economic adviser said last week that a tariff battle could result in price inflation and consumer
