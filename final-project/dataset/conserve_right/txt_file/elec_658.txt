 at a 2006 fundraiser hillary clinton jokingly told donors that she could easily see herself as the elected representative of foreign citizens in the indian region of punjab as india abroad reported at the time at the fundraiser hosted by dr rajwant singh at his potomac maryland home clinton began by joking that i can certainly run for the senate seat in punjab and win easily after being introduced by singh as the senator not only from new york but also punjab it was apparently a line clinton used more than once the sikh council writes that at a 2005 event in the u s senate clinton said i am delighted to be the senator from punjab as well as from new york the statement prompted the campaign of her then opponent sen barack obama to call the new york senator hillary clinton d punjab in a memo circulated to reporters implying that clinton represents foreign nations and foreign citizens rather than her own american constituents the memo was titled hillary clinton d punjab s personal financial and political ties to india and it extensively detailed clinton s willingness to put the needs and interests of foreign corporations and foreign workers in india ahead of the needs of the american people the obama campaign wrote the clintons have reaped significant financial rewards from their relationship with the indian community both in their personal finances and hillary s campaign fundraising hillary clinton who is the co chair of the senate india caucus has drawn criticism from anti offshoring groups for her vocal support of indian business and unwillingness to protect american jobs hillary clinton has taken tens of thousands of dollars from companies that outsource jobs to india workers who have been laid off in upstate new york might not think that her recent joke that she could be elected to the senate seat in punjab is that funny indeed while these revelations have received scant to virtually no coverage by corporate media this election cycle clinton has an astonishingly long record of promoting indian corporations and foreign workers at the direct expense of american workers most notably clinton has extensive ties to corporations responsible for some of the most egregious anti american worker labor practices namely the india based tata consultancy services tcs and hcl these india based it firms specialize in outsourcing and offshoring and are among the top h 1b and l 1 visa employers in the united states together hcl and tata have stolen tens of thousands of u s jobs from american workers all across the country hcl and tata are responsible for the layoffs of workers from disney southern california edison northeast utilities xerox university of california siemens and countless others a review of clinton s record shows that she has not only defended and enabled these corporations anti american worker business model but she has also pushed to expand it calling for substantial increases to the number of low wage workers admitted on guest worker visas and suggesting that american workers lack the requisite skills to fill u s jobs interestingly both companies have given money to the clintons either via donations to the clinton foundation or paying bill clinton to deliver speeches as the obama campaign wrote in 2007 about clinton s ties to india it s all about the money tata as the washington post has reported tata has given tens of thousands of dollars to the clinton foundation although foreign nationals cannot contribute to u s campaigns clinton has won campaign support from the indian american community records show tata consultancy services contributed between 25 000 and 50 000 to the clinton foundation and ratan tata then chairman of the tata group was a speaker at the clinton global initiative conference in 2010 tata is also a participant in the clinton foundation s stem education program the clinton s ties to the indian corporation extend back for over a decade in 2003 then senator hillary clinton was widely credited for recruiting and helping tata open a software development center in buffalo new york as a press release issued by tata announcing the opening stated the deal was the brainchild of senator hillary rodham clinton a year before the announcement clinton had courted executives from tata and other indian businesses giving them a tour of the region clinton was so instrumental to the deal that the company even flew her to buffaloto join tata s ceo subramaniam ramadorai for the announcement of the company s opening even at the time clinton s decision was a controversial one five days before clinton and tata announced the buffalo opening tata came under fire for helping a siemens unit in lake mary florida lay off its american workers and forced them to train their lower wage foreign replacements brought in on guest worker visas as bloomberg reported less than a week before the announcement of tata s buffalo opening siemens made no bones about the cost cutting nature of the layoff bloomberg noted that one of the foreign replacements who speaks halting english allegedly earned just one third of the original american employee s 98 000 a year salary yet despite public outrage over siemens and tata s anti american worker business model clinton forged ahead with tata s opening in buffalo the event signaled that clinton who portrays herself as a fighter for american workers had aligned herself with indian american business leaders and indian companies feared by the labor movement the los angeles times reported in 2007 mike emmons one of the american siemens workers who was axed and replaced by a foreign worker said that he was in touch with clinton s staff as all of this was happening yet shortly after emmons had reached out to senator clinton seeking representation and protection for his colleagues from tata s job theft emmons was forced to watch as clinton celebrated tata at its grand opening in buffalo in july of 2016 emmons decided to speak out in response to clinton s claim that she finds it heartbreaking when american workers are forced to train their foreign replacements in an op ed titled don t believe clinton s crocodile tears over lost american jobs emmons denounced clinton s preference for foreign guest workers over qualified americans emmons pointed specifically to clinton s long history of supporting expansions to the h 1b program and her support for legislation that would have weakened the already laughably feeble protections currently in place to prevent americans from being displaced by guest workers for me the issue is personal i am a tech worker who was replaced by a foreign guest worker emmons wrote emmons said that as he struggled to afford medical care for his handicapped daughter and as he watched his former colleagues struggle to make ends meet he decided i could not remain silent i reached out to elected office holders across the country including hillary clinton who had been elected senator from new york in 2000 shortly after i reached out to senator clinton s office i saw that she attended the grand opening of a tata regional office in buffalo new york if hillary clinton truly was heartbroken about americans being forced to train their foreign replacements she had ample opportunity to do something about it when she was in office i for one have good reason not to trust that she will do the right thing if elected president tata has been responsible for destroying tens of thousands of american jobs and depressing the wages of countless more said it labor expert and howard university professor ron hira who was a professor at the rochester institute of technology at the time of tata s opening in buffalo hira said that clinton s actions enabled tata s anti american worker business model these guest workers are imported by tata because they are cheaper than american workers over the ten year period fy2005 14 tata imported an incredible 27 193 h 1b guest workers we don t know how many l 1 workers it imported but it s likely more than 10 000 that s at least 27 193 jobs that american workers should have been hired for or in many cases were already doing workers at siemens northeast utilities and southern california edison and got replaced by an h 1b worker those are high wage jobs that pay more than 85k to american workers why would anyone court a company whose business model is based upon destroying american jobs it s the height of irrationality to think that destroying american jobs is effective economic development policy by giving tata her repeated endorsements she enabled these very practices indeed in a 2004 interview with then cnn host lou dobbs clinton defended tata s controversial practices insisting that they brought jobs to buffalo well of course i know that they outsource jobs that they ve actually brought jobs to buffalo they ve created 10 jobs in buffalo she said you know outsourcing does work both ways it expert and uc davis professor norm matloff mocked clinton for her remarks yeah 10 whole jobs matloff wrote at the time tata imports thousands of h 1bs and offshores untold numbers of jobs but hey they created 10 new jobs in the u s matloff further pointed out that it was unknown whether those 10 whole jobs were even given to american workers noting that tata may very well have filled those 10 jobs with h 1bs most remarkably during her interview with dobbs clinton declared we are not against all outsourcing we are not in favor of putting up fences her remarks were reported by the times of india in an article titled clinton stands up for tata outsourcing during a 2005 trip to india clinton again reportedly defended the tata deal insisting that it represented the type of cooperation that would help prevent the kind of negative feelings that could be stirred up by by critics of globalization while on foreign soil she called critics of the global marketplace presumably american workers who have been victims of globalization short sighted around the same time clinton was pushing policies that would expand the displacement of american workers in 2006 clinton backed ted kennedy s immigration plan which would have nearly doubled the cap on h 1b visas per year in 2007 clinton specifically called for increasing the pool of foreign workers available tocorporate employers i also want to reaffirm my commitment to the h 1b visa program and to increase the current cap clinton reportedly told a conference of indian workers in silicon valley whom she addressed via satellite foreign skilled workers contribute to greatly to our us technological development clinton toldthe group in contrast to the foreign skilled workers clinton said she wants to import to the u s clinton suggested that americans workers lack the necessary skills to fill u s jobs without citing any evidence to support her argument and indeed disregarding all of the evidence that would prove her statement to be demonstrably false clinton suggested that american workers skills are not in line with the jobs there s no shortage of talented hardworking people in the united states we just need to get the skills more in line with the jobs clinton said amid her call for increasing the importation of foreign workers this statement is remarkable given the fact that the american workers who tata replaced workers like mike emmons at siemens already had skills that were in line with the job they were filling in fact the american workers already filling those jobs were more skilled than their foreign replacements as evidenced by the fact that the american workers had to spend weeks training their foreign lower wage replacements experts have shown that there s actually a surplus of labor in the tech labor market and have explained that this the reason it workers have not seen a pay raise since bill clinton s administration despite these realities clinton chose to parrot the debunked talking point that there is a shortage of skilled laborerswhile addressing a conference ofsilicon valley employers in 2007 clinton told the crowd that if elected president she would address the concerns of silicon valley ceos who want a larger pool of foreign workers i have had countless meetings with people from the silicon valley and in silicon valley bemoaning the shortage in the skills that are needed clinton said clinton said that across the country there are jobs that american workers are not filling not just tech jobs but blue collar jobs as well clinton suggested that this is because workers do not have the skills for the jobs i hear that across the country there are auto mechanic jobs we cannot fill today thousands of them making 50 60 70 thousand dollars there are airline mechanic jobs that we can t fill there are so many jobs that we can t get the right mix between the person and the skill and the job we need to do more and we have to also recognize the shortage that exists now clinton added so i am reaffirming my commitment to the h1b visa and increasing the current cap let s just face the fact that foreign skilled workers contribute greatly to what we have to do in being innovators yes increase the cap interestingly despite the fact that clinton has struggled to defend her controversial support for doubling h 1b visas in the past computer world spatrick thibodeau notes thatin this election the h 1b visa is not mentioned in her immigration platform her tech policy platform or in the just released draft platform for the democratic party hcl in addition to tata clinton is also tied to hcl the firm that helped disney world in orlando florida lay off 250 american tech workers and forced them to train their lesser skilled foreign replacements brought in on h 1b visas interestingly bob iger the disney ceo who presided over the firingand replacement of hundreds of american workers is also a hillary clinton supporter in august iger hosted a big ticket hollywood fundraiser for clinton at the home of billionaire entertainment mogul haim saban in beverly park a gated community above beverly hills iger serves as a co chair of an open borders lobbying firm that has advocated for the type of expansions to the foreign worker h 1b program that clinton has championed the disney workers who suffered h 1b job theft are planning on filing a discrimination lawsuit against disney based on the contract between disney and hcl the disney workers attorney told breitbart that they made discrimination claims under the title vii of the civil rights act the claims include discrimination based on national origin the displaced workers were american non indian while their replacements were reportedly indian nationals indeed in 2009 hcl caused a stir when its chief executive vineet nayar said that american tech grads are unemployable asdaily techreportedat the time mr nayar speaking before an audience of business partners in new york city blasted american tech grads as unemployable he elaborated that he views american tech grads as inferior to those from india china and brazil as the americans only want to get rich and dream up the next big thing he says students from countries like india china and brazil are more willing to put the effort into boring details of tech process and methodology mr nayar also complains about the cost of training americans he says that most americans are simply tooexpensive totrain the comments sparked outrage amongst the american tech community yet just a few months after hcl s then ceo described american tech graduates as inferior to indian tech grads former president bill clinton accepted an invitation to speak at the company for a hefty fee after nayar s anti american tech workercomments clinton ultimately wound up delivering two paid speeches to hcl for a total of 375 000 the first speech was in april of 2010 and the second was in november of 2011 clinton delivered his november 2011 to hcl at disney world in orlando florida almost exactly three years later 250 american workers at that very same location at disney world in orlando florida were informed that they would be replaced with indianworkers that hcl had helped bring into the country on h 1b visas as one employee explained the american workers were gathered together at a meeting with a top disney executive manyof theworkers who had been described as top performers thought the meeting was to recognize their contributions to the company or was about a potential promotion or a bonus of some kind some employees even thought the company was throwing them a surprise party instead the disney executive reportedly informed them all of you in this room will be losing your jobs in the next 90 days your jobs have been given over to a foreign workforce in the meantime you will be training your replacements until your jobs are 100 percent transferred over to them and if you don t cooperate you will not receive any severance pay tears streamed down employees faces others completely broke down and were crying out loud one employee was murmuring no this can t be as they were marched out of the room ninety days later as one employee found himself living on unemployment payments he spoke of the sleepless nights that accompanied the pressure of trying to providefor food and shelter for his family he spoke of the feeling of alienation that accompanied the huge influx of foreign workers whose presence transformed the composition of the company overnight a foreign language was suddenly being spoken throughout the building hallways the worker said he said he felt betrayed and described the humiliat ing disgraceful and demoralizing experience as he had no choice but to watch a foreign worker completely take over my job i ve spoken to thousands of american families whose lives have been destroyed by this business model said the disney workers attorney sara blackwell who runs an organization that represents high skilled american workers who have been replaced by low wage foreign guest workers american workers tend to have a very emotional reaction to being forced to train their replacements blackwell explained they know that they are being sold out and they feel as though they are contributing to the death of the american tech workforce by training their replacements but they ve been forced to do it in order to get their severance pay which they need so that they can pay their mortgage and feed their families workers tell me that they feel physically sick as they re forced to train their replacements they go home and vomit they cry every single night they go into counseling they re admitted to hospitals there are divorces we ve seen two suicides as a result of these cheap labor practices and when the workers are officially let go and can t find work that kind of emotional distress drives a lot of them to homelessness a lot of them move in with their older parents it has single handedly destroyed american families by the thousands hillary clinton is by far the worst person we could have in the white house blackwell added if hillary wins there will be no protections for these american workers they will have no voice india s favorite senator the obama campaign memo hitting clinton s ties to india also emphasized that in 2004 clinton co founded and became the co chair of the senate india caucus which was coordinated by the u s india political action committee usinpac according to the los angeles times the usinpac cites the tata deal as one of clinton s top three achievements as a senator and evidence of a turnabout in its view from her past criticism of outsourcing even though she was against outsourcing at the beginning of her political career the usinpac website says she has since changed her position and now maintains that offshoring brings as much economic value to the united states as to the country where services are outsourced especially india information technology professionals association of america itpaa an anti offshoring advocacy group that labeled clinton a weasel in 2005 for her embrace of anti american worker labor practices described clinton s india caucus as a group of senators that supports issues important to india including outsourcing and h 1b and l 1 visas a blog post on the cwa union s website warned that clinton s india caucus represents the first time in the history of the u s senate that a country focused caucus has been constituted the cwa post urged readers to check if your u s senator is a member of the caucus if yes write and object to the h 1b visa program and offshore outsourcing of american jobs indeed as the los angeles times reported in her effort to woo wealthy indian americans donors clinton has repeatedly telegraphed her support for a globalized world including the benefits of open borders and outsourcing clinton is successfully wooing wealthy indian americans many of them business leaders with close ties to their native country and an interest in protecting outsourcing laws and expanding access to worker visas her campaign has held three fundraisers in the indian american community recently one of which raised close to 3 million its sponsor told an indian news organization her campaign continues to telegraph sometimes in front of indian american audiences that she sees benefits to a globalized world three weeks ago her husband drew applause at a conference of 14 000 indian americans in washington as he extolled the benefits of open borders easy travel easy immigration he said the outsourcing debate bothered him because it failed to acknowledge the contributions of indians who settled in the u s the same day he headlined a fundraiser at the conference for his wife s campaign while then senator obama who as president pushed policies to expand the displacement of american workers through large scale foreign worker programs eventually apologized for the memo s caustic tone his campaign s message was unmistakably clear a hillary clinton presidency would not represent the interests of american workers but would instead represent the desires of wealthy donors and foreign corporations while clinton s record on these issues were apparently a topic of discussion during the 2008 election it is perhaps interesting that in the 2016 election which has been so driven by the issues of trade immigration national sovereignty and opposition to globalization clinton s historyon this issue has received so little attention it remains to be seen whether clinton will be asked about her controversial positions on these subjects during next week s debate politicsh 1b visahillary clintonimmigration please let us
