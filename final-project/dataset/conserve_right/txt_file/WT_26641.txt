tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn new york ap looking across the stock market it s hard to find a company that isn t vulnerable in some degree to the u s china trade war stocks of companies that do lots of business with china such as chipmakers and other technology companies are obvious candidates for investors to sell when trade worries rise they have fallen more than the rest of the market whenever president donald trump sends out a tweet or speaks about tariffs but investors are also looking beyond these first order effects as they pick out which stocks look

its stock has plunged nearly 22 seven times the loss of the overall s p 500 that s in large part because the price of oil has sunk on worries that the trade war will do lasting damage to the global economy if that happens countries around the world will have less need to burn oil the price of benchmark u s crude plunged nearly 8 on aug 1 its worst day in 4 years banks financial stocks have been

its stock has sunk 16 2 during the recent pick up in trade tensions the escalation in the trade war has led a growing number of economists and analysts to warn about a possible recession and those concerns have spread to the bond market where interest rates have sunk sharply the market for interest rates has gone so haywire this month because of worries about a possible recession that long term treasury yields in some cases are lower than short term yields that s trouble for an industry that relies on borrowing money at short term rates lending it out at long term rates and pocketing the
