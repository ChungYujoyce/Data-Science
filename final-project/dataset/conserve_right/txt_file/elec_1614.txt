hillary clinton told goldman sachs executives that americans who want to limit immigration are fundamentally un american according to the leaked transcript of her private october 2013 speech made public by wikileaks clinton s statement is significant because it suggests that according to polling data clinton views an overwhelming majority of the american electorate to be fundamentally un american according to data from pew research center 83 of the american electorate would like to see immigration levels frozen or reduced clinton s declarationdescribing those who want to limit immigration as unamerican came in the context of her urging action on immigration reform immigration reform is so important clinton told the wall street executives as she demanded that congress get immigration reform done by immigration reform clinton was referring to the 2013 rubio schumer proposal which she supported and which would have granted immediate amnesty and eventual citizenship to millions of illegal aliens would have doubled the annual admission of foreign workers and would have dispensed 33 million green cards to foreign nationals in the span of a single decade despite current record immigration levels clinton went on to suggest that those who oppose such dramatic expansions toimmigrationare fundamentally un american what i really resent most about the obstructionists is they have such a narrow view of america they see america in a way that is no longer reflective of the reality of who we are they re against immigration for reasons that have to do with the past not the future they can t figure out how to invest in the future so they cut everything you know laying off you know young researchers closing labs instead of saying we re better at this than anybody in the world that s where our money should go they just have a backward looking view of america and they play on people s fears not on people s hopes and they have to be rejected i don t care what they call themselves i don t care where they re from they have to be rejected because they are fundamentally unamerican this is not the first time she has described sectors of the american electorate as unamerican at a september fundraiser earlier this year clinton described trump supporters as deplorable and irredeemable but thankfully they are not america clinton said during her goldman sachs speech clinton went on to argue that being american isnot a national identity but rather is an intellectual invention american was an invention clinton declared it was an intellectual invention and we have done pretty well for all these years and these people want to just undermine that very profound sense of who we are and we can t let them do that so it s not just about politics or partisanship it really goes to the heart of what it means to be american clinton s declaration seems to echo a sentiment that has been expressed by mass migration enthusiast republican house speaker paul ryan paul ryan like clinton has previously suggested that america is not a country or a national identity but is rather an intellectual idea america is more than just a country ryan said just a few months before clinton delivered her speech to goldman sachs it s more than chicago or wisconsin it s more than our borders america is an idea it s a very precious idea ryan s statement came as he was stumping for the rubio schumer immigration agenda in 2013 with open borders advocate luis gutierrez who has since endorsed hillary clinton for president over donald trump gutierrez was also one of the first members of congress to endorse ryan for house speaker gutierrez has called ryan his good friend and guiding light on immigration ryan s statement is significant because while a country has borders ideas do not if america is an idea rather than a country that means that refugees in somali have as much right to a job in the united states as the children of the american revolution indeed like clinton speaker ryan has a long record of pushing to expand record high immigration levels and advocating foropen borders this goal is shared by hillary clinton who went so far as to privately tellforeign bankers that her dream was to enact open borders several reports have documented how immigration is not the only issueof agreementbetween paul ryan and hillary clinton as breitbart news has extensively documented ryan s views on foreign migration foreign trade and foreign warsmore closely align with the views of hillary clinton than they do with the views of donald trump and the republican electorate indeed sen tim kaine has predicted that speaker ryan will be the key to passing a president hillary clinton s agenda including enacting the largest amnesty in u s history within her first 100 days in office the overwhelming similarities between the goals of establishment leaders in both political parties and the goals of their wealthy corporate donors like goldman sachs recently prompted green party presidential nominee jill stein to denounce hillary clinton as a corporatist and the face of thenewrepublicanparty both democrats and republicans are funded by big corporate interests stein has written noting that these members of washington s uniparty are united in their shared desire to advance the goals of their wealthy donors rather than the desires of the people bernie sanders has previously explained how open borders backed by both clinton and ryan is a koch brothers proposal that would dissolve national sovereignty and would make everybody in america poorer by allowing corporations to bring in all kinds of people who would work for 2 or 3 an hour and would drive down wages for american workers by bernie sanders own argument hillary clinton s dream is to enact a policy that would make everybody in america poorer and would do away with the concept of the united states as a nation state as a result ofcurrent federal policy every year the u s issues one million plus new green cards admits one million foreign workers refugees and dependents and imports half a million foreign youths sought by college administrators in 1970 fewer than one in 21 americans were foreign born but today as a result of the federal government s four decade long green card gusher nearly one in seven u s residents was born in a foreign country alabama senator jeff sessions has explained that farfrom being fundamentally unamerican recognizing limits and curbing immigration to protect american jobs and wages is rational and is the mainstream view heldby most americans it is not mainstream but extreme to continue surging immigration beyond all historical precedent and it is not rational but radical to refuse to recognize limits sessions has explained sessions has previously noted that clinton s desire to expand immigration beyond all known historical precedent place her at odds with the vast majority of the american electorate hillary clinton has embraced a radical and extreme open borders agenda that properly exposed will make her un electable sessionshas said politicsgoldman sachshillary clintonimmigration please let us know if you re having
