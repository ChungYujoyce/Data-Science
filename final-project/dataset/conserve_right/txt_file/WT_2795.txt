apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic news analysis democrats in their drive toward impeachment charge that president trump withheld u s aid to ukraine until kyiv agreed to launch an investigation into potential corruption involving former vice president joseph r biden and to conduct an inquiry into ukrainian meddling in the 2016 presidential election but there was a much earlier and more blatant episode this time with a democratic president demanding a clear quid pro quo from a desperate foreign leader top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century in the spring of 1996 president clinton was seeking reelection when he met in egypt with boris yeltsin russia s first post soviet leader who was also facing a tough reelection battle a leaked memorandum of the conversation obtained by the washington times found that mr clinton pressured the russian leader by offering u s political support for mr yeltsin s reelection with just one catch russia first had to lift a ban on u s chicken imports imposed over concerns that the poultry was tainted with bad bacteria this is a big issue especially since about 40 of u s poultry is produced in arkansas mr clinton told the russian leader in sharm el sheikh an effort should be made to keep such things from getting out of hand mr clinton did not mention that most of that arkansas chicken was produced by tyson foods inc whose chairman don tyson was a close friend and political supporter mr tyson owned the 4 billion company which was the world s leading chicken processor mr yeltsin agreed to the request he told the president a leader of international stature such as president clinton should support russia and that meant supporting boris yeltsin thought should be given to how to do that wisely double standard critics say the differing responses to mr clinton s and mr trump s presidential horse trading show a double standard by current house democratic leaders the idea that the very act of negotiating would be impeachable requires such a complete lack of historic knowledge that it is a little hard to believe that even house intelligence committee chairman adam b schiff thinks it is real said former house speaker newt gingrich a republican we are watching a pretext for a predetermined outcome the chicken dispute was later made part of talks between then vice president al gore and then russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin days after the march 13 1996 presidential meeting mr gore announced that russia had lifted the chicken ban the meeting came to be known in washington circles as the chicken summit and highlighted for critics how mr clinton was willing to play fast and loose with policy with a major foreign power to boost the market for tainted chicken exports for one of his longtime political donors but the leak of the confidential memorandum to this reporter prompted no impeachment inquiry by congress as occurred after the recent telephone call between president trump and ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky instead the clinton white house ordered the fbi to investigate the leak of the confidential memo and denied the president had gone to bat for a longtime friend and political supporter and his chicken business mike mccurry the white house press secretary at the time did not deny the exchange but he said it was inaccurate to assert that mr clinton promised to shade u s policies toward russia in exchange for lifting the chicken import ban strobe talbott a deputy secretary of state under mr clinton argued in a 2002 book that the washington times scoop offered a distorted and damaging story about the exchange between the presidents while clinton was indeed advancing american commercial interests and doing so on behalf of a company in his home state the notion that he either intended or implied a threat of withholding support for yeltsin if russia didn t ease the import restrictions was nonsense mr talbott wrote stonewalling congress in another parallel to current events the clinton white house and congress sparred furiously over the investigation itself three powerful republicans on capitol hill including house judiciary committee chairman henry hyde and house oversight and government reform committee chairman william clinger sought to investigate the reports of chicken diplomacy sen john mccain arizona republican denounced what he called the president s use of diplomacy to serve anyone s reelection campaign but the congressional inquiry was hampered by the failure of the white house to provide documents similar to impeachment charges that mr trump obstructed the democrats inquiry the russian government demanded that the u s government halt what a spokesman said were provocative leaks of private discussions mr tyson had been a close clinton friend for more than 10 years and provided private jet travel and other perks when mr clinton was governor of arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992 he told the washington post that he and his associates made no secret of thousands of dollars in political donations to clinton election campaigns andrew mccarthy a former federal prosecutor said the clinton yeltsin exchange is similar to mr trump s case it goes to show that virtually all foreign exchange involves quid pro quo and presidents typically conduct policy with an eye on politics mr mccarthy said it further demonstrates that today s pearl clutching about foreign interference in elections conveniently omits various instances of meddling in other countries elections by american presidents and members of congress mr clinton was impeached in 1998 not for the chicken summit offer but for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding a sex scandal he was not convicted in the senate mr trump s defenders also point to a march 2012 incident when president obama was heard on a hot mic telling russian president dmitry medvedev he could shift u s policy in a direction more favorable to moscow if he won a second term that november this is my last election mr obama told mr medvedev after my election i ll have more flexibility the flexibility was a reference to russia s demands to limit u s missile defenses specifically plans to deploy anti missile interceptors in europe that moscow regarded as threats to russian offensive missile forces that certainly was a lot bigger promise than anything trump has done
