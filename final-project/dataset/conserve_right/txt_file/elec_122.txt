energized his campaign for president wednesday night charging out of his first debate having by most accounts from both sides of the political spectrum dominated president obama in a standoff for which he was evidently well prepared the republican nominee was quick on his feet polished and feisty as he repeatedly cut off the moderator and challenged his opponent on the facts his central argument that obama apos s economic policies have consigned the middle class to an eroding status quo echoing the words of vice president biden earlier in the week romney said under the president apos s policies middle income americans have been buried liberal pundits and supporters of the president expressed disappointment coming out of the debate while conservatives were ecstatic romney heads next to the battleground of virginia on thursday while obama heads to wisconsin following a rally in the debate state of colorado it apos s unclear whether romney apos s performance will move the polls but he was clearly looking for a race shaking performance having slipped in recent weeks in several swing state surveys obama though fought wednesday night to cast romney as bad for working americans he slammed romney for wanting to turn medicare into a voucher system repeal the federal health care overhaul and allegedly push a tax cut for top earners each candidate strived throughout the 90 minute debate to appeal to the middle class voters who likely will decide the election five weeks from now while romney accused obama of pushing trickle down government obama accused romney of wanting to double down on the top down policies that led to the financial crisis the debate which focused exclusively on domestic matters was heavy on policy details and light on zingers it was one of three presidential debates set for october and marked romney apos s first opportunity to go toe to toe with the president the debate was tense at times with the candidates standing just feet from each other and often cutting off the moderator pbs apos jim lehrer romney appeared to take a consistently more aggressive tone on stage though the overall tenor of the debate marked a step back from what has become a bitter and nasty campaign in the closing weeks each candidate came armed with studies and stats to bolster his respective position but the central goal was to broaden their appeal before a national audience hurting for jobs and make the case for why their plans would boost growth obama argued that the issue to consider is not where we apos ve been but where we apos re going we apos ve begun to fight our way back obama said he accused romney of wanting to roll back regulations and implement tax cuts skewed toward the wealthy and reverse those gains but romney citing the millions who have gone on food stamps and hit the unemployment lines in the last four years argued that the status quo is not going to cut it we know that the path we apos re taking is not working it apos s time for a new path romney said he said obama apos s push to raise taxes on top earners amounts to a tax on the very small businesses needed for a robust economic recovery you raise taxes and you kill jobs romney said i don apos t want to kill jobs in this environment on taxes though romney sought to wipe away the caricature that the obama campaign has been drawing these last two years of romney as an out of touch millionaire who apos s looking to make the rich richer with his tax cut plan obama again argued wednesday night that the republican nominee is pushing a 5 trillion tax cut plan that would skew toward the wealthy to offset that obama claimed romney would have to either add to the deficit or raise the burden on the middle class it apos s math it apos s arithmetic obama said romney though insisted the 20 percent across the board rate cut he apos s pushing is not nearly as sweeping as the president describes i don apos t have a 5 trillion tax cut romney said further he pledged to hold to his promise that it would be deficit neutral and not hurt the middle class there apos ll be no tax cut that adds to the deficit i want to underline that no tax cut that adds to the deficit romney said he added i will not under any circumstance raise taxes on middle income families romney addressed his tax plan after saying in an interview that one way to offset the rate cut would be to cap deductions at perhaps 17 000 and have taxpayers choose what deductions they want to take the details may have been meant to undercut the obama campaign apos s claims that he has not been specific the president though repeatedly hammered romney at the debate for allegedly hiding the details of his plans from his proposals for implementing tax reform to his plans for replacing obamacare at some point i think the american people have to ask themselves is the reason that gov romney is keeping all these plans to replace the health care law secret because they apos re too good obama said sarcastically obama adamantly defended the health care law saying he apos s warmed to the term obamacare he denied that it was a takeover of health care and warned against repealing it as romney wants to do the debate in denver fell against the backdrop of a sputtering economic recovery and rising u s debt while romney used these factors to argue obama does not deserve a second term the president again made the case that he apos s still cleaning up the mess from the prior administration and needs four more years to finish the job romney arguably had the most to gain out of tuesday apos s performance though competitive with obama in national polls he apos s been slipping in key battlegrounds the debate was a chance for him to close that gap and potentially benefit simply from being on the same stage as the president the two candidates debate next on oct 16 and for the last time on oct 22 the only vice presidential debate is set for oct 11 get all the stories you need to know from
