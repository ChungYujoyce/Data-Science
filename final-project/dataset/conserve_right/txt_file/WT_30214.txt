tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn some of you may remember that the conservative tea party was founded in 2009 after cnbc analyst rick santelli offered an unprecedented on camera rant from the floor of the chicago mercantile exchange railing against the obama administration and calling for the formation of a new tea party grassroots folks took the cue and a movement was born complete with such very active organizers as the tea party patriots and tea party express with their good cheer enthusiasm and devotion to founding principles the tea party outreach proved so compelling and successful that some progressive groups even tried to emulate their tactics the tea partyers have another distinction however they have proved intensely and consistently loyal to president trump perhaps something for gop strategists to consider as 2020 looms and the battle for voters and party unity gets underway a decade after the tea party emerged as a political force its former supporters are some of donald trump s most stalwart republican supporters according to a new analysis of pew research center panel surveys from 2014 through 2018 the pollster says noting that the tea party s very positive feelings toward the president did not waver as the years went by top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey republicans who had positive views of the tea party movement in 2014 or 2015 were among trump s most enthusiastic backers during the 2016 campaign and unlike republicans who had mixed or negative opinions of the tea party they continued to have very positive feelings about trump through his first year as president the analysis said the pollster s complex research has a grand finale though they also developed a feeling thermometer which gauged the temperature of feelings about the president going from cold to hot on a scale of 1 to 100 in 2018 tea partyers gave mr trump a toasty 78 on the scale up from 61 when he took office their positive sentiment is only increasing these tea party supporters were more likely than other republicans to say that trump s election made positive changes in what the party stands for in a 2016 postelection survey the pew researchers noted for the lexicon impeach a mania handy term coined by breitbart com for the democratic party s obsessive fixation on impeaching president trump above all else and the nonstop news coverage that accompanies it a moment with reagan today the united states stands as a beacon of liberty and democratic strength before the community of nations we are

highest tribute we can pay to the many who have fallen in the service of our nation from president ronald reagan s official proclamation for memorial day on may 25 1981 honk if you love infrastructure the u s travel association has released new research revealing that americans avoided an estimated 47 5 million auto trips due to highway congestion in 2018 costing the economy 30 billion in travel spending and 248 000 american jobs heading into memorial day and the summer travel season this suite of research shows that one the country is becoming less connected because of strained infrastructure and two there is a measurable economic cost to that problem said the organization s president and ceo roger dow the infrastructure discussion tends to grind to a political halt when it turns to resources so we tested the funding question with polling the interesting thing we found is that americans are willing to pay more as long as their money is explicitly used to improve transportation in their region mr dow says among the findings 66 1 of auto travelers would rather pay an additional 2 3 each way to fund transportation projects than sit for an additional one to two hours in traffic each way another 60 said traffic congestion would be a greater deterrent to car travel than a 25 cent increase in gas taxes while 80 said additional gas taxes will not have a negative impact the frequency of their travel by car when told congress is considering proposals to increase other taxes and fees on drivers that would result in transportation improvements 64 8 of auto travelers are willing to support such proposals the research said our survey gave travelers a choice would you rather pay more or continue to sit in traffic two thirds said they would rather pay a little more we hope that gives congress some encouragement to make difficult decisions because data shows us that inaction is putting the brakes on connectivity and prosperity mr dow notes the
