ecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion john bolton s sudden departure from the white house last week cheered progressives who believe america has no enemies just friends whose grievances we ve failed to address as well as those conservatives who believe if we leave our enemies alone they ll return the favor and you thought there was no common ground between left and right count me among those not cheered mr bolton calls himself an americanist meaning he believes this nation must be strong and resolute enough to daunt its enemies because enemies we shall always have and reassure its friends because friends are good and useful to have president trump s former national security adviser is no proponent of nation building in the sense of planting democracy in arid soils at the same time he recognizes that if the united states doesn t shoulder some significant global responsibilities no other nation and certainly no transnational organization will top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties my point is not that you or more consequentially mr trump should admire mr bolton s moustache and agree with his every policy preference my point is that mr bolton has been providing the president with strategic thinking grounded in a serious reading of our adversaries histories ideologies intentions and capabilities h r mcmaster who preceded mr bolton as national security adviser did the same their personalities are very different gen mcmaster is an even tempered soldier scholar ambassador bolton a bit of a firebrand but both brought to the oval office useful perspectives and reasoned policy options mr bolton s departure was reportedly precipitated when mr trump began to consider giving in to demands from iran s rulers to relieve economic pressure on them as a pre condition for new talks about their nuclear weapons program support for terrorists imperialist aggression and other malign activities to do so would repeat one of president obama s worst errors the lifting of sanctions following an interim agreement with the islamic republic of iran in 2013 from that point on iranian foreign minister javad zarif perceiving that concluding a deal had become politically essential to mr obama made no concessions mr obama s negotiators led by secretary of state john kerry made one after another had the talks been a poker game mr kerry would have come home shirtless it s unfortunate that mr trump did not have mr bolton advising him over the weekend when saudi arabia s largest oil production facilities were attacked with drones and cruise missiles houthi rebels in yemen funded armed and instructed by tehran quickly claimed credit almost as quickly secretary of state mike pompeo said he wasn t buying it there is no evidence the attacks came from yemen he tweeted amid all the calls for de escalation iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world s energy supply based on u s intelligence reports administration officials believe the guided munitions were launched from the north from iranian soil wherever they came from we can confidently conclude that iran s rulers were responsible the reason for the houthi claim to provide those rulers with sufficient plausible deniability to satisfy their sympathizers and apologists a not insignificant coterie in both washington and europe the benefit of such subterfuge became apparent when just hours after the attack iran s rulers offered to help shore up the global economy by increasing their oil output to make up for the 5 percent of global supplies that their act of war has put offline talk about arsonists volunteering to assist the fire brigade oh and by the way in exchange for that favor they really must insist that the united states lift its silly sanctions the faux goodwill was soon replaced by menace everybody should know that all american bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2 000 kilometers around iran are within the range of our missiles an iranian islamic revolutionary guard commander noted on sunday in case president trump failed to catch his drift he added iran has always been ready for a full fledged war ambassador bolton would not take such threats lightly he d suggest the president review a list of punitive responses that does not imply another endless war it does imply inflicting pain on the theocratic regime an interesting question did iran s rulers figure that with the administration s leading hawk out of the picture now would be the perfect time to flex their muscles and do some damage to an american strategic partner and the global economy sophisticated attacks require preparation but who s to say that the pieces were not already in place awaiting the right opportunity as president trump considers his options he should remember a cardinal rule if we reward aggression we ll get more of it this episode also should remind us how foolish we would be ever to allow a regime whose slogan for 40 years has been death to america to acquire nuclear warheads and missiles that can deliver them anywhere on the planet i m confident secretary pompeo secretary of defense mark esper and cia director gina haspel get all that and are counseling mr trump accordingly nevertheless i d sleep better if ambassador bolton were still on the job he d be the loudest and most vehement voice opposing both appeasement and isolationism he d tell the president plainly that america cannot become great again by submitting to islamist bullies who will probe with their bayonets so long as they feel mush stopping only when they hit steel he d warn against recycling mr obama s failed policies you see why i m not cheered by his departure from the white house
