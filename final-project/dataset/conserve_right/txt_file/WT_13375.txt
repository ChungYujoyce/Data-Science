apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinion sorry to spoil the party but i am completely unimpressed with apple s announcement last week that it will resume manufacturing some computers in the united states next year i m even less impressed with the larger narrative continually fed by such news for months that america is reclaiming from an over the hill china the mantle of global industrial leadership although apple ceo tim cook s motives may be unimpeachable and american high tech manufacturing won t be rebuilt in a day his decision certainly looks like tokenism for example in early 2011 the now deceased apple founder steve jobs reportedly told president obama that the manufacturing jobs sent overseas by the company aren t coming back suddenly apple now sees a dramatically different sourcing picture at the same time the product reportedly to become american made again is a desktop computer a breed that innovation by apple and many other tech firms is rapidly making obsolete top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore the 100 million mr cook says apple will spend on the new facility sounds considerable especially for a pr gambit but the company s cash hoard tops 120 billion and its 2012 nonretail capital expenditures budget is about 9 5 billion from that perspective its glowing new notices are a screaming bargain and mr cook no doubt expects the actual cost to be far less once state and local governments start falling all over themselves trying to lure the investment with big tax breaks and subsidies no more credible is the all but viral america supplanting china meme which most recently is dominating the new issue of the atlantic monthly a seemingly endless string of anecdotes and high profile champions including mr obama compellingly buttress the claim so do falling energy costs for domestic industry rising chinese wages and the appeal to manufacturers of locating close to customers the only problem the national and global level data say almost exactly the opposite for example if china s manufacturing clock is rapidly being cleaned by america why have the chinese taken the global industrial output lead during the past two years according to the consulting firm ihs why does the manufacturing dominated u s trade deficit with china keep growing robustly despite stagnating overall u s economic growth why did the u s manufacturing trade deficit with china set a new monthly record as shown in census bureau data released yesterday why are american purchases of chinese manufacturers today increasing faster relative to u s economic growth than before the recession when no one had spotted an american manufacturing renaissance why have high value goods as a share of these u s imports risen from 15 5 percent to 20 86 percent since 2000 by the most conservative methodology and from 16 39 percent to 28 64 percent if products like cellphones and smartphones are included and why will an upcoming u s business and industry council report reveal that the share of high value u s manufacturing markets supplied by china is up more than tenfold since 1997 and hit 6 20 percent last year moreover if american manufacturing is becoming such a world beater why do ihs calculations show it losing ground in global output rankings to the crisis ridden european union why did the overall u s manufacturing trade deficit hit its own all time high in october according to new u s government figures and why were foreign based manufacturers last year supplying fully 37 57 percent of u s consumption of a broad cross section of advanced industrial goods up from 24 49 percent in 1997 american manufacturing s promise remains unmistakable reflecting strengths like robust innovation and high productivity but its performance remains hamstrung by public policy blunders especially international trade decisions that have permitted unfettered import competition from countries that impede u s exports that produce in conditions unacceptable in the united states or both once these policies are overhauled national reindustrialization could actually move the economic needle but not one instant before alan tonelson is a research fellow at the u s business and industry council a national business organization whose nearly 2 000 members are mainly small and medium sized domestic manufacturers the author of the race to the bottom mr tonelson also is a contributor to the council s website www americaneconomicalert or
