continue to follow the facts pence said but a senior homeland security official in a briefing held on condition that the official not be identified said there s no expectation of any domestic travel restrictions at this time by air or rail britain has taken a different approach as countries across europe and other afflicted areas have shut schools scrapped large public events and shuttered bars

the irish republic schools colleges daycare centers and cultural institutions were closed in the u s senate majority leader mitch mcconnell canceled the coming week s planned recess to deal with the matter senate democrats called on mcconnell who let senators leave town for the weekend to reconvene now and pass the aid package everyone is going to have new ideas but that will slow things down said sen chuck schumer the top senate democrat we have to act immediately with the president s backing and robust republican support from the house vote passage appears likely while anxiety hangs over the nation the president took a lighter tone at moments as he addressed the media he boasted that he was honored that the dow jones industrial average reacted with a huge one day gain friday after he announced the national emergency declaration i think we should do one of them every day perhaps joked trump who wore a blue baseball cap emblazoned with usa how about five times a day the president didn t mention that despite friday s pickup the market had its worst week since october 2008 in just a few weeks u s stocks have lost all the gains made during 2019 the crush of activity capped a tumultuous week in washington as the fast moving virus left ordinary americans suddenly navigating self quarantines school closures and a changed way of life trump took a number of other actions to bolster energy markets ease the financial burden for americans with student loans and give medical professionals additional flexibility in treating patients during the public health crisis central to the aid package from congress which builds on an emergency 8 3 billion measure approved earlier are the free testing sick pay and family leave provisions providing sick pay for workers is a crucial element of federal efforts to stop the rapid spread of the infection officials warn that the nation s healthcare system could quickly become overwhelmed with gravely sick patients as suddenly happened in italy one of the countries hardest hit by the virus the ability to ensure paychecks will keep flowing for people self quarantining or caring for others can help assure americans they will not fall into financial hardship the legislation also offers three months of paid family and medical leave small and mid sized employers will be reimbursed through tax credits both treasury secretary mnuchin and house speaker nancy pelosi promised a third coronavirus package will follow soon with more aggressive steps to boost the u s economy which economists fear has already slipped into recession mnuchin said saturday that lawmakers will have to fix a minor error in the approved house bill which could create some hiccups in getting the measure to trump s desk by early in the week it involves a delicately negotiated provision about a tax credit for businesses to provide sick leave trump on friday also told people to expect the imminent rollout of a website facilitated by google that would guide users through a series of questions to determine whether they should be screened for the virus if testing is recommended users would be directed to a local testing location which could include parking lots at walmart target walgreens and other chains but it quickly became apparent that such a fast track to testing was in early stages of development and would not be widely employed soon

increasingly hunkers down the pentagon and state department announced new guidance aimed at limiting movement of its personnel and promoting social distancing in hopes of reducing the impact of the
