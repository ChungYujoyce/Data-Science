ever set foot in the oval office early on we heard what their strategy was it was kill romney she said adding a message to mr obama not when i m next to him you better not mr romney for his part didn t weigh in on that characterization of mr obama s strategy during the joint interview he also declined to describe the status of the vice presidential search saying that s something i m keeping close with my team speculation is high about whom mr romney will choose as his no 2 with his search well under way and his self imposed deadline for picking a running mate before the convention looming large it s the biggest decision he will make between now and when he accepts the gop s presidential nomination in late august talk in republican circles has focused on men as likely top prospects including ohio sen rob portman former minnesota gov tim pawlenty wisconsin rep paul ryan florida sen marco rubio new jersey gov chris christie and louisiana gov bobby jindal but no less than a half dozen other names also have popped up including new hampshire sen kelly ayotte who walked in a july fourth parade with mr romney on wednesday as well as south carolina gov nikki haley new mexico gov susana martinez and former ebay ceo meg whitman in the interview mrs romney also sketched out her own requirements for what she would like to see in a running mate saying the person should be someone that obviously can do the job but will be able to carry through with some of the other responsibilities she said the person should be someone who will have her husband s back and who he will enjoy being around him and have the same personality type she added competent capable and willing to serve this country i think there s lots of good people out there that fill that bill right now it s been four years since sen john mccain selected then alaska gov sarah palin a rock ribbed conservative who was little known outside of her home state to be the first female on a republican presidential ticket as he sought a way to both fire up the gop s core supporters while narrowing democratic sen barack obama s advantage with female voters it wasn t long before questions about mrs palin s readiness to be president and criticism of an inadequate vetting process became a major problem for mr mccain with critics using the pick to pummel the nominee on his decision making this year mr romney has let that experience drive his criteria he has said that preparedness to be president is his no 1 requirement for a vice president unlike four years ago republican base voters are energized largely by a desire to beat mr obama but polls show that mr romney still badly trails mr obama among women and putting one on the ticket or even just raising the possibility of a female running mate could help carve into that support the romneys gave the rare joint interview to cbs as they spent the week relaxing with their family at their lakeside estate in wolfeboro officially the campaign says mr romney is doing what he s done for the past decade enjoying family time during a weeklong holiday in new hampshire it s also a break from the campaign trail and a chance to relax before the pre convention push but unofficially the bit of down time is a chance for the contemplative mr romney to consider how the campaign is going and adjust strategy as necessary in a contest that polls show is close he and his wife huddled tuesday at the estate for at least 45 minutes with campaign manager matt rhoades senior adviser beth myers and top strategist stuart stevens on the deck that overlooks the lawn behind his home mr romney s five sons particularly his eldest son tagg also serve as informal political advisers and all have been on hand all week virtually assuring that the campaign and the running mate search were being discussed fueling the running mate talk was the fact that several potential candidates essentially were auditioning for the spot this week mr portman was headlining a fundraiser in concord n h this weekend and also wrote an opinion piece published in an ohio newspaper this week to counter mr obama s campaign appearances in the state thursday and friday mr pawlenty and mr jindal both were in ohio for the same reason to campaign for romney near mr obama s events mr romney s vacation ends sunday when he s scheduled to head to new york for fundraising
