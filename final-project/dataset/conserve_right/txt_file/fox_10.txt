y members of the house intelligence committee that released the memo alleging surveillance abuse in the investigation of the trump campaign join the debate on fox news sunday this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday february 4 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news sunday host and hello again from fox news in washington well someone forgot to pay the electricity bill not really but we lost power to our studio overnight and with duct tape and bailing wire and a couple of hamsters running really hard we have jerry rigged an operation to put on this program keep your fingers crossed the nation aposs capital is still arguing this weekend about that house republican memo accusing the offense of abusing their authority to surveilled a former trump campaign advisor and suggesting there aposs politics at the center of the restaurant investigation we begin this hour with two members of the house intelligence committee from san francisco democratic congressman eric swalwell and from salt lake city republican chris stewart gentlemen now that we aposve seen the memo the big question is where does this leave the robert mueller special counsel investigation here aposs a tweet that the president put out this weekend the memo totally vindicates trump in probe but the russian witch hunt goes on and on there was no collusion and there was no obstruction the world now used because of one year of looking endlessly and finding nothing collusion is dead this is an american disgrace congressman stewart does the gop memo vindicate the president does it end the need for the special prosecutor aposs investigation rep chris stewart r utah intelligence committee no it doesn apost end that made it all i think it would be a mistake for anyone to suggest that the special counsel shouldn apost complete his work i support his work i want him to finish it i hope he finishes it as quickly as possible this memo has frankly nothing at all to do with a special counsel it was one of the criticisms of people last week and before that who had never seen the memo who said you know this is to impugn the integrity and the work of the special counsel as you know now chris it has nothing to do with at all with that they aposre very separate i hope the special counsel will complete his work and work to the american people wallace so what you think the president is up to when he puts out a tweet saying that this memo vindicates him and obviates the need for any investigation stewart yes i think a couple things you know if i could take 30 seconds to review something that you said for more than a year we had collusion conspiracy you know people accused of treason no one is making that accusation anymore at least no one serious even dianne feinstein has said there is no evidence of collusion and i think that aposs the point the president is making the essence of this memo is something quite different and again it aposs as you said hillary clinton and the dnc hired fusion gps who then hired ironically a foreign agent to create this dossier that we know is just political garbage it aposs no more credible than a 2 novel and the fbi used that dossier to survey a private u s citizen who had no accusations against him except for he has associations with the trump campaign it aposs an absolute abuse of power and we just want the american people to know that wallace all right we aposre going to get into the memo in a minute i want to talk and turned to congressman swalwell about the state of the investigation congressman on friday the president was asked about deputy attorney general rod rosenstein who signed one of the request applications for this fisa warrant and also is the only person who can either fire or limit the investigation by robert mueller here was the president begin video clip reporter does it make you more likely to fire rosenstein do you still have confidence in him after reading the memo donald trump president of the united states you figure that one out end video clip wallace congressman swalwell is this memo an excuse to shut down the mueller investigation rep eric swalwell d cali intelligence committee it does appear that way chris and good morning to my colleague chris stewart we believe that the memo that the republicans put out shows not a single abuse but a willingness to risk our republic to protect the president so i hope that mr stewart is sincere when we go back to washington this week that he would do all he could to protect bob mueller and mr rosenstein and support the bipartisan legislation that aposs out there that would do that and also that would support releasing the democratic memo that puts into context point by point the seriousness of this investigation as well as new unseen evidence that bolsters the fbi aposs credibility wallace i promise i aposm going to get to the memo and the whole controversy about fisa and a moment but here aposs the question here aposs the issue i don apost understand congressman stewart the house intelligence committee is in the midst of a broad investigation of unprecedented russian interference in an american election in 2016 and yet you decide in the midst of that investigation to write a memo on this one particular point which is what happened or didn apost happen in the fisa court is the are house republicans were concerned about protecting us from the russians or protecting us from the fbi stewart well a little bit of both now actually that aposs not what we expected when we started this investigation chris just a few months before the election i was in moscow and i came home and talked to the media and said they aposre going to mess with our elections there aposs just no question that that was intention and there aposs no question that they did and that aposs the impetus for the house investigation we want to look at their how they messed how they interfered and hopefully preclude that from happening in the future but as a result of that we became aware of this abuse by the fbi and department of justice officials and we just felt like this was so important it aposs kind of separate from a russian investigation but it aposs so important that we advise the american people of that and that aposs why we wanted to release this memo get this information out there as quickly as possible we aposll continue the investigation on both sides but again this is a bit of a pause for us to say this is meaningful information the american people deserve to know wallace do you buy that congressman swalwell swalwell well no i don apost because i aposve seen all of the evidence i aposve sat in for almost every single second that a witness has testified i wish my republican colleagues would do the same four public transcripts have been released and mr stewart was either not present or didn apost ask a single question during that and that is crosstalk wallace well all right that aposs kind of inside baseball let aposs get let aposs get to the issue swalwell sure but the issue is that there aposs not a willingness to look at the evidence they assert that there aposs no collusion but there aposs no interest or willingness to understand the evidence in this case and so the evidence that we aposve seen with a limited subpoena power we have is a deep willingness that exists around the trump campaign and the trump family and the trump businesses to work with the russians and to receive information on hillary clinton and we ought to do something about it to make sure that doesn apost happen again crosstalk stewart i have to respond to that if i could wallace go ahead look my friend mr swalwell if you want to convince people go convince your own democratic allies go convince dianne feinstein go convince general clapper and many others they have said there aposs no evidence of collusion it aposs not just the republicans who were saying that wallace but congressman stewart i want to put up several things a full screen because let aposs put it up on the screen right now because some of the events have nothing to do with the carter page warrant which again is why i wonder why you decided to focus just on that george papadopoulos being told by russians months before that they had dirt on hillary clinton the trump tower meeting between top campaign aides and a russian lawyer general michael flynn lying about his meeting with the russian ambassador you suggested at the beginning of this interview that you saw no evidence of collusion and no evidence of obstruction of justice but you are focusing i aposm not saying it aposs not legitimate and we will talk about it i promise after you answer this question but you are focusing on what happened in the fisa court with regard to carter page stewart yes because the american people didn apost know about this you knew about george papadopoulos you know about general flynn all of that had been already reported this had not been reported and we felt like once again the american people wanted to know by the way those things that you talked about in the work of the special counsel which let me restate i support and want him to continue but none of that virtually none of that indicates any collusion on behalf of the trump campaign and russian officials there just isn apost anything you aposve got some financial irregularities that happened years before the election you got some people in a process crime as they call it where they weren apost honest with the fbi but no one has said or showing evidence of collusion between trump officials and any russian agents there just simply isn apost any wallace well let aposs talk about the memo and its central allegation which was that the fbi misled the fisa court the foreign intelligence surveillance act court to get a warrant on to surveilled carter page without revealing the fact that this was political oppo research the dossier here was the house intel chairman devin nunes begin video clip rep devin nunes r cali chairman house intelligence committee i think the american people understand that the fbi should not go to secret courts using information that was paid for by the democrats to open up investigations to get warrants on people of the other political party that aposs the type of stuff that happens in banana republics end video clip wallace congressman swalwell doesn apost that concern you at all that they went to get this warrant and at least part of it according to some reports the lead item in the application was the russia dossier and as we all know that was paid for the dnc and the clinton campaign swalwell chris there was a barrage of evidence that they presented to the courts including a disclosure that the steele dossier had a political motivation but it also included that george papadopoulos had been contacted about receiving russian dirt he was on the same foreign policy team as carter page carter page also since 2013 had been suspected of being a russian foreign agent we just learned today breaking news before i can on the site the carter page sent a letter in 2013 saying that he had been doing work for the kremlin they had all the right of the world to be concerned about these individuals wallace i want to focus on one sentence in the memo gentlemen deputy director mccabe testified before the committee in december 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought would have been sought from fisc that aposs the foreign intelligence surveillance court without the steele dossier congressman stewart i notice that that aposs not in quote rep chris stewart r utah intelligence committee yes wallace did deputy director mccabe actually say that stewart that may not have been his exact phrase but i assure you i was there i was part of the questioning i promise you that the intent of his answers was that we would not have gone forward were it not for this dossier there were two basic pieces of evidence the dossier and then ironically a yahoo news report that was based on what the dossier and the author of that news report yesterday was shocked he said i can apost believe they would use my news reporting as evidence before the fisa court when it was clearly based on the dossier the information was fed to him by fusion gps and by christopher steele that was the evidence that was the bulk of the evidence for justifying this dossier and they knew it was weak that aposs why they didn apost want to be honest with the fisa court and reveal to them that oh by the way this was written by the democrats this is paid for by the democrats and you know that aposs one of the things we are most concerned about crosstalk wallace we are beginning to run out of time let me bring in congressman swalwell why not it does seem to show bad faith why wouldn apost the fbi include in its application the fact that the dossier had been bought and paid for by the democrats swalwell well i asked andy mccabe that is not what he said they have the transcript i don apost understand why they wouldn apost quote from the transcript they did disclose that it was a politically motivated source that aposs what the judge needed to know and again i think this is just an effort to torch the credibility of the fbi crosstalk wallace did they put in the fact that it was bought and paid for by the clinton campaign and the dnc and if not why not swalwell you know what they did chris they masked they masked the names of most of the individuals and last year the accusation against the fbi was that they were unmasking names so when they do the right thing and mask the name and just say there aposs political bias you are saying that that aposs wrong and when they don apost do that you are saying that aposs wrong you can apost have it both ways wallace when they unmask its republicans but when they mask its democrats swalwell that aposs what aposs being alleged here by house republican colleagues stewart chris two things on this that are very very important if i were the fisa judge i would be furious that this information was withheld for me it clearly is relevant it clearly is important and the second thing is we aposve been questioning about we aposre tearing down the integrity of the fbi i aposm a former military officer i understand the necessity to protect your troops but that aposs not what aposs going on here i aposve been contacted by fbi agents in the last few days and thank you for doing this we recognize that you aposre trying to hold us accountable they have enormous power enormous authority with that must come enormous accountability that aposs all we are trying to do here is to hold certain individuals accountable if they abuse that power wallace gentlemen we aposre going to have to leave it there congressman stewart congressman swalwell swalwell my pleasure wallace thank you both thanks for your time stewart thank you wallace and of course we aposll stay on top of where your committee goes next up next we aposll bring in former cia director and former defense secretary leon panetta for some perspective on what aposs going on in washington commercial break wallace leon panetta has seen more than his share of washington controversies he worked for the nixon administration before being forced out he was bill clinton aposs chief of staff and he served barak obama as cia director and then defense secretary secretary panetta joins us now from california and welcome back to fox news sunday leon panetta former defense secretary nice to be with you chris wallace you as we suggested have lived through a lot watergate the clinton impeachment compared to those how should folks see where we are right now how broken is washington panetta chris i during my 50 years of public life i aposve had the honor of seeing washington at its best and i aposve also seen washington at its worst the good news is i aposve seen washington work i aposve seen democrats and republicans work together in order to solve problems in our country the problem today is that washington is largely dysfunctional and republicans and democrats are simply unable to be able to work together to resolve the tremendous issues that face this country i aposm worried about this dysfunction because it goes to the heart of our democracy and i think ultimately if they don apost get together and govern this country that it will ultimately weaken the united states by virtue of that wallace you said recently for the president to release the house republican memo over the objections of the fbi and the department of justice would create quote in your words a constitutional crisis is that a bit of an overstatement panetta well i aposm a believer in the rule of law in this country and i aposm a believer in the importance of our constitution and the relationship between the president and our law enforcement authorities i think in order for our democracy to function you have to have a relationship of trust between the president and those who are responsible for enforcing the law the justice department and the fbi and if that trust breaks down then i think it does undermine the rule of law in this country and that in effect creates a crisis wallace let me approach this from a different aspect which is the criminalization of politics you were for almost three years bill clinton aposs white house chief of staff during the long special counsel investigation that went everywhere from whitewater to monica lewinski and i aposm going to put a quote that you said while you were the clinton chief of staff in this town too much is done on the basis of innuendo and speculation every mistake becomes a conspiracy every charge becomes a conviction every rumor becomes reality that aposs the way this town is built question couldn apost donald trump say the same thing panetta yes i think that aposs a pretty damn good quote because that in effect i think that in effect is what happens in washington that there aposs too much innuendo there aposs too much failure to kind of deal with each other on the basis of trust and honesty and so the result is that we engage in these partisan attacks we engage in what i think is trench warfare in washington in which both parties stay in their trenches throw grenades at one another and fail to govern and i think that aposs why the american people are angry and frustrated very frankly is because they look at washington and see that it doesn apost work and that concerns us all chris wallace fox news host but i guess the point is this that as a democrat you probably thought that bill clinton was being hounded by an inspector javert like special counsel people who support donald trump may feel the same way about the special counsel investigation of him panetta i look i understand that i understand how presidents can have that feeling that somehow you know there are people out there that trying to get them no matter what they try to do i understand that but i think they also need to understand whether they aposre democrats or republicans that we have an obligation in this country to find the truth and to establish what the truth is and when you try to avoid the truth ultimately it is going to come out we are going to find out what happened here with the russian we aposre going to find out whether or not there was any collusion involved we aposll find that out and to try to pretend that somehow we can avoid that i think is only fooling yourself wallace let aposs talk about the practical effect of what happened this week from your long experience the partisan break inside the house intelligence committee panetta well i that worries me because it damages frankly an institution that is critical to our national security the house intelligence committee just like the senate intelligence committee was established in order to provide bipartisan oversight of very highly sensitive and classified intelligence information to make sure that our intelligence agencies law enforcement agencies were doing what is necessary to do but pursuant to our constitution and to the rule of law when that bipartisanship breaks down and when intelligence starts to be used on a partisan basis to score political points i think that really undermines the way the intelligence committee is supposed to function and it aposs going to hurt our ability to be able to have the kind of oversight we need in our democracy wallace the fisa process to get a warrant in extraordinary circumstances to surveil an american citizen now devin nunes chair of the house intelligence committee said he had an obligation to bring up according to his argument the fact that the democrats played politics this and the fbi aided and abetted them panetta well again i aposm concerned about those kinds of charges undermining trust in the fisa process the fisa process was designed in order to make sure that we could do surveillance against potential terrorists and those who would undermine our country and that is the purpose of a fisa process is to be able to insure that we can do surveillance of those who have the worst instincts in terms of our country it works it has worked the fisa judges are no pushovers they are responsible individuals in my experience who carefully review all of the evidence that is presented to them and it isn apost just a little bit of evidence these applications to fisa are sometimes 50 or 60 pages long highly classified information and a great deal of support investigation in order to justify those warrants i think in this instance very frankly that the nunes charges against fisa particularly without looking at the entire application without talking to the judges who actually make these decisions i think that aposs irresponsible wallace let aposs play a thought experiment if you were donald trump aposs white house chief of staff right now what advice would you give him what should he do going forward panetta i think the president of the united states has to focus first and foremost on being president of the united states i realize that this investigation is going on i realize that from a personal view it probably bothers the hell out of him i understand that but at the same time it aposs part of the process in our country to investigate what happened here we know as a result of 17 intelligence agencies that russia tried to undermine our election process that aposs a serious attack on our country by an adversary and so we ought to allow the process to proceed that looks at what happen and make sure it doesn apost happen again and at the same time the president frankly needs to focus on the economy on infrastructure on improving the ability of all americans in order to succeed in our country that aposs what presidents need to focus on and if he spends his time tweeting about the investigation or trying to tweet about undermining the fbi very frankly he aposs going to hurt his presidency wallace and finally and i aposve got about a minute left here let aposs say he ignores panetta aposs advice and decides to move against either rod rosenstein or robert mueller panetta i think it aposs a big mistake i mean these are people that he appointed to office at least from my impression these are people who are credible and trying to do their job in a conscientious and dedicated way i think if he tries to go after them and tries to somehow appear to be obstructing the process that aposs involved in this investigation he aposs going to hurt himself he aposs going to hurt the presidency but more importantly he aposs going to hurt the country wallace secretary panetta thank you thanks for sharing part of your weekend with us please come back sir panetta thanks very much chris up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss what aposs in the memo and what aposs not plus what would you like to ask the panel about whether it sheds any more light on the russia investigation just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace now you can connect with fox news sunday on facebook and twitter be sure to check out exclusive material online at facebook and share us with other fox fans and tweet us at foxnewssunday using fns be part of the discussion weigh in on the discussion every fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i think it aposs terrible if you want to know the truth i think it aposs a disgrace what aposs going on in this country i think it aposs a disgrace and when you look at that and you see that and so many other things what aposs going on a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves and much worse than that end video clip wallace president trump in the oval office calling out top officials at the fbi and justice department for allegedly playing politics as they conducted the russia investigation and it aposs time now for our sunday group and because of our technical problems they are across town at another studio howard kurtz host of mediabuzz and author of the new book media madness mo elleithee of georgetown aposs universities institute of politics and public service jonathan swan national political reporter for axios and fox news correspondent gillian turner guys i miss you but we aposre in the dark over here all right let me start jonathan people are going to disagree obviously they are about the substance of the house republican memo what it shows or what it doesn apost show but to a certain degree haven apost the president and republicans already succeed to the degree that they have raised doubts about the fbi playing politics and to that extent have they undermined the credibility of the special counsel investigation jonathan swan national political reporter axios well there aposs no question about that i mean we we saw some polling we did some polling with surveymonkey overnight on friday which showed that the support for the fbi among republican voters has plummeted significantly in the space of a year and donald trump can move public opinion particularly among the republican voting bloc like nobody else you saw what he did to the nfl so there aposs no question that the view of the fbi is changing and there aposs no question that there aposs been a general muddying of the waters among the electorate it aposs not just conservative media we aposre seeing it in the mainstream media as well wallace so if you get someone like congressman stewart ph who set at the beginning of the program the republican congressman on house intel hey look this memo is a separate issue i just want the investigation to continue and trey gowdy has said the same thing are they being a bit disingenuous swan well i i can apost speak for them personally but the idea that this can be hermetically sealed and that it aposs a completely different issue i mean paul ryan was trying to have it both ways he came out and said you know that i support releasing the memo but it has nothing to do with undermining the leadership of the department of justice the fbi or this investigation the president of the united states has explicitly said this so you know the tribune of the republican party is out there the guy with the biggest megaphone explicitly drawing that link so whether i can apost speak to members as individual motivations but the fact is that aposs exactly what aposs being done here supported by the president aposs boosters in the media wallace to give you a sense of the impact this is having we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from jean r page she writes if it is true that the fisa warrant was issued under false pretenses wouldn apost it be appropriate to shut the whole russian investigation down including dismissal of special counsel mo how do you answer jean mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public services i think this is exactly the point that this is a kind of muddying of the waters to try to undermine the mueller investigation which the president himself has said he wants to do you know you aposve got not just the democrats on the committee but members of the intelligence community who say that is not a true fact that this fisa warrant was issued under false pretenses that it was pegged entirely and exclusively to the dossier we know that carter page who it it is unfathomable to me that republicans want to stake their credibility on on carter page who was on on the radar screen of the intelligence community who himself had previously called himself an advisor to the kremlin that that they had him on their radar screen before the memo itself says that the entire investigation was not prompted by carter page but by george papadopoulos and his actions but none of this information is getting out because the house republicans on the intelligence committee devin nunes cherry picked the information and refuses to release any more information and despite all of their calls for transparency they this could not be less transparent of a of a memo or of a process they aposre not putting out allowing the democrats to respond they aposre not putting out the supporting information so i think this speaks exactly to that point it aposs taking inaudible wallace well it let me just interrupt for a second elleithee yes wallace i mean in fairness the republicans say that they are going to vote to release the memo it will then go to the president for declassification the democratic memo so we can apost say at this point that they aposve cut them off elleithee well and we aposll see because what aposs going to happen now is you aposre what and what i think they have done and what they have done a masterful job of is hyper partisan making this a hyper partisan issue now it aposs going to be democrats and republicans fighting over two competing memos and that aposs just going to further muddy the water as opposed to just letting the legitimate investigation play itself out which is what it can ph happen wallace yes i want to i want to pick up on that with you jillian as our foreign policy expert who work in the national security council for both presidents bush and president obama congressional intelligence committees traditionally try to rise above politics and and stick to fact finding but listen to the republican chair devin nunes and to the democratic ranking member adam schiff going after each other this week begin video clip nunes well they know they aposre not being honest actors and you know i get tired of playing whack amole every day with the democrats on this committee who never wanted to start this investigation inthe first place rep adam schiff d democratic ranking member house intel committee what aposs the most dangerous thing about this in the current context it aposs this the president is looking for a reason to fire bob mueller end video clip wallace gillian how unusual is it for congressional intelligence committees in your experience to get involved in this kind of partisan food fight if you will and and potentially how troubling is it this is an issue i was discussing with secretary panetta going forward for if the house intelligence and senate intelligence committees just become more political vehicles gillian turner fox news correspondent yes and secretary panetta talked about a breakdown of rule of law being a primary concern i agree with him on that on that front and to answer your question chris this kind of involvement on the part of the hipsi ph the house intelligence community is highly unusual i also want to make the point that in this political hullabaloo surrounding the memo in the showdown between democrats versus republicans i think washington has lost sight of the fact that this is actually a classic executive branch versus legislative branch dispute in the sense that it is pitting the department of justice which is an executive branch agency against a congressional committee that oversees it the key differentiator here of course is that president trump is weighing in against his own team he aposs thrown in the towel on the on behalf of the house intelligence committee i think in the long term here though this is damaging for everybody this is absolutely damaging for the fbi it aposs damaging it aposs damaging for the house intelligence committee because keep in mind going forward with any future investigations it aposs going to be very hard to listen to anything they have to say with any degree of confidence and it also hurts the american people of course sort of innocent bystanders to all of this wallace yes let me pick up on on one of the points that you made there it aposs not just the the house intelligence committee and and its role you have the president in this case as you pointed out at odds with his justice department and the fbi the director of the fbi his appointed by president trump christopher wray and rod rosenstein who was also appointed by the trump administration came over earlier this week and begged for the white house not to release the memo what what does that do when you aposve got a president who is at such odds with his own law enforcement turner i don apost know how that bond or the ties that at least bind the president to the fbi director can be healed i hesitate to stay that it aposs an irreparable break but i don apost see how wray moves forward knowing that he absolutely doesn apost have the faith and confidence of the commander in chief i don apost know how he gets anything done in washington but that being said i also think it aposs incumbent upon the president here to allow the investigation the russia investigation being led by an offshoot of the fbi to continue forward unimpeded as senator john mccain put out a statement saying just the other day wallace howie that brings me to you because i think it aposs fair to say the president in his comments has left the door wide open to doing something to stop the investigation he was asked about rod rosenstein the one person who can either fire or limit the mueller investigation the deputy attorney general and they you know they said do you still have confidence and he said you figure that out which i don apost think left much doubt about what he feels if and i just want to repeat if the president were to decide to do something either to get rid of rosenstein to get rid of mueller to limit the investigation would that just be another political controversy or are we now in saturday night massacre constitutional crisis mode howard kurtz host mediabuzz well look if the president were to fire bob mueller which i do not believe that he will do he talk about it last year he pulled back with his white house counsel threatened to resign that would put washington at def con 1 and it would be you know a huge crisis the media would go absolutely crazy now if he were to fire rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general who oversees mueller and the investigation that would be def con 2 but it would still i don apost know that it would be worth the political price because it would give the impression especially after firing jim comey that the president was acting at least like he had something to hide now to come back to the contents of the memo it seems to me that it did raise serious questions about the former british spy christopher steele who wrote that russian dossier he hated donald trump he lied to the fbi he tried to manipulate the media but when all that was going on with the fisa court application with carter page bob mueller was a private citizen he doesn apost have any involvement in any event and it seems to me that because you had a republican chairman releasing this over the fierce objection of the fbi and you had a level of pregame hype worthy of the super bowl and now you have democrats counterattacking i think the contents of the memo itself have just been completely lost and drowned out by the partisan sniping on both sides wallace hey jonathan i want to ask you one final question in all of this what do your sources at the white house indicated to you do you get do they get the sense that the president and i know it aposs hard to predict what president trump is going to do that the president will try to wait the mueller investigation out that perhaps he feels he aposs done enough damage to the credibility of it and he aposll take whatever hit he takes or do you think it aposs still an open question as to whether he might try either directly through mueller or indirectly through rosenstein to end the investigation prematurely swan the very fact that he keeps his attorneys john dowd and ty cobb employed as a signal that president trump is willing for the moment to go along with their strategy of cooperating entirely keeping mueller in place there was a big change i don apost think people realize how profound the change was when trump got rid of his old lawyer marc kasowitz who was a street brawler who defended him in all sorts of cases in new york and brought in ty cobb who really advocated a 180 degree switch in strategy which was let aposs cooperate entirely let aposs give them everything and let aposs try and bring this investigation to a close so while trump for months has been complaining about rosenstein complaining about mueller has said thing to his staff that have made them nervous i don apost get any sense that any change like that is immanent because i think he aposs entire legal team would resign if he move to fire either rosenstein or mueller wallace and from and do you get the sense that he will actually sit down and participate in an interview with mueller and his investigators swan well trump when he said that into the reporters in that impromptu briefing that freaked out his legal team because they they are not entirely cool with this idea of a freewheeling conversation between the president and bob mueller ty cobb has literally said on the record he aposs worried that it could be a perjury trap so i think again we aposve got tensions between his legal team and the president of the united states who is full of confidence and brio ph and wants to do it i suspect he will actually end up sitting down with mueller but i don apost know what terms will be negotiated what the sphere of questioning will be i suspect his legal team will be quite happy if they could avoid that scenario wallace panel we aposre going to have to take a break here but when we come back deadlock over the dreamers prompted the last government shutdown now congress is up against a thursday deadline yes this thursday to pass another funding bill will we see a compromise or another standoff or will congress just kick the can down the road for a few more weeks commercial break begin video clip trump so tonight i am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties democrats and republicans to protect our citizens of every background color religion and creed end video clip wallace president trump appealing for common ground in his state of the union address this week and we aposre back now with the panel the president laid out his agenda for 2018 and he touted the strong economy that we saw at the end of 2017 and are continuing to see and it seems to be having a political impact take a look at these numbers at the end of 2017 democrats led republicans in the generic congressional ballot question by almost 13 points now just a month later that aposs down to seven points and in at least one poll the democratic leaders only three howie is president trump and especially with this strong economy is it turning around republican prospects for the 2018 midterms kurtz i think things are starting to look a bit better for the republicans in 2018 chris i mean at the end of the year you had all of the drama and you had roy moore was in the headlines until now now roy moore is not in the senate the tax cuts that the president was able to pass pretty much on a party line vote are about to take effect and the economy is doing really well notwithstanding the hiccup in the stock market on friday a lot of people are feeling a little wealthier because they aposre seeing their 401 k s go up so you put all of those things together and then there aposs the bipartisan speech to congress which the pundits picked apart but the polls showed that the people really liked it seems to me that things are looking a little better for the gop now having said that all of the outrage fueled energy is on the democratic side and the house i think is still very much in play but nancy pelosi and company are going to have to come up with some kind of agenda for 2018 they can apost just run that donald trump aposs a bad guy and we want to get rid of him because that didn apost work very well in 2016 did it wallace yes let me let me ask you about that though if on the one hand you aposve got the anti trump fervor and a substantive disagreement on issues like health care like immigration which we aposll get to in a moment on the other hand if people feel better off in their pocketbooks how do you assess those two kurtz well usually the economy is the most important thing unless we aposre in the middle of an awful war that generally helps republicans in fact one of the mysteries here has been how donald trump aposs approval ratings have at least until recently remained so stubbornly and historically low despite the fact that the economy is booming and we aposre almost at full employment now i do think that politically though immigration remains such a hot button issue and we have to see how this is going to play out because substantively the two sides are not that far apart when chuck schumer walked out of the white house a few weeks ago he thought he had to deal and the president actually has come offered made a good faith offer to more than double the number of dreamers who would receive protection a possible path to citizenship and so the question is is trump really willing to take the heat as he said from his base in making a deal with the democrats and the democrats would they rather have the issue in 2018 or would they rather protect the dreamers and then move on to other issues wallace they may not be so far apart on the issues but they sure are far apart rhetorically and if you want a sense of just how far apart republicans and democrats are on trying to get a daca deal to protect the dreamers just listen to these comments this week from president trump and nancy pelosi begin video clip trump we presented congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise one where nobody gets everything they want but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have rep nancy pelosi d minority leader it was dangerous what he said last night and it has instilled fear as i say over and over what he is doing brings tears to the eyes of the statue of liberty end video clip wallace mo the white house seems to think that they have box democrats in by making this big concession that they would offer a path to citizenship in ten or 12 years for almost 2 million either dreamers or people eligible to be to come under that but in response they would have to accept a real crackdown on legal and illegal immigration are democrats in a box elleithee you know i don apost think so we aposre going to have to see how it plays out but you know i agree with howie that that there is actual room here for a bipartisan solution you have democrats and republicans who are coming to the table and and seem to be willing to find a deal that protects the dreamers while also increasing border security you aposre going to find very little disagreement on that we were close to a deal and now the president is throwing in this huge wrinkle of limiting legal immigration and that aposs something that i think a good number of republicans on the hill are even saying whoa whoa whoa that aposs a step too far so you know the question i actually would turn around and ask is is it the president who aposs really interested in making a deal i think the numbers that you just show their reflected a slight reenergizing of the republican base i think that aposs what is what is narrowing the gap in those in that in that horse race for the president to continue to do that he can apost be seen as abandoning the people who got him elected to office and those people do not want to see a deal that protects the dreamers kurtz but in the end chris i don apost think donald trump wants to wallace folks we aposve got we aposve got about we aposve got about three minutes left kurtz go ahead wallace so let me i want to get our other two panelists in there gillian it seems to me democrats are a little boxed in to the degree that their base wants them to use all the leverage they can to get a daca deal but on the other hand if they aposre trying to shut down the government the public really doesn apost want to shut down the government over that turner no and mo aposs right there is room an opportunity for a bipartisan solution here but in order to get there both sides of the aisle have to acknowledge and recognize that the problem here as i see it is this is very hard for congress to grasp but two things can be true at once the american people spoke forcefully in poll after poll in january they care about the plight of dreamers they want a solution that can keep them in the country at the same time the majority of americans don apost want the plight of the dreamers to shut down the federal government they don apost even want the issue of immigration rite large to jeopardize the function of the federal government so it aposs it aposs incumbent upon congress to figure out the legislative solution to that problem what we aposre seeing right now is still folks retreating to their opposite side of the room and hunkering down for a long fight again congress not serving the interest of the american people wallace let me bring in jonathan let me bring in jonathan on the prospects for a deal the president has made it clear that he wants to hold firm yes he aposll give a pass to citizenship for the dreamers but he wants an end to what he calls chain migration he wants an end to the visa lottery that aposs pretty unacceptable at this point to democrats do you get the sense the president is willing to hold firm have no deal and see dreamers conceivably start being deported swan i aposve never had that sense nor have people inside the white house the president has always been reluctant to let daca end and has always saw that opening gambit as a negotiating play to get leverage and to be fair he has gained leverage from this but i aposm very pessimistic actually about the prospects of a deal because i think whatever the senate will pass i don apost see how the senate which is a far left to the far left of the house whatever they pass i just don apost see how paul ryan politically can put that on the floor and pass it so i actually think it aposs going to be really messy and i aposm not particularly optimistic that a deal is going to get done wallace and in ten seconds jonathan is there a government shutdown this week or not swan no i think they get a short term funding bill with democratic votes not house freedom caucus votes wallace thank you panel we aposll see you next sunday maybe i aposll allow you to come back here and sit although i kind of like this long distance conversation and we aposll be right back with some final thoughts commercial brea
