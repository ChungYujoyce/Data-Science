dr ben carson has officially announced his candidacy for president my first thought was a doctor someone who cares for sick children as president that prompted me to ask myself and you too this question what characteristics would most americans like to see in our next u s president here is a checklist we want someone who solves problems based on the problem itself not based on a political bias right or left crony protectionism or some pre determined outcome in healthcare we want the medical care we need when we need it without going broke getting it in education we want future generations to be the most highly educated and thus most productive competitive in the world we want our president to approach national problems the same way a doctor approaches a sick person i will do whatever it takes period to a physician all patients are equally valuable the good doctor treats the sickest first not his best friend we want the same in a u s president that is particularly true for party affiliation we want a presidentof and forall americans not a democrat or republican president googletag cmd push function googletag display div gpt ad in content 300x250 102 credit bloomberg bloomberg via getty images the problems a president faces are system problems the last thing we want is a micromanager to truly fix a system problem requiressystems thinking not a piecemeal or ideological approach an effective president treats the underlying reason for why things that don t work the systems thinker good doctor understands you cannotcontrolpeople you can only influence further you need evidence before you decide well anything if this sounds like what a doctor does it is so who is better able to do what our country needs than a well trained experienced physician to demonstrate the utility of a medical approach to national problems we can look where this approach wasnotused healthcare a true american president knows that this is the land of the free and home of the brave not land of the entitled and home of the victims this country can be exceptional and is without taking away from the greatness of other nations americans do for themselves we do not expect the government to do for us we want the government to get out of our way so we can develop grow and achieve on our own we did build that we the non elite share a core principle about the relationship between individual and government the president elected officials and federal bureaucrats serve us not the other way around that is called a fiduciary relationship just like the doctor patient interaction the patient or voter voluntarily cedes his her autonomy to the doctor or president so that the doctor president can serve the best interest of the patient voter at the same time we want a president who understands that americans want a social medical safety net for those among us who are unable to do for themselves this is just like a doctor treating a heart attack patient without first demanding payment up front we want a president who is politically incorrect what doesthatmean it means a president like john locke the original liberal ben franklin or thomas jefferson this nation was founded on a bedrock of civil discourse and disagreement read the founding fathers to see how much they verbally fought with each other there was no such thing as political correctness they had strong differences of opinion discussed and ultimately resolved out in the open dissent was and is the american way true patriots say what they think not what others want to hear and certainly not whatever falsehood will get them re elected a president who reflects our core principles would openly and proudly say what i just wrote dr ben carson has both written and spoken all of the above listen to him at the famousnational prayer breakfastin may 2014 with the president and first lady sitting to the right of the podium with plastic smiles offering desultory applause in a criminal trial your fate is decided by a jury of your peers is the jury in washington that decides the fate of our nation made up of your peers and mine quite the opposite the halls of congress and the corridors of the white house are populated with the elite a tenth of the 1 percent all ivy league graduates with advanced degrees in everything except life they are professional politicians their primary function is to get re elected for a second term president his primary function is to solidify his legacy so he can like bill clinton make 89 million just from speaking gigs after he leaves office you and i would like one of us in the oval office not a professional politician we want an outsider an individual of the people how about a president who is a black man raised in poverty in detroit by a single illiterate mother a boy who went to public schools there and who eventually became a world famous brain surgeon if this sounds like a great american success story it is if that sounds like the kind of person we want in the white house dr ben is i urge my fellow americans to apply the same standards as shown above toany candidate for the highest office use it like a checklist to see howthey all
