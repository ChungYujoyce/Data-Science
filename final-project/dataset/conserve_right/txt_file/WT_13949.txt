stand for stay at home orders anymore the carrier program is a key part of china s naval expansion at a time when it is looking to beef up its regional military influence to match its economic might while china says it maintains a defensive military policy its ambitions are rattling some neighbors who see beijing as fueling already enflamed tensions in the region chinese naval strategists see the carrier program not only as a means to protect their country s maritime interests but also to have naval power commensurate with china s international status to impress both external and domestic audiences said michael chase an expert on the chinese military at u s think tank the rand corporation the new carrier is likely to be seen as further evidence of china s desire to become the most powerful and influential country in the region he said that will be especially worrying to indian security analysts who are already concerned about beijing s ambitions in the indian ocean he said india along with japan and taiwan which also view chinese carriers as threats will likely respond by building new submarines and anti ship missiles said ian easton a research fellow at the project 2049 institute in arlington virginia china s expansionist behavior in the south china sea and its aggressive efforts to undermine the security of taiwan and japan in particular have translated into a situation where few countries now trust that beijing has benign motives easton said chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang reiterated china s contention that it maintains a purely defense military posture and sticks to the path of peaceful development the purpose to develop national defense forces including the navy is to safeguard our national sovereignty security and development interests as well as the peace of the world geng told reporters wednesday at a daily news conference china has offered little information about the roles it expects its carriers to play although its planning appears to be evolving as it gains more experience the liaoning was initially touted mainly as an experimental and training platform but in december was declared to be combat ready and has taken part in live firing exercises in the south china sea where tensions have risen over china s construction of man made islands complete with airstrips and military structures earlier this year the liaoning sailed through the taiwan strait which was seen as a message to taiwan which china claims as its own territory to be brought under control by force if necessary wednesday s launch was presided over by the vice chairman of china s central military commission and communist party central committee fan changlong and came just three days after the anniversary of the people s liberation army navy s symbolic founding in 1949 also attending was navy commander vice adm shen jinlong a former commander of the south sea fleet responsible for defending china s claim to virtually the entire south china sea reports of the launch said a bottle of champagne was broken across the ship s bow and other craft in the port sounded their horns in celebration like the 60 000 ton liaoning which was purchased from the ukraine the new carrier is based on the soviet kuznetsov class design with a ski jump style deck for taking off and a conventional oil fueled steam turbine power plant that limits the weight of the payloads its planes can carry its speed and the amount of time it can spend at sea relative to american nuclear powered carriers the main hull of the new carrier has been completed and its power supply put into place next up are mooring tests and the debugging of its electronic systems the defense ministry said china is believed to be planning to build at least two and possibly as many as four additional carriers with one of them the type 002 reported to be already under construction at a shipyard outside shanghai they are expected to be closer in size to the u s navy s nuclear powered 100 000 ton nimitz class ships with flat flight decks and catapults to allow planes to launch with more bombs and fuel aboard according to chinese reports the new as yet unnamed carrier will carry 24 shenyang j 15 fighters based on the russian sukhoi su 33 along with 12 helicopters for anti submarine warfare airborne early warning and rescue operations that compares to 85 90
