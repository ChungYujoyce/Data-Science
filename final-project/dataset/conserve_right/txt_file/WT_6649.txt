this case you re referring to chinese malfeasance but one side or the other doesn t abide by their agreements mr pompeo said there needs to be a built in mechanism inside the agreement that says we re going to verify we re going to have an evaluative process and then in the event there are breaches of the agreement that one side or the other is not living up to their commitments that there is an enforcement mechanism the enforcement mechanism could include a withdrawal from the agreement or other tools that could be used that would bring to bear to convince both parties that it is appropriate
