to enjoy all the benefits of our website to overcome voter disillusionment left parties must unite jews and arabs with a progressive vision for the country s future get the new statesman s morning call email israelis head to the polls today for an unprecedented third time in 11 months elections in april and september yielded impasses with no party managing to achieve a governing majority of 61 knesset seats for months prime minister binyamin netanyahu s right wing likud has battled its main rival the centrist blue and white a new party headed by benny gantz a former chief of staff of the israeli defence forces for those israelis who want to defeat the country s longest serving pm whose corruption trial is due to start a mere two weeks after the vote gantz seems the most obvious option meanwhile labour and meretz the traditional parties of the israeli left have remained weak in advance of the election they united on one slate to surpass the electoral threshold of 3 25 per cent i think that meretz and the labour party have finished their historic role zehava gal on an israeli peace camp veteran who led meretz the smaller left wing party from 2012 to 2018 told me i say this with sadness with pain i only voted for meretz from the day i could vote i didn t vote for anything else in my whole life but i understand the political system i can see what s happening israel s labour party is associated with the founding of the state and for decades was the party of government as recently as 2015 labour then rebranded as the zionist camp in partnership with former foreign secretary tzipi livni won 24 seats in the knesset in the april 2019 election the first of the three it plummeted to six meretz founded in 1992 fell from five seats in 2015 to four in april both won less than five per cent of the vote the electoral threshold in israel s proportional representation system is 3 25 per cent this decline is an old story however and some would argue that it reached its trough long ago the trend dates back to the aftermath of the oslo peace accords of the 1990s and the violence of the second intifada in the 2000s voters on the left moved to the centre explains pollster dahlia scheindlin because they got mugged in the second intifada an allusion to the quip that a conservative is a liberal mugged by reality these voters supported a two state solution and former prime minister yitzhak rabin s push for peace but then they bought the narrative on the second intifada the palestinians just aren t ready what can you do we have to wait so they are basically the same people they got bitter they got despairing according to scheindlin s surveys the decline stopped in the mid 2000s with around 20 per cent of the israeli electorate 15 per cent of whom are jewish self identifying with the left ever since around 23 25 per cent identify as centrists the left and centre trade votes because they are basically similar kinds of people scheindlin says about half of people who self identify as centre came from the left they have the same worldview people who think of themselves as left wing have voted for parties of the centre such as kadima established by former likud prime minister ariel sharon and yesh atid set up by former journalist yair lapid yesh atid won an impressive 19 seats when it first stood in 2013 and lasted for two election cycles lapid is now part of gantz s blue and white party if the 20 per cent of voters who self identify as left voted for left wing parties that would translate to 25 knesset seats that isn t happening explains scheindlin partly because there is lower turnout among arab voters but also because many left wing israeli voters are prioritising the defeat of netanyahu for those who want a genuine ideological alternative the joint list a slate of four parties one of which is mixed arab and jewish is an option even if not all of the parties on that list would describe themselves as left they are at the very least all committed to equality between jews and arabs during netanyahu s incumbency the motivations ofleft wing voters havebecome less ideological over the past year all three of these elections were about one thing yes bibi no bibi says gal on and then many leftists who define themselves as people of the left wanted to vote for the party that is closest to fulfilling the idea that netanyahuwouldn t be in power any more and that is the blue and white party one of netanyahu s persistent tactics has been demonisation of the left the term has become a way of insulting opponents when former defence minister avigdor lieberman refused to join netanyahu s coalition last april forcing the country to stage a second election in september netanyahu denounced him as a leftist the ultimate put down this constant attack has also weakened the left it s really hard to be on the left says gal on all the time they say to you that you are a traitor that you are a leftist and then becauseit s hard it smore comfortable to bend to the consensus and the consensus is in the centre those who are still voting for parties such as meretz end up with this sort of soul searching what do we do what is the left s historic role how can it forge a new path how can it continue to represent its values there is a broader question of whether israel s left has ever been truly liberal and progressive israeli historian yair wallach who teaches at london s school of oriental and african studies says that the minimum requirement for parties of the left is equality between citizens but that in israel that was never the logic of the state gal on doesn t regard labour or mapai its predecessor which merged into today s labour party as having led left wing governments either it was a generation that built that state and thought it was allowed to do anything issues of human rights citizen rights weren t at the top of its priority list in these earlier years the labour movement s key role in the establishment of settlements in the west bank from 1967 is another case in point i can t say they were left wing in any way maybe their approach to social issues was more socialist but i wouldn t define the left as having been in government gal on is depressed by the state of the left but she has a solution forging a new arab and jewish movement there is a goal today that is a lot bigger than to be nice on the left we need to join with everyone who is a partner to our views there is a war here with the right and the centre is centre right if we think we have to end the occupation and not annex settlements and we have to protect human rights and minority rights and fight against all the messianics who god promised the right over this land then this is what needs to be done whatever the election result and whether labour and meretz gain or lose seats the israeli left needs to transform itself into a true alternative in order to move past years of voters motivated by anti netanyahu pragmatism it needs to develop something new and meaningful and that can only come from a movement that unites jews and arabs with a progressive vision for israel s future otherwise the left risks being represented by parties of nostalgia voted for by people who don t want to see them become obsolete but who are not committed to what they represent andwith no one ruling out a fourth election just yet time could be short i think that meretz and the labour party have finished their historic role zehava gal on an israeli peace camp veteran who led meretz the smaller left wing

come from a movement that unites jews and arabs with a progressive vision for israel s future otherwise the left risks being represented by parties of nostalgia voted for by people who don t want to see them become obsolete but who are not committed to what they represent andwith no one ruling out a fourth election just yet time could be short during netanyahu s incumbency the motivations ofleft wing voters havebecome less ideological over the past year all three of these elections were about one thing yes bibi no bibi says gal on and then many leftists who define themselves as people of the left wanted to vote for the party that is closest to fulfilling the idea that netanyahuwouldn t be in power any more and that is the blue and white party one of netanyahu s persistent tactics has been demonisation of the left the term has become a way of insulting opponents when former defence minister avigdor lieberman refused to join netanyahu s coalition last april forcing the country to stage a second election in september netanyahu denounced him as a leftist the ultimate put down this constant attack has also weakened the left it s really hard to be on the left says gal on all the time they say to you that you are a traitor that you are a leftist and then becauseit s hard it smore comfortable to bend to the consensus and the consensus is in the centre those who are still voting for parties such as meretz end up with this sort of soul searching what do we do what is the left s historic role how can it forge a new path how can it continue to represent its values there is a broader question of whether israel s left has ever been truly liberal and progressive israeli historian yair wallach who teaches at london s school of oriental and african studies says that the minimum requirement for parties of the left is equality between citizens but that in israel that was never the logic of the state gal on doesn t regard labour or mapai its predecessor which merged into today s labour party as having led left wing governments either it was a generation that built that state and thought it was allowed to do anything issues of human rights citizen rights weren t at the top of its priority list in these earlier years the labour movement s key role in the establishment of settlements in the west bank from 1967 is another case in point i can t say they were left wing in any way maybe their approach to social issues was more socialist but i wouldn t define the left as having been in government gal on is depressed by the state of the left but she has a solution forging a new arab and jewish movement there is a goal today that is a lot bigger than to be nice on the left we need to join with everyone who is a partner to our views there is a war here with the right and the centre is centre right if we think we have to end the occupation and not annex settlements and we have to protect human rights and minority rights and fight against all the messianics who god
