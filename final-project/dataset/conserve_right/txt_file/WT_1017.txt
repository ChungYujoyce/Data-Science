for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the middle east held its breath monday as iran s three day mourning period for slain gen qassem soleimani ended with a mass outpouring of grief and heated vows of revenge against president trump from top iranian officials while u s allies pleaded for calm in an attempt to de escalate the spiraling crisis between washington and tehran the trump administration held to its threat to respond with overwhelming force if iran or its proxies target americans in the region although there was confusion at the pentagon over whether some u s troops may withdraw from iraq as part of the fallout from last week s drone strike near baghdad international airport that killed soleimani and a top iraqi militia leader in baghdad red faced pentagon leaders scrambled to disavow an unsigned leaked letter monday from the commanding marine corps general to iraqi officials seemingly agreeing to their demands to pull the 5 200 u s troops out of iraq and declaring we respect your sovereign decision to order our departure see also red faced pentagon says iraq leaked withdrawal letter an honest mistake there s been no decision whatsoever to leave iraq defense secretary mark t esper told reporters he said the administration was still weighing a response to the iraqi parliament s approval over the weekend of a bill calling for the expulsion of u s troops amid heightened tension with tehran backed militants in iraq which has a long border with iran our message to iran is that the ball is in their court mr esper said we are open to sitting down with them and discussing issues so we can have a more normal relationship with that country president trump who sparked more furor when he suggested that iran s cultural sites could be targeted in an outright war with iran displayed no second thoughts about authorizing the u s strike in a radio interview with talk show host rush limbaugh soleimani was their real military leader mr trump said he s a terrorist severe revenge ayatollah ali khamenei iran s supreme leader has vowed to inflict severe revenge for soleimani s death and hassan nasrallah head of the most powerful of tehran s regional allies lebanon based hezbollah suggested that u s military personnel and assets across the middle east are fair targets the soaring brinkmanship with iran coupled with mr trump s assertion over the weekend that u s officials have already identified a vast slate of targets to hit inside iran stirred debate among lawmakers in washington over the status of american forces in the middle east trump critics say his order to kill the powerful general risks an all out war with iran despite a tehran backed attack on the u s embassy in baghdad last week and a host of other iranian military and proxy provocations in recent months house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat said the house will vote this week on a war powers resolution to limit mr trump s authority to take further military action against iran in a letter to house democrats mrs pelosi called the drone strike that killed soleimani commander of the iranian military s elite quds force which oversees tehran backed militant proxy activity in several middle east nations provocative and disproportionate other democratic lawmakers argued that mr trump may have exceeded his presidential authority by ordering the strike without first notifying key members of congress mr trump sent a classified official notification to capitol hill on saturday nearly two days after the strike the notification providing his justification technically checks a key legal box pertaining to such strikes but it left democrats with even more questions about the president s motives lawmakers are expected to pressure administration officials for answers including the intelligence justifying the attack at a classified briefing wednesday nervous allies u s allies in the middle east and beyond appealed for calm monday between washington and tehran and world markets appeared to take the escalating tensions in stride the international benchmark brent crude oil rose

facing a very dangerous moment we hope that all actors take all the steps necessary to prevent any further escalation and provocation the prince said massive funeral the theocratic shiite muslim regime in tehran as well a massive crowd of ordinary iranians mourned the death of perhaps the country s second most powerful figure after ayatollah khamenei iran recently faced nationwide protests over government set gasoline prices that u s officials said resulted in a crackdown by iranian authorities that killed more than 1 000 demonstrators but soleimani s death brought together people from across the country s political spectrum and temporarily silenced that anger demonstrators in tehran on monday burned israeli and u s flags and displayed mocking effigies of mr trump mohammad milad rashidi a 26 year old university graduate in the funeral crowd predicted more tension ahead trump demolished the chance for any sort of possible agreement between tehran and washington mr rashidi told

the deaths of hundreds of american troops in resistance after the 2003 u s invasion of iraq and the trump administration accused him of plotting further attacks soleimani s death has pushed tehran to abandon the remaining limits of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers as his successor and others vow to take revenge troops in doubt the fallout has raised questions about the future of some 5 200
