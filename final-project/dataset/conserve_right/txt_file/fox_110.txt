not trump wallace we aposll ask larry kudlow the president aposs new top economic advisor live only on fox news sunday then democrats look to take back the house in november we aposll look at prospects for a blue wave and the economic plan they are offering voters for democratic caucus chair joe crowley plus reporter scott pruitt sir do you support scott pruitt donald trump president of the united states i hope he aposs going to be great wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel whether the president will fire his epa chief over ethics violations and our power player of the week a member of the obama cabinet goes back to school sylvia burwell former hhs secretary there were two themes in the mathews council ph one was education and the other was public service wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington we begin with breaking news the state department is monitoring reports of a poison gas attack in a rebel held town near syria aposs capital of damascus video from syrian activists claims to show victims including children getting hosed down a human aposs rights group says dozens have been killed in the attack and we aposll stay on top of this story now to the face off for trade between the u s and china which has sent tension soaring and market stumbling in the latest move president trump threatened to impose tariffs on another 100 billion in chinese exports something that nation has vowed to fight a trade war without serious consequences for consumers and businesses and investors joining me now president trump aposs new top white house economic adviser larry kudlow larry welcome to fox news sunday larry kudlow white house chief economic adviser thank you chris thanks a lot wallace you keep saying that there is no trade war that this is part of negotiations between the u s and china but the chinese history says there are any talks and says quote china is fully prepared to hit back forcefully and without hesitation and here was treasury secretary mnuchin on friday begin video clip steven mnuchin treasury secretary we will continue to have discussions but there is the potential of a trade war end video clip wallace now you aposre a market guy the markets dropped 572 points on friday clearly there are a lot of serious investors who think there aposs a real chance of a trade war kudlow i suppose so i mean i know there are some jitters out there i don apost think there aposs any trade or insight just technically we have taken no actions you understand that and even the thursday announcement for president trump he asked ambassador lighthizer to consider additional actions it aposs a long process several months here we put our papers we take public comments we then review the public comments and then decisions will be made so far no tariffs and no action has been enacted point number two i believe china aposs response to the u s actions which is a complaint against stealing intellectual property against forced technology transfers i think that aposs a legitimate complaint so does the rest of the world but china aposs response was highly unsatisfactory and i think that aposs unfortunate we do have constant communication with them to be sure i hope their side picks up on this but so far stonewalling us is not the answer listen wallace and that aposs what they aposre doing is stonewalling kudlow basically i mean lots of rhetoric out there like you know old communist party type stuff the whole world please the whole world knows china has been violating trade laws for many years and president trump is the guy calling them on it and he aposs right to do so wallace is the president you say he aposs calling them on it is he bluffing or will he impose tariffs if china doesn apost change its trade practice kudlow look i he aposs not bluffing i mean there are a number of tools at his disposal just one thing there people are saying trump trump trump this is a problem caused by china not a problem caused by president trump and i would go so far as to say trump is there to fix the problem if you talk to the president as i have he regards himself as a free trader all right as do i but his argument and it aposs a good one you can apost have free trade which is pro growth around the world unless china brings down its barriers opens up its markets wallace but larry kudlow and stop this technology steal that they aposre doing wallace nobody is saying that china isn apost to blame here the question is the president aposs response as you point out you are a tree trader here is what you said just last month when president trump announced his first round of tariffs and this wasn apost an announcement this was real imposition of tariffs on aluminum and steel here you are begin video clip kudlow tariff hikes are prosperity killers they always have been and they always will be tariffs are taxes and the ones who suffer most are the users end video clip wallace so who should we believe that larry kudlow or this one kudlow i thought you might run that i aposm opposed to blanket tariffs and that aposs where it first started wallace but that aposs what the president is talking about kudlow no he has changed his view even on the national security action we aposve got a lot of exceptions and a lot of carve outs wallace but you aposre not talking about carve outs or exceptions for china kudlow well hang on so i oppose the blanket tariffs i always do now with respect to china i aposve always been a hard liner on china and while i don apost like tariffs sometimes there is no substitution for putting tariffs into the discussion into the process that is part of the quiver of arrows that the president has look he aposs a great negotiator he has a whole history of that but in this process tariffs have to be part of it there aposs no two ways about it then hopefully there will be discussions and hopefully in just the next two months the chinese will come seriously back to the table president trump has told me we were together a long time on thursday and friday he likes president xi they get along he respects president xi as a negotiator but they have not played by the rules chris this has been going on technology is everything to this country everything our entrepreneurship our innovation our future growth our productivity we cut corporate tax rates precisely to unlock the animal spirits around technology we cannot let china willy nilly steal our technology wallace ok you said on friday that you were going to announce a trade coalition of the willing today other countries that were going to join us in taking on china who are they kudlow well i don apost ph i didn apost make this announcement i aposm just observing wallace no no you set on friday between 24 and 48 hours i aposm going to announce the trade coalition of the willing do you have them kudlow they are coming to us wallace who are they kudlow japan europe australia canada they have come to us the president actually wallace they are not talking about tariffs kudlow sure they are wallace no they aposre not kudlow sure they are wallace japan said that they were going to join us in taking this issue to the world trade organization and to object to chinese trade practices just as free traders have done for years kudlow but if china maintains its third world status as they have in the wto then other countries are free to take whatever actions they want wallace but if i just depress this has any other country joined us in threatening tariffs if china doesn apost clean up its act kudlow i can apost answer that i don apost even want to answer that all i aposm saying is my trade coalition of the willing will put the whole world behind the united states apos actions against china and this is going to have a big effect on china china does not want to lose face but china does not want to be regarded as the enemy in trade for the entire world the wto by the way is one of the processes ambassador lighthizer has that in his releases so we aposll work there we aposll work directly with the chinese but i want to make this clear president trump is a great negotiator the tariffs which none of us particularly want may i say may have to be part of this discussion and argument wallace ok i want to pick up on that because ever since i first met we go back a ways and ever since i first met you in the reagan white house you have been an apostle of growth kudlow yes wallace you say that growth cures income inequality growth cures budget deficits but if china and if let me just finish if china and the u s slapped tariffs on each other even president trump said that could hurt the economy here he is begin audio clip donald trump president of the united states so we may take a hit and you know what ultimately we aposre going to be much stronger for it but it aposs something we had to do end audio clip wallace and here aposs a line from an article trump should also examine the historical record on tariffs because they have almost never worked as intended and almost always delivered an unhappy ending larry i assume you agree with that because you wrote it kudlow i do i wrote it i agree with it it aposs still my position the president knows that we had lots of conversations but around this action i aposm going to stay with us the path to free trade has to include china acting in concert with first world nations with inaudible nations crosstalk wallace even if we end up in trade were kudlow we aposre not going to end up in a trade war wallace well they aren apost backing off kudlow look we haven apost even enacted anything yet wallace i understand kudlow so let aposs go easy on the trade war we got several months here wallace but you say the president isn apost bluffing you say tariffs have to be part of the discussion kudlow i do wallace so if they don apost back off kudlow we will see we will see remember this the u s economy is doing very well now by the way at the time you learned your lesson as well when we first spoke back in 1980 wallace i listened kudlow you aposve been very good on that i aposm proud of you now having said all that we are growing at over 3 percent annual rate for the last three quarters this is investment spending equipment spending is booming jobs are rising consumer confidence is high small business confidence is high all i aposm saying is forget trade wars why don apost you just look at the progress of the american economy wallace i kudlow we can take wallace that aposs the concern though that people have is this is going to put a brake on that kudlow it cant it can apost possibly it can apost possibly the sums here are too small but the principals are very strong do you see what i aposm saying wallace i understand that but as you well know trade war sometime escalate kudlow well i haven apost seen a trade war since smoot hawley of 1930s and even i was wallace all right i have to ask you to other questions and we aposve got three other minutes to get them in one of the drags on the market right now is the concern that washington is going to regulate big tech mark zuckerberg the head of facebook is going to testify before congress this week does the president want to see washington regulate how facebook uses its users apos data what it does with its users apos data and also how it screens ads kudlow look i think the president right now will be intently watching the congressional hearings i think that aposs going to be step number one i think he has his doubts whether facebook has violated protocols i don apost know we will see i wish mr zuckerberg i hope he comes to congress wearing a nice business suit and shirt and tie so he will be taking more seriously wallace not a t shirt kudlow right i aposm tired of that t shirt hoody stuff he does run one of the largest corporations of the world for heaven aposs sakes crosstalk wallace but we inaudible agree to regulate kudlow we are waiting on congress let aposs see what comes out of that before the administration takes any particular action wallace all right amazon the president keeps hitting the company for failing to pay taxes for its deal with the post office here he was on air force one begin audio clip trump well amazon is just not on an even playing field you know they have a tremendous lobbying effort in addition to having the washington post which is as far as i aposm concerned another lobbyist end audio clip wallace in fact the post office makes money off amazon it doesn apost lose money and amazon collects taxes in all 45 states so is this just talk or is the president seriously considering taking action against amazon kudlow the president is asking that amazon and all the internet retailers have a level playing field with respect to tax and while it aposs true wallace but amazon is one of the companies that does have a level playing field kudlow in recent years they aposve done much better in collecting state taxes sales taxes however they don apost always connect local sales taxes and we aposve had too much protection in this area they are not a fledgling industry anymore so what the president is saying is raising this issue for discussion i don apost think it aposs aimed at anybody we just need a level playing field and you aposre going to have a court decision very soon chris that aposs going to make this more explicit wallace ok i aposve got a minute left there is talk this morning that the president may ask congress to undo part of the 1 3 trillion spending bill to cut back some of the expenditures that were made is that true and how far along are you on that kudlow it aposs playing in the white house my friend omb director mick mulvaney he and i are on i aposm an ex omb guy i feel his pain we are looking at an enhanced rescission package i aposm not going to use numbers this is all around town i think the republican party on the hill has finally figured out it aposs really not a bad idea to trim some spending because after all spending can lead to deficits and spending interferes with the economy and president trump is a deregulator and a tax cutter so we want and much more modest government role wallace larry thank you kudlow thank you wallace thanks for your time always good to talk with you and i keep listening and learning kudlow you aposve been great you aposve been absolutely one of the best people down through the years laughter wallace that aposs where i blew all of my credibility thank you larry always a pleasure kudlow that was a joke and a compliment wallace thank you up next reaction from one of the top democrats in the house congressman joe crowley on his party aposs message for the 2018 midterms and talk he might replace nancy pelosi as the next speaker of the house commercial break wallace a look at the cherry blossoms along the tidal basin here in d c which have peak bloom this week and were just beautiful washington always has its eye on the next election and as we get closer to the 2018 midterms many are predicting a blue wave with democrats taking back the house and possibly the senate joining us now new york congressman joe crowley chair of the house democratic caucus and the subject of growing chatter among democrats as a possible replacement for nancy pelosi after the election he aposs not going to like me saying that congressman welcome back to fox news sunday rep joe crowley d ny house democratic caucus chairman thanks chris good to be with you wallace you just heard larry kudlow what do you think of his arguments for potentially potentially using tariffs against china and if not that how do you propose we stop their unfair trading practice crowley well chris i aposm also a member of the ways and means committee and so i do recognize there aposs a role for tariffs in the economy but i think what really it has created is a great deal more chaos people really don apost know what the president aposs plans are or what mr kudlow aposs plan is as it relates to china and the trade war that has now begun or at least the initial start of that has begun i think that aposs left a lot of americans with uncertainty about what this crosstalk wallace what should they do if you are not going to use tariffs how do you stop behind the unfair trade practices the theft of intellectual property crowley well first of all let me just say for the record that when it came to the issue of china i did not vote for normal trade with china i believe they were not economically nor politically mature enough to be dealing with us on the same par and having said i think that aposs panned out to be true but i do think we have to do this in a much more calculated way and i with more of a plan let aposs have an understanding of what the ultimate goal is here is the goal to raise the price of products here in the united states or to lower the price of agricultural products in the united states that is the overall goal because that aposs what some of the effect may very well be if china retaliates in this war where is ultimately going that aposs what we don apost understand about this wallace donald trump won the presidency because he convinced a lot of voters including a lot of democratic voters in the industrial heartland that he had a better idea for how to build the economy how to get them jobs than hillary clinton did now democrats are going into the 2018 midterms with what they call a better deal here is nancy pelosi on that begn video clip rep nancy pelosi d cali house minority leader democrats are offering a better deal better jobs better wages a better future a better deal is founded on strong values that we share strong values fueled by fresh ideas end video clip wallace forgive me congressman but that sounds like standard democratic boilerplate so give me one fresh idea that democrats are offering voters for november crowley fresh idea first of all chris donald trump did not win by a lot of democratic votes in the midwest it was fractions of a vote that actually are responsible for him being president of the united states today but what i think one great fresh idea is a real infrastructure package for the american people what the president has offered a 20 80 plan 20 percent from the federal 80 percent from local governments is not going to wash it aposs not going to work what democrats are proposing is really an 80 20 or 75 25 plan where the federal government comes up with the resources for 80 percent and works with local governments to put america back to work and invest in american infrastructure and invest in america that aposs jobs that aposs a bridge to the new economy that aposs giving people the opportunity to put their kids through college to afford health care with a real job that aposs the kind of message the democrats are talking about wallace but let aposs look at the trump record on the economy which obviously you agree is going to be the key issue in november employers are adding an average of 202 000 jobs a month this year the unemployment rate has been 4 1 percent for six straight months that aposs the lowest level in 17 years and wages are up 2 7 percent the highest rate of almost nine years congressman a solid majority of americans according to the polls feel good about the trump economy crowley show me how any of those statistics the difference of any month that president obama was president of united states crosstalk wallace well i just said that the 4 1 percent is the lowest level in 17 years crowley it aposs moving on a downward trend wallace but it wasn apost 4 1 percent wage growth wasn apost up crowley where was it when president bush left office wallace president bush or president obama crowley president bush when he left office and president obama came from wallace well i understand the world is in recession crowley right and so we democrats really moved us towards this job growth through the sustained economy wallace are you saying the president deserves no crowley i didn apost say that wallace i aposm asking crowley what i aposm suggesting is that i believe what this is based on is a false premise the notion of the tax cut is going to lead to somehow help the american people along ph i think is a scam i think what they aposve done is the desperate need to pass anything by the end of the year they rammed through a bill without fully really understanding what was in the bill it was done in a very very highly partisan way and i think in the end it aposs the average worker the middle class in this going to suffer because the result of the tax cut bill wallace let aposs turn to another subject immigration the president has ordered the deployment of up to 4 000 members of the national guard to the southern border and the fact is more people are attempting to cross the border illegally just take a look at these statistics in march of 2017 16 000 people were caught at the border that number tripled last month march of 2018 to more than 50 000 don apost we need to stop the surge crowley i think what we need is comprehensive immigration reform we aposve been talking about this for decades and we just haven apost seen it happen not since 1986 what i think is interesting to go back to 1986 where you saw a comprehensive immigration reform and comprehensive tax reform done in a bipartisan way it was long lasting because it was done both democrats and republicans came together here we have a very partisan approach to this the president talks about building a wall but mexico is going to pay for it now he aposs putting troops down at the border a very provocative move but at the same time it aposs not really solving the problem wallace wait a minute you say it aposs a very provocative move barack obama put 1 800 at the border crowley it was to some degree provocative not in the same breath that this president has done what the verbiage the language that our president has used towards immigrants in this nation is really it aposs abhorrent to me quite frankly it aposs not representative of who we are as a nation so this president making this move is different from any other president doing it quite frankly wallace let aposs turn to the midterms president trump says that your party is vulnerable in november here he is begin video clip trump democrats haven apost learned they still think the loyal citizens who care about jobs and borders and security are deplorable end video clip wallace how confident are you the democrats will win in november and take back control of the house crowley we aposre a long way from november let aposs be clear about that but i aposm confident that the american people want to bring balance back to the united states government what they see right now is republicans in charge of the presidency the senate the house and some would argue the supreme court every branch of government seems to be controlled in some way or facet ph by republicans wallace forgive me that was what voters decided crowley well look they have an opportunity here to change course and correction that aposs the beauty of our democracy the house of representatives every member of the house of representatives is up for election this year and a third of the senate so people have the opportunity to bring that balance back we know that the first midterm election of an incumbent president on average sees 40 seats swing in the opposite direction it aposs not going to happen on its own democrats are not going to win that back just simply be up against president trump we need to be for as i mentioned before our economic policies our better deal and is a deal are become very clear to the american people wallace all right in more than a third of house races republicans running for those seats have run ads that go after nancy pelosi here aposs an example from the recent special election in pennsylvania apos18 begin video clip ad announcer conor lamb is a pelosi liberal his values aren apost our values end video clip wallace now that democrat conor lamb won but one of the ways in which he won was that he promised not to support nancy pelosi if democrats take the house and she aposs up for speaker again is nancy pelosi a liability for democrats in this campaign crowley i think it was more reflective of the fact that republicans are bankrupt on the ideas they don apost have anything else to offer except to go after nancy pelosi to win elections that aposs if they think that aposs a winning strategy they aposre completely mistaken and wrong it aposs not a winning strategy crosstalk wallace i mean forgive me but conor lamb apparently thought it was an issue because he dumped nancy pelosi crowley conor lamb won because he ran a local election he talked about that the cuts that the republicans were attempting to make and to privatize social security he talked about what affect local what affect the federal government has on local politics on people aposs lives and that aposs why he won that election not because of nancy pelosi wallace if democrats win the house in november will you run either to replace nancy pelosi if she steps down or against her if she doesn apost crowley well on the first portion of that i would wait and see just what happened in terms of nancy pelosi deciding not to run but if nancy pelosi stays i don apost i don apost see a scenario by which i would challenge her for that position wallace do you want to be speaker crowley look i aposm focused right now on winning back the house of representatives to be in the majority to be the chair of the democratic caucus in the majority i aposm doing that job right now i want to be the best chair of the democratic caucus i possibly can be help my colleagues get reelected and help when back seats for the house democratic caucus that aposs my focus and goal that aposs the focus and goal of the entire democratic leadership we are one mind chris and that is we want to win back the house that aposs goal one and the only goal right now wallace one last question in this on top democrat was quoted as saying that at age 56 which you are now that you are a spring chicken by congressional standards crowley well i aposve had others say that i aposm not such a spring chicken after all look at the end of the day we have a very vibrant democratic caucus we have some incredibly talented young people i think people running today like mikie sherrill she was a navy grad she is running for office in new jersey i think of joe neguse who aposs running in colorado i think of brendan kelly some great people are running all around this country and we are becoming more vibrant as a democratic caucus so i think we have nothing to look forward to but good days ahead of us wallace congressman crowley thank you thanks for coming in today please come back sir crowley i aposm happy to come back thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the escalating tariff threats between the u s and china plus we aposll discuss the president aposs pruitt problem and growing ethical concerns about the epa chief commercial break wallace coming up president trump sends the national guard to the border begin video clip trump we have very bad laws for our border we aposre going to be doing things militarily until we can have a wall and proper security end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what the deployment means next on fox news sunday commercial break donald trump president of the united states but i think we aposre going to have a fantastic relationship long term with china but we have to get this straightened out we have to have some balance end video clip wallace president trump taking a hard line on china saying it aposs time to stop beijing from taking advantage of the u s on trade and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove columnist for the hill juan williams former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and the head of heritage action for america michael needham well karl there aposs no question that we have a problem with chinese trade practices but is it the best solution to threaten them with tariffs karl rove fox news contributor i don apost think so we have two problems with them the biggest problem is they aposre stealing our intellectual property and in all this kerfuffle over tariffs we aposve missed the fact that on march 23rd the administration filed what it should have done which is an action with the wto challenging from top to bottom the chinese on their intellectual property rights that aposs where we can win and win big for the american companies the american consumer and for the concept of free trade but tariffs really problematic the president said we aposre going to levy 60 billion in tariffs on the chinese peter navarro his trade expert came out and said and the chinese are not going to retaliate the chinese said we aposre going to respond with 50 billion of tariffs the president says this is unfair i aposm going to come with 100 billion worth of tariffs 160 billion worth of tariffs would be paid by american taxpayers this year the value of the tax cut as estimated by the joint committee on taxation is 135 billion to american taxpayers next year 280 billion economic growth is happening because of pro growth in part because of the pro growth policies of the tax code what happens if you take that away by tariffs he aposs attacking a problem we don apost need to really be worried about we by 500 billion from them they buy 130 billion from us let aposs focus on selling more to them and we aposre not going to get there by putting tariffs on chinese products wallace michael are you as negative about the idea of tariffs and what impact could it conceivably have on economic growth which at this point may be the best argument republicans have going for them going into the midterms michael needham ceo heritage action for america yes look large broad tariffs aren apost the right way to go nobody wants a trade war i agree with what larry kudlow said i don apost think we aposre going to have a trade war at the same time i think the strongest fact the president has going for him is he aposs always been looking about for american interests he aposs always been looking out for american security and for 20 years liberal elites have promised us that if we just integrate china into the global trade network they will start acting like a responsible stakeholder in the international community they haven apost and it aposs been a lie and the president is right to take seriously the threat of china their irresponsibility on intellectual property their requirements that american companies when they come into china give up their intellectual property and the vast irresponsibility of the chinese government around the world integrating them into a trade framework had not worked we need to be tough we just need to be smart about how we aposre being tough we need to be targeted and i think some of what the president has laid out has not been targeted and smart wallace congresswoman edwards look i understand the concern about tariffs on the other hand as michael points out china has continued with unfair trade practices stealing or threatening pressuring to get our intellectual property i have to say i asked congressman crowley that and didn apost get much of an answer do you have a specific idea of how we get them to clean up their act donna edwards d former maryland congresswoman well first of all i don apost think tariffs are a trade policy and one of the things that aposs missing here i think in the pacific region is a trade policy we had an opportunity i think under the obama administration of a tpp that was fairly negotiated i mean i didn apost support that because i thought that it was missing in terms of protections for american workers which would have had a direct impact on our relationship our trade relationship with china and i think that what is happening now is this sort of ad hoc imposition of tariffs that aposs really throwing the markets around now do i care about that for wealthy people no but i do care about that for american workers and for retirements and for for farmers and so wallace so what should we do edwards you know and so i think that you know what we should do is we should actually have a trade policy for the region that allows us with our neighbors and our allies to stack up against china and right now we don apost have that wallace if you go to the wto and as michael has pointed out it hasn apost worked there was a ruling i just read this weekend that the wto made about certain chinese trade practices they have spent six years and they still are mulling how to comply edwards well i aposm not really sure the wto is necessarily the framework it may be it aposs one avenue but the real framework is our european allies which are facing exactly the same problem with china but we aposve done nothing to coordinate a strategy with with europe and with the pacific region in terms of dealing with china particularly on intellectual property wallace all right i want to switch to another big story this week and that is immigration and president trump aposs decision to send up to 4 000 members of the national guard to the southern border to guard that border he talked at one point about a caravan of about 1 000 people coming up through mexico to the united states here he is begin video clip trump yesterday it came out where this journey coming up women are raped at levels that nobody aposs ever seen before they don apost want to mention that so we have to change our laws and the democrats what they aposre doing is just it aposs insanity end video clip wallace juan now under questioning the white house ended up having to cite reports of incidents of rate with another caravan back in 2014 but what about the larger issue and what about the president aposs decision to send border rather national guard to the border juan williams fox news political analyst well this is political theater for a man who promised to build a wall that would be paid for by mexico that hasn apost happened and you aposve had some people in his base say hey what happened to your pledge to build a wall the reality is the border crossings are i think it aposs a 45 plus year low wallace well no no no we williams no we saw the tick up that you illustrated earlier in the show in the month of march that aposs not representative of the long term here and the long term is in fact that in terms of border crossings from mexico they too are at net zero migration this is the reality but what you have is most illegals in this country have overstayed visas they haven apost run through any wall or snuck under a wall or jumped over a wall wallace well there aposs no wall williams there aposs a well that are there are walls in places that we think i mean it aposs not as if we haven apost done anything about border security but the caravan the caravan aposs been coming up as an easter ritual for the last five plus years chris and i think what you have here is an attempt to trigger fear and hysteria over oh there aposs a horde coming at the southern border and they aposre coming and they aposre going to invade america but i think it aposs all about this president trying to say to his base hey i am putting a wall up or if i aposm not putting a wall up i aposm going to put soldiers there soldiers who by the way have no authority to detain anyone arrest anyone no bullets in their guns i mean it aposs it aposs a joke wallace i i can see both michael and karl with ready to come out of their seats karl i aposll rove i want to briefly agree with one the only thing that juan said that was correct which is the caravan has been going on for a long while and the mexicans were fully capable of taking care of them but the rest of what juan said bologna look we we have a problem on the border if you look at if you look at the crossings compared to a year ago they have doubled and we are facing a surge and the president was right to say to the states it was on an impulse but that doesn apost make it a bad impulse that the states need help you noticed did you see with the first national guard unit was from texas to be sent to the border immediately after the president aposs order an aviation unit because what was the first unit to go from arizona a construction unit there are things along the border that the national guard can do in a moment like this when additional resources are needed that is justified and ample and i trust the secretary of homeland security to arrive at it and so do the governors of most of the border states we have jerry brown wringing his hands in sacramento as to what he ought to do but otherwise this is a useful thing president obama did it president bush did it in a similar moment it aposs not because of the caravan but it aposs because of a more secular trend that aposs troubling the number of illegal border crossings has doubled this year verses last year wallace all right i know we aposre not going to settle this you can argue during the commercial williams it aposs a deal wallace all right we have to take a break here when we come back the trump administration imposes new sanctions on russian oligarchs and businesses to punish the kremlin for alleged meddling in the 2016 election plus the fate of scott pruitt what would you like to ask the panel about whether the president should stand by or fire his epa chief just go to facebook or twitter at fox news sunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip ed henry fox news is draining the swamp renting an apartment from the wife of a washington lobbyist scott pruitt epa administrator i don apost think that that aposs even remotely fair to ask that question end video clip wallace embattled epa administrator scott pruitt pushing back on ethics allegations against him including renting a room in a capitol hill condo for 50 a night and we aposre back now with the panel well michael you aposre one of 10 leading conservatives who sent a letter to president trump yesterday urging him to keep pruitt at epa and saturday night the president tweeted this rent for this condo was about market rate travel expenses ok scott is doing a great job are you not troubled by the growing list of ethical concerns about scott pruitt needham yes look scott pruitt is taking on one of the sacred cows of the extreme progressive left which is that in the debate between job growth and job creation and environmentalism there is no room for any belief in terms of anything other than always siding with environmentalists and anyone who takes that side should be attacked in a mean spirited manner and that aposs what aposs going on towards epa administrator pruitt right now in that environment all of us who take on the left for some these things should be squeaking clean because you give them fuel to create issues and i think scott pruitt should not have done many of the things that he aposs done which has allowed the left to sidetrack the discussion from policy and take it towards the personnel the personal and the ad hominem if you compare what scott pruitt is going through to what obama president obama aposs epa administrators went through gina mccarthy deleted 5 000 tweets because she wanted to get around foia requirements gina mccarthy spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on foreign travel lisa jackson the administrator before gina mccarthy had a fake e mail account to get around foia requests she spent 155 000 on a single trip to china and so there aposs a gigantic double standard the reason the double standard exists is because of the policies that scott pruitt is pursuing and he should be lauded for the for his noble efforts on those policies wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of scott pruitt aposs behavior we got this tweet from 6152tom is there any truth to it that he is a target as he is getting the most done has made some bad expense decisions but his value added seems to be the best of any cabinet person juan how do you answer tom williams well i think there aposs a real situation here in terms of have president trump having promised to drain the swamp and then you have scott pruitt and let aposs just put aside the policy arguments because i think for michael needham shouldn apost that be what matters policy williams no not at the moment needham you don apost think policy matters williams let aposs just let aposs separated it for a second michael because i think conservative activists and conservative donors and people in businesses that are affected by environmental regulations just say well he aposs doing what we want so let aposs leave it alone but can you imagine if this was any other president and you had a cabinet secretary who was engaged in this kind of behavior can apost even answer a question from ed henry of fox news i don apost think he aposs a fox news is not some liberal organization out here trying to undercut a conservative no but what you have is someone who has taken advantage of not only what is a sweetheart deal pennies for dollars in terms of that condo but the condo being rented from a lobbyist whose clients have business in front of the epa that on the face of it michael is disqualifying so we can talk about policy and we can have arguments about wallace all right cross talk needham i am i am going to look forward to going back and finding juan williams speaking out about gina mccarthy deleting 5 000 text messages to get around foia i am sure juan was outraged at the 150 000 williams no i don apost think that aposs good behavior but i aposm just telling you i aposm just it aposs shocking to me that you will make excuses for what is inexcusable needham but you said they were disqualifying was lisa jackson aposs 155 000 trip to china disqualifying williams that aposs look she spent by the way on security much less scott pruitt spent three times as much he has alarms and red flashing things and added asking for more people just to get through d c traffic wallace all right williams it aposs ridiculous wallace i williams for a drain the swamp administration wallace ok i want to we were going to talk about russia we may still get to it but i want to focus now on the breaking story today and that is this what appears to be a poison gas attack on a rebel held suburb outside of damascus there are reports that dozens of people may have been killed and even more were hit by this the president has begun to tweet on this subject today and i hope we aposll put up one tweet many dead including women and children in mindless chemical attack in syria area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by syrian army making it completely inaccessible to outside world president putin russia and iran are responsible for backing animal assad big price it aposs interesting karl there has not been outside confirmation that this was a poison attack but it aposs interesting one the president is saying it and two not only condemning it but also in maybe the strongest terms i aposve never heard him condemning president putin aposs support for assad rove yes the president the president is not obligated to act so confirm if this was a poison gas attack which it looks like it was the estimates now are at least 70 dead maybe as many as 150 a number of them children all of them civilians but now the united states will have to act as the president acted in the aftermath of the sarin gas attack in early 2017 otherwise our credibility in the region is going to be greatly diminished wallace yes let me just pick up on that with you because in one of his earlier tweets he said the reason that this has fallen apart is because president obama did not enforce the redline when he was president on when it came to gas attacks by assad he and when the president did launch that attack those i think it was 59 missiles back in the spring of 2017 he said if it happens again i aposll strike again how much is he on the line now inaudible rove well he aposs on the line and look i think there aposs some i think there is some you know there aposs some reason why he said some evidence that he was correct when he said president obama should have acted it aposs unseemly for the president however to be reflecting on that in my opinion he ought to he ought to act it was one of the most important moments in the definition of his foreign policy last year that when this attack did occur he reacted in 25 percent of the air capacity of the syrian air force disappeared in a matter of moments he has to exact another price in order to send a second signal that just because a year has passed doesn apost mean you can engage in this behavior again wallace congresswoman edwards your reaction to what appears and we need to say it aposs not confirmed yet what appears to be an attack and if so what action president trump is going to need to take edwards well the president is the president today and i think that the american people and the congress actually have to engage in a discussion about syria that is a moral discussion when it comes to the use if this is true of poison gas i mean this is a human rights crisis and the president has an obligation to act that said over this last year and a half our policy has actually allowed assad with russia aposs help to consolidate his power and that leaves open the door to do these kinds to engage in these kind of atrocities because we think we aposve rolled back the islamic states in fact what we aposve done is we aposve actually created an environment where it goes underground it aposs not consolidating land but continues to engage in terrorist behavior and activity wallace would you agree that president obama is much more responsible for the disaster and the humanitarian slaughter in syria than president trump is edwards well let me just say i at the time when i was in congress i called on the president and supported the idea wallace president obama edwards president obama and support of the idea that we should actually be on the side of the syrian people who were facing exactly the same kinds of atrocities and it aposs come to this point but the fact is that today in april 2018 president trump is the president and it aposs his obligation to act and not just reflect on what a bad job he thinks that president obama did wallace we have less than a minute left michael needham yes look i think that that president trump should act as karl said i think that president trump needs to see things through in syria and i think that we should give president trump credit for having a very muscular and strong american policy towards syria and more importantly towards russia which is backing syria in terms of getting anti tank missiles to ukraine the action he took earlier this year in syria pushing forward to put small tactical nuclear weapons into our arsenal and so i think president trump has had a very strong foreign policy and he needs to make sure that he continues that following through with syria williams well john bolton comes on board tomorrow and we aposll see what happens but i think trump has been trying to pull troops out of syria without pentagon approval wallace thanks panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week how the president of a major university here in washington works the campus like a big city mayor commercial break wallace hang around washington long enough and you see plenty of turnover cabinet secretaries come and go and administrations and and as we aposve seen recently when presidents change their mind so what happens to those former big shots here is our power player of the week begin videotape sylvia burwell president of american university i think the role is a little more like a mayor than a ceo hi wallace voice over sylvia matthews burwell is president of american university here in washington and she works the campus like a mayor burwell very nice to meet you both thank you both right now we aposre passing the library wallace here was a video in her new job when the school year started last summer burwell great to see some students on campus oh wait a minute there aposs claude ph the au legend out for a morning run wallace on camera so i understand you insist everyone calls you sylvia burwell that aposs right wallace why burwell because i think it aposs part of being a part of the university and having people feel like they can engage wallace voice over if burwell looks familiar she was a member of president obama aposs cabinet first his budget director then secretary of health and human services trying to fix obamacare after the disastrous rollout and then dealing with the ebola crisis burwell so having very large critical issues made it a pretty challenging time wallace but running a university with 13 000 students and a tradition of public service is also challenging wallace on camera how much does it cost tuition room and board to go to au for a year burwell about 60 000 wallace voice over burwell says she aposs trying to cut cost and find new ways to help students who can apost afford it then there were several racist incidents last fall including confederate flag posters on bulletin boards burwell held a town hall burwell we want to make sure that you know we aposre taking our steps we need your help and support too unidentified female i don apost feel safe here i don apost feel happy here i don apost feel nicer i feel worse wallace on camera was that a tough meeting for you burwell you know it it was a tough meeting most of all because of the pain that the incidents cause wallace voice over one reform every student must now take a course that includes diversity training burwell it is about learning to listen from others differing points of view and differing experiences wallace burwell grew up in hinton west virginia her grandparents greek immigrants burwell there were two themes in the matthews household one was education and the other was public service wallace she followed both paths going to harvard and becoming a rhodes scholar then interspersing government work with 11 years helping run the gates and walmart foundations wallace on camera how does it feel to see so much of the obama legacy including obamacare being rolled back by president trump burwell there will be people who don apost receive treatment and actually die because they can apost afford the care the preventative care or the care along the way and so this has real world consequences for individuals in their lives wallace voice over but burwell embraces her new role as college president including one game as guest coach of the women aposs basketball team burwell i aposm undefeated it was terrific it was wonderful i loved it wallace it aposs all part of seeing au as a town and she aposs the
