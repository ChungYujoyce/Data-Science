deal to offset the sanctions u s president donald trump reinstated after pulling out the country recently surpassed the amount of low enriched uranium it is allowed to stockpile and started enriching uranium past a 3 67 limit permitted to 4 5 saying the actions could be reversed if the europeans came up with incentives that compensated for the impact of the sanctions on the iranian economy iran s recent moves which it defends as permissible after the u s withdrawal are seen as a way to force the others to openly confront the sanctions araghchi told reporters in farsi after the meeting that iran would continue decreasing its commitments until the europeans meet its demands experts warn that a higher enrichment level and a growing uranium stockpile narrow the one year window that iran would need to have enough material to make an atomic bomb something iran denies it wants but that the deal prevented so far iran s exceeding of the agreement s stockpile and uranium enrichment ceilings have been seen as violations likely to prompt the european signatories to invoke a dispute resolution mechanism weapons grade uranium is enriched at a level of 90 both of iran s actions were verified by the u n s nuclear watchdog the international atomic energy agency in recent weeks iran broke past the limit on its stockpile of low enriched uranium but did not say by how much the nuclear accord has a stockpile limit of 300 kilograms however it also permits iran to enrich uranium and export it as it has to russia in past years the head of iran s atomic energy organization said sunday that the country has enriched 24 tons of uranium since it reached the 2015 nuclear deal with the other countries and the eu atomic energy organization head ali akbar salehi was quoted by state tv as saying iran did not enrich 300 kilograms of uranium but enriched 24 metric tons of uranium or what is 24 000 kilograms nearly 53 000 pounds at the sunday meeting fu said the europeans urged iran to come back to full compliance and iran urged the european union france britain and germany to implement their part of the deal fu said all sides expressed strong opposition against the unilateral imposition of sanctions by the u s especially the extraterritorial application of the sanctions they also voiced support for china s efforts to maintain normal trade and oil relations with iran fu added in addition to trade with china iran is especially keen on the activation of a barter type system set up by the europeans that would allow the continent s businesses to trade with tehran without violating the u s sanctions araghchi said the european system was not functioning yet but it is in its final stages in the meantime iran has taken increasingly provocative actions against ships in the gulf including seizing a british tanker and downing a u s drone the u s has expanded its military presence in the region and fears are growing of a wider conflict a royal navy warship arrived sunday in the gulf to accompany british flagged ships passing through the strait of hormuz britain s ministry of defense said the hms duncan will join the frigate hms montrose in the gulf to defend freedom of navigation until a diplomatic resolution is found to secure the key waterway again iranian president hassan rouhani penned an open letter to new british prime minister boris johnson that was published on the president s website sunday rouhani extended congratulations and said he hoped the diplomatic ties between their countries would be stronger under johnson s leadership rouhani said he hoped johnson s only one visit to tehran while serving as u k foreign secretary in 2017 and now his tenure as prime minister lead to a further deepening of bilateral and multilateral relations under the provisions of the 2015 accord signatories provided iran with economic sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on the country s nuclear program trump withdrew the u s and put sanctions on iran back in place saying he wanted to negotiate a better agreement the u s sanctions have had their intended purpose of hurting iran s economy while highlighting the inability of the europeans as well as russia and china to keep their commitments at the same time europe is under pressure from the u s to abandon the iran nuclear accord entirely and is also being squeezed by iran to offset the ever crippling effects of american economic sanctions kirsten grieshaber in berlin a
