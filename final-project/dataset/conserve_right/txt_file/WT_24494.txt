at becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion when iran shot down a u s drone aircraft last month president trump ordered and then canceled a retaliatory u s strike on iranian military sites minutes before the attack was to occur mr trump reportedly canceled the retaliation because it would probably have killed more than 100 iranians the president felt that it would thus be disproportionate to what iran had done he believed correctly that because iran did not take any american lives in shooting down the drone we shouldn t take iranian lives in response in response to the drone being downed mr trump imposed more sanctions on iran including personally on iran s supreme leader ayatollah khamenei as well as reportedly authorizing a cyber attack on iranian missile forces top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century a few days after mr trump s actions i wrote on this page that mr trump s actions were a good example of proportionality but that proportionality is only a guideline in conflicts most importantly that column pointed out that if the new sanctions and the cyber attack did not stop or at least slow iran s aggression they were an inadequate response to the downing of our drone as always in the middle east fast moving facts have intervened to muddy any judgment of the adequacy of the president s response in early july british forces seized an iranian oil tanker which was believed to be on course to deliver oil to syria in violation of european union sanctions about two weeks later iranian revolutionary guard corps troops hijacked the british flagged tanker stena impero forcing it into an iranian port iran has since upped the ante considerably by seizing at least one indian flagged tanker and is threatening to impose a toll on all ships passing through the strait of hormuz about one fifth of the world s oil supply passes through the strait in response to iran s actions mr trump has tried so far unsuccessfully to get our nato allies to help protect ships passing through the strait of hormuz the british navy has only one ship there a small frigate to protect british ships defense secretary mark esper said that u s ships will be protected by our naval forces from the tanker mess we can gather that proportionality is an eroding guideline for the iranians and as such must erode in our judgment as well in the past experts on iran have always assured us that iran carefully calibrates its actions against ours to avoid a u s military response but those days are gone iran is willing to take far greater risks than pure proportionality and avoidance of military response would allow proportionality to iran means not only that it could seize the british tanker but that it could also seize the indian ship and threaten every other one passing through the strait of hormuz it means that iran s testing of the united states will continue with greater and more dangerous provocations we must therefore judge mr trump s proportional response to the drone shoot down to have failed his campaign of sanctions is strangling iran s economy but not enough to compel tehran to reduce the level of its aggression is proportionality failing or is it that iran feeling the pressure of american sanctions is behaving like a cornered rat in either case iran is becoming even more dangerous than it has been even if you consider only iran s diplomatic efforts in reaction to mr trump s sanctions you must conclude that they are greatly damaging iran s economy and its self esteem iran s diplomacy is focused on britain france and germany presumably the three that have the greatest influence on u s policy promising them the sun the moon and the stars if only they relieve iran of the burden of our sanctions but iran never gives an inch tehran refuses to negotiate anything else unless they are first relieved of the sanctions if iran were offering to negotiate while the sanctions were still in place in the hope of earning relief from them that would be entirely different that would indicate that iran lacked the power and more importantly the will to continue its aggression at least temporarily the rat isn t cornered at least not yet what happens next largely depends on the united kingdom s new prime minister boris johnson mr johnson who took office last week is faced with the immediate crisis over the tanker seized by iran and the continued crisis over brexit he will certainly consult with mr trump before he takes action on the tanker crisis if he is as strong as conservatives believe he is mr johnson could demand that the european union increase its sanctions against iran or take the u k out of instex the financial mechanism the u k france and germany have set up to evade u s sanctions or could even go as far as to begin the process of quitting the obama nuclear weapons deal with iran mr trump would likely recommend all three actions to mr johnson if he is weak mr johnson could release the syria bound iranian tanker in exchange for the release of the stena impero or negotiate other humiliating terms with tehran whatever action mr johnson takes won t change iran s behavior tehran has a history of taking american lives and will again when that happens military action will be the only proportional u s response jed
