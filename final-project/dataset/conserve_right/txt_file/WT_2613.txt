reads this way ukrainian efforts to sabotage trump backfire kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president elect after quietly working to boost clinton hmm well that s interesting particularly since the democrats have been busily working to impeach president donald trump over supposed nefarious ukraine wheelings and dealings top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state particularly since a couple of republican senators as the washington times previously reported have requested the justice department to investigate whether or not ukrainian officials tried to undermine trump s presidential campaign and asked for attorney general william barr to give them the answer by oct 14 according to politico according to a politico report from jan 11 2017 that was linked on the usubc s page the answer to that question is a clear cut yes flashback politico headine ukrainian efforts to sabotage trump backfire and here s how that 2017 story starts kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president elect trump after quietly working to boost clinton it s a worthwhile read one excerpt ukrainian government officials tried to help hillary clinton and undermine trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office another a ukrainian american operative who was consulting for the democratic national committee met with top officials in the ukrainian embassy in washington in an effort to expose ties between trump top campaign aide paul manafort and russia as news watchers recall manafort did ultimately resign and face charges the trump campaign did face ongoing unfounded accusations of collusion with russia the piece goes on to report how ukraine s involvement in the 2016 presidential race to the white house appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another s elections and then there was this tidbit the ukrainian antipathy for trump s team and alignment with hillary clinton s can be traced back to late 2013 that s when the country s president viktor yanukovych removed from power in 2014 whom manafort had been advising abruptly backed out of a european union pact linked to anti corruption reforms and instead signed a bailout agreement with russia where he then fled shortly after a woman named alexandra chalupa caught wind of the manafort yanukovych connection who s chalupa the daughter of ukrainian immigrants a lawyer by training and a democratic operative who had worked during the clinton administration in the white house office of public liaison and who then went on to a position with the democratic national committee as a consultant the dnc paid her 412 000 from 2004 to june 2016 politico wrote citing federal election commission records and chalupa used her position contacts and experience to align with investigative journalists intelligence officials and government and citizen sources in both kiev and washington d c to dig deeper into manafort and possibly trump improprieties she occasionally shared her findings with officials from the dnc and clinton s campaign politico wrote she said she shared her concern about a manafort russia connection with ukraine s ambassador to the u s valeriy chaly and one of his top aides oksana shulyar at the time nobody thought trump was much of a contender for the white house so the findings were largely yawned until trump hired manafort that is all of a sudden the dnc was all ears w ith the dnc s encouragement chalupa asked ukrainian embassy staff to try to arrange an interview in which proshenko ukraine president 2014 2019 might discuss manafort s ties to yanukovych politico wrote apparently embassy folk said no but they then offered chalupa quiet assistance quiet so that they couldn t be seen as too political shulyar aide to ukraine s ambassador to the united states denied any such assistance came from the embassy or from her then again of course she would twouldn t look good for ukraine to appear to pick a campaign side right hold that thought but andrii telizhenko who worked as a political officer in the ukrainian embassy under shulyar said shulyar instructed him to help chalupa research connections between trump manafort and russia politico reported telizhenoko s quoted remarks oksana shulyar said that if i had any information or knew other people who did then i should contact chalupa they were coordinating an investigation with the hillary team on paul manafort with alexandra chalupa oksana was keeping it all quiet but the embassy worked very closely with chalupa telizhenko told politico other sources confirmed and the goal politico wrote was to get a congressional hearing or even better a congressional investigation chalupa confirmed that a week after manafort s hiring was announced she discussed the possibility of a congressional investigation with a foreign policy legislative assistant in the office of rep marcy kaptur d oh politico reported the story goes on the rabbit hole goes deeper but one big takeaway is this when it comes to democrats pointing fingers at team trump for crooked ukraine dealings fact is they better look inward they better look at clinton they better look at their own dnc another takeaway the two republican senators ron johnson and charles grassley requesting justice department information about ukraine s interference in the 2016 election better kick it into high gear like much the democrats accuse the trail of corruption doesn t so much stop at trump s door as it meanders on down clinton lane right
