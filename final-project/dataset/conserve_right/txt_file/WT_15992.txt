the past decade china and its companies have invested almost 900 million in ethiopia over the past five years according to the ethiopian investment agency trade between the two countries is around 1 3

transport sector to other infrastructure and ethiopia isn t alone chinese president xi jinping this week traveled directly from the paris climate summit for a visit to zimbabwe and south africa a trip resulting in billions of dollars in new deals and multiple meetings with african leaders who traveled to meet with mr xi but the new relationship is proving to be double edged as the chinese economy has slumped this year and demand for resources in the world s most populous country slackens ethiopian growth is forecast to decline to 7 5 percent in the next few years according to the international monetary fund the imf also recently noted that ethiopia could benefit however as chinese consumers import more goods like ethiopian coffee and leather ethiopia is still desperately poor more than 80

long period as a backwater in the global race for prosperity sub saharan african nations such as ethiopia are finally generating excitement among investors as the site for the next big economic takeoff another china backed freight rail system recently opened replacing the old french built railway that formerly connected landlocked ethiopia to the red sea port of djibouti ethiopian officials
