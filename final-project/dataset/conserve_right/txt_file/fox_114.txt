trip chris wallace john roberts reporting from tokyo john thanks for that now to the sweeping republican tax plan which would cut rates for corporations and individuals but would end some key deductions on friday i sat down with the speaker of the house paul ryan to discuss the tax plan and much more begin videotape wallace mr speaker welcome back to fox news sunday rep paul ryan r wis speaker of the house thanks for having me wallce let aposs start with the prospects for this tax plan you say you want the house to pass it by thanksgiving which is less than three weeks away you also say that k street is coming after us the lobbyists and the special interests so how certain are you that the house will meet the thanksgiving deadline ryan yes i feel very good about it i think our members are very excited about this we aposre pleased with what we aposve rolled out and this is what we said we would do when we ran for office in 2016 we have to have tax reform we have to have tax cuts for people in the middle this delivers that and we really are convinced this is going to help get out economy growing and reaching its potential you have to this in order to do that and that aposs why we want to get it done this year so we can have a very good 2018 and get stronger economic growth and so yes we aposre on track for moving this through the house before thanksgiving that aposs our plan we expect our friends in the senate to be about a week behind us wallace well let aposs talk about the senate because of course the house passed obamacare repeal and replace you may remember ryan i do wallace and it died in the senate ryan yes wallce how worried are you with all of the complicated rules about budget reconciliation that the same thing could happen to tax reform ryan it aposs a completely fair and legitimate question we feel very good and we did things differently this time because of the health care experience like you said we passed out health care repeal and replace bill back in may and the senate just couldn apost get it done so what we did this time differently was we worked for the senate ahead of time from the summer on to put this bill together to basically create a framework of this bill house senate and the white house and launch this thing together and be very coordinated and then now the budget rule the budget that we passed in the house and the senate paves the way for this to get done and get through the senate and this is in conformity of those rules so wallace but orrin hatch ryan the lesson learned was coordinate with the senate and then move together orrin hatch is going to be putting his bill out all of those wallace but he aposs saying he aposs going to pass his own bill which makes crosstalk ryan that aposs the legislative process but that aposs within the framework that aposs the key here so we had basically decided the big ticket items the big 20 percent corporate a 25 percent rate for pass through business the middle class tax cut all of those things are things we agree on and so these bills are written within those details so that aposs why those differences will be fairly narrow wallace a month ago you promised that tax reform would revenue neutral your words but the bill that you just announced ryan i said budget neutral deficit neutral because that aposs the way out budget rules work let me just get you right there you aposre going to say that the 1 5 trillion dollar tax cut we are we are convinced that this is going to give us faster economic growth i aposm not saying every tax cut will pay for itself wallace let me just i just ryan yes wallace let me ask a question then you can crosstalk ryan i just know you so well chris wallace well i know i know but in january when the new house the new republican senate the new republican president were just getting started you said this begin video clip ryan we are fiscal conservatives what that means is we believe government should not live beyond its needs that means we have to get our fiscal house in order to prevent a debt crisis in the future end video clip wallace question what happened to paul ryan the deficit hawk ryan paul ryan deficit hawk is also a growth advocate paul ryan deficit hawk also know that you have to have a faster growing economy more jobs bigger take home pay that means higher tax revenues wallace but your mark is 1 5 trillion added to the deficit ryan the reason we did it that way is because we believed that the senate parliamentarian won apost let us use what we call dynamic scoring which is wallace score keeping ground ryan that figures out growth so we basically did not want to lead the chance that some bureaucrat unelected would deny our ability to bring a tax bill through that is pro growth and that reflects those pro growth estimates that aposs why it aposs done that way but we are absolutely convinced and we all have economic models that will show this that this will help grow the economy i wish the obamacare bill would have passed which would have been good fiscal responsibility entitlement reform legislation it didn apost pass the senate it passed the house we aposre just going to keep going at entitlement reform all the way down the road but we aposre going to make sure that we actually get this economy growing and this tax reform bill does that wallace well let me ask you about obamacare because some republicans are saying that as part of tax reform there aposs a discussion about repealing the obamacare individual mandate which would save about 400 billion take it away from the deficit is that on the table ryan yes we have an active conversation with our members in a whole host of ideas on things to add to this bill and that aposs one of the things that aposs being discussed wallace you say it aposs being discussed so there is a possibility the house could pass as part of tax reform doing away with the individual mandate ryan again we aposre listening to our members about what we can do to add to this bill to make it even better so that aposs among the ideas that a lot of members are suggesting that we could add to this bill to make it even better wallace but it aposs on the table for this tax reform bill ryan it aposs one of the things that people have been suggesting that aposs what i aposm saying wallace then there aposs the question who benefits senate democratic leader chuck schumer said this about this about the bill begin video clip sen chuck schumer d cali senate minority leader to pay for all the tax giveaways in their bill the republicans are likely to make it worse for the middle class not just not help them but hurt them slash state and local deductibility which is a bedrock middle class and upper middle class deduction would hurt so many middle class taxpayers end video clip wallace schumer says that you take away 70 percent of the state and local deduction and he points out that one third of taxpayers claim that he says you aposre taking away almost three quarters of the value ryan yes so here aposs what we aposre doing you see this postcard this is literally the kind of tax form that nine out of 10 taxpayers will be able to use right now about 70 percent don apost itemize by doubling the standard deduction we aposre making it so that people don apost have to itemize their deductions so instead of having the first 12 000 that you don apost pay tax on it will be the first 24 000 for a couple you don apost pay your tax on and we aposre lowering people aposs tax rates the difference here is we aposre basically saying instead of using a tax deduction to lower your tax rate lower your tax liability we aposre just going to make it easier so you don apost pay taxes in the first place but this is a clear middle class tax cut no two ways about it even for people in those high tax states wallace let aposs talk about it being a middle class tax cut which i know you say the president says ryan well the math says it as well wallace let aposs talk about fairness people will no longer be able to deduct medical expenses or interest on their student loans as we aposve said they aposre going to lose the deduction for what they pay in state and local income taxes under your plan but wealthy people will no longer pay any tax on estates worth millions question ryan yes wallace is that fair ryan here aposs what fair clean out the special interest loopholes in the tax code and let people keep their money in the first place so here aposs the discussion here you just mentioned a couple of things that are good that are valuable paying student loans you have medical expenses so what we aposre doing here by raising the standard deduction and lowering people aposs tax rates we aposre saying you do what you want with your money because it aposs your money instead of using a deduction to get some kind of a tax break based on this behavior it aposs your money you do what you want with it crosstalk wallace you aposre making it sound like it aposs a deal mr speaker but if i have a student loan and i aposve been getting able to deduct the ryan yes and instead of wallace if i if i aposm able to deduct the interest rate now i aposm losing that if i have huge medical expenses and i aposm able to deduct the medical ryan in exchange for a tax cut so you get to keep your money more in the first place so you get to decide what you want to do with your money that aposs the point i aposm trying to make wallace and why repeal the estate tax we aposre only talking about like 5 000 people a year there aposs already an 11 million exemption ryan i said two things first of all it aposs a fairness argument second of all it aposs a job argument you actually create jobs by getting rid of this death tax because you know what kills one family business from passing their business on to the next generation the estate tax wallace but there are a lot of protections for family farms ryan but we believe that they aposre this is a fairness argument people work hard to build up their business their farm their ranch all their working lives they pay taxes on that money all of their lives and then when you die you get it taxed away from you and you can apost pass it on to the next generation we just think it aposs unfair death should be not a taxable event and we should not be stopping people from being able to pass their life aposs work on to their kids wallace i want to ask you briefly about the russia investigation the special counsel robert mueller has charged two top trump campaign officials with various misconduct one guilty plea by a campaign associate for lying to the fbi some republicans are arguing the president should fire robert mueller in fact several members of your own caucus have filed a resolution calling for him to step down some are saying congress should cut off his funding will you pledge that you will not allow the mueller investigation to be curbed or stopped ryan yes as i aposve said all along we need to let these career professionals do their jobs see it through so no i don apost think he should be stepping down i don apost think he should be fired i don apost and the president aposs made it clear he aposs not going to do that so no we aposre not going to interfere with his investigation the investigation will take its course and we will let it take its course we aposre also doing our own investigations here in the house and the senate has one as well into russia and into russia aposs meddling in our campaign so these russian investigations will take their course we need to find out exactly what they did to our country how and why they did it and then how do we prevent them from doing it in the future and let these career professionals at doj just do their jobs and finish their job and that aposs what we aposre going to do let them do that wallace and what about the revelations over the last few weeks about hilary clinton about the fact that her campaign helped pay for the so called russia dossier the revelation just yesterday that the dnc in effect made a deal with hillary clinton ryan yes wallace that she could control ryan so the first part of your question the dossier that aposs part we were discovering that as well through our investigation and the fbi has finally been releasing those documents so we could get to the bottom of that and that is part of this russia investigation the second thing that story just broke i aposve never seen anything like that i mean we all said that the clintons thought they lived above the rules so this takes the cake i mean this is pretty amazing for them to basically be running the dnc in a primary to see such a deck stack is really pretty jaw dropping to me no wonder the democrats are ticked off i would be too it aposs amazing to me on the clintons this live above the law or above the rules in this thing i understand why democrats are mad about this they should be mad about this and i don apost think i aposve ever seen anything like this frankly wallace is there any legislative remedy or is this ryan well i don apost know that there aposs a legislative remedy on how parties conduct themselves and how they aposre supposed to be neutral in primaries whether they broke campaign finance laws should be something that the fec the federal elections commission should have to look into but i don apost we don apost legally regulate how the parties set up their bylaws but to have a primary it had one of the primary participants stacking the deck and running the party that aposs i aposve never heard of that before that it just takes the cake in my mind it aposs amazing wallace mr speaker thank you ryan yes you got it chris thank you end videotape wallace when we come back more on that bombshell from former democratic party chair donna brazile about hillary clinton aposs control of the dnc in 2016 we aposll bring in our sunday panel to discuss whether the party aposs primaries were rigged plus what would you like to ask the panel about the republican tax plan just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump we are giving them a big beautiful christmas present in the form of a tremendous tax cut sen chuck schumer d ny senate minority leader republican tax plan would put two thumbs down on a scale already tipped towards the wealthy and powerful end video clip wallace president trump and senate democratic leader chuck schumer with very different views of the new republican tax plan and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove columnist for the hill juan williams rachael bade who covers politics for politico and jason riley from the wall street journal rachel as our congress watcher on this panel i want to ask you about the tax plan what you think of the prospects for the plan what do you is the biggest challenge the republicans face getting it through and to follow up on the discussion i had with speaker ryan what about this idea of adding repealing killing the individual mandate of obamacare as part of tax reform rachael bade reporter politico i think the prospects are pretty good at this point in time i mean republicans after failing to repeal obamacare they are feeling this pressure right now that they really have to deliver on tax reform i think i saw something this week on the hill that bodes well for the plan and that is the rollout went very fairly smoothly i remember when they rolled out the obamacare replacement plan in the spring and within two or three hours we knew it was in some trouble because conservative groups started piling on calling it obamacare light and they aposve never recovered from that and ultimately the bill died this time around we saw those same conservative groups come out and applaud the plan say they like it and that puts pressure on the house republicans that are often divided and fighting about specifics on legislation to actually get this done wallace what about this idea of killing the individual mandate as part of tax reform is not going to help or is not going to make it even more divided bade you know speaker paul ryan who you just interviewed he kind of sidestepped that a little bit turns out he thinks it aposs going to complicate the bill we aposve heard this privately he aposs very reluctant to mix health care and taxes because taxes are already complicated enough when you add a repeal of the individual mandate it could make things harder however senator cotton is really pushing this in the senate he aposs close with president trump and my understanding is he took this to the president and got him on board and president trump obviously tweeted about this this week that puts pressure on speaker ryan and the ways and means chairman kevin brady to actually consider this so right now they are not panning it out right publicly they don apost like it privately we aposll just have to see where it goes wallace we ask you for questions for the panel and someone called hopeful skeptic which is i think a good name tweeted this why are we cutting taxes with the deficit where the cuts going to come from funding for disaster relief increased military infrastructure jason how do you answer hopeful skeptic and what do you think that going to try to finance this through spending cuts or were they just going to add to the national debt jason riley columnist the wall street journal well as speaker ryan said to you this is about economic growth and that aposs how you aposre ultimately going to handle these deficits you aposre going have to grow the economy and that is what this plan is designed to do and i think on the corporate side it would do that as we see in the house proposal you got something like 2 trillion sitting overseas lowering the rate to 20 percent of corporate tax rate could bring a lot of that money back here it could be invested in companies here that aposs more hiring that aposs higher wages we aposve all seen that unemployment rate come down but wages have not been growing like they should be corporate tax cut like that can get the ball rolling here so that aposs ultimately what you aposre going to do the problem for me however is on the individual rate side i think tax credits complicate the code they are expensive they do nothing for growth and you have some senators like mike lee of utah and senator rubio of florida who want to put these credits in they think it aposs good politics but frankly if you want to use if a voter is interested in using the tax code to redistribute wealth they aposre going to vote they aposre going to vote for democrats because that aposs what they specialize in doing i think paul ryan wants to focus on growing the economy and that aposs what i think this would accomplish at least when it comes to corporate tax wallace all right let aposs turn if we can to the democrats well yes we can because i aposm running the panel here so there you go let aposs turn to the democrats enter the bombshell revelation in donna brazile aposs new book that the clinton campaign signed a deal with the dnc in 2015 that in return for fund raising the party gave the clinton campaign considerable control over staff and strategy this put president trump and elizabeth warren in rare agreement take a look begin video clip trump you want to look at hillary clinton and you want to look at the new book that was just put out by donna brazile where she basically bought the dnc and she stole the election from burning jake tapper cnn anchor very quickly senator do you agree with the notion that it was rigged sen elizabeth warren d massachusetts yes end video clip wallace carl the clinton camp fires back they say this was a deal that was made not for the primaries but for the general election that it was a way to raise money for the democratic party that bernie sanders could have made the same deal do you buy it karl rove former bush white house adviser baloney complete and utter baloney these joint fund raiser agreements are a norm in presidential campaigns but they aposre generally consist of very simple provisions we aposll let you use the party aposs mailing list and donor list for fund raising purposes and in return we get access to your donors after you finish the primary campaign this gave in writing control over finance strategy operations and staffing of the democratic national committee to the clinton campaign it explicitly says we get to name the communications director we aposve given you two names you pick from those two names and any vacancies staff vacancies in communications tech and research you aposre going to come to us and we have control over your budget anybody who has control over your budget has control over your operations and anybody who has control over who you staff up in the committee has control over how that committee goes wallace so this was rigged rove this was rigged i got to tell you it is jaw droppingly amazing that in the fall of 2015 the democratic national committee signs this agreement and then for the next until their convention in the summer of 2016 the democratic national chairman says oh no no we are being neutral in this this was a document that surrendered lock stock and barrel control of the democratic national committee to robby mook and the clinton campaign hierarchy in brooklyn it aposs just astonishing wallace and we should point out in terms of timing that the time that this was signed the primary battle with bernie sanders hadn apost even begun and joe biden was still considering running which brings up another point i want to ask you about juan and that aposs another revelation in the book we got to back let aposs play the tape 9 11 2016 you could see hillary clinton this is where she fainted because of pneumonia leaving the event the ceremony at ground zero and donna brazile says in her book when she saw that plus all the problems she had with the clinton campaign that she thought of getting the dnc to begin a process to replace hillary clinton and tim kaine on the national ticket with joe biden and cory booker i have a couple of questions first of all what to make of that revelation and two you and i know donna brazile we aposve known her for years she aposs a sharp strong tough democratic operative why do you think she is saying this juan williams fox news political analyst well i think this is what happened to her i mean she was essentially pushed aside by the clinton operation and i think she feels disrespected by the clinton operation to that extent because when she comes in it aposs very apparent to her as we just heard karl described it they have bailed out a financially ailing democratic party president obama had created you know organizing for america he aposs taking money away there wasn apost really a fund raising energy there debbie wasserman schultz had not been a success as the party chairman donna comes in in a rescue operation and finds gee whiz guess what this is being run out of brooklyn i don apost have that power so i think that she has felt and she always felt you know some wise guys on the democratic side who run the democratic party they don apost listen to her they don apost have value for people like her so i think that aposs why she did it wallace this is what she said in conference calls this is what she says in her book in conference calls with democratic clinton campaign operatives you were treating me like one of the slaves in 12 years a slave williams correct that aposs what i said that aposs how she felt so this let me just finish this point though there aposs a civil war among democrats going on the rift between the hillary people and the bernie people the elizabeth warren people has never healed this morning we know about a rift among the republicans with george h w and george w bush going after trump but what we have going on for the democrats as they have been unable to capitalize on the tremendous anti trumped fervor because they haven apost been able to somehow heal the rift in their own party wallace and i think we would all agree that donna brazile aposs book pours a lot of salt on that open wound williams right wallace panel we have to take a break here we aposll see you a little later in the program up next president trump takes on his own justice department from demands to investigate hillary clinton to calls for the death penalty in the new york terror case is the president crossing the line we aposll ask senator lindsey graham next commercial break wallace coming up senator lindsey graham urges the president to get tough on terrorists in the wake of the attack in new york new york begin video clip sen lindsey graham r south carolina the last thing i want this guy to hear tonight is you have the right to a lawyer the last thing he should here is his miranda rights end video clip wallace we aposll talk with senator graham about terror justice and russia next commercial break wallace senator lindsey graham was one of president trump aposs biggest critics earlier this year but now the two are finding common ground on everything from health care to taxes still after this week aposs terror attack in new york city the senator called out the president for quote following the obama playbook senator graham joins us now from south carolina senator i want to start with two two terror suspects graham yes right wallace sayfullo saipov has been charged in the attack in new york city this week that killed eight people mustafa al imam has been charged in the attack on the u s consulate in benghazi now in both cases as you know they were charged in civilian criminal court not as enemy combatants and you said in reaction to that it as if loretta lynch obama aposs attorney general never left is this president and his administration are they too soft on terror cases graham well i think the president aposs got the right attitude about fighting the war on terror i complement him for taking the gloves off when it comes to our military but clearly the trump administration is doing exactly what the obama administration did it aposs hard to catch a terrorist alive chris and when you do you should try to gather intelligence i don apost mind trying this guy in new york court the new york terrorist but want i wanted to do was hold him for a long period of time let our military cia interrogate him about what he knows about terrorism how he got radicalized he said he was a soldier of the caliphate isil says he was a soldier of the caliphate we talked to him for one day in the hospital we read him his miranda rights we throw him right in court and we can get any intelligence going forward because now he aposs been lawyered up and that aposs exactly what obama did so when it comes to trump policy they aposre using obama aposs playbook and they got a lot of the obama people hold over and i want to see that change wallace how do you explain that you know this is a president who has talked tough on terror graham yes yes wallace this is his own justice department graham right wallace how do you explain the fact that they aposre as you say doing the same thing which is not taking these people into the enemy combatant role at least for interrogation graham yes wallace but instead are putting them immediately into the criminal justice system and allowing them to lawyer up graham woefully unprepared for this moment the explanations i got from the department of justice about their legal reasoning made me so mad i could not see straight they said the reason they didn apost declare the new york guy an enemy combatant even though he pledged allegiance to isil isil said he was one of their soldiers he killed eight people in the name of radical islam showing support for isil because there aposs no evidence of command and control that is ridiculous they aposre recruiting in cyberspace they aposre trying to radicalize people in our own backyard what makes you an enemy combatants is when you adopt radical islamic philosophy and you act on it when you kill in the name of isil you aposre a soldier of the caliphate the guy coming back from libya was one of the masterminds behind the benghazi attack and under the obama administration at least they interrogated him while he was on the ship before they put him in federal court the trump administration took this man from libya captured by our military and sent him right into federal court without any efforts to gather intelligence and he was one of the masterminds of the benghazi attack this is ridiculous it makes us less safe and it needs to change wallace you say woefully unprepared graham woefully wallace who do you hold responsible graham well i know jeff sessions agrees with me in philosophy but it aposs clear to me the department of defense and the department of justice have not coordinated how to handle a terror suspect when we capture one of the soldiers of the caliphate alive it is a tremendous opportunity to understand how the enemy operates what they know how they got radicalized we should have long conversations they were not prepared for this moment there are no protocols at the department of justice and the department of defense changing obama policy they aposre doing exactly what obama did and i aposm urging the department of justice department of defense to come up with new protocols to hold terror suspects soldiers of the caliphate people who kill our ambassador as enemy combatants in the future wallace meanwhile president trump is urging his justice department and the fbi to investigate hillary clinton and the democrats graham yes wallace on everything from the uranium deal to the russia dossier her e mails graham right wallace her arrangement that we just talked about with the dnc here aposs the president begin video clip trump they should be looking at the democrats they should be looking at podesta and all of that dishonesty they should be looking at a lot of things and a lot of people are disappointed in the justice department including me end video clip wallace senator is the president crossing the line when he encourages almost directs his justice department and the fbi to investigate and perhaps prosecute his political opponents graham yes it is my view that president trump as the commander in chief should be focusing on his department of justice his department of defense to make sure that if we ever capture somebody who is involved in the benghazi attack who murdered our ambassador and three other americans that we don apost ship him across the seas and put him in federal court without first interrogating him i can only imagine how much intelligence could be gathered from one of the masterminds of the benghazi attack so rather than directing his department of justice to go after hillary clinton i wish he would direct his department of justice to come up with policies to hold terror suspects soldiers of the caliphate as enemy combatants wallace well so so why do think it aposs wrong for him to be pushing the justice department and fbi to go after hillary clinton graham that aposs just not the way we do it in america here aposs what i do need believe needs to happen i think we need a special counsel to investigate the fusion gps episode between the democratic party mr steele and russian operatives i think we need a special counsel to investigate the uranium one episode of where thousands of dollars were given to the clinton global fund and to former president bill clinton from groups tied to russia we need a special counsel because mueller can apost do this wallace when you say that aposs not the way we do it in america go after political opponents through the justice system explain graham right well the president of the united states is in charge of the executive branch it aposs not his job to be telling the attorney general to prosecute a particular individual or a group it is the attorney general aposs job to do that independent we have a rule of law that aposs independent of political influence and when you call on the attorney general to prosecute your former opponent that is crossing a line but here aposs what i would say about russia massive involvement in our election the idea that the democratic party would pay millions of dollars to a foreign agent to go to russia to gather dirt on president trump then candidate trump allows the democratic party to be manipulated by russian operatives inside of russia so i want to get to the bottom of fusion gps and i aposm really worried about what happened with the uranium one deal because there was a woman in clinton aposs inner inner orbit there in terms of campaign financing fundraising that was sent out of the country a suspected russian spy that needs to be looked at as much is the trump campaign wallace who was that sir graham i can apost remember her name but he was associated with a big fundraiser of clinton she was expelled from the country as being a russian spy and everything about fusion gps stinks the idea that the democratic party would hire though a law firm a foreign intelligence officer go to russia and try to gather dirt means that they aposve set themselves up to be manipulated by the russians the idea that the russians didn apost know that mr steele was in town looking for dirt on donald trump is zero impossible i can apost believe that they didn apost know so you aposre setting yourself up to be manipulated by the russians and to me that aposs a terrible thing to do wallace finally i want to ask you about attorney general jeff sessions and statements he aposs made repeatedly to congress that he knew nothing of any contacts between the trump campaign trump world and associates here aposs an example begin video clip graham did you ever overhear a conversation between you and anybody on the campaign who talked about meeting with the russians jeff sessions attorney general i have not seen anything that would indicate a collusion with russians to impact the campaign end video clip wallace yes i just want to correct the record i was talking you were asking about trump campaign in the russians but we now know that carter page has testified before congress that he told sessions he was going to russia during the campaign and another advisor george papadopoulos who pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi says he told both sessions and candidate trump in this meeting during 2016 about his contacts with the russians question do you believe that sessions needs to come back before congress and correct the record on his testimony graham well this is getting a bit old with jeff sessions i like him a lot he aposs a dear friend i think he aposs very qualified for the job but i ask a question did anybody ever talk to you about talking to the russians i didn apost ask about collusion so we now know that somebody at a meeting mr papadopoulos raise the idea of meeting with putin there aposs nothing wrong with trump meeting with putin if he wanted to it would be wrong to have the russians help the trump campaign or the or hillary clinton aposs campaign and here aposs what nobody talks about the russians manipulated comey in getting involved into the election it was russian information that comey used to jump into the middle of the 2016 election not a meeting between lynch and president clinton on the tarmac but when it comes to jeff sessions jeff you need to tell us everything you know about russia so yes he probably should come back and answer the question yet again did you know anything about an effort by the trump campaign to meet with russia not just collude with russia wallace i aposve got 30 seconds final question do you still have full confidence in jeff sessions as attorney general graham i have confidence in jeff that he can adjust his policies but if we don apost adjust our policies at the department of justice regarding how to handle terror suspects and soldiers of the caliphate i will lose that confidence we missed two opportunities to hold two terrorists as enemy combatants to gather valuable intelligence about the war on terror and we blew it and i hold the people at the department of justice and the department of defense accountable for that wallace senator graham thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir graham thank you wallace up next special counsel robert mueller aposs russia probe starts with two indictments and one guilty plea we aposll ask our sunday panel who aposs next commercial break begin video clip trump i am not supposed to be involved with the justice department i aposm not supposed to be involved with the fbi i aposm not supposed to be doing the kind of things that i would love to be doing and i aposm very frustrated by it end video clip wallace president trump making it clear he aposs not satisfied with the way his prosecutors and investigators are doing their jobs and we aposre back now with the panel well karl i was thinking back the bush 43 white house that you were part of got in trouble for making what turned out to be a completely legal move to dismiss seven u s attorneys around the country what do you make of the president aposs comments this week in effect challenging his justice department and the fbi to go after hillary clinton karl rove fox news contributor i think it aposs unseemly and more than that i think it aposs dangerous i think it aposs dangerous for our country to get in the habit of where it looks like the political winners direct their departments of justice to go after their political opponents and political the people they defeated at the polls i think it aposs dangerous for president trump because look this simply once you unsheathe this particular weapon you can never sheath it again imagine what would happen if a democratic congress got in a democrat majority in the house and senate and used their disagreements with political disagreements with the president to push for impeachment you know and also it looks like he aposs got something to hide leave this whole thing alone move on be the president of the united states focus on the big things and leave it to the justice department to make a conscious decision whether they ought to i aposm confident mueller is looking at some of these questions i aposm confident the justice department is looking at some of these questions leave it over there don apost have the president engage with it wallace juan let me take the counter side of the argument the president does nominate he aposs subject to senate confirmation he does nominate the attorney general the justice department is part of his administration if there have been violations of the law and you just heard lindsey graham say there have been violations of the law by the clintons some of these deals uranium one the gps fusion why not say to them take a look juan williams fox news political analyst well this is an authoritarian instinct so i think karl was exactly right when he says you don apost punish your political opponents by putting the mechanism of law enforcement on them without saying hey there has to be a real basis this is a law enforcement decision this is not a political act and you don apost go after the courts or the military courts in terms of some of the criticism we aposve had this week without understanding you aposre undermining something that is core to america which is our law enforcement system and that aposs what he aposs doing by trying to pressure attorney general sessions into taking an act against hillary clinton now with regard to the dossier and this is a and fusion gps this has a total false equivalency there is nothing equivalent between opposition research which is totally legal and potentially colluding with a hostile foreign state to interfere with an american election wallace well go ahead karl wait a minute wait a minute they the democratic national committee hired a firm that paid money to a british spy in order to contact his russian counterparts williams no karl his russian contracts williams no karl to collect bad stuff on donald williams no karl absolutely williams no no not at all karl there aposs i mean williams one is a russian government karl well wait who do you think he was talking to who do you think the former british spy was talking to williams and but but the point is it aposs a now karl karl the russians not the russian government necessarily wallace well he was talking to people that were russians wallace does it does it what aposs the difference what aposs the difference cross talk williams but karl one is foreknowledge karl oh please juan please williams one is foreknowledge of working with the russian government karl please this is embarrassing williams if i aposll tell you what aposs embarrassing is the manipulation karl inaudible paying money to a british spy to talk to to inaudible checks williams let me finish this point let me allow me allow me to finish this point wallace briefly because i want to move on to something else williams one one is a matter of total distraction diversion from the russian probe put up like a smoke screen by the trump administration and by his stooges in the congress rove it is not appropriate for american political parties to be paying money to acquire information from the agents of foreign governments period williams they weren apost they were paying fusion gps which is an american company wallace wait wait wait timeout meanwhile special counsel robert mueller made the first big salvo of his probe let aposs take a look at that announcing charges against two top trump campaign officials paul manafort and rick gates and that a foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi here was the response from white house spokesperson sarah huckabee sanders begin video clip sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary today aposs announcement has nothing to do with the president it has nothing to do with the president aposs campaign or campaign activity the real collusion scandal as we aposve said several times before has everything to do with the clinton campaign fusion gps and russia end video clip wallace jason what kind of statement do you think robert mueller made in terms of the nature the strength the momentum of this probe with what happened this week jason riley the wall street journal i think the statement he made was i aposm just getting started i think it aposs got a couple indictments now he aposs got a guilty conviction i think what he aposs going to do is squeeze now he wants the people he aposs indicted and the person who has already pled guilty to talk about other people higher up the food chain and so forth so i think that is that is the message and again we say it a lot the president is helping himself or not by publicly commenting on the investigation i mean what we aposve seen in the cases of the court response to his executive actions is often turning his words back on him so i think the lesson from that would be to just say let the let the investigation play out but i think this is going to be a headache for the administration for the foreseeable future wallace rachael what was the reaction from people you talked to on capitol hill were republicans did they did they get the sense this president is going to have a problem and may be in trouble or gee it aposs not as bad as we thought rachael bade politico it was particularly surprising i think the democratic reaction and it aposs kind of muted we didn apost hear a lot of calls for impeachment following these indictments of papadopoulos wallace well that would be utterly premature bade and it sounds like nancy pelosi has been doing her best behind closed doors to tamp this down and because she doesn apost want to overplay her cards here republicans i think just yesterday we saw conservatives drop a bill calling for mueller to step aside and that leads me to one thing we aposre going to be watching in the coming weeks is does congress move to try to protect mueller right now the answer is no even though they have bipartisan legislation in the senate that would make sure that the president cannot get rid of mueller mitch mcconnell wallace paul ryan made pretty clear bade right wallace he aposs not going to play that game bade right they feel like the president won apost go there they have an assurance privately that he aposs not going to do this however i aposm wondering if this is sort of misplaced confidence at this point in time we know that steve bannon has been talking to the president about going after mueller we also know that conservatives inaudible the wall street journal said something about it this week as well there aposs definitely a brewing storm right now around mueller and so we aposll have to watch wallace twenty seconds karl your read on this first week rove i think it is the beginning but i also think it aposs a rapid beginning which is a good sign i think he aposs going to wrap this thing up quicker than we might expect there aposs more to more to be done but look if if there was collusion if there was something there i think we would have had a bigger hit that these things that were done with manafort involved things that after a couple of happened end a couple years ago and papadopoulos is a flimflam artist not at the center of the campaign wallace flimflam artist i don apost think i aposve ever heard that on fox news sunday thank you panel see you next sunday but we aposll say it again up next our power player of the week mark cuban on the secrets of his success and the lure of politics commercial break wallace a billionaire businessman goes on reality tv and becomes a star and then he toys with the idea of

meanwhile he aposs busy learning about artificial intelligence and thinking how he can add to his portfolio of more than 150 companies cuban but i know that there aposs some 12 year old kid somewhere that aposs trying to do the same thing and that gets me fired up
