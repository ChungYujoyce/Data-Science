coordinator for coronavirus response told reporters thurday what we are trying to do is utilize a very laser focused approach rather than an generic horizontal approach she said birx acknowledged concerns that people could simply move between areas with different infection risks and potentially different restrictions on movement and gathering amid the outbreak part of this will be the need to
