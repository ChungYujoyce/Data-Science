apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap the box of white tissues stood by two seats to maria yovanovitch s right as she told the world about being shocked appalled devastated that the president had badmouthed her after firing her as ambassador to ukraine but yovanovitch stayed a picture of soft spoken reserve even as her former boss disparaged her again in real time during her solo testimony in the house s impeachment proceedings it s very intimidating she said of president donald trump s tweet which was displayed on screens in the hearing room whatever the president s intent the moment seemed consistent with yovanovitch s account that she was kneecapped by a smear campaign then ousted as trump and his allies pushed ukraine to investigate joe biden and his son top

all including illegal aliens it was also hard not to notice that trump who has an extensive history of putting down women who challenge him had abstained from attacking a pair of tweedy male diplomats who had told a similar story wednesday but when yovanovitch who usually goes by masha sat at the same witness table and relayed her experience trump fired off a tweet that weaponized her three decade record of diplomatic postings everywhere marie yovanovitch went turned bad trump wrote in part referencing somalia the first of her 13 assignments yovanovitch 60 shrugged and smiled well she said i don t think i have such powers not in mogadishu and some other places by the end of the day the dark suited career diplomat and daughter of immigrants who fled the former soviet union and nazi germany had her own twitter hashtag and her version of a mic drop moment it was far from the first time yovanovitch felt threatened by trump and his associates according to her testimony but democrats conducting impeachment proceedings against the nation s 45th president said his tweets amounted to evidence of witness intimidation potentially for a separate article of impeachment republicans too were stunned by trump s tweet and declined to defend it if they were willing to talk about it at all the president s going to defend himself said rep lee zeldin r n y the house s no 3 republican said trump had been wrong yovanovitch clearly is somebody who s been a public servant to the united states for decades and i don t think the president should have done that said rep liz cheney r wyo for her part yovanovitch offered chilling detail about the lead up to her firing in which she said she felt pressured to put out public shows of support for trump and got none in return she said she was told during a 1 a m phone call from a state department official to return to the united states on the next plane because of concerns from up the street which she believed to mean the white house she said deputy secretary of state john sullivan told her the president had lost confidence in her secretary of state mike pompeo sullivan said was no longer able to protect her from attacks led by trump s personal attorney rudy giuliani but months after her firing yovanovitch said she felt alarmed again as she read a transcript of trump s july 25th phone call on it he asked ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy for the favor of the investigations trump also made clear that yovanovitch though gone was very much on his mind the woman trump said according to a rough transcript released by the white house she s going to go through some things it was a terrible moment yovanovitch recalled friday someone who watched her read the white house s rough transcript told her that the color drained from my face i think i even had a physical reaction it sounded she said like a threat in private testimony she had grown emotional retelling the story and at one point agreed to take a break that didn t happen friday so there was no need for tissues but yovanovitch made clear she was still unnerved by the ordeal it s hard to believe she said the president would talk to any ambassador like that to a foreign head of state and it was me watching from the rows reserved for the public were some women from long island who had taken the train to washington to see the proceedings firsthand when yovanovitch was done schiff delivered a stemwinder of a closing statement telling her you were viewed as an obstacle that had to go he gaveled the proceedings which had stretched over six hours to a close republicans shouted for his attention but schiff walked out members of the public jumped to their feet and applauded yovanovitch as she her lawyers and others in her retinue stood yovanovich heard the hoots and looked over her shoulder then she smiled and headed out a side door her turn in the public eye complete it touched my soul the way schiff just ended it said ann orton of northport new york a retired teacher who took the train to the hearings with two friends i wanted to cheer her friend cathy benjamin of bay shore said it was yovanovitch who had moved her having to
