apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic defense secretary nominee ashton carter told the senate committee on armed services that an act of cyberwarfare is defined as a cyberattack on critical infrastructure the economy or u s military operations however mr carter said he did not think the north korean cyberattack against sony pictures entertainment reached the level of an act of war i believe that what is termed an act of war should follow the same practice as in other domains because it is the seriousness not the means of an attack that matters most he said in written answers to questions posed by the committee and released wednesday whether a particular attack is considered an act of war in or out of cyberspace requires a determination on a case by case and fact specific basis top stories gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning trump says

saudi arabia grows a recent terrorist attack by the islamic state on a saudi border post with iraq highlights the danger that the oil rich kingdom could become a target of attacks according to a state department report the attack follows already growing concerns that the risk of terrorism in saudi arabia may be increasing states the report by the research unit of the overseas security advisory council a state department security partnership with u s companies al qaeda s persistent interest in attacking the kingdom paired with a string of recent incidents and growing instability in the region raises the possibility that the relative quiet of recent years could give way to an elevated terrorism threat the islamic state attack took place jan 5 at the suwief border post 25 miles from the town of arar in iraq s western anbar province the militants carried out a rifle assault and suicide bomb attack that killed two saudi border guards and their commanding officer a general saudi authorities later arrested three saudis and four syrians who were linked to the attack the report says that saudi counterterrorism capabilities have improved in the past 10 years the persistent intent and evolving capabilities of terrorist groups highlights a concern for those operating in country u s businesses have expressed worries about growing terrorism threats but have not taken measures to increase security the jan 29 report by the osac research and information support center states the islamic state threat to the kingdom is made worse by the continuing threat from al qaeda in the arabian peninsula which conducted numerous internal attacks in the 2000s targeting saudi government and economic interests as well as western interests in saudi arabia there were six terrorist attacks from 2005 to 2011 down from 30 in 2004 after a riyadh crackdown today aqap and isil remain interested in targeting saudi arabia highlighted by recent statements and activities says the report using an acronym for the islamic state the al qaeda group attacked a saudi guard post on the border with yemen last year killing four saudi guards and five militants in november islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi issued a speech calling for terrorists to attack saudi arabia the report notes a string of incidents over the past several months that indicate terrorists are stepping up or planning attacks they include an incident in october in which three employees of a u s defense firm were fired upon killing one and wounding another and an islamic state assault in november against a shiite mosque in eastern saudi arabia also in november a danish national was injured in a shooting claimed by the islamic state near the saudi capital riyadh and the stabbing of a canadian in dhahran the report warns that some 1 000 foreign fighters returned to saudi arabia after the fall of the taliban in 2003 and many took part in terrorist support networks in the kingdom saudi nationals have had a high foreign fighter presence the report says noting that 1 200 to 2 500 saudis have taken part in the syrian conflict on the side of rebels the saudi contingent of foreign fighters in syria is one of the highest percentages of any single country the report says that about 25 percent of those syrian fighters have returned home the recent paris attack by jihadis linked to syria is a sign that the threat should be taken seriously the report says saudi arabia is taking part in coalition military operations against the islamic state and thus could become an increasing target of the group s attacks the saudis are setting up a 600 mile long wall on the iraqi border composed of a ditch and triple layered steel fencing with some 40 watchtowers and electronic surveillance radar a similar wall was set up on the southern border with yemen in 2013 troops have reportedly been issued orders to shoot on sight anyone seen breaching the border the report says dia china threat significant

think that they are designing their forces to challenge military presence of the united states in the region he added they have fairly sophisticated missile systems that can counter a number of our platforms i think both china training and some of their weapons capability is a significant threat to our forces the three star general said he did not believe the united states is losing its technological edge to china but i do believe china has a concerted effort to as much as possible gather intellectual property to close the gap between our technological edge and their capability he said i do not believe at this point that we are losing our technological edge but it is at risk based on some of their cyberactivities last week frank kendall undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics told the same house committee that china s new precision weapons and other advanced arms capability are undermining u s military superiority we re at risk and the situation is
