the heavily guarded demilitarized zone that separates north and south korea shook hands with mr kim and said it was a great honor to cross the border as he did so both leaders agreed to resume stalled talks aimed at compelling pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons and missile systems i think it s historic it s a great day for the world mr trump said see also trump becomes first sitting u s president to enter north korea mr kim dressed in his typical mao suit greeted mr trump warmly he told the president that he never expected to meet you at this place meeting at such a place shows that we are willing to put an end to the unfortunate past and also open a new future he said through an interpreter it was their first face to face meeting since a second summit fell apart in hanoi vietnam in february the president walked away from that meeting because the north koreans demanded sweeping sanctions relief in exchange for only a limited commitment to destroy part of their nuclear arsenal at the yongbyon nuclear complex see also unlike obama south koreans impressed by trump s efforts to reach peace mr trump hinted at a softening of that approach the sanctions remain but at some point during the negotiations things can happen the president said we re not looking for speed we re looking to get it right we re on a very good path based on the impromptu meeting at the dmz secretary of state mike pompeo said stephen e biegun the u s special representative for north korea will conduct talks with his north korean counterparts by mid july he said the parties are not starting at square one despite the narrative that both sides are stuck even in hanoi we made progress so we think we do have a jumping off point for these discussions which will put us in a place where we can truly evaluate if there s a clear path forward mr pompeo told reporters on his plane having listened to chairman kim today i think there is he added we thought there might be this opportunity and the president by getting together with chairman kim today broke through and was able to get us the opportunity to get back to the negotiating table gen robert b abrams commander of u s forces korea said the mission remains the same while diplomacy unfolds we have to maintain our edge he told soldiers at osan air base south of seoul we ve got to be ready to fight tonight in the u s democratic presidential candidates belittled mr trump s effort a spokesman for former vice president joseph r biden said the president fawned over mr kim mr biden also criticized mr trump for coddling dictators on his five day trip rep tim ryan of ohio called the president s trip an appeasement tour he compared mr trump s meeting with mr kim to british prime minister neville chamberlain going to talk to hitler and making concessions before the start of world war ii sen bernard sanders of vermont had no objection to the meeting i have no problem with him sitting down with kim jong un in north korea or anyplace else but i don t want it simply to be a photo opportunity mr sanders told abc news mr trump risks legitimizing a ruthless strongman who many say will never give up his nuclear ambitions mr kim recently tested short range missiles and a failed summit or provocation that could harm the u s would damage mr trump on the cusp of his reelection campaign the unexpected round of diplomacy came after mr trump announced on social media while attending the group of 20 summit in japan that he hoped mr kim would meet him at the dmz the north korean leader said he was surprised by mr trump s public overture the two leaders met at the truce village of panmunjom where the armistice was signed to pause the korean war in 1953 after they shook hands across the boundary line mr trump walked about 20 steps into the north with mr kim igniting a media frenzy as u s journalists shouted at north korean photographers to stop blocking their view of the action the two leaders then returned to the demarcation line and the president asked mr kim a question would you like to come over mr trump asked gesturing to the south mr kim agreed and walked into the freedom house building with mr trump on the south korean side they spoke for a total of 66 minutes signaling they had more on their minds than a photo op handshake they emerged with the commitment to restart nuclear talks mr trump said north koreans on site were in tears as he crossed the border it was the third encounter between the two men after a pair of summits that forged a personal bond but failed to produce a pact that deals with mr kim s nuclear and missile systems we re all in this together we want to get this thing solved he told cheering u s soldiers at osan the president even said he would like to invite mr kim to the white house mr trump exchanged warm letters with mr kim before this visit to asia giving south korean president moon jae in hope that he could seize on that momentum to advance the korean peace process mr moon who met with mr trump in seoul played the role of mediator over the weekend he is urging mr trump to be flexible because he has tied his own legacy to making progress on korean peace you really are the peacemaker of the korean peninsula mr moon told mr trump mr moon also joined mr trump at the dmz which is 160 miles long and 2 5 miles wide previous u s presidents including barack obama have visited the dmz to reaffirm the u s south korean alliance though mr trump is the first to use the backdrop as an embrace of the north president clinton once dubbed it the scariest place on earth some folks in south korea weren t happy cho won jin the leader of the far right our republican party said regime change is the only way to solve the north korea problem he said mr trump was making a mistake by agreeing to a trilateral visit at the dmz he said mr moon s progressive government is socialist and an unreliable partner with america we oppose president trump meeting kim jong un at the dmz he told the washington times late saturday it is very dangerous for president trump to take mr moon s side by late sunday however mr trump was on a victory lap saying mr moon called him on the way to osan he s so happy mr trump said he s so thrilled it was mr trump s second rescue of stalled major negotiations on his trip at the g 20 summit in osaka japan on saturday he agreed with
