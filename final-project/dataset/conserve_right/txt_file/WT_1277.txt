apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic buenos aires the collateral damage can t be worse than the disease our mission is to save lives without neglecting jobs hydroxychloroquine seems pretty effective what may sound like a donald trump press briefing from a month ago when u s deaths from covid 19 had barely topped double digits was actually brazilian president jair bolsonaro last week as his country logged its 200th fatality from the viral disease for weeks mr bolsonaro has not just downplayed but outright dismissed the covid 19 pandemic as a little flu that view that has put the trump of the tropics a moniker the maverick conservative former legislator embraces on a crash course with key governors congress and much of his own cabinet top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots mr bolsonaro s vice president gen hamilton mourao publicly contradicted his boss call to defy mass confinement sao paulo gov joao doria a political rival was less subtle he said the president lacked the mental fitness to lead the country mr bolsonaro s address to the nation on march 31 was his most subdued yet the virus is a reality and our generation s greatest challenge he acknowledged at one point a day later though the leader of south america s most populous nation again lashed out at governors who on their own have decreed commercial lockdowns and mandatory social distancing following the lead of brazil s major south american neighbors argentina peru and colombia into a national quarantine thus seems out of the question and as late as last week his administration hammered home the bolsonaro coined slogan brazil can t stop with a near 1 million advertising campaign on monday brazil s reported cases of covid 19 were a tiny fraction of those in the u s 11 516 positive cases 506 deaths and 127 patients who have recovered but the curve has been climbing sharply since the last week of march and public health professionals say there has likely been severe underreporting of cases in brazil s vast urban areas and poor crowded favelas as elsewhere brazilian health officials are warning of a looming lack of hospital beds masks testing devices and trained staff the associated press reported friday as with mr trump brazil s president says a collapse of the economy presents its own health risks and that a rational balance must be struck his dual mission the nominally independent former army captain insists is saving both lives and jobs what about the peddler the hawker the meat skewer vendor the day laborer the bricklayer s mate the truck driver and others who are self employed he wondered aloud in his televised address instructing his cabinet to do all it can to minimize layoffs but his fiercely loyal base notwithstanding many brazilians are turned off by a president whom they view as a politically isolated coronavirus denier for more than two weeks thousands of residents across the country s major cities have been banging pots and pans in protest every night leaders across the world have faced agonizing choices over whether when and how long to shut down normal life in hopes of containing the contagion but even given the varied strategies and urgency with which major countries have fought covid 19 brazil under mr bolsonaro stands out as an outlier economic fallout his handling of the coronavirus crisis widely ridiculed and decried as irresponsible in equal measure by critics seems to be driven by fears of how the economic side effects of mitigation measures will affect his political prospects president bolsonaro has had a total obsession with his reelection from his first day in office said former ambassador paulo roberto de almeida who until last year led the brazilian foreign ministry s ipri think tank in an ironic twist the president s reluctance to back the coronavirus guidelines issued by his own health minister physician luiz henrique mandetta may have worsened the economic damage it caused many difficulties in the field of health mr de almeida said so there were shocks following the recommendations of the health ministry which in turn had an economic impact in another striking parallel with the u s dr mandetta has emerged as brazil s equivalent of dr anthony fauci dr mandetta s daily briefings heavy on science and infection avoiding advice have become popular among ordinary brazilians but have sparked tensions with the president mr bolsonaro recently remarked that his health minister at times lacked humility but what looks at times like self sabotage on mr bolsonaro s part could also be an exercise in positioning allowing him down the road to shift away blame for the inevitable economic fallout said jornal do brasil editor clovis saint clair the author of one of the few book length profiles of the 65 year old president for better or worse the population is heeding the health ministry s appeal for social distancing mr saint clair said but this will give him a chance to say it s not his problem that it was state and local governments that were in favor of social distancing whatever mr bolsonaro s rationale his comments have drawn harsh condemnation from dozens of professional medical associations and a rebuke from the government run national health council which labeled them an affront that put thousands of lives at risk but there are some including some physicians who empathize with mr bolsonaro and appreciate his overall approach maria luiza moretti an infectious disease physician at the university of campinas hospital acknowledged the pressure and crosscurrents mr bolsonaro is facing i understand the president s position she said people aren t working companies aren t producing selling in the short term there s a limit to how much time we can keep that up a former president of the sao paulo state infectious disease society dr moretti and her team have been preparing for the coronavirus onslaught since january as such she noted she was not sure what to make of mr bolsonaro s endorsement of hydroxychloroquine as a possible cure for covid 19 we don t have scientific data anywhere in the world that would justify the routine use of the drug she said still mr bolsonaro has ordered brazilian military labs to churn out 1 million doses of the anti malaria drug and ms moretti conceded it might encourage patients with otherwise limited treatment options truly needed though is authoritative information and an end to the government infighting which further befuddles a spooked population she said beating the establishment mr de almeida and mr saint clair were not hopeful that such calls would be heeded or that rumors about the imminent dismissal of dr mandetta and other key cabinet members would be quelled anytime soon mr bolsonaro again like mr trump won election by defeating the establishment powers in brazil s political system with a political base that does not depend on support in brasilia the next general elections are not scheduled until october 2022 he sees all others as adversaries competitors even his own ministers mr de almeida said he added that mr bolsonaro was increasingly under the spell of his adult sons particularly eduardo a congressman and flavio a senator and his social media hate cabinet the most potent force in his life are his sons said mr saint clair who in turn are being counseled by extreme right wing groups none of this sits particularly well with voters and opinion polls suggest that mr bolsonaro has lost the middle class backing that propelled him to power in late 2018 rational bolsonaro supporters have been shocked by his attitude mr de almeida said those who hope that the trump of the tropics will imitate his american original and accept that brazil too will have to do whatever it takes to curb the coronavirus should not hold their breaths bolsonaro has this bipolar characteristic mr de almeida said that makes him heed reasonable recommendations one day and return
