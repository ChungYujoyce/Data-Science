wallace and hello again from fox news in washington after almost two months of lockdown the u s is slowly coming out of the worst of the covid 19 pandemic the nation now tops more than 1 4 million cases of the coronavirus but some 48 states have at least partially reopened for business and recreation and president trump has launched operation warp speed to find and distribute a vaccine by years end in a moment we aposll speak with former cdc director dr tom frieden about where we are in dealing with the virus but first let aposs bring in david spunt with the latest on the reopenings around the country david david spunt fox news correspondent chris good morning president trump is at camp david this weekend on the agenda vaccine development but any sustainable vaccine is months away and many americans are tired of waiting begin videotape spunt the sun is out and so are thousands of restless americans hoping for a sense of normalcy unidentified male i don apost want to go home and i want to be out in the sun all day spunt beaches and boardwalks on both sides of the country slowly reopening in new jersey and maryland families flocked to the water greeted by social distancing signs the crowds are a welcome sight to small business owners in the red since february unidentified male we aposve been closed for probably the last what two and a half months so extensively yes we got hurt spunt in new york governor andrew cuomo announced beaches will open next weekend for memorial day but crowds headed to the beach anyway ignoring the social distancing guidelines trump thank you very much spunt on friday in the rose garden president trump launched operation warp speed a plan to develop a sustainable coronavirus vaccine in record time the operation brings together the private sector military and the department of health and human services the timeline is ambitious the white house hoping to have 100 million doses by fall and triple that number by january trump nobody has seen anything like we aposre doing now within our country since the second world war end videotape spunt so americans would have access to a vaccine even if it aposs developed first by china chris this comes just days after the department of homeland security and fbi warned that china is actively hacking united states vaccine research chris wallace david spunt reporting from the white house david thank you joining us now former cdc director dr tom frieden doctor where are we with this virus now are we past the peak and your predecessor in the job the current cdc director dr robert redfield tweeted this on friday based on 12 different forecasting models we will see deaths exceeding 100 000 by june 1 that aposs just two weeks from now what do you think dr tom frieden former cdc director well i said the same thing about two weeks ago in my testimony in congress tragically this is a really bad virus and we are just at the beginning we aposre in different places in different parts of the country in new york city where i am today and where i live we are at the end of the beginning in some other places of the country it hasn apost yet hit in full force the bottom line chris is that the safer we start the sooner we can reopen our economy we start safer we reopen sooner wallace you say we aposre just at the beginning but people are already talking about a second wave either next fall or next winter dr rick bright who was one of the administration aposs top experts on vaccines who has been moved out of that job and is now a whistle blower he testified about the second wave this week take a look begin video clip dr rick bright former top vaccine official there aposll be likely a resurgence of covid 19 this fall it will be greatly compounded by the challenges of seasonal influenza without better planning 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history end video clip wallace dr frieden is rick bright correct frieden no one can predict with certainty what aposs going to happen with this virus it aposs a new virus we think it may spread a little bit less in warmer weather that could help us but i think it aposs not right to think of a second wave unfortunately we aposre likely to see multiple waves in different parts of the country we know that this can spread explosively if it gets out of control that aposs why we have to be so careful we aposre all tired of waiting at home we want to get out i want to get back to the gym we want to get back to our lives we want to get our economy back but at the same time if we go too fast it will backfire and we can see explosive spread that could bring us back in fundamentally it aposs not just a lockdown that are keeping us at home it aposs the virus the virus is the enemy here and you know chris yogi berra said if people don apost want to go to the ballpark how are you going to stop them if people aren apost feeling safe going out they are not going to go to dine to eat to shop and do other things that aposs why it aposs so important that to get our economy back soon we start safe wallace well you say start safe as we just said 48 states have reopened to some degree some businesses some parks and beaches do you think we aposre moving too soon to reopen frieden out of doors is great there aposs very very low risk of spread out of doors so by all means go out take a walk bicycle enjoy nature it aposs good for you it aposs good for your health and there are some businesses that are essential and there aposs some business that can start with minimal risk there were other things that are going to be harder to do without without a lot of safety measures so we aposre going to see not shaking hands for a while we aposre going to see using hand sanitizer a lot we aposre going to see face masks where it aposs spreading widely where you aposre within six feet to someone especially if you aposre indoors there are things that we can do so that we can start this safer it doesn apost mean you have to stay home forever it does mean we have to be careful because if you get the virus it aposs not just about you getting sick you could without feeling sick spread it to your neighbor aposs kid who has leukemia and they could get deathly ill we aposre all in this together we aposre fighting a virus that is a really difficult enemy to fight and it aposs still out there it aposs going to be there the more we aposre safe from this virus actually the more we aposll be safe from flu as well those things we do to physically distance those are going to cut down our flu level as well and if everybody gets the flu vaccine this fall that will be helpful too just keep in mind this is a lot worse than the flu this is ten times deadlier it spreads much more readily it aposs more likely to kill you and we don apost have any immunity naturally and we don apost yet have a vaccine wallace well i want to pick up on this question of where we are in the virus and the question of reopening because we aposve heard two very different arguments this week from president trump and from dr anthony fauci here they are begin video clip dr anthony fauci national institute of allergy infectious diseases there is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control donald trump president of the united states look he wants to play all sides of the equation end video clip wallace i want to point to a specific state because there was a lot of criticism when georgia and its governor brian kemp reopened a few weeks ago and they reopen salons and gyms even got criticism from president trump that it was moving too fast but we have not seen the kind of spike that was widely feared with that reopening in georgia which raises the question are some public health experts i aposll include you in that are you being too alarmist about this frieden i don apost think you can be too alarmist about what this virus can do look at new york city over the past two months more than 20 000 deaths from this virus it aposs really been catastrophic but it is important to recognize that there are things we can do to go out more safely and i have friends in georgia still and they described to me physical distancing in shops people being very careful that aposs important also keep in mind the virus mutates it changes it evolves but fundamentally when it begins the spread again you won apost see that for a few weeks because it takes about a week to get sick and another week to get very sick and then you make other people sick so once there is the resumption of spread you might not see that for a month or two there aposs a lag here wallace on friday as we reported president trump announced operation warp speed an effort to marshal the government private companies the military to develop a vaccine and 200 million doses by the end of this year how realistic is that two hundred million doses of a proved safe vaccine by the end of the year frieden well it is absolutely the right thing to do to pull out all the stops to try to make a safe and effective vaccine and we all hope it will be available as soon as possible just keep in mind vaccine is complicated you have to prove it safe you have to prove it aposs effective you have to make huge quantities you have to figure out the doses of one dose or two how much of it you have to figure out who gets it first health care workers would be first in line and you got have to get it out there and explain to people what it is monitor to see if there are adverse reactions so absolutely a vaccine is the single most important weapon we could develop against this virus but we don apost have one yet we hope we will we hope it will be soon but we cannot count on it that aposs why we need to get used to the fact that the virus is here for a while we aposre going to change what we do so that we can restart our economy and our society as soon and safely as possible wallace well i want to pick up on that because the president said while he aposs pushing for a vaccine the country is coming back regardless take a look begin video clip trump you know it aposs not solely vaccine based other things have never had a vaccine and they go away i just want to make something clear it aposs very important vaccine or no vaccine we aposre back end video clip wallace can covid 19 just to go away as the president said and how back to normal back to normal i understand we can reopen some but how back to normal can we get without a vaccine frieden it aposs unlikely that the vac that the virus would simply disappear that would be unusual based on what we aposve seen in 200 countries around the world but we don apost know how it will behave over the summer we don apost know how long it will persist and what will happen with it no one can predict with certainty but one thing that is highly likely is that we will be coming to a new normal things will be different we won apost be shaking hands for a while we aposll be using lots of hand sanitizer we aposll be safe whenever we can be our health care system needs to get a lot safer not just for covid but for other infections as well we aposll be traveling less we aposre going to see challenges with different countries not letting people in or having quarantines and we aposre likely to continue to have outbreaks in places like nursing homes which are as i said more than two months ago ground zero for this we are going to see unfortunately thousands of deaths but we can save a lot of lives if we focus on being in this together there is only one enemy here chris it aposs the virus we aposre all in it together and the more we aposre safe the more we work together it aposs not about economy versus health if people are poor they aposre less likely to be healthy and unless we control the virus we aposre not going to get our economy back so we aposre in it together against the virus wallace dr frieden dr frieden i aposve got about a minute left and i aposve got a final question as far back as i can remember the cdc has always been the lead agency in health crisis like this i remember when you were there and there were various pandemics ebola things like that i would be talking to you as the lead person for the cdc and the lead person for the administration this time it seems like the cdc has been sidelined to some degree they have not had a public briefing and more than two months one do you agree that the cdc that its role has been diminished and do you think that is reasonable or do you think that aposs a mistake frieden i will personally feel safer when cdc is speaking regularly to the american people they are the world aposs experts in this no other doctor no other agency in the u s government has the depth and breath of expertise of cdc they continue to do great work and in fact americans are voting with their clicks they have been more than 1 2 billion clicks on the cdc website and it aposs still the best place to go for objective information advice recommendations on how to protect yourself your family your community wallace so frieden so i hope we aposll be hearing more from the cdc wallace so very briefly so briefly do you think it aposs been a mistake for this administration to sideline the cdc frieden i think fighting this pandemic without the cdc is like fighting with one arm tied behind your back wallace that aposs brief and direct dr frieden thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir and please stay safe up next the economy has taken a hit not seen since the great depression with another 3 million americans filing for unemployment just this week top investor mohamed el erian joins us to discuss the prospects for an economic comeback commercial break wallace mohamed el erian is an influential voice in the financial world he led pimco for years running the world aposs largest bond fund now he is the chief economic advisor at allianz and he says the economy could look very different as we emerged from the pandemic i sat down with him on friday begin videotape wallace mr el erian new unemployment numbers came in this week just under 3 million and white house economic adviser kevin hassett said while that is a tough number it aposs an indication that the economy is starting to come back here he is begin video clip kevin hassett white house economic adviser i think the fact that we came in under 3 million suggest that the turning on of the economy is beginning and it aposs beginning to show up with the data so what we expect now is that claims will continue to decline as the economy turns back end video clip wallace do you see the jobs picture getting brighter right now mohamed el erian allianz chief economic adviser so it will get brighter in the sense it will get back at a slower rate but we should not forget how bad this picture is with the additional 3 million chris that is 36 million people have signed up on jobless claims for in eight weeks that aposs one quarter of our labor force so it aposs an enormous shock wallace so the consistent forecast from the white house is of a sharp steep quick downturn to be followed in a v shaped by a sharp quick rebound here is president trump on that this week begin video clip trump we aposre going to do well in the fourth quarter and i think next year with all of the stimulus all of the things we aposve done i think we aposre going to have one of the best economic years we aposve ever had end video clip wallace do you see a v shaped recovery as the white house is predicting that the economy is going to come back as quickly and as sharply as it went down el erian i sure hope so but i think it aposs uncertain and it aposs uncertain because both the journey to next year and what next year looks like are uncertain so rather than think of letters think of a pendulum chris we were operating in a normal world as you and i define it we then swung all the way on the other side to a lockdown and now we aposre going to swing back and forth trying to find where the new equilibrium is so it aposs going to be a neat v it aposs going to be more like a series of ws if you like but think of a pendulum swinging and we don apost know the magnitude of the swings and we don apost know the duration of the swing or the settling point so it really is an uncertain outlook wallace i want to pick up on that because you say people are being naive about how easy and quick it is going to be to reopen the economy that we have to deal with health factors and economic factors and even behavioral factors explain what you mean both in terms of this country and globally in reopening the economy el erian so this is the biggest shock we aposve had for generations and it raises three issues one is the main reason for the shock is health and it aposs going to be a long time until you and i trust each other it aposs what eric schmidt calls the information failure it aposs very difficult for me to convince you i aposm healthy and for you to convince me i aposm healthy until we get a vaccine so the health issue doesn apost get resolved overnight secondly you have shaken consumer confidence you have shaken behaviors our economy isn apost wired for social distancing so we aposre going to have to discover how to do that and third businesses it aposs not clear how you restart a business when different states are doing different things and when different countries are going to do different things so we have these three massive uncertainties all in play at the same time and it is very hard to say oh everything is going to be resolved overnight we hope so but i think we should buckle our seat belt that it aposs going to get bumpy still wallace well there was another uncertainty and debate and that is over what to do in washington next democrats want a 3 trillion another huge stimulus bill republicans say let aposs take a pause and see how the money siphons through the economy that aposs been approved so far and this week you had federal reserve chairman jerome powell say that this has been a real economic shock and we do need more stimulus here he is on that begin video clip jerome powell federal reserve chairman while the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large it may not be the final chapter given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks end video clip wallace do you think we need more government stimulus and if so how much and how quickly el erian so so far chris we haven apost had government stimulus we aposve had government relief and it aposs a good thing we have it and it aposs a good thing that washington reacted 5 trillion worth of reaction because despite that this week also gave us not just horrible unemployment number but the worst industrial output collapse in a century and the worst retail sale collapse on record so we are hurting and thank god that washington has reacted on relief measures what aposs important now is not to lose sight of the second phase this is not just about winning the war against the global depression and a u s depression this is about securing the peace about making sure that we emerge from this also strong so the next stage has to also focus on key issues like infrastructure labor retailing and a retooling safety nets things that are going to be critical if we are to bounce back in a sustainable manner otherwise we aposre going to get stuck in a new normal of really mediocre growth and greater social tensions wallace and then there are the financial markets which i think surprised a lot of people by remaining surprisingly strong in fact the markets are up about 25 percent from their bottom in late march you say that the financial markets are in one universe and the real economy is in the different universe what do you mean el erian they aposre looking at different things so you and i in a real economy are wondering when do we get to go back to work when are the stores open again we feel very big disruptions of our everyday life the markets are saying look that aposs fine but that aposs all short term we look to the long term and when they look to the long term they see a win win hypothesis i think they are too optimistic but let me explain what they see first they bet that we aposre going to come back quickly the v and if we come back quickly then looking through which is the phrase you hear the most this awful period is the right thing to do but they have a second win chris if we get that wrong it doesn apost matter because the federal reserve is buying assets and is buying assets that we never imagined it would buy so there is this sense of comfort that you get to win whatever the outlook i think chris that it aposs too optimistic but markets do what they do wallace well i was going to ask you do you think the markets as one of the great investors do you think the markets are going to say stay as strong as they are right now or do you think at some point the two universes are going to collide and reality will intrude el erian so most of us who think fundamentals are important that ultimately you are betting on company aposs profitability and you aposre vetting on the liability of a system are cautious here and we had several warnings from really respected investors but i also understand those who say that aposs fine but you are dinosaurs we are betting on something different we are betting on the federal reserve and if you have a printing press in the basement then you aposre going to have a massive influence on the markets i personally think it aposs easier to make a relative call between different companies i get nervous betting on the overall level of the market right here wallace mohamed el erian thank you so much it is always fascinating to talk to you and to get a little dose of reality thanks so much sir el erian thank you chris end videotape wallace coming up how to make up for lost months in the classroom while still saying safe and how the coronavirus has highlighted the importance of child care to the economy we aposll ask colorado governor jared polis about his plan to reopen schools in the fall that aposs next commercial break wallace coming up governor jared polis on his push to get colorado back to work begin video clip gov jared polis d colorado offices manufacturing salons pretty much all people are back at in a safer way end video clip wallace we aposll ask him about the link between reopening the economy and reopening schools that aposs next commercial break wallace colorado aposs jared polis was one of the first governors to shut down his state but also among the first to reopen before serving as governor he founded schools for at risk students and served as chair of the state board of education and governor polis joins us now from denver governor you said a week ago friday that you expect schools in your state to reopen in class education this fall why are you so confident about that polis i aposm really confident that it aposs a critical part of our society and schools need to function they are going to function it aposs also going to be somewhat of a hybrid environment meaning there might be times during the year if there aposs an outbreak at a school that it has to convert to online for a period of weeks until it aposs reasonably safe to return to school but by and large i think across our state and across our nation kids are going to be able to return to school in the fall it aposs just not going to look like any other school year wallace i want to pick up on that because you say that that school even if you know without the question of having to go back online if there were an outbreak is going to look different that the lunch may look different that going from one class to another in the hallway will look different that there might be staggered start times polis those are exactly some of the things that are being looked at so we call it passing time when all the kids are in the hallway lunchtime the districts are working with our state i know and across the country on schedules that have less interactions that can slow the spread when there aposs an inevitable outbreak it aposs also likely chris and this isn apost a bad thing it aposs a fine thing you know maybe 10 percent 20 percent of parents aren apost going to want their kids to return to school in the fall they aposre going to want to continue online that actually is fine as long as those parents are there with those kids they don apost they don apost have to leave to go to work in addition it means there can be less crowding at the schools because of those individual choices that some parents make to continue with online until it aposs even safer wallace as we said you have quite a resume in education even before you became governor how seriously do you think students will be set back in their education by the fact that at the very least they aposre going to have been out of the classroom from march until august and in some places conceivably longer than that how much do you think that sets them back in basic math and reading skills polis there aposs really no excuses in the business of education i made that very clear to our superintendents i hope other governors across the nation are doing that we aposve moved to online kids can learn as well or better online in fact there aposs been a few percent of kids in online schools before this crisis now you need that social side right and it aposs a little bit harder to get that social side in an online setting but academically there are no excuses for every kid not to be ready to accomplish their grade level work and we can do that online we can do that in schools and we can do it through a hybrid which is what aposs likely to occur this year as while generally schools are open there might need to be periodic regional or site based closures wallace you aposve allowed day care operators licensed day care operators to stay open during this whole period with some tighter restrictions but how much harder do you think having kids at home has made it for parents who work but have to take care of their kids at home i guess what i aposm asking is to what degree do you see a link between reopening schools and reopening the economy polis yeah there aposs a a critical link in colorado it aposs about almost a quarter of our work force that has kids relies on the schools it aposs similar elsewhere you know not everybody has the luxury of having a two parent household where one parent can stay home there aposs many single parents and there aposs many parent families where both parents work and so you need that aposs why we aposve had day care going throughout this entire piece we aposve actually learned a lot from that day care experience that will translate into a safer school experience you know schools are reasonably safe places to be chris and and we always have issues and there aposs always challenges we had a school district in western colorado that had to close for a week because of norovirus about six months ago that was what created vomiting and intense stomach disease and they had to close for about a week to clean that out of their schools so schools are no stranger to this sort of thing it aposs just going to be a bit more prevalent this year and schools are really working hard on making sure their teachers are set up for success in the online environment wallace i want to pick up on that because dr fauci this week in a congressional hearing said we can apost be cavalier about kids apos health in this pandemic with the coronavirus he said one they can catch it two they can spread it and give it to other people and now we aposre hearing very alarming stories not widespread but still out there of some kids coming apparently from the coronavirus to this inflammatory syndrome which raises the question again can they be safe going back you know and it aposs than the norovirus can they be safe going back to school in the midst of this pandemic polis you know all all the medical experts that we aposve consulted with say the concern is less about the kids this is no question from an epidemiological perspective a less severe significantly almost infinitesimal fatality rate for kids but the thing is kids live with parents kids live with grandparents kids are around teachers so that aposs where it gets a little bit more complicated chris you know it aposs is it a risk for kids nothing is risk free but kids encounter all sorts of germs in school this one has a more minor manifestation for 12 year olds 14 year olds and eight year olds although you know it aposs not without any risk but the real risk is parents grandparents and teachers who are of course around their kids all the time wallace i aposve got two more questions i want to squeeze them both in you met with president trump this past week he spoke highly of the job that you aposre doing you spoke highly of the job that he is doing i wonder did you get any pushback from some of your fellow democratic governors maybe people in the biden campaign that perhaps it aposs not too helpful to be praising president trump just months before the presidential election polis well look i happen to be a democrat but what i aposve said is he aposs the president we have and i owe it to the people of my state who elected me to work with any president to really make sure that we can save lives get our economy going in our state we aposre proud to be getting our economy going in a safe reasonably safe way stores have been open for a couple weeks now in most areas of our state we aposre doing this thoughtfully we aposre doing this carefully we value our partnership with the federal government there aposs a time for election there aposs a time for politics this isn apost it it aposs a time for managing managing the crisis together and i aposm doing my best to get it done wallace finally your state just changed the way that you count covid deaths and as a result you lowered the total in colorado from about 1 100 to 878 one why did you change that process of how you count them the criteria for that and two do you think the number of deaths should be a political issue as it seems to be becoming polis no in fact one of the reasons that we wanted to make sure we reported it out in a better way is to inspire confidence so that it wouldn apost be politicized chris these are deaths that should not be politicized the cdc criteria included anybody who has died with covid 19 what the people of colorado and the people of the country want to know is how many people died of covid 19 in our state about 900 have died from covid 19 on their death certificate or from the attending physician about 1 100 have died with it those 200 in the middle it might have been a contributing factor but it wasn apost deemed the sole factor or the only factor in their death i also want to point out chris that of course there aposs likely cases that should be counted as covid deaths that people have missed doctors have missed there aposs probably some of those as well but the numbers are all fairly close whether it aposs 900 or 1 100 in our state you know a few 100 000 across the world we know that this can kill people of all ages it aposs particularly dangerous for people in their 70s and 80s and those with pre existing conditions but it aposs a bad bug wallace governor polis thank you thanks for taking time out of your weekend to talk with us sir polis thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss president trump aposs charge that barack obama and joe biden sought to take down his presidency commercial break begin video clip president donald j trump this was all obama this was all biden these people were corrupt the whole thing was corrupt and we caught them end video clip begin video clip former vice president joseph r biden i thought you asked me whether or not i had anything to do with him being prosecuted wallace ok biden i aposm sorry i i was aware that there was that they asked for an investigation but that aposs all i know about it end video clip wallace president trump calls obama obamagate rather pushing that issue and former vice president joe biden pushing back on one aspect of the alleged scandal that he was part of an effort to target former trump national security adviser general michael flynn time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove pollster and fox news contributor kristin soltis anderson and fox news political analyst juan williams karl is obamagate an effective campaign issue this year do you think the argument that that barack obama and joe biden broke the law to try to hurt his presidency including going after former trump national security adviser michael flynn rove well we don apost know who broke the law but somebody did it is routine and legal for government officials to ask for a name and a confidential classified briefing to be quote unmasked what is illegal is that somebody then leak that name and unfortunately for joe biden the fact is the name of michael flynn as a subject of an investigation was leaked on january 12th the day that he had requested the unmasking of flynn aposs name in a classified report now is this going to be what the election aposs settled on no i don apost think so but it does stink we had the leak the leaking of michael flynn aposs name and we now know in the filing that the department of justice made with the judge the investigation of flynn was closed in december the documents to close it were written up but they were not filed properly and in early january peter strzok tells his lover lisa page the incompetence of our department has saved us i aposve gotten position from the seventh floor meaning james comey the director of the fbi to interview flynn because the paperwork wasn apost properly filed comey meets with president obama tells him that they aposre going to be interviewing flynn but doesn apost give a heads up to his boss secretary a g yates and doesn apost give the defensive briefing to the trump campaign that normally happens when there aposs a counterintelligence and it just goes on and on and it stinks now is it going to settle the election no i don apost think so but it does ask some very serious questions that need to be answered wallace kristen let me pick up on the political impact of that do you see from your polling any sign that swing voters not the trump base who we know is fascinated and outraged by this but the swing voters want to relitigate the russia investigation including the targeting of general flynn anderson it is unlikely that this is what swing voters are interested in relitigating recall however that when president trump was facing impeachment during a moment where there was clear airtime where there really wasn apost much else going on save perhaps the democratic primary you didn apost actually see numbers for president trump moving that much one way or the other if anything he had a slight increase but now you have 88 000 deaths you have 36 million unemployed you have this crisis hanging over everything that is absolutely the number one thing that swing voters are looking for how are you handling this crisis everything else is just noise wallace juan i want you to weigh in on that and i also want you to weigh in on another attack line that the president president trump is using against joe biden that at age 77 he is not up to the job of becoming president i want to play a clip from one of those events from the studio basement in delaware from joe biden aposs home there in which he frankly mixed up the number of lives and jobs lost from this pandemic take a look begin video clip biden we aposre in the middle of a pandemic that has cost us more than 85 000 jobs as of today lives of millions of people millions of people millions of jobs end video clip wallace juan don apost you have to wonder how joe biden after this long layoff shut up shut in in his basement in delaware how he aposs going to do once he gets back on the campaign trail facing voters and also facing questions lot of questions from reporters williams well i think first thing that let me just say chris that with regard to the so called obamagate there is no obamagate president trump himself can apost even say what president trump i aposm sorry what president obama did that was wrong or criminal and if any of us right here on this show lied to the fbi twice plead guilty we aposd be in jail right now right now so i mean i don apost i just think this is a total effort if you aposre thinking of it in strategic terms to distract from the trump administration aposs failed handling of the coronavirus crisis with regard to age i think that president trump turns 74 next month joe biden aposs 77 the only one of them that seems to prefer conspiracy theories and talking about putting disinfectant in your body is president trump not joe biden and with regard to the campaign trail we live in a moment when telework zoom conferences have become the new normal and so far in terms of campaigning fund raising giving interviews wallace right williams joe biden has been doing that from his basement he aposs a good retail politician i aposve seen him out on the stump but i aposm not sure that aposs the reality of how this campaign is going to go forward we aposre not even sure about the conventions at this point wallace right i want to move on to another subject and that was the friday night announcement that president trump is firing the state department inspector general a fellow named steve linick he aposs the fourth independent watchdog the president has dismissed this year linick was reportedly investigating secretary of state pompeo and his wife and the way they were using a government employee for personal chores or business karl one how did bush 43 handle the inspectors general in his administration and are you troubled that president trump seems to be trying to clear the house of the i g s rove well i thought it was interesting in this case that we immediately had two members of the democratic house leadership jump in and say they knew why he had been replaced and accused secretary pompeo of using a government employee for personal chores now we haven apost heard that from the inspector general and if the inspector general had opened such an investigation the new inspector general will be bound by law to continue that investigation so it the president of the united states has the right to remove inspectors general period and if president trump decided that he had no longer had confidence in the inspector general at state he had a right to remove him so i want to see this thing play out but i thought it was a quick drive by slander by the chairman of the house foreign relations committee and others in the democratic leadership and as a result wallace right rove i aposm suspect of the democratic response let aposs see what this how this plays out and what the and if there was a reason if the accusation has got any basis in truth wallace finally there aposs a growing debate in congress and maybe it aposs a sign that the pandemic is lifting a little because we aposre seeing more politics a growing debate in congress about passing another big relief bill republicans say let aposs wait and see how the trillions we aposve already passed go through the economy but on friday night house democrats passed another 3 trillion bill here is house speaker democrat nancy pelosi begin video clip house speaker nancy pelosi d calif now some of the members say let aposs take a pause let aposs take a pause do you think this virus is taking a pause end video clip wallace kristen i aposve got less than a minute left which side do you think has the better argument politically politically i aposm talking about here republicans who say let aposs wait a bit maybe into june or further into the summer or democrats saying we aposve got to keep passing money and helping out americans and businesses anderson americans are are americans are absolutely hurting right now and i think that it aposs important for congress to be taking action along this front however i do think that you aposve had these instances of democrats sort of not making the number one issue the number one issue trying to turn not let a crisis go to waste and so as a result i think republicans are going to have a chance to come back and say look if we aposre going to spend all this taxpayer money trying to help people let aposs do it the right way wallace all right panel thank you see you next sunday up next our power player of the week for two months fans have wanted to see them back in action the driver of the 48 car jimmie johnson talks about nascar aposs return today commercial break wallace nascar is back today the first major live sporting event since the pandemic hit there are no fans in the stands but as the green flag waves the 48 car is there with our power player of the week behind the wheel

nascar aposs return after more than two months away announcer his car number 48 the only number johnson i started racing at five years old on dirt bikes and here i am almost 45 years old 40 years later racing and to have off you know two months during prime racing weather and prime racing time is just completely uncommon to me wallace the cars the speed and the horsepower haven apost changed but there aposs one big difference the stands will be empty johnson i think as competitors will notice more arriving at the track but once we get racing our line of sight really is on the other cars wallace johnson has 83 career wins former president george w bush you aposre leaders on the track and leaders off the track wallace he aposs made several trips to the white house as the nascar cup champion former president barack obama i aposd like to welcome back the six time nascar sprint champion mr jimmie johnson wallace but this spring he and other drivers have been stuck at home entertaining fans with virtual races i aposve got to be careful how i say this you were not the best virtual racer laughter in fact there were some crashes johnson oh lots of crashes yeah i i am not going to pursue a career in virtual racing when this is done wallace today johnson and 35 other drivers hit south carolina aposs legendary darlington raceway with no qualifying runs practice has also been virtual on camera darlington is known as a famously challenging track how much can you prepare for it on a simulator johnson you know the simulators are really great from a visual aspect i would say it probably gets you 80 percent to 90 percent there but that last little bit is what takes you from good to great wallace nascar took special precautions because of the coronavirus during preparations teams wore masks and practiced social distancing and they cut the number of people allowed on the pit crews johnson i won apost have human interaction with my crew they have us separated at track i will see one individual before i get in the car and that aposs the guy that aposs going to put up the window net on my race car before i pull off wallace before the shutdown johnson

racetrack and perform at the highest level get back to victory lane make the playoffs and be the champion in my final season and really have my p
