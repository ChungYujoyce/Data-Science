and residents were shut in roma ladrona rome thieves from the nation such is the old slogan of the northern league the far right party famous for its attacks on the decay and deceit of italy s national government when the country first entered lockdown in early march the league and its leader matteo salvini commanded over 30 per cent of the vote but the sentiment of the slogan is nearly universal the italian state in the eyes of its citizens is a broken machine leaking and spluttering as it moves who can trust those crooks in the capital roma fa schifo rome sucks as with all things coronavirus has radically upended this reputation virtually overnight italians have shifted from dismissive cynicism of their national government to a blind and trusting devotion between february and march approval of prime minister giuseppe conte swung from 44 per cent to over 70 even as his government moved to shut down the country and shut in its residents few asked about democratic process
