apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion there s good reason for all those headlines and media sniping regarding the nba s china brouhaha i had pretty much caved to my inner self to not write about the issue then after reading the stories the thunder struck the lightning bolt americans can be such hypocrites and i couldn t be silent shoosh as big mama would say this is merica and in merica we have the right to free speech top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches we do indeed and that s why houston rockets general manager daryl morey is one of my heroes of the week for tweeting that we americans here and abroad should support the protesters in hong kong demanding the basic human right to speak their minds china is one of those nations that wants everyone to speak from the same script or else mr morey apologized for airing his views online after the nba said he doesn t speak for the league and he doesn t speak for the rockets either in fact the pr mouthpiece for the rockets even shut up two of the league s most prolific players james harden and russell westbrook an on court duo big mama dubbed thundah and lightnin at any rate they were told to shoosh too meanwhile analyst and hall of famer charles barkley who once played for the rockets took on the critics they have billions of dollars at stake he said it s a business decision i understand the nba the players and the owners both got billions of dollars at stake those who do not understand that mr barkley added are idiots and jackasses and fools well that was enough to untie big mama s apron strings and have a one on one with sir charles mr barkley may understand the money thang but he clearly fails to see the impo tant picture charles she said you get to say bout anythin you wanna yet you think tha nba should shoosh what they don t wanna hear that ain t a mer i can and there s the rub mr barkley and others who side with the nba for stuffing cotton in the mouths of officials and players forget not only america s history they forget that schools like auburn university mr barkley s alma mater didn t even integrate until 1968 they also forget or perhaps never learned that the nba itself didn t allow its first black player until 1959 so the problem isn t solely how the chinese government treats its citizens it s how americans treat other americans americans telling other americans to shoosh is un american a violation of the first amendment right to free speech big mama is very mindful of the warnings following 9 11 and the other traumatic incidents if you see something say something that s why she spoke up about the nba china issue and the first word out of her mouth was shoosh she wants to know if you even care about free speech deborah simmons can be contacted at email
