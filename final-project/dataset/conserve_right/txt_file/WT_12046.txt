weapon systems used by the chinese military according to the wisconsin project on nuclear arms control an avic subsidiary china national aero technology import export corp was under u s sanctions in

avic and that the department of defense may not have independent authority to pose a binding objection or block the transaction still the pentagon must advise congress and u s defense contractors and the public to the dangers of such technology transfers mr forbes stated mr forbes also asked mr panetta to review a defense intelligence agency report from oct 7 2011 that said china s civilian aircraft industry is likely to transfer foreign military technology to the chinese military jennifer villarreal a spokeswoman for ge aviation said the venture with china involves civilian avionics technology we are continuing to work with relevant government agencies through the process she said pentagon spokeswoman cheryl irwin said mr kendall has asked mr lambert to look at how national

taiwan to see whether the ruling kuomintang party will retain power or if the opposition democratic progressive party which is despised by beijing will win u s assessments show the race between current president ma ying jeou and democratic progressive party dpp candidate tsai ing wen to be very close with predictions mixed between a ruling party and opposition party victory the election will be held saturday according to the officials beijing has been covertly backing mr ma according to one official beijing has been helping some of the 150 000 taiwanese now working in mainland china to return to taiwan the chinese are calculating that the returning expatriates will vote for mr ma and help re elect the kmt president u s officials also said china s state run media in recent weeks have been stepping up broadcasts that indirectly support the kmt by citing kmt positions in campaign coverage by chinese and hong kong television and other propaganda organs china s communist leaders fear that a win by ms tsai will heighten tensions because of the party s pro independence stance the official suggested that china is helping pay the airfare for the taiwanese who cannot vote with absentee ballots and must be in taiwan to cast their votes both candidates have made gaffes during the campaign that u s officials say have hurt their standing within the taiwan electorate the obama administration claims to be neutral in the vibrant democratic island s presidential race however a senior u s official told the financial times in september that ms tsai during a u s visit left us with distinct doubts about whether she is both willing and able to continue the stability in cross strait relations the region has enjoyed in recent years a defense official told the washington times recently that mr ma has been weak on bolstering the island s defense in the face of a large scale chinese arms buildup he has failed to press the obama administration for more advanced weaponry the official said taiwanese officials denied the claim but it has become a campaign issue the administration agreed recently to sell upgrading packages for f 16 jet fighters but has declined to sell more advanced versions of the jet that the taipei government sought al qaeda secret weapon a new book by financial analyst kevin freeman who told the pentagon that the 2008 financial crisis may have been

was triggered in part by financial subversion carried out by unknown parties such as terrorists or hostile nations the government has been too siloed and too partisan to really address this problem mr freeman told inside the ring everyone has their own narrative and too few have been willing to look at the facts or search for the truth after maybe 200 briefings the vast majority at my own expense only a handful of patriots have been willing to address this he said some don t understand and don t want to deal with it for that reason chinese slbm test update a u s official confirmed the report
