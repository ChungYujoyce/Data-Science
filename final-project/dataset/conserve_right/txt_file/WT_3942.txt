apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap republicans have no unified argument in the impeachment inquiry of donald trump in large part because they can t agree on how best to defend the president or for some if they should that would require a level of consensus that trump s call with the ukraine president was perfect as he insists or it would take a measure of gop independence from trump to suggest there may be a need to investigate instead it s every republican for himself or herself top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century utah sen mitt romney says the president s actions toward ukraine are troubling other republicans say the behavior may raise concerns but it s not impeachable south carolina sen lindsey graham calls the whole impeachment inquiry b s the result is a mishmash of gop commentary spilling from capitol hill that may shield lawmakers for now from risky political choices but leaves them with a disjointed defense of trump as impeachment hearings push into the public realm this coming week it s not good said veteran gop strategist alex conant normally you want to establish the facts get them out on their own terms and build a message around that strategy they re not doing any of that he added it s hard to rally people to your side without a coherent and sustainable message early on as the white house ceded the pr strategy to the president republicans in the house and senate parted ways as they confronted the political threat posed by the democrats impeachment investigation as far back as mid october senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky gathered his gop colleagues in private and offered them advice on impeachment mcconnell told republican senators their best bet was to calibrate their own message about the impeachment inquiry to fit their political situation according to two people familiar with the private meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed door session with a power point presentation mcconnell outlined the process ahead if the investigation moves to a vote in the house and trial in the senate but when it came time to broach what republicans should say about impeachment mcconnell showed a preference for saying as little about it as possible mcconnell suggested a couple of options senators could say they disagreed with the house process he said or they could simply say that as potential jurors in an eventual impeachment trial they wouldn t discuss it according to the people familiar with the meeting it was the kind of political advice one would expect from the risk averse leader as he tries to insulate his 53 seat gop majority including several senators up for reelection in 2020 in states such as maine and colorado where voters are split on trump that s what a good leader does gives them the flexibility they need to respond my problem is given how egregious the president s conduct is he s given them a pass said jim manley a veteran democratic strategist most of these folks have got to know that what the president s doing is wrong but they ve made a cold hearted political decision right now it s best to stick with the president he said at its core the impeachment inquiry is based on what democrats say is an improper quid pro quo a shakedown that trump engaged in during his july 25 phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy according to a white house rough transcript of the call and testimony from several government officials trump was withholding needed military aid the east european ally as he wanted zelenskiy to investigate trump s potential 2020 rival joe biden as well 2016 u s election interference in the house where congressional district boundary lines have been drawn in a way that leaves republicans barely exposed to voters with centrist or left leaning views gop leaders are mounting a more fulsome if shifting defense of trump gop leader kevin mccarthy of california says the president did nothing wrong on the call with zelenskiy and trump s top allies in the house including ohio rep jim jordan the top republican on a committee conducting the impeachment inquiry are leading the daily arguments against speaker nancy pelosi d calif and the democrats jordan is seen as the chief messenger for republicans said one senior house gop aide who was not authorized to publicly discuss the strategy and spoke on condition of anonymity the house republican message against impeachment has four distinct parts according to this aide the transcript of trump s call with zelenskiy shows the president did nothing wrong several key witnesses testified that they don t have firsthand knowledge of what transpired the ukrainians didn t know the military aid was being upheld until it was publicly reported and eventually the u s agreed to send the money to ukraine it s a message being reinforced daily in the media by jordan and other trump surrogates including reps mark meadows r n c and lee zeldin r n y who are also part of the inquiry panels the person said what goes without saying though is that few republicans lawmakers are willing to say the call was perfect or that there was no quid pro quo as trump insists more often they say a little of this a little of that there are perfectly appropriate quid pro quos and there are inappropriate quid pro quos offered sen john kennedy r la just saying that there is a quid pro quo at least based on my analysis of the evidence that i ve seen so far is a red herring associated press video journalists padmana
