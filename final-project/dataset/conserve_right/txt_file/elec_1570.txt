presidential election david goodfriend was crushed dumbfounded he sat in his toyota corolla in a parking lot next to a hiking trail in bethesda listening to talk radio alone and inert wondering where it all went wrong what just happened why did my candidate lose top stories australian researchers see virus design manipulation coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni what kind of america am i living in when george w bush was re elected i thought this is the end of the country as i know it said mr goodfriend a washington lawyer and former clinton white house staffer those of us who supported john kerry just couldn t believe that more people supported bush we had one view of the iraq war and the american economy and were convinced we were right but kerry lost this time around you have people who cannot believe that there are more people who support barack obama they see the economy differently they see social issues differently there s a very close analogy there indeed as conservatives mourn and by mourn we mean full on biblical wailing and teeth gnashing and that s just from karl rove republican nominee mitt romney s defeat in a contest most on the political right were convinced he would win they can find consolation in the fact that liberal america has been through the same dark night of the partisan soul the doubt and disbelief the anger and finger pointing the fuming promises to move to canada well probably not canada because it has socialized medicine in fact conservatives should do more than take solace in past liberal anguish they should take notes because while some on the left aren t exactly sympathetic regarding the election s outcome they do have empathy and plenty of practical hard earned coping advice to wit democratic strategist and cnn contributor paul begala moved past mr kerry s defeat by refocusing on the 2006 midterm elections writing a self critical book with fellow strategist james carville and spending time coaching his children s little league and basketball teams and drinking mr begala said in an email interview especially shiner bock beer apocalypse not now like mr goodfriend david quigg spent the day after the 2004 election in a daze a 40 year old photographer and political writer from seattle he recalled looking at his two children one an infant the other a toddler and breaking down in tears that surprised me mr quigg said i had this vision that the world was going to be this place where they were going to have to pretend to be canadian to travel anywhere because america s reputation would be so bad i wasn t even angry just superdepressed i suspect that is probably similar to what conservatives are feeling now perhaps not to put too fine a point on it but some on the right are well freaking out consider online the cincinnati tea party posted a short obituary for the nation reading rip america july 4 1776 november 6 2012 death was ruled a suicide in arizona a 28 year old woman reportedly ran over her husband with her car because she thought he had contributed to mr obama s re election by not voting on twitter donald trump blasted the electoral college claimed the world is laughing at us called american democracy a sham and a travesty said the nation was in serious and unprecedented trouble and called for both a march on washington and a revolution the republicans are convinced that the republic is dead said democratic strategist jim duffy liberty is dead the state is going to run our lives no more entrepreneurs no more free thought well the older i get the more i m amazed that the extremes on both sides are so much alike in 2004 a lot of democrats felt that bush was a cowboy fool from texas who literally couldn t walk and chew gum at the same time and was leading the country to ruin as it turns out we re still here as mr goodfriend points out the united states has survived the civil war the great depression pearl harbor and watergate plus 10 seasons of two and a half men no matter how disappointed conservatives feel following mr obama s re election apocalyptic histrionics give the nation too little credit and mr obama far too much particularly when coming from otherwise vocal advocates of american exceptionalism many of us thought that bush would be the end of america as we know it said comedian and author baratunde thurston and sure there were a few policies and wars we strongly disagreed with but when it comes to the important things we still have our bacon and our real housewives it s not just them it s also you conservatives long have criticized liberals for being elitist smug and out of touch convinced that they are both smarter and morally superior to the very voters they re attempting to persuade in the wake of mr romney s loss the right would do well to avoid the same mistake there s no good lesson in getting your face bloodied in a political fight if you don t realize how much you believed your own spin and pr and bs said nato green a left leaning comic activist and writer for the fx series totally biased with w kamu bell in 2004 it was a hard lesson to realize that half of america just didn t like us but like in comedy you can t play nationally by hanging out in coffee shops in san francisco and portland if republicans want to win people over they need to go spend some time hanging out with undocumented immigrants and people who actually have had abortions following a bitter electoral defeat mr goodfriend said it s easy and emotionally satisfying to write off the opposing slice of the electorate as liberals did by dismissing red states as jesusistan or as fox television host bill o reilly did when he concluded that mr obama s voters want stuff and feel entitled to things it s tougher and more necessary to look in the mirror after bush won the democrats had to say that kerry had some flaws as a candidate the way romney had some flaws mr goodfriend said they had to do some soul searching when it came to why voters didn t trust them on some of the issues that carried the day like national security that s actually a healthy process the worst thing you can do is just say everybody else must be wrong because we are so right that is a recipe for losing the next election love it don t leave it in the annals of empty gestures threatening to leave the country following a disliked political outcome ranks somewhere between president nixon s post resignation v sign and basketball coach phil jackson s book the last season in 2000 pearl jam singer eddie vedder and the late director robert altman both promised to vacate america if mr bush won the presidency eight years later actor stephen baldwin promised to depart if mr obama won the democratic nomination two years after that radio host rush limbaugh said he would move to costa rica if congress passed the affordable care act perhaps unsurprisingly all of the above remained american citizens which is also why the 2007 film blue state a love story about a disaffected supporter of mr kerry who disembarks to canada following the 2004 election is in fact fictional i had a feeling of estrangement in 2004 like i don t understand where i live said blue state director marshall lewy who once volunteered for mr kerry s campaign in ohio i thought it would be a funny premise for a movie but i didn t actually consider moving to canada not until i actually had to go there to make the movie over the past week distraught and presumably right leaning citizens in more than 20 states reportedly have signed online secession petitions with one from texas gathering roughly 50 000 signatures an online poster with the handle blue collar republican went one step further posting an open letter to the queen of england that states in part if you can find it in your heart to forgive us and take us back we promise never to trade british oppression for socialist tyranny again the problem for bag packing conservatives said humor writer and self professed liberal chuck thompson is that canada is far too leftist to serve as an acceptable backup nation it always gets better for his part mr thompson spent the day after the 2004 election at an arizona resort where he saw a group of republicans decked out in campaign gear checking in at the front desk talking and smiling and elated over mr bush s victory mr thompson wanted to hide he wanted to head back to his room and pull a bedsheet over his head he later attended an inauguration day protest in washington of course that was then to all conservatives i d say don t worry he said four years ago the names george bush and sarah palin used to drive me and my friends into a red faced frenzy now they re irrelevant obama will become the
