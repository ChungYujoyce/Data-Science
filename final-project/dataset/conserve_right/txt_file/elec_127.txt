always wrong denver claiming he s the true champion of a middle class that s being crushed under president obama mitt romney went straight at the president wednesday in the first debate of the campaign saying his four years in office have doubled the deficit and left the economy gasping mr obama countered that mr romney is hiding key parts of his plans from voters but said from what he s seen the republican nominee would take government back to bush administration policies that led to the 2008 recession mr obama said he s done what he could in his first four years drescuing the auto industry and beginning to add jobs but quickly shifted saying he wants to look forward not backward top stories russian fighter jets intercept u s navy patrol aircraft over mediterranean cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens we all know that we ve still got a lot of work to do and so the question here tonight is not where we ve been but where we re going he said governor romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes skewed towards the wealthy and roll back regulations that we ll be better off like challengers before him mr romney benefitted from being on the same stage as the president in the 90 minute sparring match broadcast to a national audience that underscored the deep policy differences between the two men probably the biggest divide between presidential candidates in a generation unlike mr obama who said he wanted to look forward mr romney repeatedly pointed back to the last four years laying a devastating litany of failures on mr obama s doorstep what we re seeing right now is a trickle down government approach which has government thinking it can do a better job than people pursuing their dreams it s not working he said and the proof of that is 23 million people out of work the proof of that is one out of six people in poverty the proof of that is we ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps the proof of that is 50 percent of college graduates this year can t find work we know that the path we re taking is not working it s time for a new path the early reviews were far kinder to mr romney than to the president it looked like romney wanted to be there and obama looked like he didn t want to be there james carville a democratic strategist who advised president clinton said on cnn and a cnn flash poll of registered voters who watched the debate found 67 percent thought mr romney won to 25 percent for mr obama a separate cbs poll of undecided voters also give mr romney s performance a decisive edge 46 percent to 22 percent with the rest saying it was a tie the republican had the bigger challenge coming in he trails in the polls and voters say they don t know as much about him and find him less likable than mr obama with that context mr romney labored to portray himself as the defender of the middle class and to overcome the video released last month that showed him telling wealthy donors that 47 percent of americans are victims receiving government benefits i don t have a 5 trillion tax cut i don t have a tax cut of a scale that you re talking about he told the president my view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class but i m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high income people high income people are doing just fine in this economy they ll do fine whether you re president or i am the republican told stories of middle class americans he s met on the campaign trail who are struggling and he blamed mr obama s policies for their plight he even used the word buried playing off a gaffe of vice president joseph r biden jr who said earlier in the week that the middle class had been buried in the past four years mr obama never mentioned the 47 percent video an omission that shocked strategists who said the president was missing major opportunities to dent the republican instead mr obama repeatedly attacked mr romney for refusing to specify what tax breaks he ll eliminate in order to make the math on his tax plan add up and mr romney did not offer any new details instead flatly vowing that he won t allow the rich to get tax cuts at the expense of the middle class mr obama said it was becoming a pattern for the republican candidate to hide the details of his proposals at some point i think the american people have to ask themselves is the reason that governor romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they re too good is it because that somehow middle class families are going to benefit too much from them he quipped but mr romney was brutally clear on some specific budget cuts he d make including axing funding for pbs telling debate moderator and long time pbs newsman jim lehrer i like pbs i love big bird i actually like you too but i m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from china to pay for he said as the debate began the two men shook hands and exchanged what appeared to be friendly words mr obama then began his opening remarks by speaking to his wife michelle who was in the audience and with whom he was celebrating his 20th anniversary a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people he promised her i m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine here with me mr romney quipped copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view comments click to hide terms of use privacy policy
