officials on 1 099 patients with confirmed disease at more than 500 hospitals throughout china the report published friday by the new england journal of medicine gives a much broader view of the outbreak beyond wuhan where it started and has been most severe assuming there are many more cases with no or very mild symptoms the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1 u s health officials wrote in an editorial in the journal that would make the new virus more like a severe seasonal flu than a disease similar to its genetic cousins sars severe acute respiratory syndrome or mers middle east respiratory syndrome given the ease of spread however the virus could gain footholds around the world and many could die and the report by national health commission of china scientists shows how easy it is for many cases to be missed early on 44 of these patients had fever when they were admitted to the hospital but 89 ultimately developed it severe illness developed in

who s most at risk from covid 19 older people especially those with chronic illnesses such as heart or lung diseases are more at risk the chinese study released friday found that less than 1 of hospitalized patients were younger than 15 years old while 42 were 65 and older deaths also are rarer among younger people but some young deaths have made headlines such as the 34 year old doctor in china who was reprimanded by communist authorities for sounding an early alarm about the virus only to later succumb to it in china 80 of patients are mildly ill when the virus is detected compared with 13 who already are severely ill while the sickest to start with are at highest risk of death a fraction of the mildly ill do go on to die for unknown reasons on average however who says people with mild cases recover in about two weeks while those who are sicker can take anywhere from three to six weeks how can people prevent infection there s no vaccine although researchers are working on it for now the best way to prevent infection is hand washing cleaning surfaces with regular household sprays and wipes and avoiding close contact with people who are sick the virus spreads mostly through droplets from coughs and sneezes staying home when you are sick is recommended every flu season but may be especially important now what are we learning from this crisis in another essay in
