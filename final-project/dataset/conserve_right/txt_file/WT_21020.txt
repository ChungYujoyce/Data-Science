summit with north korea s leader collapse without an agreement his former lawyer deliver damaging congressional testimony about his character and business practices and congress take action to nullify his emergency declaration to secure money for the border wall that lawmakers have denied him on the stage he was a prideful and at times profane figure as he complained that past political appointments had allowed a situation where political foes were trying to take him out with bullshit trump reached back to old criticisms of his ex attorney general mocking jeff sessions southern accent and calling him weak and ineffective it took him more than an hour to get to the message that republicans and members of his administration have been emphasizing in recent weeks as they try to brand democratic policy ideas as socialism america will never be a socialist country he said socialism is not about the environment it s not about justice it s not about virtue he said it s about power for the ruling class for every prepared line like that there were multiple improvisations from a president on policy and personality that s how i got elected by being off script trump said early in his speech as the crowd roared its approval he took particular delight in going after the democrats green new deal brought forward by some liberal democrats in congress and backed to varying degrees by several of the party s 2020 presidential candidates i think the new green deal or whatever the hell they call it the green new deal i encourage it trump said mockingly as he wound up for a round of exaggeration i think it s really something that they should promote they should work hard on it no planes no energy when the wind stops blowing that s the end of your electric let s hurry up darling is the wind blowing today i d like to watch television darling he returned to the topic again and again and jokingly kicked himself for doing so saying it would give the democrats time to back away from it he also turned the topic into an attack of sen elizabeth warren d mass and one of the top democratic contenders for president i m going to regret this this speech should have been delivered one year from now not now damn it trump said i should have saved the pocahontas thing for another year because that destroyed her political career and now i won t get a chance to run against her i don t want to knock out all of the good stuff and wind up with somebody who s actually got talent trump also went after federal reserve chairman jerome powell essentially accusing him of being a drag on the economy we have a gentleman that likes raising interest rates in the fed we have a gentleman that loves quantitative tightening in the fed we have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the fed trump said with all of that we re doing great can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were trump defended his declaration of a national emergency to obtain wall funding beyond the 1 4 billion that congress approved for border security he said the order doesn t set a bad precedent for future administrations because democrats are going to do that anyway folks the best way to stop that is to make sure i win the election trump continued to bask in his 2016 victory and the crowds that attend his events he talked of how few gave him a chance to win i think we re going to do even better in 2020 trump said when he made his prediction of a second term the crowd responded with chants of usa usa usa he also took a lengthy detour back to the inauguration claiming that an enormous if not unprecedented crowd showed up contrary to the thorough video and photo coverage that showed otherwise trump revisited his meeting with north korea leader kim jong un calling their summit very productive he also took another crack at explaining his remarks that he didn t believe kim knew about or would have allowed the death of otto warmbier the american college student who was held prisoner in north korea then sent home in a vegetative state his remarks were widely criticized and led the warmbier family to say they held kim and his regime responsible for their son s death i
