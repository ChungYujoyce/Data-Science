hurricane dorian potentially hitting alabama upsetting meteorologists around the country on sunday trump had warned that alabama along with the carolinas and georgia was most likely to be hit much

ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens but the president has been adamant throughout the week that he was correct and the white house has deployed government resources and staff to back him the latest defense came out friday evening when the national oceanic and atmospheric administration issued a statement from an unidentified spokesman stating that information provided by noaa and the national hurricane center to the president had demonstrated that tropical storm force winds from hurricane dorian could impact alabama the advisories were dated from last wednesday aug 28 through monday the statement read the statement also said the birmingham nws tweet sunday morning spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time the statement from noaa contrasts with comments the agency s spokesman chris vaccaro made sunday the current forecast path of dorian does not include alabama vaccaro said at the time friday s noaa statement released just before 5 p m points to a few graphics issued by the national hurricane center to support trump s claims the maps show

disappointing and saying he would comment because noaa employees were ordered to be quiet either noaa leadership truly agrees with what they posted or they were ordered to do it if it is the former
