 in case you missed it last evening florida senator marco rubio of floridaofficially entered the 2016 republican presidential race he isthe third gop aspirant to formally do so joining fellow first term senators ted cruz and rand paul among the ranks of declared candidates here are hisfull remarks followed by some commentary asdan noted last night rubio directly criticized the obama administration on foreign policy and dismissed hillary clinton as a relic of yesterday s politics his campaign theme is the forward looking mission ofsecuring a new american century rooted in an abidingappreciation for the genius ofour founding and deep loveofwhat america has meant to herpeople and tothe world sounding very much like 2008 s barack obama rubio positioned himself as representinga needed break from the past and described 2016 s dynamic asa change election sounding very much unlike barack obama rubio attacked expansionist government anddemanded the united states reassert its imperative role as the leader of the free world his speech was optimistic and future oriented previewing exactly how he d frame a head to head contest with the presumptive democratic nominee i suspect he senses a real opportunityat the prospect of hillary clinton effectively running as anolder continuation of the obama presidency rubio enters the fray withsingle digit support but data guru nate silver makes an interesting observation rubio s favorability ratings as good as walker bush s among gopers but he s often a 2nd choice will that change http t co uvygk8r5il nate silver natesilver538 april 13 2015 rubio is in pretty good shape in terms of favorability but he hasn t galvanized much support as a top tier candidate at least not yet he s an acceptable fallback for quite a lot of republicans but he s not at the top of many voters list not a terrible spot to occupy at this early stage sure but one from which he ll need to emerge to attract dollars and attention silver s question is a good one here s another via allahpundit is rubio actually the safest option for national republicans the more i think about it the more i think his biggest asset is that he s the safest pick among the top tier of candidate by far no one knows if jeb can shed his bush baggage no one knows if walker can attain the sort of fluency rubio already has on foreign policy or if his ham handed early pandering on immigration will lead to other opportunistic policy reversals no one knows if rand paul can prevent democrats from painting him as a crank and no one knows how many republican hawks will stay home in protest if he s the nominee no one knows if ted cruz can appeal to swing voters in a national election even if he figures out a path to the gop nomination rubio though seems like a low risk choice on almost every front he banked some centrist cred with his immigration bill and his new tax reform plan he s got his own trailblazing racial narrative he can probably deliver a major swing state he ll be excellent on the stump and far far far better than hillary clinton there won t be any major gaffes a la romney and the 47 percent there won t be any weird stunts like mccain suspending his campaign over the financial crisis he ll be solid even his most obvious liability his youth could turn out to be an asset against clinton a candidate nearly 25 years older the fear with electing a young president is that he doesn t know the issues rubio palpably does and will have many chances to prove it besides how can hillary attack him for his age rubio will be 45 on election day 2016 bill clinton s age when he was elected to his first term 46 meet the press host chuck todd addsadditional perspective to the youth question why does generational contrast matter 5 of the last six prez elections won by younger nominee bush gore the exception chuck todd chucktodd april 13 2015 as ap says rubio s fluency on issues and strength as a compelling extemporaneous speaker will serve him well over the day in day out grind of a presidential campaign yes he tends tolean heavily on moving anecdotes about his family in speeches but beneath the inspirational rhetoric is adeep pool of knowledge much of itquite detailed and he s able to convey that knowledge and express conservative perspectives as fluidly and impressively as anyone on the contemporary scene parting thoughts will his undeniable talents land him at least somewhere on the 2016 gop ticket remember regardless of how things play out he ll beout of a job as a us senator come 2017 and even though his favorables are in good shape among core republican voters at the moment canthose numbers withstand a barrage of attack ads over the gang of eight immigration bill he co sponsored also consider this good pointfrom jim pethokoukis almost every politician from both parties waxes poetic on american exceptionalism and praisesthe american dream but with rubio that standard farefeelslike something more than warmed oversloganeering one gets the sense that rubio doesn t think the stuff about american exceptionalism american dream is just bomfog speech boilerplate james pethokoukis jimpethokoukis april 13 2015 i ll leave you with the words of a man who sounds like he s ready for hillary rubio s favorability ratings as good as walker bush s among gopers but he s often a 2nd choice will that change http t co uvygk8r5il why does generational contrast matter 5 of the last six prez elections won by younger nominee bush gore the exception one gets the sense that rubio
