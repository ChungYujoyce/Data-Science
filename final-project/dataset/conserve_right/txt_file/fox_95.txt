videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the u s is now the epicenter of the global coronavirus outbreak with more than 121 000 confirmed cases and 2 000 deaths and the nation aposs health care system struggling to keep up here are the latest developments the cdc now urging residents of new york new jersey and connecticut to avoid nonessential travel for 14 days after president trump backed off talk of imposing a quarantine but his 15 days to slow the spread initiative is slated to end tomorrow and the president has discussed getting americans back to work in some areas by easter despite push backs from governors and public health officials in a moment we aposll speak with treasury secretary steven mnuchin but first let aposs bring in mark meredith reporting from the white house on the struggles facing people on the front lines mark mark meredith fox news correspondent chris good morning the president first raised the idea of this potential quarantine for the northeast on saturday instead the cdc has issued the travel advisory for the tri state area urging people to avoid nonessential travel meanwhile cities nationwide they are bracing for the worst as millions of americans also wonder what the outbreak will mean for their wallets too begin videotape meredith new york aposs hospitals are struggling to keep up as the number of patients infected with covid 19 grows by the hour unidentified male i need eyewear and i need face masks i need as many as you can get meredith at this hospital in queens some people are stuck waiting hours to be tested or

not enough health care resources to care for all those who will need care if we continue to develop cases at our current pace meredith louisiana aposs leaders fear their state is about to see a major surge that aposs led some to ask if the recent mardi gras celebration in new orleans sped up the spread of the virus throughout the south end videotape meredith meantime the president on friday signed a 2 trillion stimulus bill aimed to help individuals and industries now struggling to survive but millions of americans are still out of work right now and many are wondering how long this may last chris wallace mark meredith reporting from the white house mark thanks for that joining us now treasury secretary stephen mnuchin who aposs a member of the president aposs coronavirus task force mr secretary president trump talked openly yesterday about a possible quarantine of the new york state area why did he first consider it and why in the end did he decide not to go ahead with it mnuchin well chris it aposs great to be back with you the president did very seriously consider it the task force met yesterday with the vice president it was the unanimous decision of the recommendation of the task force to go forward with the advisory the vice president myself mark meadows and others met with the president yesterday afternoon and he decided to go forward with the recommendation wallace what was it that made him think a quarantine might be necessary and again why did he decide not to do it mnuchin chris i think the president wanted to consider all the options he was obviously concerned what was going on with new york he spoke to the task force he spoke to the governors and he was comfortable that people would take this advisory very seriously and and would not travel wallace the coronavirus task force of which you aposre a member is meeting this weekend to come up with new guidelines after the 15 days how to stop the spread of the virus guidelines end tomorrow here is what the president said this week about what he aposd like to see begin video clip president donald j trump i would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by easter wallace as treasury secretary do you think that aposs realistic to open up parts of the country to open up parts of the economy as soon as two weeks from today which is which will be easter mnuchin chris i aposm going to leave that decision to the medical professionals and the president my full time focus right now is we couldn apost be more pleased that the senate and house reacted very quickly signed an enormous package to support u s workers and the u s economy the president signed it into law and my full time focus is delivering on that and let me just say the the sba is working very closely with the treasury we expect to have a program up on friday that will be up and running that will cover half of the private workforce i encourage all small businesses to take out these loans because if you go and hire back your workers for eight weeks you will have a forgivable loan and the government will pay for that so again it is very important for us that workers are protected and this is a major part of the package wallace mr secretary i aposm going to get to that package in a moment but i want to press on this issue of perhaps changing the guidelines because that not only has a lot of health implications it also has a lot of economic implications there aposs been a lot of push back from public health experts about the idea of reopening parts of the country where there aposs a lower incidence of the virus opening them up perhaps within two weeks our very next guest dr tom inglesby head of the johns hopkins center for health security says this disease will not respect state borders and city borders and will move around this country just like it aposs moved around the world so the question is if the virus spread from china to italy can apost it spread from chicago to iowa and if we were to open reopen parts of the country too soon wouldn apost that be the worst thing for the economy if we see the virus spreading into more areas mnuchin chris i can assure you the president aposs number one objective is the health of the american public and protecting the american public and we aposre going to do everything to support the economy the task force will be reviewing it it will be discussing it with the president there hasn apost been any recommendation made yet so again let me just emphasize the president wants to make sure that we kill this virus and we do it quickly and the medical professionals are working on that and while we do that we have now a gigantic economic program to support american workers and american business wallace yeah let aposs get to that you were the key administration figure negotiating that 2 trillion some call it relief bill some call it a stimulus bill one part of that is 500 billion a half a trillion dollars to help dealing with various big corporations how much discretion do you and the president have in deciding who to give that 500 billion to which corporations and under what terms mnuchin chris there aposs two parts to this program there aposs there aposs approximately 50 billion that we can make direct treasury loans that are subject to the president and my approval those are specifically designed for the airline business and for the cargo business which are national security concerns and also give us flexibility if there are other national security companies and let me be clear taxpayers will be fully compensated for those loans the other part of the package is for us to work with federal reserve i think you know chairman jay powell and i now speak multiple times a day on a regular basis the 13 3 was a package that existed under the federal reserve act the federal reserve has the ability to make broad based lending programs available once the fed requests those actions they come to me i have to approve them as treasury secretary and in many cases i contribute capital to support that in consultation with the president so these are very important programs we think they can provide about 4 trillion of liquidity to the american economy again we expect we will get paid back on these loans these are temporary support for the american economy that aposs very very very critical and we aposve already rolled out many of these already wallace but mr secretary one of the big sticking points when you were negotiating with democrats in the senate is they wanted an inspector general to oversee the big loans the big grants to big corporations and just two hours after the president signed the 2 trillion bill he put out a signing statement saying that he will only allow that inspector general to report to congress under quote presidential supervision so didn apost that basically violate the deal you made with the democrats in the senate mnuchin i don apost i don apost think that aposs the case chris there aposs constitutional issues again we are going to have full transparency the way this works is we have full transparency in reporting what we aposre doing to the american public we also have a bipartisan oversight committee that will review our actions we we are fully comfortable that whatever we do we want full transparency and we aposre very careful in what we aposre doing about supporting american workers and the american economy wallace so directly will the inspector general that was provided for in this bill be allowed to testify and report to congress mnuchin chris i aposm i aposm going to leave that to the lawyers ok and to congress to figure out my full time objective right now is to make sure this administration does everything we can to get this money into the economy quickly that aposs a combination of small business loans that will be available this week and let me just be clear this is not just normal sba lenders any fdic bank any credit union any fintech lender will be authorized to make these loans subject to certain approvals we aposll also have direct deposit into people aposs accounts within three weeks so they have checks these are bridge checks we have enhanced unemployment insurance that we aposre working with the states this is all about the president aposs determination to support the u s economy wallace finally mr secretary 3 3 million people applied for unemployment benefits this week that is four times the previous highest record since 1967 when these records were kept the former head of the cbo says that we are going to see an unemployment rate in the next few months of 20 percent your former company goldman sachs is projecting that gdp in the second quarter instead of being up 2 percent or 3 percent is going to be minus 24 percent is that what you aposre seeing at the treasury department 20 percent unemployment a gdp shrinking from year over year by a quarter mnuchin chris it aposs hard to predict these numbers because we aposve never had anything like this where we aposve shut down the u s economy for medical reasons the economy was in very very good health and we shut it down and let me just say we aposre very sympathetic to the people who who don apost have jobs and that aposs why the president was very clear that he wanted me to work with congress on a bipartisan basis quickly to support those people so i hope number one businesses rehire small businesses rehire those people now that they aposll have the money number two people will have enhanced unemployment insurance and number three people will have direct deposit money in their accounts to provide liquidity and we want to get people back to work wallace but but mnuchin as quickly as we can subject to the medical conditions wallace understood but briefly now i aposve got about 30 seconds left you aposre saying you seem to be saying that 20 percent unemployment and gdp minus a quarter 24 percent is not impossible it may not be may not last long but we may see those numbers and we may have to live with that mnuchin chris i don apost know what the numbers are going to be this quarter what i do think is we are going to kill this virus we are going to reopen this economy and in the third quarter of this year you aposre going to see this economy bounce back with very large gdp numbers and low unemployment back to where we were beforehand so the president is determined that we protect people and reopen the economy when it aposs the right time wallace secretary mnuchin thank you thanks for your time during these busy days always good to talk with you sir mnuchin thank you chris wallace up next the spread of the virus in the united states warnings of a second wave and an expert aposs serious concerns about ending social distancing too soon commercial break wallace as the debate intensifies about how long to continue to coronavirus lockdown in this country we want to bring in one of the nation aposs top experts on infectious disease epidemics joining us from baltimore dr thomas inglesby director of the center for health security at johns hopkins university doctor let aposs start with the astonishing spread of this virus one week ago we had 25 000 cases and 307 deaths but as of saturday we had 121 000 cases and 2 000 deaths what does that tell you about the nature of this virus and where are we in its course it aposs spread here in the united states dr thomas inglesby director of the center for health security at johns hopkins university well it tells us that this virus is able to spread pretty efficiently and quickly we aposve seen that around the world in the last few months and we should expect that to keep happening in the united states i think unfortunately we are still at the very beginning of this outbreak and we should expect that to continue for some time and really focus on social distancing as one of our main interventions of trying to slow it wallace i want to pick up on that because i want to ask you about president trump aposs evolving policy on how to handle the virus as you know his initial 15 days to stop the spread of the virus guidelines run out tomorrow the 15 days end tomorrow and he is now talking about the possibility in certain what he calls low risk parts of the country where there aposs a low incidence of the virus re opening those areas by easter here he is this week begin clip donald trump president of the united states of america there are a lot ph of sections of our country probably can go back much sooner than other sections end clip wallace will that work and what about the president aposs discussing the idea that you could have some areas of the country where you could begin to open in two weeks inglesby yes at this point we aposre seeing numbers go up around the country pretty consistently there isn apost really any place in the country where we aposve seen numbers go down and we wouldn apost expect to have had enough time for social distancing to change the numbers so i don apost think we have had nearly enough time for these measures to take full effect i do think in the future it aposs possible that parts of the country once they get control of this virus that maybe states or regions could begin to relax social distancing measures a little sooner than other parts of the country but as long as the numbers continue to go up as they are around the country i think we really need to hold steady with the social distancing until we have a number of different conditions in place wallace but i want to put up a map because if you look at the situation there are broad parts of the country well you can see in the northeast in the new york general areas some cities big cities in the midwest and on the west coast where there are serious hot spots and then there are broad areas where there are very few cases so why can apost we as the president is suggesting treat different parts of the country where the virus is at a very different state treat those different parts of the country differently inglesby well i think the first reason is that i don apost really have confidence i don apost think many in public health have confidence that we really know where all the cases are we aposve begun to do much more diagnostic testing around the country especially in places where there is a lot of illness but in some parts of the country we don apost have enough coverage of diagnostic testing we aposre seeing what we see but there could be twice as many three times as many four times as many cases in a particular area of the country that aren apost yet recognized so we need to get to a point in the country where we have such extensive diagnostic testing that we can test people who have mild symptoms right now many in many places in the country if you have mild symptoms you can apost get a test but those people can spread the disease just as well as the people who are sick in the hospital so we need to get to a point where we have go ahead wallace no i got i didn apost mean to interrupt but the president talks about in these certain areas of the country that people could actually go back to work go back to offices as long as they practice the guidelines for these last 15 days in the office social distancing in the office good hygiene washing your hands a lot take a look at what the president said begin clip trump we can socially distance ourselves and go to work and you aposll have to work a little bit harder you can clean your hands five times more than you used to end clip wallace dr inglesby will that work inglesby i don apost think so i think if we we aposve seen in italy for example which is a number of weeks ahead of the united states in terms of it aposs epidemic that even with very serious very aggressive social distancing measures where people have been kept at home schools have been closed everyone is recommended not to leave their homes that this disease has continued to spread and is causing national crisis so at this point i think what we need to do is really stick with what other countries that have had more success have done which is they aposve largely been in asia singapore hong kong south korea china taiwan they have put in place social distancing measures until they aposve gotten control of the epidemic convincingly and at that point begun to try experiments with loosening it and i do think we will get to that point obviously we need to as a country get to a point where people can go back to work but if we go back to work too quickly this epidemic is going to spread widely and aggressively and we won apost have a normal economy in that case anyway so i really do think that while this epidemic continues to be on the rise in many places in the country and we don apost know enough about diagnostics in many other parts of the country we really should hold the course wallace so if easter as the president has suggested is too soon to begin to loosen the reigns in the quote low risk areas when would you say this is the kind of question reporters ask and i aposm sure epidemiologists like you hate two questions one what is the earliest that you think that we could begin to loosen the reigns in some of the less affected areas and then the question i aposm sure you aposre getting over and over how long is this going to last before we really go back to normal inglesby so i think dates are hard to predict because everyday the numbers continue to go up in many parts of the country i think we should really have this more like a conditions based decision so when we see a state or a region have numbers that go down over time and when we have diagnostics in place and when we have masks available for all of our doctors and nurses who are putting their lives at risk to take care of sick patients and hospitals are well prepared and when we can get our public health systems in place to start tracing or identifying individuals and tracing their contracts again like they do in asia i think those five major conditions then i think it aposs a time to begin to think about how we might experiment with lightening social distancing perhaps one step at a time it aposs not clear to me when that aposs going to happen i think we aposll have to see where we are in two more weeks in other countries where they aposve put social distancing measures in place aggressively it aposs taken about four weeks for those measures to begin to have an effect but at that point i think we could begin to look for the conditions that might make it safe to begin to lowering our social distancing but not until then wallace dr inglesby thank you thanks for providing your expert inglesby thanks for having me on chris wallace analysis and please come back sir up next increasing cooperation and some tension between the president and the nation aposs governors who are on the front lines of fighting the coronavirus we aposll talk with maryland aposs larry hogan head of the national governors association that aposs next commercial break wallace coming up president trump aposs timeline to reopen the country puts him at odds with some governors begin video clip hogan we simply don apost yet know how bad it aposs going to get or how long it aposs going to last end video clip wallace we aposll ask maryland governor larry hogan how he feels about relaxing the restrictions next commercial break wallace the coronavirus pandemic is putting the nation aposs governors in the spotlight and setting some in the hardest hit states at odds with the white house in maryland there are now a thousand confirmed cases an increase of more than just 250 yesterday including 66 residents of a nursing home and 10 people have died in maryland joining us now that state aposs governor larry hogan who aposs also chair of the national governors association governor maryland was one of the first states to shut down all the schools then all the restaurants then all non essential businesses and you just extended school closures for another four weeks until april 24th if the president and his task force start saying this week that certain low risk areas of the country including some perhaps in maryland can reopen do you follow that guidance or do you just ignore it gov larry hogan r md look i think the virus is going to dictate the timeframe and it we aposre going to follow the advice of the scientists and doctor like dr inglesby ph who you just had on a moment ago he aposs on our task force but no we don apost see any way that we aposre going to be opening back up in a couple of weeks the washington metropolitan area has maryland d c and virginia quadrupled in the past week and we see that continuing to grow exponentially and we think in two weeks around easter we aposre going to be looking a lot more like new york wallace so you think two weeks from now it aposs going to be getting worse in maryland not better hogan there aposs no question about that i mean in spite of the fact that we aposve taken some of the most aggressive steps in the country on social distancing and we were out front ahead of nearly every state on some of these things we aposve been taking unprecedented actions every day for the past three weeks it aposs continuing to grow at really kind of frightening paces and we think it aposs going to be worse in two weeks not better wallace do you worry that this talk and it got a little tempered as the week went on about reopening about we don apost want the cure to be worse than the problem it may be giving some people not just in maryland but around the country a false sense of confidence that you know maybe i don apost have to do all the social distancing and i don apost have to do all of those precautions hogan it is the messaging isn apost helpful because as we aposre as the governor aposs out there on the front lines they aposre trying to get people to stay in their homes for everything but very essential things like going out to get food or prescriptions or things that are basic needs for their you know for them to survive and then we aposve got messaging coming out saying that things are ok and and you know you shouldn apost you should get back to normal it does conflict and it hurts with the messaging but look i think the president aposs just trying to be hopeful which is good we want we don apost want people to be scared but we do want them to take it seriously and we want you know the facts to be out there so we aposre going to follow the doctors and the scientists i think most governors are going to do what they think is right in their own states to to save lives wallace we have been hearing a lot about a shortage of ventilators a shortage of personal protective equipment for health care workers especially in new york city and state how are you doing in maryland and are you getting all the help you would like from the federal government hogan well you know we the federal government has done a great job of communicating with us we aposve had five calls with all of the governors with the president and and or vice president and many of the top leaders we aposve we had a request for about ten different things most of which they aposve tried to address but the big pinch point that everybody is dealing with both at the federal and all the states is this lack of of the equipment that we need it aposs a lack of tests a lack of ventilators a lack of masks and swabs and protective equipment you know this is this is a serious issue across the country that we aposre all grappling with and so while they aposve made efforts in fema is now in charge it aposs not enough wallace you as we aposve said are not only the governor of maryland you aposre also the head of the national governors association and some of your democratic governors have been complaining and getting into some verbal spats with the president he was asked about that this week here he is begin video clip question what more specifically do you want the governor of washington the governor of michigan donald trump president of the united states all i want them to do very simple i want them to be appreciative i don apost want them to say things that aren apost true i want them to be appreciative end video clip wallace governor hogan does president trump have a point hogan well look i do appreciate the efforts i said a minute ago that of the of the ten things that we aposve been asking for you know they have tried to address about eight of them and some you know half of them are already done so we do appreciate the efforts of the federal government and i hate to just point fingers and talk about what hasn apost been done or what didn apost get done we we we aposre all in this together and it aposs going to take the federal state and locals working together to save lives but there aposs also frustration out there just that that we aposre all in the situation we aposre in and that the federal government is unable to to to solve some of these issues and neither you know the states are are not also not able to so there aposs frustration out there but i think we should do less arguing more working together wallace maryland just released information that seems to go against i think some of the prevailing narratives one of them is that half your cases are people under 50 and that you have as many cases of infection of of people in their 20s as you do of people in their 60s and you just postponed your state election primary from april until june so so where what are you learning about the nature and spread and duration of this virus in your state of maryland hogan well chris the more the more data we gather from the smart folks like dr inglesby at johns hopkins and the university of maryland and all of our all of our smart folks that are collecting all the new cases we aposre finding out that it aposs not it aposs not exactly the way it aposs been described for the past few months and the more data we get the more the numbers change we have people in their 20s 30s and 40s the the biggest category is people in their 40s but we aposve got young younger people we have cases of four months old ten months old and 56 percent of all the people that have been hospitalized in maryland are are under 60 they aposre not just folks from nursing homes that are in their 70s and 80s so as we as we move on i mean this this virus some of the information because we haven apost done enough testing we don apost you know we aposre getting new and conflicting data and we aposre just trying to understand exactly what aposs happening but i aposve been warning people that younger people that felt they were bulletproof and that weren apost listening to directives that you aposre endangering yourselves and your and your family and friends by not following these these orders to to stop you know going out and and and being in groups it aposs why we aposve been so tough and trying to get people to stay at home wallace governor hogan thank you thanks for joining this weekend in the midst of your fight against the virus and good luck sir hogan thank you chris wallace up next we will bring in our sunday group to discuss efforts to balance addressing both the public health and economic crisis commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states america will again and soon be open for business very soon a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting dr anthony fauci director national institute of allergy and infectious diseases i think people might get the misinterpretation you aposre just going to lift everything up and even somebody aposs going like that your i mean that that aposs not going to happen end video clip wallace president trump hoping to lift restrictions on parts of the country by easter while dr anthony fauci a key member of his task force urges caution and it aposs time now for a sunday group washington post columnist marc thiessen fox news political analyst juan williams and posterior kristen soltis anderson who aposs a fox news contributor marc you wrote a column on friday in which you said this continuing lockdown is unsustainable so when the president talks about the possibility in the less affected areas where you aposre not seeing like the hot spots you aposre seeing very few cases relatively speaking when he says that you might conceivably be able to reopen some of them by easter do you agree with him marc thiessen fox news contributor no i think easter is too optimistic but i think the president is absolutely right that we need to see a light at the end of the tunnel and that we need to have a sustainable strategy to defeat the virus because right now what we aposre doing is unsustainable we just had 3 28 million americans apply for unemployment benefits last last week that aposs a record we are talking as you mentioned earlier between 25 and even some estimates 30 percent reduction in gdp that can apost go on forever at the start of an epidemic a pandemic like this you accept very high economic costs because we don apost know what we aposre dealing with we aposre flying blind but over time as we get as we as the medical professionals get a handle on this and we start to contain the virus and we have to start transitioning dr scott gottlieb who is my colleague at the american enterprise institute former fda commissioner has released this morning a road map towards reopening and what he aposs saying is that april aposs going to be a very tough month because we aposre going to see continue to see a spike but if we keep the mitigation efforts in place by may we should be able to start opening on a state by state basis and the way you decide state by state how you do it is has there been a sustained reduction in cases for 14 days in states where you aposre seeing that happen and they have the medical capability to take care of the the hospital capability to take care of people they can test people then you can start lifting the restrictions in those states so it might be some states that happens sooner and other places like new york where it aposs been hardest hit the hot spots it aposs going to take longer to get there but we have to start moving in that direction wallace juan marc points out in his column that some countries like south korea have been able to contain the virus without locking down most of their population for months what are your thoughts about loosening the reins how soon we do it how do we decide whether and when to do it juan williams fox news political analyst well i just want to i guess you know refrain what dr inglesby said to you earlier chris which is that the virus does not respect county lines or state lines alabama for example has had a very low register so far in terms of the virus but now they aposre spiking and what you heard from dr inglesby is we aposre short on testing in lots of areas of the country you look at a place like south korea they did much in terms of limiting this but they had a tremendous advantage in terms of being prepared with the testing and with the medical supplies and so they employed social distancing on top of that preparation even at this point i think it aposs the case they aposre a country that aposs about 50 million we aposre six times bigger 300 plus million and what you see is that they aposre they have tested in terms of one of every 150 people in their population but we here in the u s it aposs still about one in every 900 that aposs a huge differential and it gives you an indication of how someone another country handle it versus what we aposve done the other element here is you know the kind of talk that we aposve heard obviously the president has tried to be very positive uplifting but when you talk about you know this is going to disappear like a miracle or we aposve got it under control it led a lot of people to have a perspective that said maybe this is being overhyped maybe there aposs alarmism here and not take the proper precautions i think we aposre still in that fight wallace kristen that brings me to what i wanted to talk to you about where is public opinion at this point how are people balancing the public health threat here versus the economic threat and how inpatient are they getting with the current guidelines the the staying in place closed schools businesses shut down are are people still think that aposs the right thing to do or are you beginning to see a little bit of restlessness about that kristen soltis anderson fox news contributor by and large the public opinion data we aposve got says that people are making big sacrifices both economically in terms of making changes to their own personal lives but that they at the moment are believing that though sacrifices are justified we have medical professionals on the frontlines of this who need folks who are not medical professionals to follow these guidelines and to stay home and to make these sacrifices and these sacrifices will all be for not if the economy is reopened too early if the virus then suddenly surges if we go through the next couple of weeks of incredible pain and as we aposve seen in fox news apos own polling data you aposve got over over 80 percent of americans say that they are making big changes to their daily lives they aposre doing things like washing their hands more they aposre not going out of public as much but you aposve also got you know small business owners who don apost know if they aposre going to be able to open their small business when this is all done you aposve got parents who are suddenly in a position where they have to homeschool their children something that they were not equipped or prepared for that was not how they were planning to spend their april you aposve got kids who are going to miss their graduations and enter an economy where where are they going to get a job who is hiring right now but all of these sacrifices will be for not if the economy is reopened too early if people are told go out of your homes and this virus then spikes again and i think that aposs when you begin to see things like what the president is enjoying right now which is a relatively good job approval rating that has increased very slightly over the course of this crisis you still have americans who are apprehensive about the way this is handled at first about 53 percent in fox aposs polling say that they felt this was not taken seriously enough at the beginning we didn apost do enough at the start they aposre giving good marks to what we aposre doing now and i think that needs to therefore continue if it aposs released to early you could definitely wind up in a situation where people are really frustrated that they made all of these sacrifices and it feels like it was for nothing wallace marc we had an interesting narrative this week at the white house because monday and we played some clips from it president trump came out and basically said we got to reopen this country the country can apost stay shut and we can apost have a cure that aposs worse than the problem and as the week went on you could see him begin to soften that as you got more of a pushback from the public health experts saying well that aposs aspirational and it aposs good to provide hope but the numbers and particularly the testing to find out really what is the incidence of this virus may not be there your sense as somebody who reports on it and talks to people in this administration how much of a struggle is there between the political and the economic advisors on the one hand who may be wanting to put the pedal on the gas a little bit more and public health experts who may be saying not so fast thiessen i don apost i think that tension is a little bit overblown i think what the president is trying to do is provide a light at the end of the tunnel for the american people when he sets a target date of easter he was even the very same day that he did it he said that you know we aposre going to follow the data and we aposre going to and the advice of health experts so i think he aposs trying to provide a light at the end of the tunnel i think that aposs what aposs so important about what dr gottlieb has done is because he aposs laid out a road map so we aposre right now we aposre in phase one where we aposre in the lockdown and we aposre doing population based mitigation efforts in part because we didn apost have testing capability and there aposs a whole story behind that whereas as you pointed out in south korea they were able to test very quickly but we want to transition to phase two over time where we can go state by state and start lifting some of these restrictions with still people you know social distancing teleworking when they can washing their hands more and do that in areas of the country where you can and then phase three will be when we can lift all the restrictions and that aposs when there aposs a therapeutic that aposs when the doctors have a and even better a vaccine where you can treat it but people need to see that road map people need to understand that we aposre not going to be in this lockdown forever that this is we bought ourselves some time with the emergency bill which is great but at a cost of 2 trillion tripling the deficit you know we can apost keep going back to the well we have to come up with a strategy that is a long term sustainable strategy to deal with this with this pandemic wallace but juan and i aposve only got 30 seconds for you here in terms of that road map we don apost know i mean the virus has a mind of its own so when we talk about phase two by may that may hold it may not hold williams we don apost know chris we don apost know i think just initially you know i think the president should retract that easter deadline just make it clear to everyone that aposs not realistic if you aposre only listening to the experts when it suits you you aposre not really listening to the experts or the facts on the ground and what we aposve heard from dr fauci dr everybody dr inglesby this morning on your show is that you have to be responsive to the realities you have to look for that curve to start to come down hopefully for 14 days before you would even have that discussion wallace thank you juan thank you panel see you all next sunday up next we aposre going to visit with pastor joel osteen and discussed his thoughts on how to get through these tough times commercial break wallace churches across the country will be empty again today as clergy live stream services for their socially distanced congregations pastor joel osteen leads one of the largest mega churches in the country and last sunday he preached to thousands of empty seats but four and a half million people watched online begin video clip pastor joel osteen you aposre not close to your miracle only when everything is calm and peaceful sometimes it aposs the opposite when it aposs chaotic when you aposre tempted to panic live afraid that means your miracle is on the way end video clip wallace and pastor joel joins us now from his lakewood church in houston pastor there aposs an awful lot for people to be worried about right now their physical health their economic security so what aposs your advice as to how to deal with these tough times pastor joel osteen lakewood church senior pastor you know chris there is a lot of negativity and reason to worry and be afraid but i think that aposs when we have to make that choice to live from a place of peace and not a place of fear you know you take it one day at a time you know it aposs just as energy i aposve learned it aposs just as easy to worry as it is to believe that god you aposve got me in the palm your hand you aposve got us through in the past and you aposll get us through again wallace we talked a couple of years ago and it aposs funny because you mentioned the negative conversation that we all have going on in our minds all the time am i good enough can i handle this and you say that the way to to break through that negative conversation right now is to seek peace and that peace is a place of power explain that osteen yes it really is chris because you know when you when you live worried when you live negative and just you know thinking about all that could happen all that could go wrong we aposre drawn into negative our life follows our thoughts and i aposm not saying it aposs easy and i aposm not saying to deny the facts but i believe there aposs a there aposs a when you live from that place of peace a grateful place you draw in peace you draw in your faith and that aposs what helps you get through these tough times not that you know we aposre denying it all but you can just choose to live from that place of peace and that aposs what gives you the strength and the power to make it through wallace you say and you just mentioned it here find something to be grateful for but when you aposre worried about your health maybe you aposve got a relative who aposs got the virus when you aposre worried about your 401 k you see those numbers ticking down all the time what do you find to be grateful for osteen well chris you aposve got to find something and i believe we all have some reason maybe we do have our health well you know what we can thank god for what we have or we have a place to live or we aposre in a great country i just think you have to make that shift that hey this is another day that god aposs given me it aposs a gift i can choose to live it negative bitter discouraged or i can say i aposm going to make the most of this day maybe i aposm going to spend a little more time with my family or i aposm going to be you know maybe it helps me get things more in perspective i aposm going to find something maybe i wouldn apost normally be grateful for just the fact that i aposm alive and healthy or you know something like that just to start the day off in faith wallace everyone pastor joel is asking and i asked dr inglesby that this question how long will this virus last can i hang on for another two weeks might i have to hang on for another two months because we really don apost know how long this is going to go on this isolation this lockdown you say don apost be thinking two weeks ahead don apost be thinking two months ahead osteen i think that aposs right chris because it is that can get us all frustrated and worried and depressed and can we make it but god gives you grace for every day his mercy is new every morning so we don apost have grace for tomorrow so if we aposre thinking about tomorrow or can i do this a month or six months it is going to discourage us but i think you have to get up and say can i make it through this day with a good attitude with a smile being good to somebody else and you can because you have the grace for this day so don apost go way out into the future well what if i don apost have the money what if my relatives get sick why don apost you stay in today be grateful for today when you get to tomorrow you aposre going to have grace for that day wallace you say that that one way to deal with the isolation the fact that we can apost hug our family we can apost sit down and have dinner with our friends is to help someone else now i know that you have a blood drive at your lakewood church in houston but what can one person sitting at home and not even able to get out of their home necessarily what can they do to help other people right now osteen yes it aposs more difficult now chris but maybe you know simple things picking up the phone and calling a friend and encouraging them letting the people in your life you love know that you love them i believe it aposs just it aposs it aposs the way we were made to be when we help somebody else get better god helps us get better if we aposll make their day god will make our day and it aposs easy to live ingrown hey i aposve got my problems i aposve got this virus i aposve got worried about my future but if you aposll get outside of yourself and go be a blessing or at least by your voice by phone right somebody send somebody a text well that aposs a seed your sewing that god can bless you wallace pastor joel thank you thanks for sharing your wisdom with us at a time when we all need some and i aposm sure you never thought you were going to be in a situation where you were going to be preaching to an absolutely empty church the probably is your nightmare sir osteen yes it was very unusual to not have any response and i just had to kind of tune out the empty seats but we are blessed to have the technology and you know see so
