national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge in the coming months you re going to hear a lot of analysts repeating that at least 34 house republicans have announced they re retiring or running for a different office and that democrats need to pick up just 24 seats to win back control of the house of representatives that s accurate as far as it goes in addition for the past three cycles the midterm elections have gone badly for the president s party but there s an angle that isn t getting nearly as much discussion a significant number of those retiring house republicans represent districts where the gop traditionally wins and about half of them are districts where the gop candidate usually wins by a wide margin a seat by seat analysis suggests that democrats have only about 14 to 15 really good opportunities to pick up open seats and that republicans might snag some open seats from the democrats too begin with all the appropriate caveats democrats have won some surprising state legislative races in 2017 and we live in an era where dave brat can beat eric cantor so anything can happen it s early in the cycle polling is rare to nonexistent and gop primaries still have to be held a national wave can carry usually uncompetitive districts here are all 34 seats where an incumbent republican is retiring with the likelihood of a gop win in november rated as a yes no or maybe if you start to get concerned remember that most of the districts that are most worrisome for the gop come earlier in the alphabet 1 arizona second

in this district than trump did lobiondo s district is the largest in new jersey encompassing the geographical bottom third of the state this is one of the more republican leaning parts of a heavily democratic state but obama beat romney in this district by about eight points with lobiondo democrats struggled to crack 40 percent but they will like their odds in a good environment and an only

expected to retire as president trump nominated him to be the next administrator of nasa in september but senate democrats deem him unqualified and a few republicans aren t such big fans of his either suggesting that his nomination could be in trouble if bridenstine does get approved he will resign and the state will likely schedule a special election either way the tulsa based district will be

regarding the following four seats on monday the pennsylvania state supreme court ruled that the state s existing district lines are unconstitutional and mandated a new map which is likely to end up

and then used taxpayer funds to settle a complaint about sexual harassment and other improper conduct he pledged to reimburse taxpayers for the 84 000 settlement and then a few weeks later said that on the advice of his lawyers he was waiting to see what changes the house would make to the congressional accountability act before repaying the treasury for republicans fahrenthold s retirement is a

may be trending democratic overall but that s driven by the washington suburbs not districts such as this one which covers the west central portion of the state and includes roanoke lynchburg and most of the shenandoah valley this district has not supported a democrat for president since lyndon johnson and the retiring incumbent bob goodlatte didn t even face a democratic candidate in six of the

presidential election 3 00 clinton 2016 house election 20 2 reichert in just about every cycle since 2004 washington democrats put a bull s eye on retiring incumbent dave reichert and in every cycle they fell short sometimes by just a few thousand votes sometimes by considerably wider margins democratic presidential candidates have carried the eighth district every cycle since 1992 but down ticket democrats just couldn t get over the hump in this large central district that includes parts of king and pierce counties and chelan and kittitas counties this district will undoubtedly be one

up the district scores an r 23 in the cook partisan voting index are republicans likely to keep the seat yes add it all up and you ve got four seats the gop is likely to lose ca 39 ca 49 fl 27 and wa 8 and another four that look like real toss ups az 2 mi 11 nj 2 and pa 15 the remaining are all pretty heavily republican leaning territory again nothing is guaranteed in politics or life and there s a lot of road ahead but if you re the national republican congressional committee and you re trying to ensure that a lot of open seats will stay republican you re pretty happy to fight in the texas suburbs and the more heavily republican parts of ohio pennsylvania and tennessee the other half of the story is that 15 house democrats are retiring and a handful are in districts where the gop has a decent shot each time a republican can win in a currently democrat held u s house seat they increase the odds that the gop will still control the chamber in january 2019 1 minnesota first district

nevada fourth district 2016 presidential election 5 clinton 2016 house election 4 kihuen this is another swing district in nevada covering a huge central portion of the state although the vast majority of the district s voters are concentrated in las vegas it was created in the aftermath of the 2010 census and republican crescent hardy won the first race under the new district lines by three percentage points then rub n kihuen beat hardy by four points in 2016 but kihuen s congressional career hit an early snag with allegations of sexual misconduct from a former staffer and the congressman announced he would not seek reelection this isn t an easy pickup opportunity for republicans but they would be fools to ignore it 4 new hampshire first district 2016 presidential election
