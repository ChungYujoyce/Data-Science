tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion donald trump strutted on the european stage last week and it seems to me put in a boffo performance he wore white tie and tails he charmed queen elizabeth he gave the heroes of normandy what may be sadly their final curtain call beyond the theatrics he signified something his speech commemorating the 75th anniversary of the d day invasion at normandy included a robust defense of nationalism the kind of nationalism he explicitly argued that won world war ii the kind of nationalism he implicitly argued that will be necessary to defeat those waging a war against the west today let me back up for a moment to make sure you re seeing the big picture on the left nationalism has become a dirty word implying nothing less than proto fascism top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick in paris last november at ceremonies commemorating the world war i armistice french president emmanuel macron called nationalism a betrayal of patriotism and the opposite of patriotism he went on to explain more or less that by pursuing our own interests first with no regard to others we erase the very thing that a nation holds most precious that which gives it life and makes it great its moral values president trump sitting a few feet away stared stony faced into the middle distance on the right there is now a sharp split over nationalism at its inaugural conference in washington next month the edmund burke foundation will pose the question is the new american and british nationalism a usurper that has arrived on the scene to displace political conservatism or is nationalism an essential part of the anglo american conservative tradition at its best keynote speakers include national security adviser john bolton and the chairman of the edmund burke foundation yoram hazony an israeli political philosopher and the author of the virtue of nationalism the subject of intense controversy since its publication last fall mr trump has called himself a nationalist and in this speech in others too those in warsaw and riyadh for example he has been putting some meat on that bone he recalled the citizens of free and independent nations who formed an alliance to vanquish the wicked tyranny of the nazi empire he referenced the nobility and fortitude of the british the honor and loyalty of the canadians the gallant french commandoes the fighting poles the tough norwegians and the intrepid aussies he added and finally there were the americans who knew that they carried on their shoulders not just the pack of a soldier but the fate of the world naming nationalities noting differences among them and employing such terms as sovereignty and self rule all this was clearly intended to trigger those who reject the vision of benign nationalism a political order based on free peoples with diverse historical cultural and religious traditions who nonetheless come together against common enemies and in support of common values not least classical liberal values he sees such a political order as clearly preferable to its primary competitor globalism the nations of the west surrendering sovereignty to the u n and other transnational authorities some readers of this column are doubtless thinking but cliff it was a speechwriter not the president who crafted those remarks of course but the task of skilled presidential speech writers peggy noonan peter robinson clark judge and anthony dolan spring to mind has always been to weave their boss ideas instincts and inclinations into a coherent tapestry and every president wields a red pencil interestingly president trump didn t use that pencil to strike out crusade a term prohibited by enforcers of political correctness because it evokes a medieval war between christian and muslim armies president george w bush used that word just once sparking furious criticism the headline in the christian science monitor on sept 19 2001 europe cringes at bush crusade against terrorists i heard no similar response after president trump said that the men who stormed omaha beach had committed their lives in a great crusade and when in his toast to the queen a few days earlier he spoke of world war ii as a great crusade why not let s give the benefit of the doubt to mr trump s critics perhaps they recognized that his use of the term was an homage to gen dwight eisenhower whose memoir of world war ii was titled crusade in europe this too was clever in portsmouth the english city from which the d day forces set out for the french coast president trump read excerpts from the prayer that president franklin d roosevelt had recited in a radio address on june 6 1944 almighty god our sons pride of our nation this day have set upon a mighty endeavor a struggle to preserve our republic our religion and our civilization and to set free a suffering humanity mr trump read against a backdrop of the american flag and a portrait of fdr imagine the reaction had those words been his own did mr trump make any missteps in europe it seems to me he did the interviews he gave should have reinforced the messages he was intending to communicate they distracted from them instead he complained to television host piers morgan that meghan markle the american born duchess of sussex was nasty to me he tweeted something combative about singer bette midler he responded to insults from london mayor sadiq khan by now this seems to me apparent while mr trump is often capable of rising to the occasion he can seldom resist rising to the bait clifford d may is founder and president of the foundation for defense of democracies and a columnist for the washing
