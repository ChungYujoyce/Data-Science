curtain unidentified female we can put the artist in the audience really close together and see what happens wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington we begin with breaking news fox news has confirmed a report there is now a second whistleblower in the trump impeachment case as first reported by abc news another intelligence official has spoken to the intelligence community inspector general and says he has firsthand knowledge of some of the allegations in the original complaint the impeachment inquiry has now formally reached the white house with house democrats issuing a subpoena for records on president trump aposs contacts with ukraine and his request for that country to investigate joe biden president trump acknowledges democrats now have the votes to impeach him but he refuses to comply with their subpoena challenging them to hold a formal vote authorizing their investigation in a moment we aposll speak with two members of the house intelligence committee which is now leading the investigation but we begin with kevin corke live at the white house with the latest kevin kevin corke correspondent chris about on the house for would actually vote for lawmakers that is to be on record on impeachment but the real issue is what happens to those new house democrats especially those who come from those recently flipped red districts begin videotape corke subpoenas from three house committees looking for detailed information about the president aposs conversation with the leader of ukraine the new york times reports a second whistleblower allegedly expressed concern about the president aposs conversation over the weekend skeptical president trump reacted saying coming from in the deep state also with secondhand info the white house is expected as early as monday to tell speaker nancy pelosi it will not cooperate with any requests until the house move forward with the vote trump we will be issuing a letter as everybody knows we aposve been treated very unfairly corke the president also going after critics such as senator mitt romney one of the few republicans to criticize them for calling on foreign powers to investigate the bidens a tweet saturday calling romney a pompous ass and a fool this as pressure builds to release transcripts of former ukraine ambassador kurt volker and intel community inspector general michael atkinson republicans and democrats have accused each other of selective leaks of the men aposs testimonies to shape public opinion end videotape corke again chris the breaking news that we are following a second whistleblower with confirmed her at fox news alleging to have firsthand knowledge of some of the information in that original whistleblower complaint something the white house i aposm sure we aposll have a great deal of interest in chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thank you joining us now from florida congresswoman val demings a democrat on the house intelligence committee and the former orlando police chief congresswoman welcome to fox news sunday rep val demings d fla good morning chris it aposs great to be here wallace based on the witnesses that the committee heard from this week based on the documents that you have received do you believe that there is now hard evidence that president trump committed high crimes and misdemeanors and do you believe that the house will now vote to impeach him demings well chris let me begin here as you aposve already indicated i served a lot of years in law enforcement i had the honor of serving in every rank at my department i even was appointed to chief of police i took that job very seriously as i take this job when i made the decision to run for congress i said that the safety and security of our nation is my number one priority as it should be because that is the foundation i believe that we build the american dream upon i believe if you look at the evidence over the past about 10 days or so right now i think it aposs pretty clear that the president tried to coerce a foreign country into investigating a political rival and use much needed military aid as a condition of the deal when you look at the readout from the administration from the president himself it corroborates everything all of the information that is in the whistleblower aposs report and so we cannot ignore what is painfully or obviously right in front of us and yes i do believe that the president dangerously abused his oath of office and his administrative powers which risks our national security wallace so to again ask you my question directly do you believe he is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and that the house will impeach him demings i believe that an abuse of power as we have seen over the last 10 days that have been so detailed and appropriately laid out by the whistleblower i think the elements are there i think that the evidence we need are there and i do believe based on that that we will have to take a serious look at articles of impeachment wallace what aposs your reaction to the report this morning that there is now a second whistleblower a second intelligence agent apparently he has not filed a complaint yet with your committee but he or she i should say has spoken to the intelligence community aposs inspector general demings well let me just say this chris let aposs deal with the first whistle blower i believe this is a career service employee a public servant i consider him or her a patriot someone who is aware of wrongdoing and has stepped forward at risk i believe to themselves of course i support what senator grassley said last week that we need to protect the whistleblower i aposm concerned about statements that were made from the president about maybe we should handle this person like we used to in the old days and the reporting that a second whistleblower has come forward or is about to come forward i believe again would be someone who sees wrongdoing hears wrongdoing and wants to do something about it wallace now the white house as i pointed out at the beginning that your committee the house has voted to subpoena documents from the white house the white house says that it will not release those documents will not turn them over unless the full house votes to authorize an impeachment inquiry as was done in the cases of bill clinton and richard nixon why is house speaker pelosi refusing to hold a formal impeachment inquiry vote demings well chris let me say this i would hope you know this is been a painful time this past couple of weeks now i would hope that the white house would cooperate with congress and actually acknowledge the oversight that we have a responsibility to do however there is no requirement under the constitution that we have a full house vote there is no requirement under house rules that we have a full house vote and there is no precedent that we have a full house vote that vote that really drives what we do wallace but wait wait wait congresswoman you said there aposs no precedent there aposve only been two times in the history under the rules that we now have andrew johnson back in the 1860s was different in both the bill clinton case and the richard nixon case there was a clear precedent the full house voted and authorized a full impeachment inquiry so there aposs a precedent demings there is no requirement again under the constitution and no requirement under house rules that that is the procedure that we follow but chris let me just say this this past 10 days has been painful for members of the house on both sides of the committee obviously it aposs been quite painful for the senate even though too many senators are quiet on this issue and so we need to conduct a very methodical very thorough investigation we need to talk to all fact witnesses we need to identify or review all documents as we begin the process of making a very very important historical decision crosstalk demings and so based on the information that we have i believe that every american should be painfully concerned about what they have witnessed over the last couple of weeks wallace we also learned this week that the original the first whistleblower originally reached out to the democratic staff of the house intelligence committee all the way back in august and yet on september 17th your chairman adam schiff was asked about any contact with the whistleblower here aposs what he said begin video clip rep adam schiff d calif we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower we would like to end video clip wallace now the washington post gave chairman schiff four pinocchios their highest level of falsehood of dissembling for that comment and here aposs how president trump reacted begin video clip donald trump president i think it aposs a scandal that he knew before i aposd go a step further i think he probably helped write it end video clip wallace first of all is there any excuses for chairman schiff not being upfront and saying yes there was contact and secondly didn apost chairman schiff in effect get advance word maybe it wasn apost detailed but some advance word about the nature of the complaint which led him to push the story even before all of you got the transcript of the president aposs phone call demings chris let me just say this with the president being accused of using his power and abusing his office to coerce a foreign country to assist in an election it aposs kind of amazing that we would try to make the news of the day around centered around chairman schiff aposs words as it pertains to contact with whistleblower chairman schiff has as you know has served several terms in congress he has been a person who has provided exceptional leadership and chairman schiff said he could have stated responded to that question in a more clear way when he was asked the question my understanding is that he was thinking of has the whistleblower come before the committee is the committee aware of the nature of the complaint no the whistleblower had not come before the committee nor was the committee or even staff aware necessarily of the nature of the complaint it was a question about procedure and process wallace all right let me i aposm running out of time so let me ask you my final question there is also criticism of chairman schiff for the way he laid out the way he basically seemed to state president trump aposs phone call with the ukrainian president in that congressional hearing with the director of national intelligence here is chairman schiff begin video clip schiff i have a favor i want from you though and i aposm going to say this only seven times so you better listen good i want you to make up dirt on my political opponent understand lots of it end video clip wallace as president trump says that it aposs just not true it isn apost what the president says you know it aposs one thing because there are questions about chairman schiff he at one time talked about having evidence of collusion in the russia case the special counsel found no evidence of collusion it aposs one thing to talk like that even in a press conference it aposs another thing to make stuff up in a congressional hearing on the possible impeachment of a president demings chris i believe what the special counsel aposs report said was that the elements of conspiracy that the information that they were able to obtain through all of the obstructive efforts to prevent the special counsel from getting all the information that the elements did not rise to the level of charging conspiracy what the president said was after president zelensky indicated that he was ready to purchase more military weaponry the president said but i need you to do me a favor though that aposs not disputed in any way and we know that the president made reference on multiple occasions as a former police detective chris i aposve seen when evidence was so painfully obvious i aposve seen the subject of an investigation turn and attack the investigators we not only see that from this president in this particular case this is something that we have certainly seen before from him wallace right demings we need to keep our eye on the ball wallace congresswoman demings thank you thanks for speaking with us today please come back demings thank you so much i will thank you wallace up next we aposll get reaction to the impeachment inquiry from a republican on the intelligence committee he says the house should take action against the committee chair adam schiff commercial break wallace house republicans are standing firm in their support for president trump and damaging revelations this week have so far done nothing to shake that support joining us now from salt lake city congressman chris stewart a republican on the intelligence committee congressman welcome back to fox news sunday rep chris stewart r ut good morning wallace i want to ask you first about this this new report which fox news has confirmed that there is now a second whistleblower in this case who has spoken to the inspector general for the intelligence community says he has firsthand knowledge that corroborates some of the allegations made by the first whistleblower does that concern you stewart well actually not at all first we aposve known a little bit that this individual was probably going to come forward and one of our concerns has always been there hasn apost been firsthand knowledge of this the first whistleblower virtually everything that he accused was second and third hand knowledge but chris it does not matter this person is going to come forward and say yes the president had this phone call and yes that aposs the transcript i mean why should i care at all what his perspective or his opinion and judgment of this transcript is you and i can read it wallace but but sir stewart we can make our own judgments of it wallace conceivably and the and and the allegation by the first whistleblower and a lot of it has already been corroborated if ph it wasn apost just this phone call that there was a whole campaign before the phone call and then even more intensely after the phone call involving the president aposs private lawyer rudy giuliani to link support for the ukrainian regime even military aid to an investigation of joe biden stewart yes wallace so so stewart yes but wallace it aposs more than just a phone call stewart but chris that aposs just not true i mean all of these accusations he makes about linkage after he just pulled from the new york times and from the washington post there aposs no classified or secret information in that it all comes down to this one thing it comes down to one sentence in one phone call and when you read that in its entirety it aposs very clear he doesn apost ever link it to military aid it aposs never even mentioned he doesn apost ever offer a quid pro quo he never even mentions the upcoming election he talks about one thing we want to investigate corruption and i think that aposs a reasonable thing for him to ask and these other assumptions are things that some people in their judgment are concerning but it aposs simply not found in this phone call wallace ok let aposs let let aposs stewart and anyone can read it wallace let aposs unpack what you what you just said here because president trump made it very clear this week he says his call for ukraine and now china to investigate allegations against vice president biden and his son hunter have nothing to do with the 2020 election as you contended take a look begin video clip trump i aposm only interested in corruption i don apost care about politics i don apost care about biden aposs politics i never thought biden was going to win to be honest end video clip wallace congressman can you tell me of any other instance during the time president trump has been in office where he asked a foreign leader to investigate a specific american on the issue of corruption stewart you bet attorney general barr is doing it right now wallace no no no i asked i forgive me i said president trump can you tell me of another instance where president trump on a conversation a call has publicly or privately asked for a foreign leader to investigate a specific american stewart yet absolutely now look he may have done it personally but it doesn apost matter chris there aposs no difference between the president making the call or the president saying to attorney general barr or other of his subordinates you make the call and investigate this and he aposs been very clear on that wallace so but the answer is you cannot ph stewart they want to go back wallace you i mean i don apost mean to interrupt but you can apost tell me of another case where we have a record of the president specifically asking for a foreign leader to investigate a specific american stewart i aposm saying he aposs he aposs willingly and and acknowledged that he aposs doing that through his attorney general wallace and and other than joe biden can you tell me of another i mean there are millions of americans who do business overseas all kinds of activities stewart yes wallace do you think it aposs just a coincidence that the one person that he has asked a foreign leader to investigate specifically by name investigate this person just happens to be his chief rival for the 2020 campaign stewart but but chris you aposre missing the whole reason for why he did that because he has knowledge of possible corruption i mean vice president biden and his son he was dragging his son to the two countries that the vice president had primary responsibility for ukraine and china and he aposs taking his son to those two countries with him and while he aposs doing official business his son is signing in some cases 1 5 billion deals and i think that a lot of people when they americans when they hear that they think you know what that doesn apost sound right to me maybe it aposs worth asking a few questions about that that aposs all the president is doing here wallace and you think it aposs just a coincidence that i mean there are a lot of businessmen doing a lot of business a lot bigger than a billion dollars and the only person that he asked for incidentally we should point out there has never never been a specific allegation of any crime committed i mean i does it look bad of course it does but there aposs never been an allegation of a specific crime that joe biden or hunter biden committed stewart yes wallace and and neither in china nor in ukraine you don apost think you think it aposs just a coincidence that he aposs talking about joe biden stewart well but chris you keep using that word coincidence it aposs not a coincidence at all it is just that those are the facts presented to him and he aposs responding to those facts if someone else brought other accusations against other americans and and they had reason to investigate that i i aposm sure the president would as well but these were the facts that were brought to him and these were the individuals that were associated with those facts wallace all right i want i want to pick up on what you said at the very top which is that there is no quid pro no linkage between president trump aposs asking the ukrainian president zelensky to investigate joe biden and u s support including 400 million in military aid to ukraine there are a number of documents that your committee has received this week and bear with me i aposm going to go through just three of them and read them july 25th this is the morning before the phone call between zelensky and trump u s envoy volker to a ukrainian aid heard from the white house assuming president z convinces trump he will investigate get to the bottom of what happened in 2016 we will nail down date for visit to washington august 10th the ukrainian aide to volker once we have a date for zelensky to visit trump we aposll call a press briefing announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of u s ukraine relationship including other things burisma that aposs the company where hunter biden was on the board and election meddling in investigation finally september 1st the top u s diplomat in ukraine bill taylor to ambassador gordon sondland are we now saying that security assistance and white house meeting are conditioned on investigations sondland call me now sondland later says that there was no quid pro quo but i aposve got to tell you you read these e mails both before and after and i just took three congressman it seems that ukrainian officials and some top american officials saw sure saw a quid pro quo stewart yes i chris it aposs just it aposs just not true and this is a great example of the dishonesty of how this investigation is being run and i wish we could elaborate that on chairman schiff and the dishonesty that he has displayed this is another example of it they take little snippets of e mails and texts they leak those without releasing the transcript if you released the transcript of this of this entire hearing it aposs very clear that mr volker and others have said there was no quid pro quo there was no linkage between us ph when you read the transcript of what the president says he aposs very clear the reason he aposs withholding aid is because he wants to pressure the europeans particularly mr ms merkel in germany that they have been dragging their feet for months on this and by the way we heard as early as late spring that they were probably going to withhold this aid we had been hearing those of us who work in national security they were going to do that to pressure the europeans this is just an example of hey let aposs go sneak some stuff out there and let the press run with it for a while and eventually the transcript will show that it aposs not true but by then we aposll already have done our damage it aposs malicious for them to to to leak like this and to not do it fairly wallace all right i i got one final question for you you are a member of the utah congressional delegation and over the weekend president trump has really gone after utah senator mitt romney i want to put up some tweets he has called him a quote pompous ass a quote fool and added the hashtag quote impeachmittromney of course senators can apost be impeached but congressman do you have any problem with the president going after your senator that way stewart chris i aposm shocked you aposd ask me this question right look i know that the media loves for republicans to criticize each other to fight with wallace i but we aposre i aposm not criticizing stewart i aposm saying well look wallace i aposm not criticizing another ph republicans stewart i know you aposre not wallace it aposs the president who called mitt romney a pompous ass stewart i know you aposre not but you aposre hoping that i will i aposll criticize one or the other and i aposm just not going to and i aposm just not going to wallace i aposm i aposm just asking you whether well ok i aposm just asking you what do you think stewart i aposm just going to say you know what mitt romney is a big boy president trump aposs a big boy they can settle their differences i aposm not going to weigh in on that i mean they aposve had disagreements in the past and i understand that wallace final stewart i aposve got to come back to one one thing real quick chris and that aposs ms demings who i have a lot of respect for she said something earlier i just think i have to respond to she says there aposs been a lot of pain over the last 10 days oh my gosh these guys are giddy over this they aposre not paining over this and it aposs not been the last 10 days it aposs been three years three years they aposve been trying to impeach this president three years they aposve been looking for reasons to remove him from office they aposre not pained by this they aposre excited about this and it aposs and it but it aposs terribly divisive for the american people wallace thank you for that statement congressman stewart thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir stewart thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss where the house investigation stands now after a hectic week of witnesses documents and presidential pushback plus what would you like to ask the panel about whether there needs to be a vote in the full house to launch an impeachment inquiry just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up president trump concedes the house has the votes to impeach him and sent his case to the senate begin video clip trump so the democrats unfortunately they have the votes they can vote very easily even though most of them many of them don apost believe they should do it end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about chances for impeachment next commercial break begin video clip rep adam schiff d calif it aposs hard to imagine a set of circumstances that would have alarmed the founders more than what aposs on that call trump not a thing wrong unless you heard the adam schiff version where he made up my conversation he actually made it up it should be criminal it should be treasonous end video clip wallace well the bruising war of words this week between president trump and house intel committee chair adam schiff as schiff takes the lead in the impeachment probe and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove fox news political analyst juan williams julie pace washington bureau chief of the associated press and senator mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff josh holmes karl at this point and i understand we aposre just probably at the beginning of this process who aposs winning the argument the democrats making the case for the impeachment the president making the case that basically democrats are just out to get him and add into your answer the fact that there now is the second whistleblower karl rove contributor yes well first of all i aposd say if you look at the polls the numbers for impeachment have grown so you aposd suggest the democrats are winning the argument but i think they aposre both losing the argument the president should not have said what he said on that call with ukraine he should not have said what he said to china but on the other hand the democrats are far from making the case that this is worthy of removing the president from office and they aposre going about it in the wrong way they aposre rushing to judgment they want to get this thing done by thanksgiving it aposs going to take them probably until christmas and they want to do it in a highly partisan way a wonderful article this week by robert doar the presidency of the american enterprise institute whose father john doar a republican was chosen by peter rodino judiciary committee chairman as the council for the impeachment committee the house voted to to to formally move forward there was a unified staff the president was allowed to have his counsel present at all hearings and depositions to receive all documents to state the president aposs position at the end of the testimony there was all the evidence was received initially behind closed doors so we didn apost have a bunch of hot dogs and rodino operated in a strictly non partisan way none of that is being done here this time it is being done just the opposite by adam schiff and and and the country is not going to be well served by this process wallace we asked you just picking up on this we asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of nancy pelosi aposs decision not to hold a formal vote to launch this probe we got this on twitter from nurse gwendo i am a democrat and i am for an impeachment inquiry i don apost understand why the democrats don apost want a vote i believe americans want to see the vote josh following up on nurse gwendo the white house is apparently going to refuse to release documents to comply with the subpoena based on the argument that it is challenging the house to hold a formal impeachment vote do you think they can turn this into a debate over process josh holmes former chief of staff to sen mitch mcconnell well sure i think they can because democrats have largely made it a debate over process i mean look i that nurse has an absolutely excellent point what nancy pelosi has been trying to do for the better part of two years and actually since they won the majority in the house in 2018 is to try to deflect and distract the base of her party and the base of her conference away from impeachment because she knows the politics are no good now they had to get there one way or another i would argue that it was inevitable they were going to find a reason to justify this one way or another but she does not want on the front end of all of this to put all of those moderate house democrats those freshman who are in purple and red districts on the record on the front end of an impeachment inquiry to try to convict this president it is horrible politics for her it is horrible politics for that conference and i think she could lose the majority if she went on the road wallace so do you think this is an argument over process over or over what the president did or didn apost do juan williams political analyst well i think the president would like it to be an argument over process because we know what he did i mean everybody can read the letter for themselves and this week you can also read the text that went back and forth between diplomats that again was quite explicit in saying the president wants president zelensky of the ukraine to agree to this kind of investigation probe of joe biden in exchange for the military aid and a meeting at the white house but in terms of the process i think it aposs very important to say there aposs nothing in the constitution nothing in house rules that says you have to have an upfront vote in fact i think the president of the united states wants an upfront vote both for the reasons that josh elucidated which is to say i aposm going to put some of his moderate democrats on the spot but also i think he wants it to slow down the process a little bit he wants to it aposs interesting to me that he wants that wallace ok let me back up for a second because people say well he doesn apost want to do it because i mean he it that she doesn apost want to do it because she would put those 31 house democrats who were won in districts that trump won in 2016 williams right wallace more importantly than that if you had a house vote and it was 99 percent democrats for it and 99 percent republicans are against it wouldn apost that just put the lie to the idea that there is any bipartisanship in this wouldn apost that in effect say it aposs a party line vote williams excuse me we live in highly polarized times and people such as the people you interview this morning are clearly lined up by tribe or team but that doesn apost take away from the reality and that aposs why i say the vote is basically an effort by the white house to distract from what we know and can read for ourselves in that letter and in the texts that were released this week wallace ok the president seemed to concede friday that the house will impeach him and send the issue of his removal to a trial in the senate take a look begin video clip trump so if they proceed and you know they aposll just get their people they aposre all in line because even though many of them don apost want to vote they have no choice they have to follow their leadership and then we aposll get it to the senate and we aposre going to win end video clip wallace julie is impeachment now inevitable that the house will vote to impeach the president and secondly almost everybody in washington republicans especially have been saying what where aposs the war room where is the president aposs concerted effort to deal with this issue and the war room seems to be whatever is in president trump aposs head is there from what you aposre talking to your white house sources do they have a strategy here julie pace the associated press on the first question i think impeachment is likely inevitable at this point the fact that nancy pelosi took this step to launch the inquiry means she knows where her caucus is on that latter question at this point and the fact that the whistleblower complaint that aposs at the center of this has largely been proven to be true based on documents that are now public i think bolsters her her case there on the white house strategy this has caught the white house off guard it caught a lot of us off guard that we aposre suddenly in impeachment right now but the white house was not prepared to be in this situation right now and so the strategy is basically the president aposs twitter account he is leading his own defense it aposs vastly different than what we saw in the clinton impeachment were clinton himself tried to act as though he was governing act as though he was he was doing things on behalf of the american people trump is all in on impeachment he is going to be leading his own defense i think the big question for the white house right now though is about their their practical cooperation with congress if they choose to stonewall on documents an interview aposs that actually guarantees his impeachment and the article of impeachment that it focuses on obstruction of congress is a is a is a definite for democrats at this point wallace josh you are our senate expert as the former chief of staff to mitch mcconnell let aposs assume the house votes sometime november december whatever to impeach the president it goes to the senate they need two thirds 67 votes there are 47 democrats that means that you would need 20 republicans to jump ship and go with the democrats to remove the president that aposs assuming that all the democrats vote to remove which we don apost necessarily know is true does it matter what the evidence is or is it just impossible that 20 republicans will jump ship and vote to remove this president holmes well it aposs highly unlikely it aposs not irrelevant what the evidence is but what i i think what julie laid out is what house democrats are doing to try to prosecute this that will result in an almost entirely partisan process in the house if that results in an entirely partisan vote in the house and it comes over to the senate i imagine it will be dealt with very similarly in an entirely partisan way i haven apost seen you know to juan aposs earlier point we live in polarizing times no kidding i mean i i think right now almost every republican in the entire district of columbia looks at adam schiff with zero credibility there is nothing that this guy can put out in front of anyone that any of them believe and more often than not we find out two or three weeks down the road that it was complete made up anyway wallace ok ok i one last quick question we aposre running out of time you aposre stealing from the next panel with whatever your answer is here you were mitch mcconnell aposs chief of staff he said and you know he aposs he aposs playing chess three dimensional chess when we aposre all playing checkers they asked him if it aposs impeach and it goes to the house will there be a trial he said under senate rules i have to take it up holmes yes wallace does that mean a trial or does that mean he just puts it up says are we going to take this up there aposs a vote no and there aposs never any trial holmes so the rules of the senate are really specific on this and it aposs unlike sort of the merrick garland and the way wallace we need a short view here holmes the way that everybody views it is basically that mcconnell can make a decision one way or another whether to take it up you can apost in the impeachment articles that come over for the senate you have to consider it it comes to the floor it displaces everything else the senate will have to deal with it one way or another wallace well you didn apost answer the question though deal with it can that just be a vote or do they have to have a trial holmes well they aposre going to have to have a vote to dismiss it if nothing else wallace right he could have to but he could do that holmes there will have to be a vote sure it could be it could be that or it could have a full trial i mean i think a lot of this depends on what the house ultimately ends up doing wallace all right panel we have to take a break here when we come back the impeachment inquiries impact on 2020 and brand new fox news poll on where the race for president stands right now commercial break begin video clip trump but biden and his son are stone cold crooked you know it and so do we biden he is unhinged i worry about what he aposs going to do not about me or my family i worry about what he aposll do in the next year in the presidency as this thing continues to rot on his watch end video clip wallace democratic frontrunner joe biden engaged in a running battle this week with president trump over whether his son hunter aposs work in ukraine and china while he was vice president was a conflict of interest and we have brand new fox polls that show biden with a continued strength in two key states in south carolina biden still has a commanding lead with support from 41 percent of democratic primary voters elizabeth warren is a distant second at 12 percent and bernie sanders at 10 biden aposs lead up six points from july and in the key swing state of wisconsin which helped put mr trump over the top in 2016 biden leads the president by nine points sanders and warren also beat mr trump but they are within the margin of error and we aposre back now with the panel karl i think most people would agree whether what biden and his son did in ukraine and china was illegal it stunk rove yes it aposs really stinky wallace it it it just smells it was it aposs classic swamp but couldn apost you argue and and the president has been hammering him on that couldn apost you argue that at this point with the campaign and we aposll get into some of the details that it aposs somewhat faltering that president trump aposs continued targeting of joe biden may be the best thing biden has going for him right now rove well it would be if biden knew how to respond the president started going after him the weekend of september 16th and his first real tough response was october 5th delivered late in the afternoon on the west coast so that none of us saw it and it was how dare you attack my family ironically biden aposs best defense would be to say you know what in retrospect i should have said something to hunter about getting off that burisma board while i aposm while i aposm focused on corruption in ukraine and said you aposve got to make a living someplace else but he didn apost so the more that he says how dare you attack my family the more we talk about the stinky arrangement and the stinkier it gets but yes no it aposs it aposs it aposs weird people have exit ramps here biden has an exit ramp the president if the president went out and said you know what i do want john durham to investigate all these questions about ukraine and i do want the attorney general to be in touch with his opposite numbers in ukraine but maybe i shouldn apost have said that about ukraine and china that aposs an off ramp for him and people say you know what ok fine but nobody is looking for an off ramp they aposre looking for a raucous fight wallace and let aposs look because i was talking about biden aposs campaign let aposs look at the fundraising numbers for the third quarter which are pretty dramatic on the screen bernie sanders in the third quarter of this year raised 25 million and elizabeth warren 24 6 million pete buttigieg 19 million and all the way back in fourth place the supposed frontrunner for the democratic nomination joe biden at 15 2 million josh do you think that at some point president trump may come to regret his efforts to get joe biden out of this race holmes no because he aposs because he aposs well i mean it aposs an easy question i think the fundraising is a very interesting component of this because as the world of politics has adapted the joe biden aposs of the world have not right they all everybody aposs gone to the digital low dollar sort of renewable resource to try to keep your campaign funded he had a huge boom bang max out dollar thing first quarter and now here he is in fourth place what is he going to do in the fourth quarter it aposs not going to get better and it aposs not going to get better in the first quarter of next year either he aposs going to be outspent and outraised four five six to one down the stretch all of it because you know frankly this campaign is a little antiquated rove it may get better in this next quarter for him because he is trump aposs target and he aposs i aposm my inbox is inundated with joe aposs requests if joe wants me to send him 5 joe aposs upset about trump look at what trump is saying about me or saying wallace let me just say if they aposre sending karl rove messages their campaign is antiquated all right rove somebody has signed me up for all these different candidates wallace ok rove inaudible wallace then let aposs look at the potential damage to president trump in all of this for 2020 and i want to play a clip of mike pence he wasn apost vice president then but this was in the vice presidential debate back in 2016 take a look begin video clip mike pence vice president october 4 2016 now you all need to know out there this is this is basic stuff foreign donors and certainly foreign governments cannot participate in the american political process end video clip wallace juan williams well wallace mike pence basic stuff foreign governments can apost participate in our elections how badly do you think what we aposve heard so far and and you know it aposs not just a whistleblower complaint because a lot has been corroborated by what the white house turned over and what we found out from two officials from the state department this week how badly do you think the president has been hurt by the revelations so far williams well the polls show that it has hurt him and you know we aposve all said that there aposs increasing numbers of people who not only now favor impeachment by the way those numbers include house democrats increased number in those who said they aposre now they want impeachment but it also is an indication more people say they want conviction in the senate i think it aposs 44 percent in the latest usa today poll which was a surprise to me but what you get here is i think that the president aposs base will be hardened in terms of support by impeachment they will see this as people picking on the president the president makes the case he was duly elected these people are involved in a coup if not treason they aposre just trying to undo because they aposre losers but the contrary impact i think will be that you will start to see moderates i think you aposll start to see especially suburban white women in states like wisconsin michigan pennsylvania ohio just turned off by all the static all the noise all the recrimination i think it there hurts the president aposs re election bid wallace julie what aposs your sense of how worried they are at the white house and how worried they are inside the trump campaign assuming that this doesn apost end up with a removal in the senate and i think we all agree that aposs over the overwhelmingly likely result how much does this damage his prospects for 2020 pace i think i think trump allies and advisors are still looking at this situation very much like they looked at the mueller investigation feeling like the tactics that they used having trump cast this as a hoax as a witch hunt will be enough to carry him through that his base remained loyal that they will look at this as a partisan process and trump will be able to to sort of message and tweet his way his way out of this what you are privately though and i know josh has heard this too from republicans what you hear privately from a lot of republicans in washington right now is that they do think that this is different they do think that a if democrats are able and it aposs a big if if they are able to do this if they are able to carry out a process that looks serious that focuses not on trump personally but on his actions in office on the idea of abusing his office for personal gain that that message could resonate with exactly the type of people that juan is talking about women in the suburbs this is an election that could swing completely on those voters and they are already voters who have moved away from trump over the last several months wallace i aposve got half a minute karl and you can apost clear her throat and half a minute so i aposm going to i know we he didn apost like that how about for the president and how bad for congressional republicans who are just standing by their man rove well look house republicans are going to get an advantage because there are 19 democrats in seats that trump won by four points or more 31 in seats that he won 43 in republican seats so they aposre going to be helped republican senators on the other hand in places like arizona and colorado and maine states that are going to be close or leaning away from trump are going to be problematic but look i we don apost know how this is all going to play out thank god from the white house they ought to say every morning for adam schiff being in charge of this process it aposs isn apost it amazing the chairman of the house judiciary committee jerrold nadler has poof disappeared and he has been replaced by adam schiff who aposs about the most partisan guy you could ever imagine channeling his inner martin scorsese wallace ok and i and i was going to say they put in schiff because they thought nadler was a bad face for the for the whole thing rove yes wallace thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week bringing jfk aposs vision for the arts into the 21st century commercial break wallace it aposs recognized as a living memorial to john f kennedy and it aposs the nation aposs busiest performing arts center but it has just expanded its mission for the 21st century here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape deborah rutter president kennedy center we need a place that is informal inviting and a place where we can put the artist and the audience really close together and see what happens and the reach was born wallace voice over deborah rutter is president of the kennedy center and the reach is the center aposs sprawling striking addition to create a new link in the performing arts the center opened in 1971 and over time the staff felt it was a bit unwelcoming as people came to sit and watch rutter the downside of that is that somebody aposs on stage and you aposre in the audience and there aposs no connection wallace the 250 million reach opened in september and is exactly what its name implies built for these times to reach out to audiences rutter you want to know the artist you want to know the process from which the art was created you want to know the back story you want to know where did they buy that beautiful costume there aposs a much deeper connection wallace it is a living interactive complex with 11 performance spaces that honor the 35th president including the moon shot room but the remarkable pavilions are in service of an ambitious mission people can walk around and see artists and their works at all stages from creation and tinkering to the final product like oscar winning composer alan menken who wrote the music for little shop of horrors and beauty and the beast conducting a master class alan menken oscar winning composer you know we aposre taking you through the town and we aposre learning bell is different she doesn apost want to be in this provincial town wallace the reach opened with a two week festival 500 events that attracted more than 100 000 people rutter to see the place filled with families bike riders or scooters that come up the bridge and go through the garden it has been an experience that you dream of in a career but you aposre not sure you will ever experience directly and i have wallace on camera how happy are you with all of this rutter ecstatic wallace voice over rutter says the reach is built for accidents a jogger peeking in a window and seeing a dance rehearsal we were walking through a field of flowers wallace on camera so this is the kind of accident you aposre talking about not in the arts rutter right wallace but here aposs a gorgeous butterfly in the middle of rutter it makes you feel like you aposre in nature while you aposr
