thanks for contacting us we ve received your submission opinion by ryan grim submit october 15 2019 4 49pm updated october 15 2019 5 13pm while democrats want the press and voters to concentrate on president trump s phone call with ukraine the problem for democrats is that a review of hunter biden s career shows clearly that he along with joe biden s brother james has been trading on their family name for decades cashing in on the implication and sometimes the explicit argument that giving money to a member of joe biden s family wins the favor of joe biden argues ryan grim at the intercept trump s behavior may be shameless grim says but that doesn t mean biden s history isn t an issue he writes in this excerpt in trading on his father s name and power to advance his career hunter biden is following in the footsteps of james biden joe s younger brother it began small in 1973 one year after joe biden was elected to the senate at age 29 james biden opened the nightclub seasons change with what politico referencing contemporaneous local reporting in delaware called unusually generous bank loans when james ran into trouble joe as a senator later complained that the bank shouldn t have loaned james the money what i d like to know biden told the news journal in 1977 is how the guy in charge of loans let it get this far the paper investigated and sources at the bank said that the loan was made because james was joe s brother james in the 90s founded lion hall group which lobbied for mississippi trial lawyers involved in tobacco litigation according to curtis wilkie s book the fall of the house of zeus the trial lawyers wanted james biden s help pushing joe biden on tobacco legislation that same decade in 1996 hunter biden got in the game fresh out of law school with thousands of options before him he chose to go work for mbna then a dominant issuer of credit cards while also serving as biden s deputy campaign manager mbna was one of the most powerful corporations in delaware a state with no shortage of major companies thanks to its lax tax and regulatory approach and has since been absorbed by bank of america biden in the 1990s was known half jokingly as the senator from mbna though he didn t find it funny i m not the senator from mbna he said in 1999 he was however mbna s greatest champion in the senate throughout the 1990s bankruptcies were on the rise and mbna began pushing hard to reform the law to make it harder for people to discharge debt the controversy brought elizabeth warren into politics a well known bankruptcy law professor she was appointed to a commission to review the law which began her decades long clash with biden in 2001 hunter biden transitioned full time to a federal lobbyist though he stayed on the payroll of mbna as a consultant until 2005 when president george w bush signed biden s bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act into law it was a savage piece of legislation and joe biden even worked to block an amendment that would have offered bankruptcy protection to people with medical debt the bill also blocked people from discharging private student loan debt under bankruptcy total student loan debt was under 400 billion in 2005 it surged in the wake of the law s passage and is now over 1 5 trillion hunter biden s transparent cashing in on his name was becoming a political liability for his father so joe biden pushed him to find non lobbying work anthony lotito a new york financial adviser said in a complaint he filed in a new york state court james and hunter in a separate filing denied that joe biden had made the call to lotito that joe biden saw hunter s work as politically damaging enough to him in 2005 demonstrates that he was entirely aware of the appearance it gave of corruption his solution was to help hunter and james into their positions at a financial firm paradigm global advisors in 2007 james biden teamed up again with some of the tobacco lawyers from the previous decade planning to launch a lobbying firm that hunter would also be involved in again the affair became a political problem for biden thanks to a sordid moment in which james biden s two prospective partners were caught on an fbi wiretap saying we really need to push on the senate bill and we re going to meet with the bidens around noon apparently in reference to legislation to compensate black farmers for discrimination the firm never came to fruition because one of the bidens potential partners was arrested that year biden launched his second failed presidential bid but he wound up on the ticket with barack obama serving the next eight years as vice president hunter s relationship with mbna became a political problem again a 2008 new york times story headlined obama aides defend bank s pay to biden son reads like deja vu obama aides said he had never lobbied for mbna and that there was nothing improper about the payments which were reported to be 100 000 per year news that the university of delaware had paid biden s firm millions and gotten many millions more in earmarks also caused the vice presidential nominee trouble in the meantime paradigm global advisors fared poorly and shut down in 2010 james quickly found new work joining a construction firm in november 2010 in june 2011 while joe biden was overseeing iraq policy the firm won a 1 5 billion contract building homes in iraq the company s founder irvin richter told fox business network that having james on board helped listen his name helps him get in the door but it doesn t help him get business he said people who have important names tend to get in the door easier but it doesn t mean success if he had the name obama he would get in the door easier hunter meanwhile went into business with the stepson of former secretary of state john kerry chris heinz forming the firm rosemont seneca along with partners devon archer and eric schwerin in 2012 archer and hunter biden connected with jonathan li who ran a chinese private equity fund bohai capital and began talks about working together they did a large real estate deal together in 2013 and began setting up a joint fund in late 2013 hunter biden traveled with his father on official business to china where he introduced the vice president to his partner li the new firm bohai harvest rst as the intercept reported earlier this year would go on to invest in facial recognition technology used to surveil china s muslim population as part of its ongoing cultural genocide operation the firm according to the wall street journal planned to raise 1 5 billion in capital trump and his attorney rudy giuliani have since contorted that reality into the notion that china simply handed hunter biden 1 5 billion i wonder where the hell that money is man because i ve got to pay tuitions biden has since responded god bless me and then there s ukraine in february 2014 hunter biden less than a year after enlisting in the navy was discharged for testing positive for cocaine but a new opportunity was about to present itself that same month protesters in kiev s maidan overthrew the government of viktor yanukovych in ukraine sparked by the government s unwillingness to sign an association agreement with the european union the new government leaned heavily toward the west and away from russia and a jockeying for wealth and power shook the ruling class remnants of the old regime became targets and one of those was burisma holdings owned by mykola zlochevsky an oligarch and former government official tied to yanukovych regulators in london had seized more than 20 million in cash from the firm amid claims by rivals that it had compiled its assets illegally zlochevsky needed western bona fides and he needed them fast so hunter biden was brought on board heinz wanted no part of it a spokesperson told the washington post that mr heinz strongly warned mr archer that working with burisma was unacceptable mr archer stated that he and hunter biden intended to pursue the opportunity as individuals not as part of the firm the post reported the lack of judgment in this matter was a major catalyst for mr heinz ending his business relationships with mr archer and mr biden the new yorker article details hunter biden s struggles with drugs and alcohol which included run ins with the law and stints in rehab one particularly out of control bender which involved a crack pipe found in a rental car took place while biden was making 50 000 a month serving on the board of burisma in 2014 he was gracing the front page of the company s website according to web archives the republican narrative that has built up around the case since claims that biden would later go to ukraine to help hunter s company escape the justice of an investigation by the ukrainian prosecutor general viktor shokin in fact shokin was busy protecting burisma from the western investigators and gave the company a letter asserting that he had no evidence they had done anything wrong that letter helped unfreeze the money in london so the us vice president s intervention in ukraine seems to have gone against the interests of his son not boosted them but hunter biden s very presence on the board of the company itself corrupted the process creating the appearance that the americans were hypocritical about their talk of corruption and self dealing at the time here s how daria kaleniuk head of ukraine s anti corruption action center put it to the wall street journal if an investigator sees the son of the vice president of the united states is part of the management of a company that investigator will be uncomfortable pushing the case forward that of course is simply obvious and it is the entire reason hunter biden was paid so handsomely to do nothing but sell his name to the company that s corruption enough originally published on october 9 2019 edited and republished with permission from the intercept an award winning
