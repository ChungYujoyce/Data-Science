institutions airlines and other tourism and travel industry businesses transportation was shut down in wuhan the city of 11 million at the epicenter of the outbreak and in at least 12 other cities in central china s hubei province encompassing a population bigger than that of new york london paris and moscow combined and authorities in beijing and other cities canceled many public celebrations and other events marking lunar new year which falls on saturday hospitals in wuhan grappled with a flood of patients and a lack of supplies videos circulating online showed throngs of frantic people in masks lined up for examinations and some complained that family members had been turned away at hospitals that were at capacity authorities in wuhan and elsewhere put out calls for medicine disinfection equipment masks goggles gowns and other protective gear wuhan officials said they are rapidly constructing a new hospital to deal with the crisis to be completed feb 3 it will be modeled on a sars hospital that was built in beijing in just six days during the sars outbreak the seriousness of the crisis was still an open question the new virus comes from a large family of what are known as coronaviruses some causing nothing worse than a cold but it is not clear just how lethal this coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as ordinary flu which kills tens of thousands of people every year in the u s alone scientists say it is also not clear if it spreads as easily as sars its genetic cousin which also originated in china and killed about 800 people in 2002 03 the rapid increase in reported deaths and illnesses does not necessarily mean the crisis is getting worse it could instead reflect better monitoring and reporting of the newly discovered virus which can cause cold and flu like symptoms including cough fever and shortness of breath but can worsen to pneumonia it s still too early to draw conclusions about how severe the virus is because at the beginning of any outbreak you would focus more on the severe cases said tarik jasarevic a spokesman for the world health organization in geneva and then maybe we are missing some mild cases because people will just be a little bit sick and will not have it tested and they will recover in france health minister agnes buzyn said that two infected patients had traveled in china and that france should brace for more such cases a third case was announced in a statement from her ministry about three hours later we see how difficult it is in today s world to close the frontiers in reality it s not possible she said buzyn said authorities are seeking to reach anyone who might have come in contact with the patients it s important to control the fire as quickly as possible in the u s the
