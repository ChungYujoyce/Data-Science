minority leader happy anniversary mr president your wish came true you wanted a shutdown the trump shutdown is all yours rep steny hoyer d maryland we will not back down because republicans are unwilling to compromise sen mitch mcconnell r ky majority leader we believe that the issue of illegal immigration is more important than everything else mick mulvaney white house budget director it aposs still a schumer budget so i got that nice little ring to it doesn apost it wallace partisan finger pointing and uncertainty after a standoff in the senate over immigration we aposll discuss the fallout for americans and who will get the blame with white house budget director mick mulvaney and democratic senator chris coons part of a bipartisan group trying to work out a compromise plus donald trump president of the united states i donald john trump do solemnly swear wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the trump presidency one year after his inauguration and our power player of the week the story behind the first combat teams on the ground after the september 11th attacks how soon after 9 11 did you know you were going to work unidentified female i knew the minute the second airplane hit the second tower wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington congress is still here this weekend still trying to reach a deal to reopen the government after the clock ran out on funding midnight friday the shutdown coinciding with the one year anniversary of the trump presidency the president cancelled a trip to florida to stay in washington until they reach a compromise this hour we aposll discuss the way forward with white house budget chief mick mulvaney and democratic senator chris part of a small group trying to make a deal but let aposs bring in chief congressional correspondent mike emanuel live on capitol hill with the latest mike mike emanuel fox news chief congressional correspondent well chris there are no visible signs of progress in ending this government shutdown in fact things have gotten pretty personal with the senate majority leader blasting his counterpart chuck schumer begiin videotape mcconnell the president would not give him everything he wants on the issue of illegal immigration in one afternoon in the oval office emanuel republicans were quick to brand it the schumer shutdown after senate democrats blocked a four week government funding extension late friday night it also would have provided a six year extension of health insurance to an estimated 9 million children democrats held out for a deal on the so called dreamers young people brought to this country illegally by their parents and now sound like they are adding to their demands sen chuck schumer d ny senate minority leader at this point we feel very very strongly about the issues not just dreamers but opioids pensions not funding the military on c r basis and we feel the american people are on our side emanuel house lawmakers aggravated after they passed a government funding extension and it was rejected by senate democrats that led to this dustup on the house floor taking aim at schumer unidentified male majority in the house and majority in the senate have voted to prevent the shutdown and keep the government open unidentified male bring the poster to the chair for his observation end videotape emanuel soon the shutdown will get real if by monday morning there is no deal and much of the federal workforce is on furlough chris wallace not good if they are arguing over posters mike emanuel reporting from capitol hill mike thank you joining me now the white house budget chief mick mulvaney the man in charge of implementing the government shutdown director welcome back to fox news sunday mick mulvaney white house budget director good morning thank you again for having me wallace describe the extent of the shutdown both in terms of personnel and programs mulvaney sure as of yesterday federal agencies started setting up their furlough notices there aposs really three categories of employees those who will come to work on monday those who will not come to work on monday and is actually a small group that will come to work on monday for about four hours to help shut things down and then they will leave as well those notices went out yesterday and that over the course of the next couple days we aposll start to see agencies trying to implement their shutdown plans which is going to be different chris than it was in 2013 as we try to work to keep more agencies open in fact i talked to the president late i guess it was friday night he said look mick we need to work hard to keep as many of these folks at work and keep as many of these agencies open as we can so that aposs the shutdown plan that we aposre implementing right now wallace where will we see the effects first regular american see the effects and where will we see the biggest effects mulvaney the effects actually won apost be as visible as they were in 2013 keep in mind 2013 the only way i can describe it is the obama administration shows to weaponize the shutdown they want it to be very showy they went out of their way to hurt more people and to be more visible you remember maybe the barricades up in front of the world war ii memorial to keep the vets away from their own memorial you won apost see that this year the national parks will be open the trash won apost get picked up but crosstalk wallace but it aposs going to hurt i mean if you aposre talking about furloughing 800 000 people mulvaney it hurts but you asked me question is what will people see the point of the matter is if you work there you will see a dramatic difference but most americans won apost see a difference you go to the airport on monday the tsa will still be there the military is still at work now they aposre not getting paid and that aposs wrong but in terms of what you will see it will not be as dramatic as what you saw in 2013 wallace let aposs talk about how we get out of this mess there are new reports that senate republicans are going to offer a deal a three week c r not a four week c r which would last continuing resolution until february 8th with disaster relief funding and also money for chip children aposs health insurance is that true and what about daca mulvaney i aposm not a couple of different things i aposm not familiar with the specific deal i know it aposs on the table right now which is a four week i have heard what you just mentioned about three weeks i know there aposs a separate disaster supplemental funding bill sitting over in the senate i have not heard about those two things getting married together you may want to ask senator coons about that but the fact of the matter is we probably need at least three weeks to try and negotiate daca let aposs be clear the president wants to resolve daca he could aposve taken it away entirely in six months ago and chose to give congress six months that expires the first week of march to fix it unfortunately congress is waiting up until the very last day to do that but we are very interested in getting daca worked out wallace you are calling this we heard it saw it in the open the schumer shutdown but the fact is you only have 46 republicans willing to vote for this congressional this continuing resolution so even if there hadn apost been a democratic filibuster you didn apost have the majority needed to pass the c r all the more reason isn apost this on republicans and the white house and control of the house and the senate mulvaney you got ph an interesting word majority they actually got the majority this sheds light on one of the difficulties we face in washington wallace it aposs not just because of democrats mulvaney well but you aposve got a majority you just didn apost get the 60 votes wallace the point is you do not have your own house in order you only have 46 republicans supporting this mulvaney if you had nine or 10 or 12 democrats where are the democrats chris who say back home that they want to work in a bipartisan fashion they want to work with republicans they want to reach across the aisle where were those folks last week only five democrats voted for a bill that they like let aposs not lose sight of that the democrats have voted they like the chip program they like delaying the obamacare cadillac tax program they like funding the government they always have they do not oppose the bill this is pure politics on their part where the democrats who say one thing back home and do another that aposs what we are focusing on wallace but you only had 46 republicans mulvaney and again if you had 10 or 15 democrats and it still failed i think your point is fair but right now until you have at least nine democrats we cannot open the government wallace well you don apost have 46 republicans either i mean you don apost have 51 republicans either mulvaney right but again short of nine what difference does it make without nine democrats this government is not opening wallace back in 2013 when republicans insisted on shutting down the government because they wanted to remove all funding of obamacare and they did it for 16 days private citizen trump placed the responsibility squarely here he is begin audio clip donald trump businessman problems start from the top and have to get solved from the top and the president is the leader and he aposs got to get everybody in a room and he aposs got to lead end audio clip wallace question if president obama was responsible then get everybody in the room and lead isn apost president trump responsible now mulvaney yes a couple of different things actually the shutdown in 2016 was not about getting rid of obamacare wallace 2013 mulvaney 2013 excuse me it was about delaying the individual mandate which we just got rid of on the tax deal but compared 2013 and 2016 and how the two presidents have acted i went through the middle of 2013 i think i was on your show during that shutdown and i will look you in the eye and tell you that president obama wanted that shutdown and he wanted to weaponize it he wanted to use it politically to hurt republicans because he thought republicans will get blamed politically and he wanted that shutdown this president has worked really really hard to prevent the shutdown he had folks down to the white house several times over the last couple of days i think mr schumer was there as recently as the last day before the shutdown he aposs actively engaged yesterday calling people trying to get the government open wallace but why doesn apost he i mean he didn apost have a meeting a bipartisan meeting with congressional meetings yesterday does he have one on the schedule for today mulvaney chris he had one on thursday but not yesterday i mean we can split hairs on that all the time the president crosstalk wallace well the shutdown happened on friday night mulvaney but we knew it was also coming we had a bipartisan meeting with senators several times in fact i think we had several of those meetings leading to the shutdown this president i don apost think anybody could say that this president wants the shutdown you could not say the same thing about president obama in fact i think he actually did want it wallace you blame democrats for holding the government hostage now but back in 2013 you supported holding the government hostage on this question of obamacare take a look begin video clip mulvaney we believe that what we did was right we did for the right reasons we did for these kids here they may not recognize that right now but we really do believe that this is worth having a fight end video clip chris wallace fox news host why was that legitimate then the right reason to have a fight but it aposs not legitimate now mulvaney that aposs a fair question but here aposs the answer they were asking us to vote for something in 2013 that we didn apost like in fact that we had a principled opposition to it they were asking us to vote to fund obamacare something that was very difficult for republicans to do and we wouldn apost go for it let me finish wallace i wasn apost saying a word mulvaney here we are today this is a bill that democrats support they are opposing a bill that they don apost oppose in order to make a political point there aposs a significant difference chris wallace i think that aposs a debating point the fact is there are budgetary implications to daca i mean if you aposre going to deport 800 000 people that aposs going to cost money you shut down the government in 2013 you writ large republicans because you didn apost like obamacare you wanted to shut down the government again in 2015 because you didn apost like planned parenthood they are willing to shut down the government because they want a solution to daca you can say well one thing is what aposs in the bill one thing is what aposs not in the bill the point is that both you then and them now are willing to shut down the government because they oppose or support a policy same issue mulvaney go back and look at 2013 and 2015 we can have a long discussion about it another day but there were many many times the house actually voted to open the government that we voted many times on many different packages that would have opened the government in fact i remember voting for stuff that i didn apost like very much so that the government could open there was a breakdown in the senate at that under harry reid that prevented the government from opening so i do think there aposs a major difference between now and 2013 but importantly the deal that aposs on the table right now in the senate is the type of deal that would have worked in 2013 and would have worked in fact did work in 2013 and 2015 it aposs a bipartisan measure the bill that the house passed is the old fashioned typical bipartisan bill that does keep the government open but for some reason the dysfunction specifically with the senate and democrats is so dramatic now it aposs not working it aposs almost as if they are so beholden to their left wing that they can apost give the president even a victory on keeping the government open wallace i want to take you because i want to talk about this i want to take you back to the big meeting that was held on friday in the white house between president trump and chuck schumer senate democratic sources tell me this let aposs put it up on the screen schumer raised full funding of a wall more than 18 billion and a full increase in defense spending around 80 billion but they say the white house chief of staff john kelly later called back and said to schumer that it was quote too liberal is that true mulvaney can you put that list back up because i can respond to each of those in turn wallace well i we can remember it but go ahead mulvaney full funding wallace full funding mulvaney full funding for the wall no what mr schumer offered the president was an authorization for funding not an appropriation i know that aposs deep down in the weeds for folks who don apost live in washington d c but the difference between authorization and appropriation is like night and day there was already authorization to build wall on the southern border that chuck schumer voted for in 2006 it hasn apost been built because the money was never appropriated it was never funded and that aposs the same deal that chuck schumer offered on saturday wallace let aposs focus on that because i think that aposs important yesterday you went after schumer hard on this issue take a look begin video clip mulvaney chuck schumer actually have the gall to look at the president and said i aposm giving you everything you asked for the wall and then when pressed admitted that he wasn apost doing it that aposs the type of negotiation that mr schumer has been engaging with the president you have to ask yourself at one point doesn apost it even become profitable to continue to work with somebody like that end video clip wallace now this is going to get complicated because you aposve raised a new issue here schumer aposs staff says specifically in response to that that you are not telling the truth they say they say that he offered not one year funding which was suggested yesterday but full funding 18 billion to 20 billion in year one that they were going to put that on the table not offer i should say that they were willing to discuss that and that you guys walked away from that i mean if you got full funding for the wall that would be the deal of the century why not take yes for an answer mulvaney it would be the deal of the century because that was not the offer the offer again i don apost want to split hairs wallace no i understand the difference between authorization and appropriation crosstalk mulvaney asked mr schumer aposs office if they offer to appropriate 20 billion go to the next thing that was on your list about full funding for defense not true he was offering something that was in the budget request from fy apos18 i know because i happen to write that budget what the request is right now and the discussion is about the ndaa levels which is slightly higher and that mr schumer not only voted for but is taking credit for back home for fully funding the military he won apost give the president that higher figure he gives him a lower figure as part of the negotiation wallace i don apost play a role as the negotiator here but let me do it just for a moment mulvaney sure wallace if senator schumer comes back and says no i aposm not talking about authorization i aposm talking about appropriation 18 billion to 20 billion right now you can build your wall and there are more democrats saying that including congressman gutierrez would the president accept that and would you make a deal mulvaney and again i aposm not going to negotiate you with either but let aposs go back to what the request was from the very beginning that we aposre happy to talk about daca want to resolve daca what is part of daca deal look like from the administration aposs perspective number one the southern border defense the southern border security gets fully funded that means the wall that means the 20 billion we also deal with chain migration we deal with the visa lottery system and we deal with interior enforcement crosstalk wallace you seem to be suggesting that even if you got the 20 billion that wouldn apost be enough mulvaney well again those are the four things the four principles we aposve asked for in the discussion mr schumer comes in and offers us none of that that aposs not the basis for an agreement wallace final question in that regard if you got 20 billion would you make the deal mulvaney again i aposm not going to negotiate on behalf of the president that would certainly cover one of the four things we aposve asked for wallace final question this is nfl championship weekend come over under how long is this going to last mulvaney a couple of different things i think two different answers i think there aposs a chance it get solved before monday i really do believe that at heart here there was an interest by some folks in the democrat party to deny the president sort of a victory lap of the anniversary of his inauguration the chance to talk about the success of the tax bill success of the economy and jobs and i think if they get over that there aposs a chance this thing gets done before 9 00 on monday morning and folks would come to work wallace and if not mulvaney if that doesn apost happen it could go several days because i think there aposs other democrats who want to see the president give the state of the union during a shutdown wallace well that is more than several days that aposs january 30th mulvaney that aposs nine or 10 days yes wallace it could go that far mulvaney you have to ask the senate democrats chris they could open this today if they wanted to wallace well you know what that aposs a perfect segue to our next segment director mulvaney thank you thanks for your time on this very difficult weekend obviously we aposll follow the negotiations mulvaney thank you for having me wallace thank you up next democratic senator chris coons on what it will take to break the stalemate in congress and end the shutdown commercial break wallace republicans including president trump say democrats are holding the government hostage over their demands for dreamers the young immigrants brought to this country as children who face possible deportation when their protection runs out in march joining us now democratic senator chris coons is part of a bipartisan group trying to find a way out of the shutdown senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen chris coons d delaware thanks chris good morning wallace well let aposs start with the president aposs tweets he has sent one this morning put it up on the screen wallace well let aposs start with the president aposs tweets he has sent one this morning put it up on the screen great to see how hard republicans are fighting for our military and safety at the border the dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked if stalemate continues republicans should go to 51 percent nuclear option and vote on real long term budget no c r continuing revolutions your reaction to that coons well this is another example of president trump growing a tweet in the middle of bipartisan negotiations that are making progress i think senator mcconnell the republican majority leader in the end will have much more to say about how the senate is run than the president should i think in the last segment you ran a clip from then private sector leader donald trump in 2013 who said during a shutdown the president should lead it aposs the president aposs responsibility and i think he should instead of throwing tweets from the white house pull together the four leaders of the house and the senate on a bipartisan basis today and negotiate i spent all day yesterday not going to the floor not going on cable news not denouncing republicans but meeting with them listening to them with a small group that grew and grew and by the end of the day we had 20 republican and democratic senators listening to each other trying to not just get out of the shutdown but address and fix some of the underlying problems that have left us with so many of the priorities that have stacked up over the last couple of months i aposm hopeful we can get through this wallace let aposs talk about meetings because they had a meeting the president and chuck schumer on friday and it ended up may be making things worse not better now i want to ask you about a point that i pressed with director mulvaney did schumer put on the table 20 billion full funding for the wall in year one not over installments and if so to mulvaney aposs point was it an authorization or was it real money and appropriation coons well i wasn apost in the meeting and i don apost know exactly but from talking to leaders schumer my impression is reluctantly he offered the two things the president really wanted full funding of the military and full funding to build the wall or the wall system we aposre never really going to build a 2 000 mile concrete wall crosstalk wallace but you aposre saying it wasn apost authorization it was in appropriation he was willing to give say real money we aposll give you the money to build the wall coons well i think he had to explain that difference to the president about full appropriation year one versus authorization and a commitment to appropriation but the reality was the president campaigned on full funding for the military and a border wall and said remember two weeks ago the president brought in a bipartisan group and said i want to solve this i want us to have a daca deal i think you call that a bill of love and put out a menu and said we need a bipartisan solution i aposll take the heat you all come back on thursday present me with a solution six senators republican and democrat came back on thursday presented a bipartisan solution and he fairly famously blew it up in an expletive laden exchange with senators so at the end of the day part of our challenge here is negotiating with the president who struggles to hear yes i believe senator schumer on friday put a lot on the table and the president accepted it and then two hours later after hearing from folks who oppose any reasonable resolution to this daca challenge he walked it back so i have a lot of sympathy for senator mitch mcconnell the leader of the republican caucus who sat on the floor friday night how am i supposed to negotiate on this issue when we still don apost know what president trump will really accept wallace let me ask you though apparently what republicans are going to offer what mitch mcconnell is going to offer today or tonight or 1 00 a m tomorrow morning is a three week continuing resolution not four weeks to february 16th three weeks to february 8th during which time you can negotiate daca why not accept that coons well i aposm not going to negotiate for our leadership it is my hope that we will have an agreement that all of our unfinished business disaster relief opioid funding coming to an agreement on budget caps that will fully fund the military and our domestic priorities and addressing daca that all of this will be negotiated in good faith over the next let aposs say three weeks and voted on that we will have a date certain for a vote to move forward wallace so is that and so in daca is that the point is that you want to commitment a guaranty of a specific date for a vote not just we aposll agree to talk to you about daca over the next three weeks coons well let aposs play tape here on what happened friday where you got senator mcconnell on the floor saying there aposs no rush there aposs no hurry we don apost need to be addressing this this is an unrelated issue for me it would be a big step forward to have the majority leaders say this is an urgent issue it aposs on the list of things that we must addressed and we will vote on the senate if we can apost get clarity from the president about what he will embrace then the senate will be the senate and we will move forward i think that will be a good step forward wallace democrats like to say when republicans shut down the government that real people are going to get hurt here is secretary of defense james mattis on the real effect of the shutdown begin video clip gen james mattis defense secretary i would just tell you that we do a lot of intelligence operations around the world and they cost money those obviously would stop end video clip wallace as a member of the senate foreign relations committee senator are you willing to see that and other vital programs shutdown coons the government should not be shut down that aposs why i spent all day yesterday listening to working with republicans wallace but you voted to shut it down you voted against the c r coons i voted against a 30 day c r and to be clear on friday an assistant to that secretary of defense secretary mattis put out a statement saying we shouldn apost have another 30 day c r that aposs why there were republicans and democrats who voted on friday against a 30 day deal so we offer one day crosstalk wallace so a three week c r you aposre going to go for it coons it depends on what aposs on the table wallace well ok coons will turn out what we aposre going to move forward on what matters less is 30 day 25 day 20 day although we have spent a lot of time on that what matters more is ending the hostage taking and moving forward i aposve got tens of thousands of delawareans who depend on community health care centers we aposre months overdue in addressing that i aposve got tens of thousands of families relying on community health insurance program the children aposs health insurance program remember those hurricanes that tore through texas and puerto rico and florida we haven apost funded the relief for those hurricanes remember the opioid crisis we have this long list of homework unfinished we need to address them all wallace i want to pick up on this though because you just said boy we don apost want the hostage taking that aposs going on that aposs exactly what democrat said back in 2013 when republicans shut down the government over obamacare take a look begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d california i call them legislative arsonists they are there to burn down what we should be building up sen chuck schumer d new york someone goes into your house takes your wife and children hostage and then says let aposs negotiate over the price of your house we can say we aposre shutting down the government we aposre not going to raise the debt ceiling until you pass immigration reform it would be governmental chaos end video clip wallace senator right now aren apost you the legislative arsonists aren apost you right now taking the government hostage coons well chris just because a bipartisan group of democrats and republicans voted friday night including me against a 30 day c r doesn apost mean i aposm an arsonist i supported continuing the government i supported keeping the government open crosstalk wallace you say you wouldn apost support a three week c r either unless there aposs certain conditions met coons right wallace i mean it aposs the same point they shut on the government because they didn apost like obamacare you are shutting down the government because there are certain things you were insisting on coons right and notice i aposm spending very little time pointing fingers and saying it aposs trump aposs fault versus it aposs this person aposs fault that aposs not my priority my priority chris is finding a way through this i aposm more optimistic after yesterday than i have been a long time because we had 20 senators in a room republicans and democrats listening to each other talking not just about how to get through this issue but how to get back to an appropriations process that works i aposm the senior democrat on the subcommittee that funds mick mulvaney aposs omb office including the whole federal judiciary the department of treasury all federal properties we never even had our final mark up in october we are four months into the new fiscal year our appropriations process is badly broken and if there was anything good that came out of this weekend whenever buddy had to cancel their plans and stay here is that we are listening to each other and trying to find a way forward i call on president trump to do the same be the leader that millions of americans hoped he would be a real dealmaker hear yes pull together a bipartisan group today and negotiate to a conclusion i will remind you it aposs partly because of that explosive meeting where he rejected a bipartisan solution on border security and dreamers that we aposre in this mess wallace well coons there is a solution wallace we can argue about his language but the fact is he didn apost like the deal coons that aposs correct he rejected it infamously forceful language crosstalk wallace but here aposs my question because i can apost i pressed director mulvaney let me impress you what is the bottom line what do you have to have to reopen the government coons a commitment to move forward on all of these issues that we have been talking about community health centers dealing with disaster relief children aposs health insurance program and dreamers wallace to move forward means what coons votes that we are going to have votes that we aposre not going to say this is an issue we don apost need to deal with it look i got teenagers it aposs like dad comes home at 8 00 and says how are you doing on your homework almost done making progress nine o aposclock how are you doing do you need to help almost making progress ten o aposclock how are we doing on homework it aposs bedtime what aposs the urgency it aposs not due until tomorrow we need a recognition that it aposs overdue we aposve got a list of things we need to move forward on wallace i used to just say the dog ate my homework senator coons thank you thanks for coming in today always good to talk with you and good luck in working on a deal coons go eagles wallace go eagles oh that aposs right you aposre from delaware i guess that aposs close enough all right you aposve now ticked off about 90 percent of the country up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss how long the shutdown will last and who will pay the political price commercial break wallace coming up the blame game over the government shutdown begin video clip pelosi the republicans were so incompetent so negligent that they couldn apost get it together to keep government open unidentified male i don apost understand why schumer went to this extreme we are committed to solving this problem end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel who will blink first coming up on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip sen mitch mcconnell r majority leader the votes were there the president was ready the solution to this manufactured crisis was inches away sen chuck schumer d minority leader negotiating with this white house is like negotiating with jell o it aposs next to impossible as soon as you take one step forward the hard right forces the president three steps back end video clip wallace senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and democratic leader chuck schumer exchanging blame saturday for shutting down the government and it aposs time now for our sunday group the head of heritage action for america michael needham charles lane of the washington post former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and josh holmes mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff and now a gop strategist as we just said josh you aposre close to senator mcconnell what is the state of play right now on the senate floor in terms of ending this shutdown josh holmes founder cavalry well i think the state of play is democrats are now in a situation where they aposve locked themselves into a box canyon and frankly there aposs no way out other than figuring out how to pass what aposs currently on the floor they aposve got a vote that aposs currently scheduled for 1 00 a m which is wallace 1 00 a m monday morning holmes right which is again entirely unnecessary but basically what it would do is just keep the government open with the same criteria that we talked about on friday night you aposre funding full funding of the military full funding of schip full funding of all government operations and then get to the business of negotiating the issue of daca which is the reason for this shutdown in the first place it can be done at any moment all of this was i think irresponsible but also unnecessary wallace president trump said this week that what democrats are really trying to do is to distract from all the good economic news here he is begin video clip donald trump president of the united states the democrats want to see a shutdown to get off this subject because the subject is not working for them the tax cuts and tax reform has not been working well for the democrats end video clip wallace congresswoman harmon are you comfortable with where democrats are right now holding out for either a daca fix or a commitment for a specific date for a vote on daca and do you think they have a strategy for if the shutdown goes on jane harman former u s congresswoman d cali well first of all shutting the government is a live fire exercise real people get hurt there are 36 furloughed employees at the wilson center alone but military training doesn apost happen our ships are colliding i mean this is a a serious problem and the government should open now hopefully tonight i i think the time that aposs gone into polling and messaging should have been spent on making a deal and i understand that as of last night at least 19 senators and i just asked senator coons as he was walking out have been working together on a bipartisan basis to fix this and what they aposre looking for is an improved deal with a three week term limit wallace right harman but at the end of that guaranteed votes on things like daca a daca fix which 87 percent of the country supports and most members of congress support wallace so you aposre comfortable with them shutting the government down until they get that harman no i aposm not comfortable with anyone shutting the government down i am comfortable i aposm not comfortable but i aposm hopeful that 20 plus bipartisan members of the senate will today craft something beyond what was offered on friday that a minority of people not 51 republicans supported as you pointed out in your interview i aposm comfortable that hopefully there will be an improved package that will get voted on today or at 1 00 in the morning god save us that will guarantee votes on all of the things that are should be part of this package that could have been worked out without shutting the government down wallace michael back in 2013 when republicans shutdown the government over obamacare their congressional or their favorability ratings tanked and yet when you got to the midterm election in 2014 they won a big victory and they actually took back the senate do you think to a certain degree democrats are pursuing the same strategy which is we can galvanize our base we can play to the left wing of our party right now and by next november months from now everybody will forget about the shutdown michael needham ceo heritage action for america yes i think what the 2013 shutdown did was it clarified where the two parties were on an important policy issue and these things actually are about policy there was one party against obamacare there was one that was in favor of keeping it what this debate is about it aposs not even just about daca i mean the president has said he wants a solution on daca the democrats allegedly have said that they aposll give funding for the border what this is actually about his chain migration what that means is can the people who are currently here illegal bring not just their close relatives their distant relatives into this country when we bring somebody into this country do we choose them based on merit or do we say you can go bring a cousin with you and so this is a shutdown over whether or not we could give amnesty to illegal immigrants who are here and have chain migration allow them to bring distant relatives wallace but let me let me just talk of needham that aposs not going to work out well in november if they aposre the party that says we aposre the party in favor of amnesty and distant relatives inaudible wallace if you aposre you aposre sliding over something which is i think there aposs really been a sea change in the last 24 to 48 hours among democrats i get the sense they are willing to say you want the wall we aposre going to let you have the wall needham exactly wallace you agree with that needham that aposs what they aposre allegedly saying we aposll figure out gutierrez has said that he aposll help build the wall i mean they are claiming that they aposre in favor of the border security wallace and you and you don apost think i mean that the president aposs main premise was not chain migration his main promise was build the wall needham and the president wallace if he gets that he shouldn apost take yes for an answer needham the president aposs been very clear from the very start when he first said we aposll have a six month reprieve on daca that one of the things that he wants is an end to chain migration and from a policy perspective he aposs exactly right about that we should have a system that allows people generously into america who can provide merit who can do it the same way canada does it australia does it instead we have this crazy system where people are allowed to bring distant relatives like cousins into the country and that is the issue that democrats are shutting the government over wallace chuck which side do you think is in more political jeopardy now and which leads to the question how do you see this ending charles lane the washington post well i think the democrats have a broadly popular goal which is daca relief for those kids and they aposre using a risky to unpopular tactic in the pursuit of it which is the government shutdown and so i think the longer it goes on the more time the republicans could have to start saying hey wait a minute you know they are they aposre putting too much at risk in the pursuit of what we all agree is a laudable goal having said that look the republicans do control all the levers of the government and the democrats have a strong argument that says in that situation it shouldn apost shutdown what aposs kind of going on here and i think some other people on the panel have already touched on this both parties are only addressing these arguments at their bases they are not anymore contesting over some middle ground of undecided people who are persuadable on this and so in a way it aposs already a stalemate and it aposs going to just perpetuate as a stalemate which makes it only which makes it only crazier that we aposre that we aposre going to let it go on at all holmes let let me push you on that just for a second i think democrats wallace real quick holmes that aposs absolutely true with republicans that is not a the case at all in the context of this discussion all they want to do is keep the government open and fund schip it aposs really clear what the discussion is about the government shutdown it has nothing to do with daca policy wallace all right we are going to have to take a break here but i have a feeling well i hope that we don apost have to discuss this next week but we may up next this weekend marks one year since president trump took the oath of office what has he done right what has he done wrong plus what would you like to ask the panel about the president aposs first year just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump 2017 was a year of tremendous achievement monumental achievement actually i don apost think any administration has ever done has done what we aposve done and what we aposve accomplished in its first year end video clip wallace president trump showing his characteristic gift for salesmanship as he celebrates his first year in office we aposre back now with the panel michael how do you rate president trump aposs first year needham well it has been a very successful year when you look at what the white house can do without congress and obviously the congress has at various times been ben more dysfunctional but you had a huge tax cut with mitch mcconnell the senate the house deserve a big credit for the role that they played in helping that get across the finish line you have a great regulatory rollback i think we finally have an american foreign policy that aposs confidently pushing itself abroad i would say it aposs been a conventional conservative year of success and part of what got trump elected was reaching out to new audiences finding ways to appeal to some issues some anxieties that are out there that i don apost know from a policy agenda we fully captured yet i think when you look at something like apprenticeship week which the president the white house did earlier this year that aposs a theme that aposs one of the types of issues that will reach out to some of those new trump voters i think we have to find ways to have more policy victories on those types of issues also wallace chuck i think it aposs fair to say you are often critical of this president but take a look at this list a big surge in gdp a big drop in unemployment record highs in the stock market we aposre seeing them now at new breaking through the thousand mark every seven eight days a record list of conservative appointments to the court and a big rollback of isis i understand that you don apost agree with some of the policies but would you agree that this has been a consequential and then perhaps a successful first year for this president lane yes i think in fact i was preparing to acknowledge that on his terms and on the republican party aposs terms you have to give credit where credit is due they have achieved a number of their goals and you just spared me the work of listing them but the presidency is both a policymaking job and a statesmanship job a national embodiment job a symbolism job and on that latter part on the part that revolves around character and temperament and bringing the country together and modeling behavior this has been a disastrous year and i would go to issues such as the remarks he made after charlottesville the comment the unprintable comment he made just a couple of days ago all the tweets in terms of the part of the presidency that involves representing the country and modeling the kind of behavior that george washington did when he established the office i don apost see how anyone could call this a successful year wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from tamara hyland she writes will trump ever get a modicum of respect for some of the good things he has done economy taxes unemployment isis josh how do you answer tamara and given the fact that the president aposs personal approval rating lag so far behind for instance satisfaction with the economy is part of the problem the style points that chuck was just talking about that in a sense he steps on his own success holmes yes i think that aposs exactly right i think chuck actually laid it out pretty well there there aposs an issue of trying to to take a look at this presidency from kind of two silos one is what are the accomplishments and in that category he aposs got an awful lot done i mean generational tax reform alone is is pretty big supreme court all the judges and regulatory rollbacks they might talk about huge stylistically on the other hand there aposs an awful lot of americans that have a big problem with it and where that runs into is it that most people can apost make a a fair evaluation of the substance of the argument because they can apost get around what his style is and i so i think that aposs the the burden that this administration has in getting a fair report card one year in wallace congresswoman harman as our foreign policy expert i want to ask you specifically about that area foreign policy whether it is rolling back isis whether it aposs dealing with rogue states like iran and north korea whether it aposs dealing with the great powers china and russia how do you think this president has done harman well mix but a lot of good i don apost disagree with any of this let aposs remember he was elected by democrats and republicans who were frustrated with washington washington isn apost getting better including his role as a uniting president he gave an inaugural speech year ago which could have been united the country it didn apost he picked an issue rolling back obamacare which divided the country he should have picked infrastructure he would have had a record twice as big as the one he now has and on foreign policy he aposs alienated a lot of our allies he aposs embraced a lot of dictators around the world he aposs about to go to the globalist swamp that would be the davos meeting this week i aposm actually going too ph wallace well well he may not because of the shutdown harman well he may not but he is at least scheduled to go wallace right harman that aposs another huge opportunity how will he use that on foreign policy i give him some accomplishments he might he is we are getting somewhere with north korea on iran iran aposs bad behavior in the neighborhood deserves more sanctions but blowing up the deal is pointless i i think i would give him the lowest marks on trade i think jettisoning tpp created a huge market and opportunity for china in asia and china is our biggest competitor out there in the world we aposre sort of working with them but we have a lot of issues that that are you know that that are problematic and i think our foreign policy his foreign policy score would be better if his temperament were different and if the language he uses weren apost this coarsening language about demonizing immigrants from africa for anything wallace michael your reaction because you were the one who started all of this both on substance and on we call it style points but behavior conduct needham yes i think there aposs no doubt that as a country we need to find ways to take a kind of civic coming apart that aposs going on people who on the one hand feel like the democrat party is always against them that they don apost understand them or their values and bring them together with republicans who who or others who feel obviously the exact other way i think sometimes the whole political system gets left off the hook a little bit for exacerbating some of these cultural problems when barack obama passes a law that says that catholic nuns are going to have to buy birth control and when that goes all the way to the supreme court and when one party is completely united around the idea of using the force of government to compel catholic nuns to buy birth control i don apost think that aposs any more unifying than this president has been and so certainly there are aspects of this president his demeanor his use of twitter that make many americans look at washington and feel disconnected feel ashamed i think that the left has to understand how so much of what they aposve been doing as they aposre on offense on the cultural wars as they think that the tide of history is is inextricably behind them that makes many other americans feel left out feel persecuted and cause them to show up and vote for donald trump as president wallace congresswoman harman so let aposs have a unifying president he can still do this he could start this week in davos or here saying to this bipartisan group that aposs trying to keep the government reopen the government ok finally i agree let aposs have votes on these all these issues and put a package together that moves the country forward and makes congress work again and then i aposll take credit for being the the first president in this century that aposs made congress work lane i i would just i think we aposre drawing a distinction between style and substance that is a little bit false here because i think it aposs not just style when a president says something like he said after charlottesville where he drew a moral equivalence between the neo nazis and the people against them and and that has a substantive impact there there really is a problem in this country were many many people don apost just feel dissed by the president but in some way actively threatened and you know too bad if he thinks that aposs unfair or whatever his job is to and he aposs failed at it to reach out to everyone and and leave everyone feeling included wallace well we aposre going to have to end on that somewhat negative point but having said that i was surprised what generally pretty high marks for this president and 2018 still to come thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week how a new hollywood film shines a light on the untold story of our first military operation in afghanistan after 9 11 commercial break wallace after 9 11 the first u s military operation to strike back was top secret most of us never heard the real story of what happened in afghanistan until now here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape lt gen john mulholland ret former task force dagger commander i think it aposs hugely important because it fills a void that i think exists about completing the story of 9 11 wallace voice over retired lieutenant general john mulholland is talking about the new movie 12 strong unidentified male it aposs us we aposre going in wallace it tells how small units of american special forces helped overthrow the taliban and drive al qaeda out of afghanistan wallace on camera how soon after 9 11 did you know you were going to war mulholland well truthfully i knew the minute the second airplane hit the hit the second tower wallace voice over back then mulholland was a colonel commander of the fifth special forces group by october he was in uzbekistan ready to send 12 man teams of green berets known as odas operational detachment alpha into afghanistan to link up with anti taliban warlords unidentified male i chose you you and 11 men task force dagger wallace it was a bold plan and mulholland admits he felt a heavy burden mulholland here we were america aposs first response so we very much felt that we were carrying kind of the weight of the nation if you will responsible to them for getting the job done unidentified male this is for the towers you carry that with you five weeks ago 19 men attacked our country the 12 of you will be the first ones to fight back mulholland i cut that steel up into little pieces and i gave one to every one of my teams that went to afghanistan and i told them when you find a place that makes sense i want you to bury it wallace the movie focuses on oda 595 that teamed up with northern alliance general abdul rashid dostum but right away the americans ran into trouble unidentified male all right who are we doing this for anyone unidentified male summer camp when i was nine unidentified male cancun spring break what spring drunk ph wallace on camera did you plan ahead for your green berets to end up fighting on horseback mulholland did not did not that that that was a bolt out of the blue unidentified male left to go left right to go right pull back to stop wallace voice over the special forces and local tribes attacked the taliban who were armed with tanks and artillery unidentified male the target tanks in the open wallace they called in air strikes if possible but often fought the enemy in close combat why send in so few soldiers mulholland the afghans traditionally the only thing they hate more than fighting with each other is foreigners and nothing brings them together like a foreign presence wallace in 49 days the taliban regime fell forty nine days wallace on camera how impressive an accomplishment is that mulholland historic absolutely historic wallace for most americans this is the first time they will have heard this mulholland we aposre not ones to kind of blow our own horn and then we aposve been very busy wallace voice over one of the few markers of the campaign is a 16 foot statue of a horse soldier near new york aposs ground zero unidentified male be able to take that city the world trade center aposs just the beginning wallace and now there is a movie to tell the story of the 12 man teams of americans that struck back after 9 11 mulholland we were able to take that fight back to the enemy and bring down that regime and and and drive al qaeda back into under their rocks it ap
