that the administration had held up aid to ukraine in part to prod that country to investigate democrats and the 2016 elections then mulvaney went on television sunday to defend his boss in effusive terms and ended up making a new problematic comment explaining why trump had tried to steer an international summit to one of the president s own properties before giving up on the idea mulvaney said

selection of his doral florida golf resort to host next year s group of seven world summit it was also an opportunity for mulvaney demonstrate his ability to defend the president he struggled in the process offering fresh fodder to critics of a president already besieged by an impeachment inquiry he asserted in the briefing that military aid to ukraine was delayed partly because trump wanted officials there to look into a security company hired by the democratic national committee that discovered that russian agents had broken into the committee s network in 2016 the look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation mulvaney told reporters did he also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the dnc server absolutely no question about that mulvaney continued that s why we held up the money trump s personal lawyers quickly dissociated themselves from the chief of staff s comments mulvaney

already angry that republicans were not defending him on syria and doral was also displeased that mulvaney only made the headlines worse according to three white house officials and republicans close to the white house not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations still a swift dismissal doesn t appear on the horizon according to nine staffers and outside advisers who noted the difficulties trump has faced attracting and retaining high quality white house staff even before the impeachment episode the shortage of viable replacements has kept other officials in their posts

potential mulvaney successor over strategy and tactics in response to impeachment mulvaney has complained that he had been iced out of the process which the lawyer was treating as a legal not political matter trump s decision late saturday to reverse course on his much criticized plan to host the g 7 at doral was the latest move that called into question mulvaney s job security mulvaney

uproar was resounding in august when the president first floated the idea of choosing doral they argued that the president s aides mulvaney first among them either should have persuaded him not to hold it there or devised a better communications strategy could we have put on an excellent g 7 at doral absolutely mulvaney concluded on fox will we
