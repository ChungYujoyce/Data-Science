makes surprise visit to afghanistan his trip comes at a pivotal moment for the future of afghanistan where the central government has struggled to maintain control over much of the country amid a resurgence by the taliban and other radical islamist forces a resurgence that s included direct assaults on american personnel new u s envoy zalmay khalilzad recently held a series of meetings with taliban officials in qatar and while both sides came out optimistic they are still far from a sweeping cease fire deal or a recognition by the taliban of afghan president ashraf ghani s government the taliban also is seeking assurances that american forces will soon exit the country and have even claimed a private accord to pull american forces out by this spring despite reports that mr trump plans to soon order a drawdown of at least half of the 14 000 u s troops in afghanistan mr shanahan said he s received no such order and he offered no clarity on when the troops will begin coming home he

forward this summer as scheduled even though taliban leaders have steadfastly refused to meet directly with his government mr ghani said monday the nation should hold a loya jirga the traditional gathering of afghan political and tribal leaders to reach a lasting peace deal mr trump has made clear that he intends to fulfill key campaign promises and begin bringing u s forces home having already begun a withdrawal from syria where forces had been battling the islamic state the president last week used his state of the union address to decry the endless wars that he said have been a staple of american foreign policy for the past two decades but that approach has drawn fire from lawmakers including many in his own part who argue that the u s could create a power vacuum that allows the taliban to regain control over much of afghanistan islamic state has also established a presence in the country even as its base in syria and iraq has been virtually wiped out by the u s and its allies regional analysts say the administration should proceed cautiously and look to history as a guide pointing out that the taliban also had promised to share power with the government in kabul in the late 1990s before ultimately seizing total control and allowing al qaeda to use the country as a base of operations the taliban lied then and there is no evidence that the group s assurances are any more meaningful now especially as the taliban and the united states do not accept a common definition of terrorism michael rubin a middle east scholar at the american enterprise institute wrote in
