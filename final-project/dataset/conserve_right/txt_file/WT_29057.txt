clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time trump s move last month has caused concern among lebanese officials that it would mean also recognizing the occupied chebaa farms and nearby kfar chouba hills captured along with the golan as israeli territory lebanese president michel aoun said the u s recognition undermines lebanon s claim to the territory the origin of the dispute over ownership of the chebaa farms dates back to the french colonial period when france drew maps of the area without officially demarcating the border following an 18 year occupation israel withdrew from south lebanon in 2000 but held on to the farms hezbollah claimed the withdrawal to be incomplete and demanded along with the lebanese government that israel withdraws israel rejected the demands saying the land was syrian when it was captured in
