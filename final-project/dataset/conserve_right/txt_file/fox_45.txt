washington hurricane harvey now downgraded to a tropical storm continues to hammer texas causing deadly flooding and leaving devastation in its wake at least two people are confirmed dead but

are now under a flash flood warning in the moment we aposll discuss the damage and the response from authorities with texas governor greg abbott but first we have fox team coverage meteorologist rick reichmuth tells us where harvey is headed steve harrigan is just outside of rockford with how folks are coping there but we begin with casey stegall in galveston with the latest on the storm casey casey stegall fox news and chris the conditions continue deteriorating out here rather quickly this is happening up and down much of the texas coast i will hop out of the way and showing one look at what we are talking here in galveston you see stuff like this all over the place a roadway taking on water right up against neighborhoods it aposs impassable the water levels are rising fast because these torrential rains simply will not let up now look at this video shot not long ago earlier this morning of an actual rescue happening in houston a human chain being formed pulling someone to safety galveston county and the city of houston have received highest rainfall totals so far the national weather service says the rain has been coming down at a rate of five to six inches an hour in some places in fact 24 inches falling in the houston metro which is just to the north of us local emergency management officials say area 911 call centers are swamped with people calling in for help either stranded in their homes or out on the roadways and forecasters fear the worst may be yet to come in terms of flooding now president trump is monitoring this disaster very very closely in fact he held a teleconference by video from camp david yesterday with key members of his cabinet he was briefed about the situation on the ground here like people from the new fema administration brock long the federal emergency management agency says now is go time begin video clip earl armstrong fema spokesperson this is where we figure out who needs what where when how much they need and how quickly we can get it to them and how to get it to them end video clip stegall president trump tweeted today great coordination between agencies at all levels of government continuing rains and flash floods are being dealt with thousands rescued and while those harvesters are carried out all over the region residents also under a different threat tornadoes amateur video capturing this listen to people screaming several twisters touching down that have hit the houston suburbs of cypress and katy multiple homes have been damaged and minor injuries reported for context the national weather service says just between friday and saturday 67 tornado warnings have been issued sixty seven in fact we woke up to yet another one here in galveston today it is starting to look like millions of texans have a very long road to recovery chris wallace casey thank you for that report now let aposs bring in steve harrigan who is just outside of rockport a town that may have been hit hardest by the storm steve steve harrigan fox news chris in this part of the texas coast there aposs a lot of small towns sometimes with a population of just a few thousand for them this storm came as a surprise because it went from almost nothing to a major powerful hurricane in less than 56 hours so people here really have a choice to make to stay put in our homes or to leave some made the wrong decision begin video clip matthew ayala rockport area resident i see the other family that was with four or five kids run back in the trailer and the tornado hit it and they were gone and like to quote more came across the other side coming on the way and they going this way and everybody in that area they were in the home there aposs no way they could have survived end video clip harrigan officials here still don apost know just how bad things are there aposs no electric power no cell phone service we aposve seen some search and rescue operations but they are very basic it is just firefighters on foot with axes they knocked on doors kick them in and say is anybody in here alive people here walk around really in a stunned days they aposve lost their houses they aposve lost their businesses some of the people we aposve spoken to say they don apost know what they aposre going to do next they have no insurance but after a moment of sadness many of them admit that they are better off than their neighbors begin video clip colby taylor rockport area resident our houses were gone everybody aposs houses were gone i aposve got friends out there that i don apost even know if they are all right end video clip harrigan many officials around her tell people don apost come back we don apost have utilities you would just be a burden stay away for now but we are seeing people come back a little at a time in the rain to pick through the wreckage to try to find something that aposs left chris back to you wallace steve thank you now with a look at where harvey is headed rick reichmuth is at the fox weather center in new york rick rick reichmuth fox news we have a long ways to go chris from this storm unfortunately resources statewide are certainly being taxed this is an evolution of the last 48 hours of the storm the problem is the storm has stalled just in short just inland but all of this moisture of this very warm gulf it aposs one of the warmest bodies of water anywhere in the world that moisture continuing to pull up now we aposre crossing the eastern side of texas that aposs targeting very directly the houston area and everywhere around it already we aposve seen some spots over two feet of rain and we have about another three days to go we knew there would probably be some spots around the 50 inch rain rainfall totals by the end of this we didn apost know exactly where that would line up it looks like it aposs going a little bit farther east than we had anticipated so we have a very heavy rain in houston we aposve already seen over two feet of rain in houston and we probably are going to be looking at about an additional two feet of rain by the time this is done that means the flooding pictures that we aposve been seeing all day today is only going to get worse by the time we get to wednesday the storm doesn apost completely pull out of the region chris until thursday into friday wallace rick thank you for that joining me now with the latest on the storm and its impact as the governor of texas greg abbott governor what is your latest damage assessment for harvey both to people and to property gov greg abbott r texas well chris it is bad and growing worse obviously part of the damage assessment is because of where the hurricane hit in the entire surrounding area now of course we are dealing with the damage around the houston area because of the flooding dollar wise it is large and growing larger it will be in the billions of dollars but we really will not be able to tell for the next couple of days when better assessments can be made wallace what is the biggest challenge right now for you and for authorities there is it the flooding in the houston area abbott we have multiple challenges all at one time as people can see the flooding in houston is dramatic some people will recall tropical storm allison that devastated houston in 2001 and this looks like somewhat of a replication of that we aposre working to save lives and to keep as many people safe as possible in the houston area but chris at the very same time we are conducting search and rescue missions where the hurricane hit near the corpus christi and rockport areas and so we are doing multiple duties in multiple parts of the state wallace yes i want to ask about that governor because we just had a report about rockport which may have been a community that hardest hit and i know the damage has been so extensive that a lot of first responders haven apost been able to go in and see what has happened to people who sheltered in place you know the casualty account at this point seems remarkably low two dead a dozen or so injured i hate to ask this but is it do you expect the casualty count to rise dramatically as first responders get into some of these more devastated areas abbott we will see we have first responders there we have what aposs called texas task force one texas task force two these are search and rescue missions as well as texas national guard who were there and who are going door to door throughout neighborhoods in rockport and across that entire region and so we will have some more reports that will come out today but i will tell you in that particular region there were a lot of warnings to evacuate there was a large number of evacuations from that area and those evacuations likely saved a whole lot of lives wallace the gulf coast in addition to all these folks in their homes the gulf coast also accounts for about a fifth of this nation aposs crude oil production and almost half of our oil refinery facilities what can you tell us about the hit that your energy sector has taken and what impact is that going to have on supplies and prices abbott sure i aposve spoken with leaders of some of these companies and listen they are very experienced in dealing with challenges like this there are hurricanes and tropical storms that pass through the gulf region all the time they were very well prepared for they hunkered down and were able to contain their facilities and they have the ability to ratchet up back up fairly quickly this will be probably a one or two week downturn period for them but they were prepared for this and they aposre prepared to wrap up very swiftly wallace let aposs talk about the federal level because i know you are coordinating with them congress changed some of the rules for fema post katrina and part of that is that they were much more able to deploy personnel and equipment in place in san antonio in the texas region before the storm hit has that made a difference sir abbott it has made a difference i aposve got to tell you i give fema a grade of a all the way from the president down i aposve spoken to the president several times to his cabinet members such as secretary of homeland security such as the administrator of fema such as tom price the secretary of health and human services and so all across the board from the white house to the federal administration to fema they aposve been very helpful we were able to see this storm coming a week or more in advance and get a lot of preposition and taking care of whether it aposd be the federal assets or the state assets or the local assets so when it comes to preparation we aposve never been more prepared for a storm than we have been this time wallace what can you tell us about president trump aposs personal engagement in this problem and managing the response to it abbott it aposs been extremely professional very helpful he called and said governor whatever you need you aposve got and this is the quickest turnaround i aposve ever seen from the time that a governor made a disaster declaration to getting that granted what that means for the layperson out there is because the president so swiftly granted my application for disaster declaration that means it triggered all the resources of fema to help texas and what you will see over the coming weeks and months is a tremendous rebuilding from all this damage and a large part of that will be because of fema helping out and so we are very appreciative of the way the president and the white house has responded to this catastrophe wallace from all the forecasts that you aposre getting sir how much longer is texas the people the millions of people there going to be under the gun from harvey whether it aposs a hurricane or a tropical storm abbott well understand that what i aposm about to tell you is not precise in perfection but from multiple reports i aposm hearing that we can expect torrential rain in the greater houston and east texas area for days to come and remember this and that is the focus on tv right now is the houston area but there are miles upon miles outside of the houston area were a lot of people will face a lot of challenges because of rain and flooding and rising and water and so we got a big task on our hands for at least several days if not a week wallace now when you say torrential rains are we talking three feet four feet and if so what to do you about that how do you try to help save those people abbott well chris we aposre measuring rain these days not in inches but in feet and we are prepared to deal with that in multiple ways for example overnight our national guard deployed to houston texas multiple high level vehicles that are going to be manned by the national guard we are deploying boats and helicopters to be involved in swift water rescues and that would be not just any houston or harris county area but that would be all over east texas where you can see all the heavy flooding but all we can do is to provide as many resources as possible to achieve goal number one and that is to save as many lives as we can wallace governor abbott i want to thank you especially for taking the time to talk to us in the midst of all this sir please know that the rest of the country has the people of texas and our thoughts and prayers abbott thank you so much wallace up next north korea launches more missiles how will the u s respond secretary of state rex tillerson joins us for an exclusive interview commercial break wallace president trump aposs national security team began the week with a careful rollout of a new strategy for afghanistan they ended the week with north korea aposs surprise launch of three short range missiles after a pause in its testing program it aposs all part of the job of our next guest secretary of state rex tillerson and mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday rex tillerson secretary of state pleased to be here chris wallace before we get to foreign affairs i want to ask you as a native son of texas and as the former chairman and ceo of exxonmobil your thoughts about hurricane harvey and especially the impact it aposs having in the oil and gas sector there on the gulf coast tillerson chris you aposre correct my wife and i are both native texans we still make our home in texas and our families are all in texas we have many many friends family that are in the affected areas and both her and mine aposs thoughts and prayers go out to those that are affected over 12 million is what i understand now in the state of texas are being impacted i think with respect to the response of the state of texas governor abbott doing a remarkable job dealing with an ongoing event and i think it aposs important that people understand and recognize this is an ongoing event that they aposre dealing with president trump has convened an all cabinets meeting yesterday they were going to have another one later this morning to ensure that all agencies were doing everything they can to support the state of texas and its response now with respect to the oil and gas industry they have been through this many many times they are probably among the most prepared for these types of events so they do a lot of pre staging of capability but there will be challenges that are created by a storm of this magnitude and a storm that aposs going to last as long as this one is i aposm confident that they will respond though capably and the government have facilitated that with early action as well wallace all right let aposs turn to your day job north korea fired three short range missiles on friday what message do you think the kim regime is sending tillerson well the firing of any ballistic missile is a violation of u n security council resolutions and we do view it as a provocative act a provocative act against the united states and our allies we continue to want the kim regime to understand there is a different path that he can choose the international community has been quite clear with the unanimous 15 0 approval of the u n security council resolution imposing the most stringent sanctions ever to be imposed on north korea there aposs also a unified international voice echoing our messages that no one wants to see a nuclear korean peninsula so we are all unified in our mission to say ph denuclearize korean peninsula we hope for the opportunity to engage with them as to how we might achieve that wallace this week both before the missile test both you and the president suggested that kim might be backing off of his missile program here both of you are begin video clip donald trump president of the united states kim jong un i respect the fact that i believe he is starting to respect us tillerson i am pleased to see that the regime in pyongyang has certainly demonstrated some level of restraint that we aposve not seen in the past end video clip wallace were both of you wrong about kim tillerson well i don apost know that we aposre wrong chris i think it aposs going to take some time to tell this type of launch again it is a violation of u n security council resolutions so it is clearly they are still messaging us as well that they are not prepared to completely back away from their position having said that we are going to continue our peaceful pressure campaign as i have described that working with allies working with china as well to see if we can bring the regime in pyongyang to the negotiating table with a view to begin a dialogue on the different future for korean peninsula and for north korea wallace president trump pledged this week to fight and win in afghanistan and i want to play a clip from his speech on monday begin video clip trump conditions on the ground not arbitrary timetables will guide our strategy from now on end video clip wallace mr secretary how open ended is that commitment how many troops as the president prepared to send to afghanistan how long as he prepared to keep them there tillerson well i think the president has been clear chris that this is a dramatic shift in terms of the military strategy we are shifting from a time based military strategy that had very clear troop ceiling levels to now as he indicated a conditions based strategy which means it will be dictated by conditions on the ground informed by battlefield commanders he has also delegated significant authority to secretary mattis to set troop levels but also has been able to delegate for the military commanders in the field decision making to begin to turn the tide against the taliban i think we all recognize that for the past couple of years the taliban has been advancing and afghan forces have been unable to push them back so there will be a definite change in military tactics on the ground now all of this is directed at sending at message to the taliban that we are not going anywhere we aposre going to be here we aposre going to continue to fight for the afghan government support the afghan security forces and what needs to happen is the taliban needs to engage with afghan government in a process of reconciliation and developing a way to govern the country in the future wallace but the point i guess i aposm trying to get at is when you say that they you were going to be there until they get that message is that an open ended commitment are you saying whatever the president aposs view is whatever it takes tillerson the president was clear that he is not setting any arbitrary timelines he aposs not committing to any deadlines he did in his speech though you will recall say that our patience is not unlimited our time is not unlimited so i think what the president has indicated wallace he was talking about that in terms of the afghan government tillerson correct and i think what the president has indicated is we are not going to set arbitrary deadlines we aposre going to monitor the conditions on the ground and our decisions will be formed around the progress on the ground wallace there aposs also the question of how this administration defines victory in afghanistan and you and the president talked about that in somewhat different terms here you both are begin video clip trump attacking our enemies obliterating isis crushing al qaeda preventing the taliban from taking over afghanistan and stopping mass terror attacks against americans before they emerge tillerson this entire effort is intended to put pressure on the taliban to have the taliban understand you will not win a battlefield victory we may not win one but neither will you end video clip wallace so mr secretary which is it is it obliterating al qaeda and isis or is it just getting the taliban to the negotiating table tillerson well the war against isis is quite clear chris and the president has been clear that we will defeat isis we will to eliminate isis apos capability to organize to raise financing to plan recruit new recruits to their fight to carry out terrorism acts throughout the world that fight is progressing quite well we are well on our way to defeating isis we have now taken the caliphate from them in iraq over 70 percent of the territory has been recovered none of it has been lost back to those forces almost 2 million displaced iraqi people have now returned to their homes in the fight in syria we are in the process of liberating raqqa which was their self designated capital that liberation is going quite well and it aposs our expectation that we will defeat isis in syria and iraq and then our effort is global to ensure that isis does not reemerge elsewhere now all terrorist organizations have somewhat different objectives so whether it aposs isis al qaeda the taliban or others our objective is to deny any terrorist organization any territory with which they can organize raise financing recruit new fighters develop techniques for carrying out terrorist attacks and then deploying those we know that if we deny them the space to do that we protect the homeland we also protect americans and our allies as well so in the case of afghanistan afghanistan has a history of being a refuge for some of the most devastating attacks carried out as we all know the attack of 9 11 was organized and carried out from afghanistan so in afghanistan we have to secure afghanistan in a way that that can never occur again because there aposs no territory available to organizations to do so wallace sebastian gorka one of the president aposs spokesmen on foreign policy was fired on friday this following the firing of steve bannon and some folks are saying that this is particularly on the right further to the right i should say are saying that this is a victory of the globalists and they include you in that group over the so called america firsters sebastian gorka in his resignation letter wrote this about the afghanistan speech the fact that those who drafted and approved the speech remove any mention of radical islam or radical islamic terrorism proves that a crucial element of the presidential campaign has been lost is gorka right tillerson i think he aposs completely wrong chris and i think it shows a lack of understanding of the president aposs broader policy when it comes to protecting americans at home and abroad from all acts of terrorism terrorism as we aposve said manifests itself in many types of organization the president has charged us to develop policies and tactics both diplomatically and militarily to attack terrorism in as many forms wherever it exists in the world and wherever it might present a threat to the homeland or to americans anywhere this means that we have to develop techniques that are global in their nature all we want is to ensure that terrorists do not have the capability to organize and carry out attacks wallace so what you make of this division between america firsters and so called globalists tillerson i don apost see any division chris i think it aposs a question of tactics and how you achieve those objectives i think the president has been clear in his speech in afghanistan that we are not undertaking nation building so we will be shifting our diplomatic and aid and development programs as well to coincide with the president aposs view that the afghan government and that afghan people must own their form of government and they must come to some reconciliation with all ethnic groups including the taliban as to how they can secure their country as a peaceful country one that does not support terrorism does not provide safe havens for terrorists and does not align itself with any terrorist organizations or countries that do that aposs what winning looks like wallace finally and i got a little over a minute left the controversy over the racial protest in charlottesville and the president aposs response to it has become an international issue a u n committee this week criticized the trump administration for quote its failure at the highest political level to unequivocally reject and condemn the racist violent events and demonstrations and here was the president in phoenix this week talking more about the media than he was about the neo nazis and the klan here he is begin video clip donald trump president of the united states the only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself and the fake news end video clip wallace does that make it harder for you to push american values around the world when some foreign leaders question president aposs values rex tillerson secretary of state chris we express america aposs values from the state department we represent the american people we represent america aposs values our commitment to freedom our commitment to equal treatment to people the world over and that message has never changed wallace and when the president gets into the kind of controversy he does and the u n committee response the way it does it seems to say they begin to doubt are whether we aposre living those values tillerson i don apost believe anyone doubts the american people aposs values or the commitment of the american government or the government aposs agencies to advancing those values and defending those values wallace and the presidents values tillerson the president speaks for himself chris wallace are you separating yourself from that sir tillerson i aposve spoken i aposve made my own comments as to our vales as well in a speech i gave to the state department this past week wallace mr secretary thank you thanks for coming today always a pleasure to talk with you sir tillerson my pleasure chris wallace stay safe tillerson we aposll do wallace and let aposs hope those folks and friends family in texas stay safe tillerson indeed keep them in your prayers wallace yes you bet up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss president trump pardoning former arizona sheriff joe arpaio supporters are happy critics are outraged plus what would you like to ask the panel about the president aposs pardon of sheriff joe just go to facebook or twitter at foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up the president pardons former arizona sheriff joe arpaio begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i aposm just curious do the people in this room like sheriff joe end video clip wallace we aposll ask our panel about the political and legal fallout next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states was sheriff joe convicted for doing his job he should have had a jury but you know what i aposll make a prediction i think he aposs going to be just fine ok end video clip wallace president trump in phoenix clearly hinting he was going to pardon sheriff joe arpaio in fact as a line from the godfather today i settle all family business and while the country was watching hurricane harvey friday night the president fired sebastian gorka set out guidelines for banning transgender aposs in the military and pardoned sheriff joe which means it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove columnist for the hill juan williams catherine lucey who covers the white house for the associated press and josh holmes mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff and the gop strategist well sheriff arpaio was convicted last month of criminal contempt for defying a court order to stop detaining latinos on suspicions that they might be illegal his opponents called it racial profiling we asked you for questions about the president aposs pardon and maria swanson tweeted this if the law doesn apost apply to arpaio should it apply to anyone else karl how do you answer maria what do you think of the pardoning as a legal proposition and also the politics of it karl rove fox news contributor yes well look the president is entitled under the constitution to have an unlimited power of pardon i think he ill exercised it in this instance sheriff arpaio was found guilty of violating a federal court order for over a year that said to stop racially profiling people for driving latino or walking latino and he openly defied it and said he was going to continue the current policy that the federal court had told him to stop and this did not go through the normal routine that pardon applications go through the department of justice it was drafted inside the white house it didn apost go through the regular process review by outside lawyers i think the president is making a political statement an ally of his was about ready to go to jail for six months or so and he stepped in he had the right to do it i think it was a bad mistake and a bad signal for the country wallace and there aposs also a report in the washington post today that the president had actually talked beforehand to the attorney general jeff sessions about not bringing the case in the first place juan some critics are suggesting that the way that the pardon went down and i will refer back to what karl was just saying no appeal no expression of remorse no review by the justice department may in some sense send a signal to some of his aides who might be under investigation in the unrelated investigation by special counsel mueller he aposll take care of them too juan williams fox news poljitical analyst well this was a political act as karl said this was not an act of mercy for someone who had been denied justice sheriff arpaio has not been sentenced yet he aposs been convicted but not sentenced so this was a preemptive act by president trump that i think then sets a precedent going in that he can act in terms of pardons with little rebuke from the justice department to help out someone who aposs a family member someone who aposs a political ally this you remember arpaio was not only an early supporter of donald trump he was an early birther and he is the face of hostility towards immigrants specifically with mexicans and latinos in his country so it was a political act that he promised his base on tuesday night at that rally in phoenix and he has delivered on that promise in such a way as to say that in the future such acts of pardon are now more normal he can say this set a pattern and he can pardon family friends and allies wallace josh are we overanalyzing this josh holmes founder cavalry yes i don apost think there aposs any grave threat to the democracy here i mean the presidential pardons are pretty clear he aposs got really broad authority to do just about anything he wants and this is an 85 year old law enforcement officer who you know may or may not get six months in prison as a result of a guilty verdict in comparison to some of the pardons and clemency that we aposve seen over the last decade or two decades it sort of pales in comparison my guess is that your reaction to this is probably a direct attribution to how you feel about joe arpaio and you know he aposs no not my cup of tea but i think for a lot of trump supporters he aposs the face of law and order williams but i think i think just quickly sorry for interrupting chris but i think very quickly josh the idea that you undermine a federal court order and say that law enforcement is not subject to equal justice under the law seems different to me when nixon was pardoned by ford huge pushback even from the president of the united states allowing a double standard to be put in place for a former president holmes well rove yes we now recognize however that was a great act on behalf of our country it united our country by putting that issue behind us i aposd say this the suggestion in the washington post that there is a grand strategy to pardon arpaio and signal to anybody who might be involved in the campaign russian inaudible blah blah blah blah blah it just doesn apost work there aposs no strategy behind this this was an act on impulse by the president it has no relationship to the ongoing investigation of russia there is no in my opinion belief that we are going to send a message wallace ok i want to switch quickly to another subject the president escalated his fight this week with members of congress it aposs become a pretty long roll call let aposs put it up on the screen mitch mcconnell bob corker john mccain flake speaker ryan josh you have a dog in this fight as the former chief of staff to mitch mcconnell is that the president separating himself and picking fights with all these members republican leaders is that going to make it harder for him to pass and them to pass the agenda holmes yes no question there aposs a great piece in the washington post by paul cain ph this weekend that explores the presidential triangulation and it can be a very effective strategy at times where it aposs not an effective strategy is when your party runs congress and you aposre before the midterms where it could lead is impeachment and i think look it has one practical effect of attacking your own party it drives down the overall approval of congress your leaders within and the generic ballot meaning republicans versus democrat played out to its logical extension what it means is that democrats have a heck of a lot better shot in the midterms than they probably would ordinarily and otherwise and if democrats take over the house if this president believes the democratic based it is not going to enforce impeachment proceedings he hasn apost been paying attention to what aposs happening wallace well let aposs talk about one other more immediate issue because one of the things that washington must do in september is it aposs got to keep funding the government which runs out of money on september 30th the president had something interesting to say about that this week begin video clip donald trump president of the united states believe me if we have to close down our government we aposre building a wall end video clip wallace catherine what do your sources in the white house tell you is this president really prepared to force a government shutdown unless he gets funding for the wall catherine lucey associated press well chris i aposve been talking with republican in and outside of this white house who are close to the white house and there is a sense that you know he is we shouldn apost view this as a completely empty threat this president is frustrated he aposs frustrated he hasn apost moved his agenda more his base cares deeply about immigration his base cares about the wall i mean if you looked at the rally this week in phoenix people were chanting build the wall as they have been you know for over a year so yes the president given to ph colorful language but wallace but let me ask you what leverage does he have because he aposs going to need democratic votes and democrats are going to say you want to shut down the government over the wall we aposre not going to give you the wall ad you aposre going to own the shutdown lucey he certainly doesn apost have leverage over democrats on the wall but what i aposm hearing is that he is going to continue to push on this he wants to see something on the wall and that he aposs not backing down from a fight even if it aposs with his own party wallace all right we need to take a break here panel when we come back the president launches a new effort in afghanistan while north korea launches a new provocation we aposll get our panel aposs reaction when we come right back commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states america aposs enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out i will not say when we are going to attack but attack we will end video clip wallace president trump vowing to be unpredictable as he re commits to fighting and winning the war in afghanistan and we aposre back now with the panel karl you of course were in the white house 16 years ago when president bush launched the war in afghanistan did president trump make the right decision in recommitting and what do you think of the strategy that he laid out rove yes i believe he did there aposs no good decision on this he took the best of the available options which is to sustain the afghan government and its military in this fight and to make a commitment to add additional u s troops to allow them to do this it aposs a big change from what president obama did president obama was not conditions to the ground he was an arbitrary deadline and we were thankfully saved from having these so called zero option exercise in 2012 by our nato allies who convinced president obama that just simply because he was up for election was not reason enough to withdraw u s and nato troops our only chance to keep afghanistan for becoming once again a haven for international terrorism is to win this and president trump i think did the right thing on monday night by recommitting america to the fight wallace but juan there are real questions about whether sending more troops and this first deployment we aposre told although the president won apost announce it is going to be 4 000 troops is that going to make any real difference in ending winning ending america aposs longest war williams i think if troop numbers were going to make any difference you go back to apos11 we had 100 000 troops on the ground so i don apost think adding 4 000 troops to the existing 8 000 or so that are on the ground is going to make any radical difference the key here it seems to me is that what the president said we have to have talks with the taliban what we heard from rex tillerson this morning in his interview with you but also earlier is that the taliban is going to have victories on the battlefield the u s is going to have victories no one aposs going to win we need to talk that aposs where the focus of this should be but at the moment with so many generals surrounding this president i think the general have said let aposs look for a military solution and i think it plays into a lot of republican memes about oh obama pulled out too quickly we want to make sure that we are there remember the good that came from the surge back in apos06 when president bush sent added forces into iraq but that aposs really not what this is about this should be about getting pakistan afghanistan the united states our allies to the table and find a settlement wallace all right i there aposs more to talk about that and we aposll have a chance but i also want to talk about the other big news because there was this latest salvo from north korea where on friday night they fired off three more missiles here aposs what secretary of state tillerson said about the kim regime a few weeks ago begin video clip rex tillerson secretary of state we do not seek a regime change we do not seek the collapse of the regime end video clip wallace catherine does this president doesn apost this administration have a clear plan for how they intend to deal with the kim regime lucey you know it aposs interesting looking at this latest missile attack so far the response has been pretty muted you saw this this morning from the secretary he noted it was a provocative act but you know then said they want to continue with this peaceful pressure and it seems like for now you know what i aposm hearing is that there is interest in seeing how the new u n sanctions play out those unanimously approved sanctions were pretty tough that came earlier this month and that that seems to be for the moment with this latest latest attack what they aposre looking at wallace so all the talk a couple of weeks ago about fire and fury and locked and loaded that aposs being dialed back by the administration lucey well you saw that earlier this week i mean the secretary you know praised him for restraint you know the president seemed more positive so the way this the most recent conflict played out they seemed pretty satisfied with how that went so for now this seems to be how they aposre looking at it wallace but josh and i gently pointed this out to the secretary of state when they are talking about restraint and he respects us and then he fires off three missiles they look a little silly don apost they holmes right well a little bit i mean i get you get the impression by listening to the president and listening to the secretary of state over the last week that they were proceeding as if they aposre dealing with a rational actor here ad i think anybody who has seen the way that u s foreign policy has proceeded with north korea over the last two decades it aposs pretty clear that we aposre not dealing with a rational actor at all and in fact the one thing that they crave more than anything is the attention of the american people and so i think you know to the extent that there has been a more muted response as has been suggested here is probably a pretty good thing every time they fire something off into the water next to the korean peninsula doesn apost mean the american people need to rush out and note it so i you know i can apost fault them for their response to this wallace karl the president likes to say that he inherited a message in north korea and he when he talks about inheriting the mess it aposs including from your fellow bush 43 in addition to obama and clinton from your days in the white house what lesson did you learn about dealing with this problem and with this regime rove well i think they do crave attention and so you don apost want to give them attention unless it aposs necessary i have to say i think president trump did the right thing when they were talking about launching missiles towards a u s territory guam and that aposs when he made the fire and fury comment and that aposs where mattis said you fire a missile at a u s territory it is an act of war and what happened the president aposs gambit worked they dropped the plan to launch the missiles towards guam and instead shot three intermediate range missiles and short range missiles wallace short range missiles rove short range missiles off into the ocean so so who cares and i think so it was the right response when they were saying we aposre threatening u s territory right response today to say we aposre not paying much attention to you shooting off short range missiles and we knew you had the capacity to do so already wallace thank you panel on that hopeful note see you next sunday up next our power player of the week a voice of her generation better than mine shows no signs of slowing down commercial break wallace the music business is notoriously tough and fickle singers have one big hit and are never heard from again which is why as we told you in may it aposs so remarkable for someone to keep turning out classics for more than 50 years here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape judy collins singer songwriter i think a thing from childhood i think of things from last week i think of things from tomorrow i aposm in a kind of state of meditation wallace judy collins is talking about what she thinks of when she sings a song something she aposs done so memorably for more than half a century collins singing you smell on time ph watching from a lonely wooden tower and all of a sudden you aposre in the right place at the right time doing the right thing it was totally magical wallace collins exploded on the music scene in new york aposs greenwich village in 1961 it was the world of pete seeger and woody guthrie and bob dylan wallace on camera was it the music that attracted your or was it the message collins well it was everything it was creative it was exciting it was music people were writing songs about every aspect of life wallace voice over it was a world where late one night joni mitchell sang her both sides now over the phone wallace on camera and what did you think collins i said i aposll be right over this is fantastic wallace is there a phrase like collins singing tears and fears and feeling proud to say i love you right out loud wallace how would you choose what worked for you and what didn apost collins if it hits me here i sing it if i if that doesn apost happen i never want to hear it again wallace voice over in 1975 collins heard another song by stephen sondheim collins singing isn apost it rich are we a pair me here at last on the ground you in midair i mean how could you not want to sing that song wallace it won the grammy for song of the year collins made her mark in other ways protesting for civil rights and against the war in vietnam and in addition to singing her own songs and others her failing love affair with stephen stills inspired him to write the classic sweet judy blue eyes stephen stills musician singing i am yours you are mine you are what you are wallace on camera he was trying to win you back collins yes he was wallace and did it work collins no i said it aposs beautiful but it aposs not going to get me back wallace since you asked wallace voice over before we knew it collins was giving us a private concert at age 78 she still does more than 100 performances a year collins singing this is what i ask you for i love to sing and the lights are on and the music is on and the sound is great and the band is great and i aposm exactly where i should be doing what i should be doing wallace no plans to retire collins oh my god it aposs not in my repertoire you know i think part of it is that i am an a
