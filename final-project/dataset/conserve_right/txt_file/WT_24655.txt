for his message that democrats are shoving the country toward socialism that s not what government is or what it should be he told about 200 alamosa county republicans at a barbecue fundraiser in a national guard armory we have to stand up and fight are you going to join me in this fight for gardner and other republicans making the same pitch including president donald trump and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell the key question is whether it will attract moderate voters not just their conservative stalwarts based on interviews with over three dozen coloradans last week from denver s suburbs south to this town in the flat san luis valley the argument has yet to take root though the gop has 18 months to sell it before election day 2020 top stories democratic clerk charged with

time few volunteered a drift toward socialism as a major worry with health care and living costs cited far more frequently several said capitalism was too embedded in the u s to be truly threatened and republicans were using socialism to stir unease with democrats by raising the specter of the old repressive soviet union and today s chaotic venezuela they re preying on fear said david kraemer 67 a financial adviser who s not registered with a political party and lives in the denver suburb of westminster yet when asked directly whether socialism was a concern many expressed a wariness of injecting more government into people s lives rather than naming policies that troubled them many mentioned two self proclaimed democratic socialists vermont independent sen bernie sanders who s seeking the democratic presidential nomination and freshman rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y the comments suggested that republicans might be tapping into unease over letting either party go too far checks and balances are what make this country so great said steve lajoie 46 a self employed carpenter from denver and independent voter gardner 44 who s expected to face a tough re election fight

emissions sanders has sponsored medicare for all legislation that s been embraced by many of his democratic presidential rivals ocasio cortez is an architect of the green new deal which remains a concept not proposed legislation many democrats especially moderates have kept their distance from both plans divisions republicans are happy to exploit democrats reject the socialism assertion as a distraction from trump s unpopularity and the issues they will emphasize especially improving health care and protecting jobs and income they say efforts to make health care more available and combat global warming have nothing to do with limiting individuals rights democrats note that voters gave them total control of colorado government in november despite gop attempts to pin the socialism label on former u s rep jared polis who was elected governor they say growing numbers of younger urban and hispanic residents are steadily making the state more liberal gop cries of socialism are cold war

republican base alone carroll said republicans see a powerful argument in telling voters they need a gop controlled senate for protection against democrats who are coming after their current health insurance their energy sector jobs and more i think we re running to be the firewall that saves the country from socialism mcconnell r ky told reporters recently republicans say the anti socialism message will prove powerful in a state that overwhelmingly rejected a ballot initiative creating single payer health care and where registered unaffiliated voters often with libertarian leanings

mechanic who like jones is an unaffiliated voter it s putting our taxes to a real good use not all democrats are dismissive of the socialism strategy eva henry a commissioner of adams county outside denver says her community s blue collar families might buy the gop argument if they believe democrats proposals would drive up taxes our democrats can vote republican because they vote their
