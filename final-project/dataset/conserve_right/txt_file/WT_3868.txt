involved in discussions over whether trump held up the military aid to ukraine to try to pressure the county s president to announce the investigations into democrats including former vice president joe biden a leading 2020 candidate and his son hunter testimony last week revealed that at least three people overheard a july phone call in which trump and sondland discussed efforts to push for the investigations one of those people david holmes the political counsel at the u s embassy in ukraine said he heard trump s voice through the earpiece of the phone because the president was talking so loud according to testimony obtained by the associated press sondland called trump as they dined at a kyiv restaurant for lunch holmes said that sondland told trump on that call that ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy would do the investigations and would do anything you ask him to the overheard call came a day after a call between the two presidents that is at the heart of the democratic probe in that call trump directly asked zelenskiy to investigate the democrats trump has said he has no recollection of the overheard call and has suggested he barely knew sondland a wealthy donor to his 2016 campaign but democrats are hoping sondland sheds new light on the discussions two of the three amigos the intelligence committee will hear from both sondland and former ukrainian envoy kurt volker this week two of the so called three amigos who had taken the lead on ukrainian policy outside normal channels the third amigo was energy secretary rick perry who has refused to provide documents or testify in the impeachment probe on trump s orders several of the diplomats who were supposed to be in charge of ukraine policy have testified about their concerns as the men appeared to coordinate with trump s personal lawyer rudy giuliani volker who will testify on tuesday afternoon was closely involved in negotiations with ukrainian officials as they tried to

meetings vindman and hill both told investigators behind closed doors about a july meeting at the white house in which sondland told ukrainian officials that zelenskiy would have to open an investigation into the bidens if he wanted a meeting with trump at the white house there was no ambiguity said vindman an army officer detailed to the white house who showed up at the deposition in his military uniform hill testified that former national security adviser john bolton abruptly ended the meeting when sondland brought up the investigations she said bolton later compared the ask to a drug deal headed to judiciary the intelligence committee is expected to wrap up its part of the impeachment probe in the coming weeks after that the three committees will submit a report to the judiciary panel which will oversee the impeachment process judiciary is expected to hold its own hearings and eventually vote on articles of impeachment democrats say they are still deciding whether to write them next would come a floor vote and if articles of impeachment are approved by the house there would then be a senate trial house democrats are hoping to finish the process by the end of the year a senate trial if called for would likely come in 2020 associated press writers jill
