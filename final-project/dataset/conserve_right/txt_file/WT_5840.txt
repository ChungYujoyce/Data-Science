apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion speaker nancy pelosi amid the largely laughable testimony of the diplomats can you say heavy on the hearsay guys came out with her own largely laughable conclusion of all that hearsay testimony and said president donald trump is guilty of bribery she even found him guilty of confessing to bribery who knew pelosi at her advanced age could perform so many contortions this has to be the greatest acrobatic spin in political history top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots the bribe she said in a widely reported news conference on the heels of the first public impeachment hearing is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections that s bribery she then referenced a quip trump made about his call with the ukraine president when he said it was perfect that he did nothing wrong and she went on what the president has admitted to and says it s perfect i say it s perfectly wrong it s bribery from there the media played its part pelosi says trump admitted to bribery cbs news reported what trump did makes what nixon did look almost small pelosi says cnn reported thing is pelosi s all smoke and mirrors and daggers if trump were guilty of bribery if trump had confessed to bribery we wouldn t be entering day two of public impeachment hearings on capitol hill would we we d be covering the jail cells and making guesses about trump s new home the root of the whole impeachment madness democrats have driven over ukraine focuses on that very matter determining whether trump used his power and platform to force ukraine to do something he wanted in exchange for money democrats have come up short in proving this so they ve sent in their spinmeister experts to bridge the gap it s no coincidence that the very word pelosi chose to characterize trump s behavior during his call with ukraine s president is specifically named in the constitution as an impeachable offense article ii section 4 provides that the president vice president and all civil officers of the united states shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors quid pro quo wasn t getting it so the left had to slap on a label that s impeachable but the fact that pelosi s jumped over the whole investigative process and sailed right by due process to try for a slam dunk on impeachment shouldn t detract from the basic thing here trump s innocent until proven guilty imaginations are not the same as realities and pelosi s premature and politically charged jump laudable for its magnificent stretching as it is has fallen far far short of the hoop she s crashed on the court it s not just the constitution that calls for facts to come before conviction it s common sense it s the american people cheryl chumley can be reached at emailprotected or on twitter
