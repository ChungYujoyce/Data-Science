tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn sen elizabeth warren s plan to pay for a series of far reaching government programs with a 2 wealth tax has liberal audiences chanting 2 cents in much the same way that president trump s vow to build a wall along the southern border led to a build that wall battle cry the tax increase on the ultra wealthy however is getting the cold shoulder from lawmakers on capitol hill it s the harsh dose of reality that awaits every president in the halls of congress where ideas that energize the masses on the campaign trail often get flattened see also bernie sanders targets ultra rich with new extreme wealth tax history proves that generally the biggest ideas are almost impossible to get done as stated in campaigns said sen doug jones of alabama likely the most vulnerable senate democrat in 2020 if you are going to govern you have to give and take you are going to reach across the aisle and sometimes on some of the issues being talked about reach within your own party to get the right votes look no further than the medicare for all bill that sen bernard sanders of vermont rolled out in april to great liberal fanfare with the support of 14 democrats from relatively safe blue states the measure is emblematic of the aggressive push from far left activists fighting to steer the democratic party in a more liberal direction and the uphill climb ahead of them since the bill was introduced it has failed to gain the support of any other lawmaker in the upper chamber all while mr sanders ms warren and other far left presidential contenders make the case that it can be a sort of cure all polls show roughly half of the public embraces the idea of a government run single payer health care system but support erodes when respondents learn that it could lead to longer wait times the elimination of private health insurance and higher taxes ms warren s wealth tax also garners strong support a recent new york times survey monkey poll showed 6 in 10 voters approving of the idea voters though are skeptical that the plan will survive in the polarized political climate some of the other ideas aired on the campaign trail such as decriminalizing border crossings are so removed from the discussion in washington that they haven t made it into the scores of bills filed in recent years former rep beto o rourke of texas meanwhile has faced stiff blowback from capitol hill over his thunderous vow to take away americans ar 15s and ak 47s as part of a mandatory buyback program for so called assault weapons rep ro khanna a california democrat who is backing mr sanders campaign said voters know the candidates could struggle to deliver on their promises if elected former new york gov mario cuomo once said you campaign in poetry and you govern in prose and a campaign is about the aspirational vision about what you believe an ideal society should look like mr khanna said once you are president then obviously you have to work with the congress and the senate to get as close to that vision that you outlined as possible and that requires coalition building it requires compromises and that is a messy process and no president in history is able to get the entirety of their vision passed president barack obama learned the difficulty of governing when he had to retreat from his push for a public health care option to get every democrat to support the affordable care act when he couldn t get congress to back protection for illegal immigrant dreamers mr obama responded by making changes unilaterally through executive action sparking a series of legal battles mr trump also has watched from the oval office as lawmakers including fellow republicans have resisted his efforts to scrap obamacare and to fulfill his promise to build 1 000 miles of border wall between mexico and the united states to curb illegal crossings lawmakers want to know how mr trump plans to fulfill his promise of getting mexico to pay the bill while the president tries to find funds beyond what congress has appropriated that could be a bad omen for ms warren s vision which hinges largely on raising 2 5 trillion over 10 years by passing a 2 tax on individuals with more than 50 million in assets she says the tax would pay for a policy wish list of universal child care universal pre k school increased social security benefits higher wages for child care workers and preschool teachers a 50 billion investment into historically black colleges and universities tuition free college and reducing student debt for 95 of individuals it s time for a wealth tax in this country ms warren said over the weekend at the polk county democrats steak fry she pumped her hands above her head and greeted the chants of 2 cents 2 cents with a big smile here s how it works your first 50 million is free and clear but your 50 million and the first dollar you have to pitch in 2 cents and 2 cents for every dollar after that she said meanwhile the push is making it easier for mr trump and other republicans to paint democrats as socialists and making life harder for down ticket democrats to run on more pragmatic messages i fear that some of the presidential candidates on the democratic side are moving a little too far from the center and that is certainly going to impact down ballot races like mine said rep anthony brindisi of new york i appreciate when candidates come out with big bold ideas but the ideas to fix our nation s immigration system or gun violence problems or health care issues have been around for a long time we have just needed some compromise to get something done ms warren though has shown no signs of moving away from the populist pitch that is attracting massive crowds to her campaign rallies she also has been surging in polls including in iowa where she has leapfrogged over former vice president joseph r biden into first place mr jones who is backing mr biden also said the far left promises can make his political life more difficult but like i say you are going to see some of the things that president trump is running on that is going to make whoever the nominee is
