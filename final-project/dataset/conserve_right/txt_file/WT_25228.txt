coronavirus global survey a group of 16 states including california new york and colorado filed a lawsuit monday against trump s emergency declaration the lawsuit filed in the u s district court for the northern district of california alleges trump s declaration is unconstitutional all the states involved in the lawsuit have democratic attorneys general using a broad interpretation of his executive powers trump declared an emergency last week to obtain wall funding beyond the 1 4 billion congress approved for border security the move allows the president to bypass congress to use money from the pentagon and other budgets trump s use of the emergency declaration has drawn bipartisan criticism and is already facing a number of legal challenges another suit was filed tuesday in the northern district of california by the american civil liberties union filed on behalf of the sierra club and the southern border communities coalition it says there is no emergency to justify the president s action and accuses trump and other members of his administration of violating constitutional limits on their authority democrats are also planning to introduce a resolution disapproving of the declaration once congress returns to session and it is likely to pass both chambers several republican senators are already indicating they would vote against trump though there do not yet appear to be enough votes to override a veto by the president sen lisa murkowski a republican from alaska would not explicitly say tuesday whether she would support a resolution of disapproval if one came before the senate but she made clear she was worried about the precedent that could be set by trump going around congress to fund the wall i ll be very direct i don t like this i don t like this i think it takes us down a road and with a precedent that if it s allowed that we may come to regret said murkowski who said she supports efforts to bolster security at the border but is concerned about

join democrats to uphold the constitution and stand with the american people against the president s brazen assault earlier tuesday trump singled out california for its lead role in the suit seeking to link the state s high speed rail project to his plan for the wall on twitter trump claimed the failed fast train project was beset by world record setting cost overruns and had become hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed wall the estimated cost for a san francisco to los angeles train has more than doubled to 77 billion that s about 13 times the 5 7 billion trump sought unsuccessfully from congress to build the wall hours later the u s department of transportation announced it planned to cancel 929 million in federal money allocated to california s rail project and seek to claw back 2 5 billion the state has already spent california gov gavin newsom charged it was a reaction to the lawsuit and pledged a fight to keep the money it s no coincidence that the administration s threat comes 24 hours after california led 16 states in challenging the president s farcical national emergency newsom said in a statement this is clear political retribution by president trump and we won t sit idly by the spat over the rail project comes after newsom said last week the project as currently planned would cost too much and take too long he said the state would
