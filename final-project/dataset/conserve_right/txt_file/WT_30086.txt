president s comments in a formal complaint filed with the intelligence community s inspector general the whistleblower said i was not a direct witness to most of the events described but had received information over the past four months from multiple u s government officials alleging that trump is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 u s election the whistleblower found the accounts by colleagues to be credible because in almost all cases multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another the allegations

chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process with grave consequences for our democracy and national security according to a person familiar with the event it was less of a typical meet and greet that presidents do when visiting american embassies abroad and had more of a campaign rally flavor with about 200 people many of them political supporters of trump the person said that while u s ambassador to the un kelly craft was there few rank and file staffers from the u s mission to the united nations attended this person and another familiar with the event said there was a band and a large number of craft friends and family including young children who posed for selfies with trump the people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private event former state department and other officials who have participated in events similar to thursday s also condemned trump s remarks they urged lawmakers from both political parties to do the same the president of the united states threatened potential charges of treason and execution to those who would dare report abuses of power the statement said an american leader issuing such threats in front of public servants not to mention their young children is a dangerous and damaging development for our country such a statement is not only illegal it is immoral the white house had no comment
