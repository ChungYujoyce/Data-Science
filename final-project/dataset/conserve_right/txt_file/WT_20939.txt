apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis president trump s stunning dismissal of john r bolton clears the stage for secretary of state mike pompeo along with vice president mike pence one of the few members of mr trump s original national security inner circle still standing to wield more influence over a raft of foreign policy challenges confronting the white house while mr pompeo was publicly aligned with the ousted national security adviser s notoriously hard line positions on several fronts in particular on iran the two sharply disagreed in private on a range of other matters most notably the pursuit of sensitive nuclear negotiations with north korea see also john bolton s sudden ouster creates shock waves confusion national security sources said tuesday that mr bolton s departure could open the way for renewed working level talks and a possible step by step approach with north korea an approach the state department was once seen to advocate only to be shut down by mr bolton s demand that pyongyang accept an all or nothing deal it wasn t the only area where the two men disagreed mr pompeo s background as a tea party backed star in the house of representatives has made him more adept at working personally with mr trump particularly when it comes to threading the policy needle implementing the president s america first foreign policy impulses but the secretary of state s influence was challenged when mr bolton an entirely different kind of foreign policy conservative joined the administration s inner circle in april 2018 mr bolton s neoconservative bent favoring u s military intervention and regime change as go to policy options initially added heft to the administration s pressure campaigns against iran and north korea but it also soon clashed with mr trump s desires to withdraw u s forces from undesired conflict zones and to persuade foreign nations to take more responsibility for global security even if it means pressuring allies to pay more for their own defense mr pompeo cultivated a close relationship with mr trump after being named head of the cia giving mr trump personal intelligence briefings one sign of his continuing clout one of the first names floated as a permanent replacement for mr bolton was stephen e biegun the secretary of state s envoy to talks with north korea and a close political ally the secretary of state has not always meshed perfectly with his boss including mr trump s surprise recognition of israeli control of the golan heights and the president s cut of foreign aid programs to central american nations but mr pompeo s personal rapport with mr trump his willingness to defend the administration in the media and his determined campaign never to show daylight between himself and the president on major issues are likely to take on new significance with mr bolton gone mr pompeo made no secret tuesday of the fact that he and mr bolton crossed swords on policy over the past year there were many times ambassador bolton and i disagreed that s to be sure the secretary of state told reporters but that s true for lots of people with whom i interact he said separately that mr trump should have people that he trusts and values and whose efforts and judgments benefit him in delivering american foreign policy the fall of mr bolton and rise of mr pompeo could play out quickly when world leaders gather for the annual u n general assembly in new york this month while the state department has energetically implemented mr trump s maximum pressure campaign against iran after the withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal mr pompeo has been careful to leave room for mr trump s expressed wish for a possible personal diplomatic overture along the lines of his north korea policy asked tuesday whether there could be a precedent shattering meeting between mr trump and iranian president hassan rouhani at the u n gathering mr pompeo said simply sure the president has made very clear he is prepared to meet iranian leaders with no preconditions in search of a better deal to curb tehran mr pompeo said one republican insider told the associated press that mr bolton s opposition to such a meeting was a precipitating factor in his dismissal some republicans appeared to openly cheer mr bolton s dismissal sen rand paul kentucky republican and member of the senate foreign relations committee told reporters that mr trump has long been clear that he s not for regime change he said that on north korea he s actually said that on iran and you know bolton s been very very loud in his call for regime change around the world mr paul said i think the problem is that it s a naive point of view to believe that we can militarily topple regimes around the world and that they ll be replaced with democracies rep jackie speier a california democrat who serves on the house permanent select committee on intelligence told cnn that mr trump and mr bolton were like oil and water while the president s relationship with secretary pompeo is quite strong north korea diplomacy could feel an immediate shift with mr pompeo s rising clout mr bolton infuriated pyongyang and stunned others in the administration when he said the u s was looking for a libya style model for the north koreans even though libyan dictator moammar gadhafi lost his power and then his life after agreeing to give up his nuclear programs in a deal with the george w bush administration mr bolton s departure could open the way for more low key lower level contacts between washington and pyongyang to better lay the groundwork for the next trump kim summit bolton s exit may lead to a more realistic step by step approach to north korean denuclearization where bolton s all or nothing approach to easing sanctions has produced a deadlock despite three trump kim summits said alexander vershbow a former u s ambassador to russia and south korea and a former nato deputy secretary general bolton s departure was only a matter of time mr vershbow a fellow with the atlantic council s scowcroft center for strategy and security said in comments circulated to reporters still the timing is ironic coming after trump s termination of negotiations with the taliban on which bolton was right to be skeptical maybe trump didn t like hearing i told you so mr pompeo has also apparently been spared the occasional dressing down that former trump aides say are a regular feature of working in this administration i argue with everyone mr trump told new york magazine in a 2018 interview except pompeo i don t think i ve
