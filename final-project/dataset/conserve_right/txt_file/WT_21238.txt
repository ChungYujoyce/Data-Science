o connor in washington president trump s2020 reelection campaignalso sent out a fundraising email late wednesday asking supporters to stand with him ahead of the report s release even with the report s redactions thursday s release will shed more light on what mr mueller s team uncovered during its sprawling 22 month probe the special counsel s team issued more than 2 800 subpoenas executed nearly 500 search warrants obtained more than 230 orders for records and interviewed 500 witnesses but much is expected to be shielded from the public mr barr said this month that every page of the report contains confidential grand jury information the justice department has identified four categories of protected information and each one has a different color code to explain the redaction besides grand jury information the other classified material includes u s intelligence information details about ongoing investigations and any information that could infringe on the personal privacy of peripheral third parties the redactions will heat up an already white hot feud between mr barr and congressional democrats who say the attorney general reached a predetermined conclusion about mr mueller s conclusions led by mr nadler they have argued mr barr must provide the full report with the underlying evidence the judiciary committee last month authorized a subpoena for the version without any redactions that subpoena has not been issued but could be as early as thursday the subpoena represents democrats increasing frustration with mr barr s handling of the mueller probe they have blasted the attorney general for clearing mr trump of conspiring with russia after spending just two days reviewing the massive report democrats also have said that mr barr and mr rosenstein took it upon themselves to absolve mr trump of obstruction allegations when mr mueller himself said he could not draw a conclusion mr trump s attorney rudolph w giuliani is preparing a 50 page response to the mueller probe the president has repeatedly railed against mr mueller s investigation calling it a witch hunt and a hoax but that changed last month after mr barr wrote a four page letter to congress saying mr mueller found no evidence the president or members of his campaign conspired with russia mr trump told reporters the report was a complete and total exoneration even after mr barr wrote that the special counsel s report did not conclude the president committed a crime but it also did not exonerate him after the justice department said the report will be released thursday morning mr trump revived his complaints about the mueller probe including his frequent grievance that mr mueller s team is biased against him referring to them as trump haters the mueller report which was written by 18 angry democrats who also happen to be trump haters and clinton supporters should have focused on the people who spied on my 2016 campaign and others who fabricated the whole
