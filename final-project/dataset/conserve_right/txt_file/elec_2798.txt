huma and the g men no editor could refuse this story dems not gop hold key for trump in novemberon his way to a 4 point popular vote loss in 2012 mitt romney won 93 percent of republican voters about the same as president obama did among democrats romney won among independents too besting obama by 5 points romney s problem was simple too many democrats exit polling showed the blue team made up 38 percent of the electorate 6 points more than the red team and 9 points more than independents given the anguish within many precincts of the republican party today it is safe to say donald trump will not get 93 percent of the republican vote the most recent usa today suffolk university poll showed trump with 80 percent of the republican vote against hillary clinton compared to 90 percent of democrats who favor their party s presumptive nominee provided there is no conservative third party alternative on offer both clinton and trump s numbers will improve among members of their parties but the gap will certainly persist add in the fact that trump trails clinton among independents by 6 points and you have the makings for a bad beatdown house speaker paul ryan and other republican leaders have a solution in mind for trump change his substance and style in a bid to unite the gop what a predictably terrible idea there are more democrats in america than there are republicans and given the astonishing obama turnout machine and the historically high democratic intensity against trump there is no reason to believe this election will be different while there are some questions about the intensity and party loyalty of african american voters 13 percent of the electorate in 2012 one suspects that the jaw dropping anti trump intensity among hispanic voters would likely make up for any slack in the democratic coalition just as it was a cultural signifier for black americans to vote for barack obama it seems likely that hispanic americans will see a vote against donald trump in the same way taco bowl or no taco bowl we know that it s state results not national polling that matters but if trump trails clinton by anything like 10 points overall you can skip the state drilldown you re looking at a rout but the states can instruct us as to where trump should be looking for his voters one of the most discussed targets for a potential trump flip is pennsylvania pennsylvania is not very republican just 35 percent in 2012 and only 20 percent independent if trump really is going to be competitive in the keystone state it would mean cracking into the 45 percent of the electorate that identified as democrats last time around it is a good rule of thumb to say that the more unified party always wins but given trump s attitudes and views he will have to find another way let s say trump could push his share of the republican vote 10 points higher he would still lose to clinton and that s assuming that gop turnout stays relatively high no guarantee in an election year that s about as pleasant as amoebic dysentery on a mule train and so ryan s threat to trump to withhold resources and support rings a little hollow trump is right to say that he probably doesn t necessarily want their support he needs money but would do better hitting up his fellow billionaires and grass roots donors than flogging an unwilling gop donor base anyway what trump really needs is to give hillary clinton the same headache he s got trump s general election focus of bashing free trade calling for a foreign policy pullback and increased domestic spending are all sweet music to the bernie bros yes it is possible that trump could lose more ground among the republicans but he needs the electorate to look very different to have a chance anyway if trump keeps trying to break up the democratic coalition it might work or it might end up in a crash and burn season finale but ryan s call for a more conventional trump candidacy would produce a predictable loss though perhaps at a smaller margin that would do trump no better but it would help ryan and his party prevent down ballot disasters as the negotiation between trump and the gop leadership plays out trump derives considerable leverage from the fact that he can t win with them but just might be able to win without them power play what will trump pay for gop money donald trump s stances have made him popular with voters but many donors are hesitant to come to his side but he needs the cash to take on hillary clinton will that be enough incentive for big money republicans to open their wallets
