sunday expressed supreme confidence in mr barr i admire rep ratcliffe especially his tenacity michael caputo a trump campaign adviser told the washington times i m quite sure it s this very same quality that has the guilty swamp roiling about his appointment the dni is a vital position in the work of discovering the breadth and depth of the conspiracy to stop this presidency mr caputo said i like dan coats but i just don t think his heart was in this inquiry mr ratcliffe is a member of the republican coalition trying to unravel the fbi s decision making in 2016 he would be expected to expedite the document transfer to mr durham who has set up shop in washington hours before the announcement mr ratcliffe told fox news maria bartiromo it does appear that there were crimes committed during the obama administration here is what mr durham is examining during the election fbi agents placed spies on at least two trump associates the bureau embraced a dossier written by former british intelligence officer christopher steele who was paid with money from the hillary clinton campaign and the democratic party the steele dossier told of a vast trump russia conspiracy relying exclusively on shadowy kremlin sources special counsel robert mueller s investigation didn t find any conspiracy republicans say this was a clear case of russian interference in the election and the political process compliments of the democratic party it was rep devin nunes as chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence in 2017 2018 who went to court to force democrats to admit they financed the dossier the california republican also won the release of fbi wiretap applications that showed the dossier was the main piece of evidence presented to judges this year mr ratcliffe joined the committee and became a nunes ally republicans were looking for a federal prosecutor who could match wits with committee chairman adam b schiff california democrat mr schiff an enthusiastic supporter of the dossier hired a former federal prosecutor to head his investigation into mr trump s business affairs at the trump organization mr ratcliffe reached some level of fame during mr mueller s house testimony on july 24 as millions of people watched on tv he grilled the former special counsel for stating in his 448 page report that he could not exonerate mr trump of obstruction of justice mr ratcliffe a former u s prosecutor said that not exonerate isn t found in any federal law or justice department guideline the federal prosecutors either charge someone or they stay silent he said donald trump is not above the law the east texas republican said he s not but he damn sure or shouldn t be below the law mr mueller acknowledged that his use of the word exonerate was a special case for mr trump in his fox news interview on sunday mr ratcliffe made clear that he wants a robust durham investigation he said it is clear that people lied to congress on replacing coats glenn r simpson co founder of the opposition research firm fusion gps that orchestrated and distributed the steele dossier testified that he didn t meet with the justice department s bruce ohr until after the nov 8 2016 election but mr ohr then an associate deputy attorney general and dossier conduit testified that they had met before nov 8 one of them is not telling the truth mr ratcliffe said we need a process to identify that mr ratcliffe said former fbi director james b comey leaked confidential conversations with the president to a reporter did that include classified information he asked when mr ohr appeared before a joint house task force in august 2018 mr ratcliffe interrogated him on mr comey s knowledge of the dossier mr ohr was fusion gps s main messenger for carrying mr steele s allegations to the obama administration beginning in august he briefed deputy director andrew mccabe agent peter strzok who started the trump investigation fbi counsel lisa page and andrew weissmann mr weissmann a democratic party donor headed the justice department s fraud division and later joined mr mueller s staff the ohr contacts meant that the justice department s power centers were awash in anti trump conspiracy allegations that turned out to be untrue how exactly the dossier affected their decision making is a question mr durham may answer democrats don t like the idea of a partisan trump ally replacing mr coats a calm and analytical former senator from indiana dan coats served ably with deep integrity tweeted john o brennan president barack obama s white house aide and cia director ratcliffe showed abject subservience to trump in mueller hearings the women men in the intelligence community deserve a leader like coats who puts nation first not a servile trump loyalist like ratcliffe republicans say it is mr brennan who has proved to be a partisan intelligence director on msnbc he repeatedly accused mr trump of being in cahoots with the kremlin he also predicted multiple indictments of trump allies in a russian conspiracy the mueller report contains no information about mr trump being in a relationship with the kremlin no trump associate was charged in a conspiracy mr brennan later said he must have been misinformed senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat opposes mr ratcliffe for confirmation the director of national intelligence is supposed to be one of the least partisan members of the president s cabinet mr schumer said it would be a grave mistake for the senate to elevate this partisan warrior rep ratcliffe to that position after mr trump s may order mr coats felt compelled to issue an unenthusiastic response as part of that process i am confident that the attorney general will work with the ic in accordance with the long established standards to protect highly sensitive classified information that if publicly released would put our national security at risk he said of particular interest is whether transcripts exist of fbi informants speaking with trump aides in an attempt to determine if they would admit to working with russia the fbi s mr strzok began the investigation on july 31 2016 based on trump campaign volunteer george papadopoulos remark to the australian ambassador in london that he heard moscow might own mrs clinton s emails the fbi had assigned at least two informants to mr papadopoulos also of interest are any internal memos that led mr obama s intelligence chiefs to conclude in january 2017 that russia hacked computers and trolled social media to help candidate trump mr trump s former campaign advisers who believed they were sullied by democrats and mr mueller for innocent behavior say mr ratcliffe is someone who will help find the truth as the shady origins of trump russia are increasingly scrutinized it s important to have a director of national intelligence who is unafraid of exposing criminal behavior even if at the highest levels of government j d gordon a former
