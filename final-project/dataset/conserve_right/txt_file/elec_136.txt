 we ll circle back to the eye catching cnn pollkatie wrote about earlier but first here are the results of a shall we say questionable online survey of a slew of swing states and non swing states via the washington post and survey monkey some ofthese numbers would appear more credible if the absence of others it s not hard to spot some of the more glaring problems wapo surveymonkeytoss up stateswi c 2fl c 2co c 2mi c 2az c 2tx c 1 pic twitter com 57bn0onmau the same batch of data has trump up three in ohio tied in north carolina tied in georgia and clinging to a two point lead in mississippi feel free to read all about this massive poll of 75 000voters acrossall 50 stateshere but basiccommon sense dictates that if trump is really leading in ohio and has closed a wide gap in places like wisconsin and colorado he is not trailing by a point in texas that s not possible and it doesn t remotely align withother evidence conversely if he s genuinely battling hillary clinton to an approximate draw in mississippi and is in danger of dropping arizona and georgia he cannot be competitive in michigan and florida there are data points in this poll that point to a very competitive race in which donald trump may be able to pull out a win althoughits results out of nevada pennsylvania and virginia present significant hurdles there are also some data points that suggest hillary clinton is on the brink of a blowout victory because of these conflicting indicators and outliers i d take this set of numbers with a large block of salt here s jim geraghty s caveat emptor warning with an emphasis on methodology now about that cnn poll katieran through the basics this morning underscoring the astonishing reversal of fortunes for donald trump and hillary clinton havingtrailed badly in this series after the dnc trump has now jumped ahead by a single point among likely voters and two points in the four way polling democrats are crying foul that the poll has a partisan sample of r 4 which does seem unlikely but these same people have more than happily embraced and trumpeted other survey results rooted in very heavily democratic samples gotta roll with the punches one of the key findings of the poll is that although both trump and clinton are dominating among their own parties respective bases trump voters aremore enthusiastic to turn out than hers are story of cnn poll showing trump taking the lead his voters are more enthusiastic clinton scandals taking a toll pic twitter com fa3lry1uqt ben shapiro writes that unlike other good polls for trump in which his support remained static as hillary s dropped thenewcnn survey actually shows him gaining this marksa truly significant development if it s also measured in additional polling moving forward again let s wait for the outlier vs trend test results to come in but there are more than enough worrisomenuggets within the cnn poll to keep team clinton awake at night the overall movement of the race seems undeniable the rcp average has closed tojust over three points in a two way race and less thantwo and a half points in the four way the bottom line is thatdonald trump s on script teleprompter aided shift into relative normalcy has been successful themexico foray was smart and worked for him and therelentless drip drip drip ofhillary clinton s corrupt lying getting systematically exposedis really hurting her as i ve been saying for weeks trump s biggest problem is that a significant majority of voters continueview him as unqualified for the job both on knowledge and temperament his best opportunity to precipitatea paradigm shift on those fronts is at the opening debate at the end of this month if he s able to beat expectations and come across as fairlycredible and prepared the game really could change which is why those rooting for himought to be disquietedbythis trump tells pool aboard his plane he isn t doing any mock debates and has no one playing hillary in his prep is this a sly head fake or the squandering of a crucial chance clever psych ops or foolish hubris either way perhaps hillary s campaign might want to reconsider its recently leaked run out the clock strategy
