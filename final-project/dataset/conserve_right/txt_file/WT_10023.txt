tion of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion most major churches in my home state of ohio have decided that medicaid expansion is good public policy in recent weeks churches have come out in support of gov john kasich s plan to expand medicaid coverage to 275 000 low income uninsured ohioans pastors argue that taking care of our own people is appropriate for a christian nation apparently removing their own congregations from the equation currently ohio has approximately 11 5 million residents of which 2 million are on medicaid most churches have very tight budgets and barely have enough cash to help the tired the poor and the homeless why aren t churches volunteering tackling these issues themselves instead of asking for more government is it because the churches believe that government has the money and resources if government is the church s solution for helping the needy why do we need churches if government is the solution why should i take the time to go to church and donate money to the poor when all i have to do is have the government take money out of my paycheck and redistribute it to the poor top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens after all churches are telling us through their actions that we help the poor by having a large bureaucratic machine take care of the poor the tired and the homeless in fact by having government take care of the poor the rest of us don t have to worry about them or even think about them is that really what jesus would want the church and all of us to be doing in fact looking at it that way expanding medicaid has to be the right solution all we have to do is vote for expansion and bring in more federal dollars from china to cover the cost of those who don t have insurance because they are poor and single what is another 500 000 ohioans on medicaid after all the money is coming from the federal government not from us so why should we care never mind that we will eventually have to dramatically increase taxes to pay for this expansion in medicaid businesses will clearly pay more in taxes because they can afford it or they will pass the taxes on to their customers who will gladly pay them in increased consumer prices customers will not change their behavior because they will feel so good about helping the homeless that they will buy even more products and services from these businesses seeing this businesses will increase the pay of their employees knowing that the money will be used to buy more product and pay more in taxes to help the homeless this cyclical behavior always works well so let s just continue doing it heck we don t even need to raise taxes because federal reserve chairman ben s bernanke will just print more money and sell more dollars to the chinese because the chinese really want to help our poor china is very prosperous as we know and all of their 1 2 billion people live in luxurious high rise condos overlooking luscious green parks and oh their beautiful blue skies china is a perfect example of how the united states should be government takes care of everything and christian churches aren t around clearly they aren t needed in china why not just expand medicaid to cover all 11 5 million ohioans currently churches are advocating to add 275 000 more low income uninsured ohioans if the system works so well and those on medicaid enjoy the system why not put everyone on it if we want to bring in more federal tax dollars why don t we just put everyone in ohio on medicaid and bring in the accompanying revenues at 10 cents on the dollar we would be fools to turn down this free money our society has a major problem if you are a church leader you should ask the simple question what would jesus do would jesus say i should not personally take on poverty i should rely on others to fix poverty would jesus who worked as a carpenter in a family owned business say i should not try to work hard build up a business hire people and help them to help themselves but instead i think everyone should be given a free handout of course he wouldn t nothing is free and handouts always come out of someone s pocket god didn t give the hebrews the promised land he gave them the tools and skills they needed to get there god didn t give noah an ark he gave him the information he needed in order to build it to save himself and his family and the world s animals god didn t give us all salvation he gave us the free will to choose and choose we must jesus didn t just give everyone fish he taught his disciples how to fish ronald reagan and george w bush both believed that the churches should handle caring for our poor and needy not only does it provide an opportunity for evangelism but it offers a true chance for salvation for the people reached and for those who offer a helping hand both on this earth and in the life to follow god s love shared with people through the church not through government is how we should be helping those who need our assistance andrew o brenner is an ohio state repre
