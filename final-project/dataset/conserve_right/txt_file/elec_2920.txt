national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions stop me if you ve heard this one before an asian guy two black guys three white women one of whom spent much of her life claiming to be native american a pacific islander woman a gay guy a hispanic guy two elderly caucasian jews one a billionaire the other a socialist a self styled irishman and a few nondescript white guys walk into a bar and the bartender yells get the hell out we value diversity here i didn t say it was a good joke but it s kind of funny all the same because some folks in the press and the democratic party are freaking out over the shrinking diversity of the democratic field the diversity panic was set off by the withdrawal of california senator kamala harris on december 3 in the words of chicago tribune columnist clarence page the famously inclusive party wasn t looking very inclusive anymore the real issue is that not many people of color qualified for the december 19 debate in los angeles as new jersey senator cory booker an african american complained there are more billionaires than black people who ve made the december debate stage that s a problem it s debatable whether it s a problem for anyone other than booker himself which is why he s been raising this alarm vociferously so has former hud secretary julian castro who is of mexican descent what we re staring at is a dnc debate stage with no people of color on it castro complained that does not reflect the diversity of our party or our country we need to do better than that jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh

entrepreneur whose parents immigrated from taiwan has qualified for the debate perhaps a broader perspective would help all of the first 43 presidents were white men about half were episcopalian or presbyterian most of the rest belonged to other prominent denominations and three were christians of no formal affiliation then in 2008 barack obama of the united church of christ for what it s worth became the first african american president winning two terms in 2016 hillary clinton became the democrats first female nominee she won the popular vote but lost the election to donald trump given these facts it s hard for me to see a diversity crisis the top four candidates right now are joe biden bernie sanders pete buttigieg and elizabeth warren biden would be only the second catholic president sanders would be the first jewish president and the first socialist one buttigieg would be the first openly gay and youngest president warren would be the first female president and if her dna test had gone another way the first native american one what a devastating blow to diversity it got dumber partisan supporters of various candidates weaponized the whiteness of white candidates i think that s gross but there s at least an internal logic for say booker castro or yang supporters to play that game but supporters of white candidates attacked other white candidates for their whiteness the twitter hashtag primariessowhite started trending a warren supporter tweeted primariessowhite because joe biden kept a very strong plurality of black support that eliminated the paths for cory booker and kamala harris huh did biden force black voters to support him did he refuse to tell them to back a black candidate are those black people at fault for liking biden if those black voters swung their support to the equally white warren would she suddenly be at fault lots of democrats are talking about the structural racism of the primary system but none of the non white candidates complained about the rules at the beginning is it only structurally racist if democratic voters support white candidates are the black voters who prefer biden to harris or booker complicit in this racism if buttigieg bombed out would we hear about the structural homophobia of the democratic party no doubt many of these activists are sincere in their beliefs but some are just grabbing the most convenient weapon they can to tear down other candidates or get more oxygen for their candidates the bigger problem for these activists and for the journalists who hype them is that they don t speak for most democrats in april a monmouth poll found that 87 percent of likely democratic voters don t think the race of the nominee matters in the historical sweep of america s struggle with racism that should be cheered as unequivocally great news but these are strange times 2019 tribune content agency llc get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national
