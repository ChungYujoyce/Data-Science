ecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the mueller report revealed that the one true putin intimate testifying under oath before the fbi cast serious doubt on vladimir putin s preference for donald trump was this crucial fact ignored because it rejects the putin prefers trump narrative at the core of the anti trump movement this question has become even more relevant with department of justice inspector general michael horowitz s disclosure of fbi and doj serial misstatements omissions errors and manipulations can we rule out similar malfeasance by the intelligence community the putin prefers trump narrative is a key feature of the steele dossier but mr horowitz tells us that christopher steele characterizes his reports as unvetted raw intelligence the gullible steele claims he just repeated what his trusted sources told him if so mr steele should then explain why he peddled the dossier to the media state department and the fbi with such intensity top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender according to mr horowitz mr steele had only two sources offering second and third hand gossip mr steele and it was mr steele claimed they occupied senior positions in the kremlin and reported that mr putin himself ordered the intervention in the u s election preferred mr trump and had a damaging file on hillary clinton throughout most of the russia investigation anti trump forces cited the steele dossier as proof that putin prefers trump with even mainstream media placing the steele dossier in the ash heap of history trump critics still have the much cited 2017 intelligence community assessment ica finding that the 2016 russian election interference was indeed aimed against mrs clinton and in favor of mr trump i quote we assess russian president vladimir putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the u s presidential election russia s goals were to undermine public faith in the u s democratic process denigrate secretary clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency we further assess putin and the russian government developed a clear preference for president elect trump readers of the ica are referred to a technical report that discusses the myriad of intelligence tools available to the intelligence community but the intelligence community rarely can publicly reveal the full extent of its knowledge or the precise bases for its assessments as the release of such information would reveal sensitive sources or methods and imperil the ability to collect critical foreign intelligence in the future the protection of sensitive sources and methods brings us to a dead end for validating putin prefers trump the ica states that the cia and fbi have high confidence in this judgment nsa has moderate confidence given the fbi s most recent performance we might register low confidence in the fbi s assessment now for the big news the mueller report offers a third source that can shed light on the putin prefers trump hypothesis but few have paid attention we have the testimony of a key kremlin oligarch and uber insider pyotr aven before the mueller team it might be noted that mr aven is the co owner of russia s largest private bank alfa bank notoriously misspelled as alpha by mr steele mr aven was unfavorably mentioned in the steele dossier hence his testimony before the mueller team mr aven who values his business reputation described what went on in one on one and all hands 50 oligarchs meetings with mr putin mr aven s account portrays a somber pessimistic mood inside the kremlin in the immediate aftermath of trump s election the mueller report states that aven understood that any suggestions or critiques that putin made during these meetings were implicit directives and that there would be consequences for aven if he did not follow through in mr aven s one on one meeting with mr putin putin raised the prospect that the united states would impose additional sanctions on russian interests including sanctions against aven and or alfa bank putin suggested that aven needed to take steps to protect himself and alfa bank mr aven testified further that putin spoke of the difficulty faced by the russian government in getting in touch with the incoming trump administration putin indicated that he did not know with whom formally to speak and generally did not know the people around the president elect mr aven told mr putin he would try to reach out to the incoming administration to establish a line of communication mr aven described mr putin as responding with skepticism about the prospects for establishing such contacts what are the takeaways from mr aven s testimony first it lays to rest the collusion narrative colluder putin did not even know how to get in touch with colluder trump no conspiracy structure was in place mr putin had no idea how to create either a formal or a back channel to the trump team second mr putin clearly did not share the elation of his security officers and of the russian people with respect to mr trump s unexpected victory why they celebrated is clear mr putin s domestic propaganda had depicted mr trump and bernie sanders as underdogs fighting against a corrupt american establishment mr putin s intent was to depict american democracy in the worst possible light russia s managed democracy may not be perfect but it is better than the american mess third mr putin did not expect any special treatment from a trump presidency odd for a u s president purportedly in mr putin s back pocket in fact he was right under mr trump sanctions hardened and horror of horrors the united states has become energy independent the kremlin interferes in any and all elections that affect its interests it bankrolls parties that favor russia it targets media with disinformation it may even attempt assassination of foreign leaders it would have been a major surprise if russia did not attack the 2016 u s election i for one take it for granted that they did for mr putin both mrs clinton and mr trump offered pluses and minuses mr putin likely had preferences and they may have changed over time the aven testimony suggests that mr trump s election filled the kremlin with foreboding and uncertainty not a feeling of triumph as asserted by the anti trump forces
