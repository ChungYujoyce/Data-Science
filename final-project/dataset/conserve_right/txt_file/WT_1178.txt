 indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion did donald trump blow the coronavirus crisis my never trumper friends keep telling me that he was wrong from the git go that he called the disease a hoax that he refused to act quickly that he failed to follow the science etc ad nauseam but the president never called the coronavirus a hoax not even close it was the washington post s dana milbank who made this accusation tweeting on feb 28 remember this moment trump in south carolina just called the coronavirus a hoax but this scoop didn t contain as barack obama liked to say a smidgen of truth even fact checking organizations on the left viewed it as bogus but the milbank libel which still rides the internet is alas emblematic of why so much of the public is misinformed how about the obscene fable that he never follows the science the answer to that is to listen to dr anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and now a media star dr fauci heatedly insists that the president has never ever overridden the advice on the science offered by his advisers top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender that may change if the president modifies the lockdown in certain areas of the country but dr fauci while skeptical hasn t flatly rejected the idea either he s also sympathetic to the president s dilemma saving lives and saving the economy the president s foes are right to say he played down the virus contagious quality early on but that was based on what his highly qualified science advisers were telling him on jan 31 key members of the president s coronavirus task force briefed the press on the current situation dr robert redfield director of the centers for disease control and prevention noted the serious health situation in china but stressed the risk to the american public currently is low he said that in the united states we have confirmed six cases of the virus which had not yet produced a single death repeating that the current risk to the american public is low question for the never trumpers if the president reflected the cdc s and the task force s optimism how was he ignoring the science nevertheless the administration planned to quarantine and test people who had been to china the main source of the disease and temporarily suspend entry of foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmitting it but that was far too aggressive an approach for the president s current critics and even the world health organization who which had just declared the outbreak a global emergency the blogosphere exploded with harsh condemnations of the travel ban the website stat headlined its lead story health experts from who warn china travel ban will hinder coronavirus response not to be outdone the democratic party s likely nominee joe biden who never trumpers think should replace this president erupted this is no time for donald trump s record of hysteria and xenophobia to lead the way instead of science but what do we now know with the luxury of hindsight that president trump s health experts proved wiser than who s health experts and mr biden s at the moment mr trump announced his policy the sole known source of the coronavirus was china and the most effective way of limiting its damage according to the president s medical experts was to block potential carriers from entering our borders the entire world now seems to accept the policy with dr fauci arguing that thousands of lives have been saved as a result just for the record taiwan despite millions of chinese visitors yearly produced spectacular results a month before the trump policy kicked in by stopping flights from china quarantining suspicious cases and examining the symptoms of passengers of all direct flights from wuhan the epicenter of the disease as of mid march this island nation with its xenophobic policy as mr biden might put it had just 48 cases and one virus related death according to the journal of the american medical association despite the unceasing attacks the president s approval ratings have levitated nicely as a result of regular press briefings where he s surrounded by a vast army of health specialists who have persuaded the public that the administration is doing everything possible to end the virus and keep the economy afloat what the public sees on tv is the administration mobilizing federal state and local governments the entrepreneurial class and a brilliant selection of epidemiologists and virologists to find solutions to this dread disease those briefings have had momentarily anyway a calming effect on the nation with the abc ipsos march 20 poll reporting that 55 percent of respondents now approve of president trump s management of the health crisis even democratic governors are getting along with the president these days and nancy pelosi though sullen is embracing the president s policies there is also a slight thaw in a tiny portion of the media with dana bash the cnn anchor saying that the president because of his message and more sober tone is being the kind of leader that people need and want and yearn for in times of crisis and uncertainty maybe the never trumper crowd should sit down with ms bash and dr fauci at a social distance of course to get a better read on what the administration is accomplishing allan h ryskind a former editor and owner of human events is the author of hollywood traitors reg
