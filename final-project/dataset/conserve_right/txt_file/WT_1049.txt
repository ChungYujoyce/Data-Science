christian expositor of the 21st century house leaders said they would convene at 9 a m friday to consider the bill and hold a voice vote president trump said he will sign it immediately upon passage the growing size of the package reflected the rapidly increasing harm to the economy from a nearly nationwide lockdown just a few days ago officials had proposed a bill totaling 850 billion this is certainly in terms of dollars far and away the biggest ever done mr trump said a lot of this money goes to jobs jobs jobs and families families families economists and lawmakers alike said the massive plan is primarily a lifeline to help families and businesses get through the next few months at best it doesn t help the economy conservative economist stephen moore said of the biggest economic relief package in history it just provides people some relief to get through the next couple of months you re going to need a real stimulus bill after this one that has tax cuts and regulatory reforms and liability reforms steven hamilton an assistant professor of economics at george washington university said the pandemic has plunged the u s economy into uncharted territory i would expect the immediate economic impact to be at least three months and then best case scenario things are at least headed back in the right direction after six months he said but the effects will still be felt a year or more from now mr trump asked wednesday how long he expects the relief package to keep the economy going replied hopefully a long time if we have to go back to congress we have to go back the president said treasury secretary steven t mnuchin said the administration envisioned the aid lasting for about three months one of the first nationwide measures of the coronavirus impact on the economy will come on thursday morning when the labor department will report on the jobless claims for the past week some economists predict the u s could see around 3 million new unemployment claims which would be about 12 times as many as the previous week there is a very challenging economic story right in front of us which is beginning now white house economic adviser larry kudlow said on fox news channel we re doing the best we can to cushion the economic consequences of the virus after expectations that the senate would approve the bill easily wednesday several republicans raised objections to a democratic provision that could provide some people with more money in unemployment benefits than they earned while working senate minority leader charles e schumer has bragged that he negotiated unemployment on steroids we cannot encourage people to make more money in unemployment than they do with employment said sen tim scott south carolina republican but sen bernard sanders of vermont who is still campaigning for the democratic presidential nomination said he was prepared to block the overall relief package unless the gop senators drop their objections to the level of unemployment insurance mr mnuchin downplayed the last minute hurdle saying he and the president had spoken to the republican senators i don t think it will create incentives against working he told reporters most americans want to keep their jobs it was a sign of the pandemic s massive hit to the economy that almost nobody was expecting the 2 trillion infusion for businesses and workers to restore some economic growth that had been robust only a month ago this is not even a stimulus package said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell kentucky republican it is emergency relief the package includes about 367 billion in loans and other relief for small businesses alfredo ortiz president and ceo of the job creators network that represents small business held conversations with mr mnuchin in crafting the package and said he s hoping it will limit the economic harm to a period of about 60 days i think that s what we need to be looking at here maybe up to 90 days mr ortiz said once we get past this medical crisis i think there s going to be a tremendous amount of pent up demand people are going to want to go out they re going to want to have their lives back the blows to the economy have been mounting on wednesday the mortgage bankers association reported that mortgage applications plunged 29 4 last week as people trying to sell homes have cancelled showings during the outbreak because closings are done in person economists expect sales will decline sharply target said wednesday it was significantly rolling back its expansion plans deciding to remodel 130 stores

continued their rally on the developments with the senate relief package the dow jones industrial average rose 495 points or 2 3 although the index lost more than half of its gains in the final hour of trading as the snag over unemployment benefits emerged mr moore said the pervasive economic harm of closing down many regions of the country and major industrial sectors underscores the correctness of mr trump s desire to reopen large portions of the country within a few weeks trump is doing the right thing by talking about getting the economy up and running again that s really critical mr moore said the fact is the recession is going to last it depends on how long the economy is shut down if it s locked down for three months then you re talking about potentially a year long depression the economic damage compounds bankruptcies compound unemployment compounds the disruptions to the supply chains all of that gets ruined if this goes on for more than a month or two he said he has two friends suffering from covid 19 one of whom is on a respirator and he understands the potential consequences for people of reopening the economy too soon mr moore noted that mr trump has called himself a wartime president partly because of the difficult decisions he s facing you really have to start asking how many trillions of dollars of damage are we willing to do to keep the virus contained mr moore said and so it s a hard calculation but it s a calculation we have to make wartime presidents have to make very tough decisions the president defended his goal of reopening many parts of the country by easter and said he believes the economy will quickly shake off the effects of the virus i don t think it s going to end up being such a rough patch mr trump said i think it s going to open up like a rocketship our country wants to get back to work this article is based in
