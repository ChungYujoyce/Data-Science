ultimately follow the law which allows the chairmen of congress s tax writing committees to request individual taxpayer information for review top stories n y gov andrew cuomo s careless cruelty shows in coronavirus nursing home policy trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time i m not aware there s ever been a request for an elected official s tax return but we will follow the law and we will protect the president as we would protect any individual taxpayer under their rights mr mnuchin told the house ways and means committee the secretary said the president has not asked him to intervene in or ignore the anticipated request mr mnuchin also said he has not discussed the topic with mr trump s attorneys or anyone at the white house house democrats are in the midst of prepping a legal case to request mr trump s tax returns saying lawmakers should be privy to whether any of the president s vast investments open him up to conflicts of interest or whether he stands to benefit from laws he s championing mr trump claimed he would not personally benefit from the tax cuts in the tax bill of december of 2017 how can we know without seeing his tax returns said rep bill pascrell new jersey democrat mr pascrell and other democrats had been pushing for two years on the issue while they were in the minority but they were rebuffed by republicans who said they smelled a fishing expedition an obscure law says the treasury secretary shall furnish taxpayer information for review if either of the chairmen of congress s tax writing committees request it ways and means committee chairman richard neal massachusetts democrat has been trying to take a methodical approach amid pressure from liberal interest groups to move more quickly there is also an ongoing legal debate over the issue which could well end up in the courts depending on how mr mnuchin responds to the expected request mr trump citing an ongoing audit broke with decades of precedent and declined to release any tax returns during the 2016 campaign he later said the american people don t care about his tax returns noting that he won the election senate finance committee chairman charles e grassley has said he would like his panel to have the returns as well if mr neal requests them and that he doesn t want house democrats to use them for political purposes rep kevin brady on thursday pointed out that states and other federal agencies do frequently request tax information for compliance or research purposes zero of those requests are for purely partisan reasons that weaponize the tax code said mr brady texas republican mr mnuchin on thursday also defended the 1 5 trillion tax cut law congressional republicans passed in late 2017 he said economic growth and additional tax revenue from the economic growth that the law will generate will ultimately make up for the initial revenue hit the federal government took after congress slashed rates across the board this is simple math if we do get the growth we expect the cuts will pay for themselves he said mr trump s 2020 budget plan anticipates the economy will on average grow by about 3 percent per year for the next decade well above the projection of approximately 2 percent from many independent forecasters an extra one percent of gdp growth per year means trillions of dollars of additional economic activity and more revenue to the government mr mnuchin said democrats questioned the secretary s claims pointing to the administration s own projections in the 2020 budget plan officials rolled out this week the president s own budget projects that the debt will hit 22 8 trillion in six years that s more than 50 percent higher than when the president took office said rep brian higgins new york democrat so these tax cuts do not pay for themselves the tax policy center also released an analysis this week that found the government brought in 275 billion less in fiscal 2018 than the congressional budget office had been projecting before the law took effect mr mnuchin also said refunds are now flat compared to the same time last year but that he would consider providing additional relief to taxpayers who might have gotten unexpected bills during the current filing season under the new law he also urged congress to act swiftly to increase the u s debt ceiling and said lawmakers should simply raise the nation s borrowing limit whenev
