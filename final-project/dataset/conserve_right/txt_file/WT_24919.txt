tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion in the war of claims and counterclaims that besiege our political world a few simple questions cut through the fog if president trump obstructed justice by firing fbi director jim comey why did he not only allow the fbi investigation of him to continue but said in his interview with nbc s lester holt that he

counterintelligence investigation of mr trump did andrew mccabe conveniently omit in his book that part of the interview when mr trump said he was probably prolonging the investigation if the trump campaign colluded with russia why did campaign manager paul manafort reject a march 2016 proposal by campaign aide george papadopoulos that the campaign meet with russian leadership including president vladimir putin to discuss us russia ties under president trump according to emails turned over by the white house to congressional committees as reported in an aug 14 2017 washington post

a dozen actions against russia and mr putin including imposing sanctions on mr putin cronies sending missiles into syria demanding that nato countries increase defense spending criticizing germany s plans to build a pipeline to import natural gas from russia and increasing u s oil and gas production thereby cutting into russia s revenue from oil and gas exportation if mr trump is a racist why did
