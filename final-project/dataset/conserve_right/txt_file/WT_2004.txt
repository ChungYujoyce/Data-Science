stage and the campaign trail see also he cannot be bought bloomberg to refuse donations presidential salary mr bloomberg s late entry in the race as well as that of former massachusetts gov deval patrick underscores dissatisfaction in some quarters of the democratic party with the current crop of candidates mr bloomberg has flirted with a white house run for years he had been inching toward the announcement for weeks and telegraphed his plans for a campaign spending spree last week he spent at least 30 million for a one week tv ad blitz slated to start monday the new york times reported the 60 second biographical spot will introduce him to voters across the country jeanne zaino a political science professor at iona college in new york said mr bloomberg could create headaches for mr biden the one time front runner who has failed to impress on the stump and the other candidates in the field such as mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana and sen amy klobuchar of minnesota who are trying to seize the moderate mantle in the race i think people are crazy to make the mistake of underestimating this guy ms zaino said he has been successful in every race and everything he has done i think people have to take his candidacy seriously he is in it to win it and i do think he sees a path forward ms zaino credited mr bloomberg with sharing the perspective of former president barack obama who recently warned the party against moving too far to the left and against losing middle of the road voters who are not interested in a political revolution in announcing his run mr bloomberg touted his unique set of experiences that he said will give him an advantage against mr trump and for leading the country mr bloomberg s business empire started with wall street data terminals that grew into the bloomberg news organization he led new york for three terms as a mayor who not only tightened the nuts and bolts of municipal government but also championed social causes such as trying to crack down on large size soda cups to fight childhood obesity beyond elected office he has poured his fortune into various political causes especially gun control efforts such as his everytown for gun safety still he has been all over the map politically he was a democrat before switching to the republican party for his 2001 mayoral run he later became an independent before re registering as a democrat ahead of the 2018 midterm elections mr bloomberg s biggest challenge will be winning over the far left of the party including those who will be asking whether they are ready for another wealthy white businessman in the race moving to head off criticism of his policies in new york that today run afoul of the party s alignment with black lives matter mr bloomberg this month abrupt reversal on his support for a stop and frisk policing strategy he is somebody who has governed as a republican and as a well known moderate ms zaino said in the sort of environment they have created in the democratic party the fact that he is a white wealthy businessman is going to be something that is going to be brought up as well as his age the 77 year old has a net worth of 54 billion his largesse also works to his benefit given his track record of investing it in democratic candidates and liberal causes i think there is an argument to be made on that with democrats taking over the house and being in a position to impeach the president much of that comes back from mayor bloomberg she said they may not like the system they may not like the money in the system but the money in the system matters and he has put it on the side of democrats and liberal causes the former mayor follows another billionaire in the democratic race tom steyer who previously plowed his hedge fund fortune into liberal causes including climate change and a campaign to impeach mr trump mr bloomberg played an instrumental role in the 2018 federal election spending 95 million on contests more than anyone else with the sole exception of gop megadonor sheldon adelson according to federal campaign finance data compiled by the center for responsive politics tom steyer was third on the big spender list
