north korea asserting that the consequences would be catastrophic mr putin said he s been encouraged by mr tillerson s openness toward talks with pyongyang but added it seems weird that u s leaders

of mr trump defending him against allegations that have swirled in some american media of collusion between the trump campaign and the kremlin during the 2016 u s presidential election there was nothing untoward about meetings russians held with trump campaign officials and family members last year mr putin said while he did not address u s intelligence charges of kremlin meddling in the

the table the secretary of state said the administration is keeping channels of communication open with pyongyang but mr tillerson s walked back statements he d made earlier this week that had seemed to suggest the administration might be willing to engage pyongyang in serious negotiations without any preconditions no preconditions at the u n mr tillerson was firm on the preconditions issue aside
