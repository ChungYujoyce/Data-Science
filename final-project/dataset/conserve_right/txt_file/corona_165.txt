as president donald trump has persistently discussed the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine critics have wondered about his motivation given the drug s far from certain performance on the global stage as a treatment for coronavirus and the food and drug administration s refusal so far to approve it as a treatment for covid 19 the new york times says trump has a small personal stake in sanofi the french drug manufacturer that produces the drug the report doesn t say how small but it notes that his three family trusts have investments in a dodge cox mutual fund whose largest holding is sanofi a fund that matches this description is the dodge cox international stock fund us dodfx which at last check was 3 3 invested in sanofi trump s 2019 financial disclosure form lists stakes in family trusts 1 2 and 3 valued at between 1 001 and 15 000 so if trump has the maximum 15 000 in each of the trusts he holds a stake in sanofi that s worth 1 485 and at the minimum just 99 it turns out he does look to have more than that modest sum invested in sanofi because unmentioned in the times report his trusts also hold broader european stock market index funds the ishares core msci eafe etf us iefa has 0 67 of its holdings in sanofi and sanofi is a 0 78 holding for the ishares msci eafe etf us efa which is neither surprising nor notable in that the french drug maker is so large and trump has a small stake in basically every big company you can think of in each of the trusts the biggest fund holding is just the broader spdr s p 500 etf us spy in which trump holds between 200 000 and 450 000 according to his financial disclosure forms so one could say trump has 22 000 or so invested in microsoft us msft and nearly as much in apple us aapl another point worth making is how little the malaria drug means to sanofi s bottom line in 2019 what the company calls plaquenil wasn t even broken out by name in the company s financial accounts while 33 other medications were that is hardly surprising as the drug has been around since the 1950s and is available generically a host of other companies are making the medication including amneal pharmaceuticals us amrx mylan us myl and teva pharmaceutical us teva read on there s scant evidence so far for chloroquine as a covid 19 drug but there s already a shortage dominic cummings u k prime minister boris johnson s most senior adviser said he has not offered to resign as he explained his actions during lockdown copyright 2020 marketwatch inc all rights reserved by using this site you agree to the subscriber agreement terms of use updated 03 26 2020 privacy notice and cookie notice intraday data provided by factset and subject to terms of use historical and current end of day data provided by factset all quotes are in local exchange time real time last sale data for u s stock quotes reflect trades reported through nasdaq only intraday data delayed at least 15 minutes or per exchange requirements
