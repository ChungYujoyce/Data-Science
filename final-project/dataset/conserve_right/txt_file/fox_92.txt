with taliban and makes some move on trade with china after announcing national security hawk john bolton is out trump john wasn apost in line with what we were doing hemmer we aposll ask what the move means for u s foreign policy with a counselor to the president kellyanne conway only on fox news sunday then democrats in disarray over impeachment rep hakeem jeffries d n y i don apost wt to get caught in semantics rep jerry nadler d n y some call this process an impeachment inquiry some call it an impeachment investigation rep nancy pelosi d calif i aposm not answering any more questions on possible inquiry investigations hemmer we aposll discuss it all with david cicilline a top democrat on the house judiciary committee it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive and the 2020 candidates crashing over health care in houston we aposll ask our sunday panel about the fallout from the fiery debate julian castro d presidential candidate i aposm fulfilling the legacy of barack obama and you aposre not hemmer all right now on fox news sunday end videotape hemmer and hello again from fox news in washington we begin with the drone attacks on key saudi arabian oil facilities raising concerns about the global oil supply and world energy prices iranian backed rebels in yemen claiming responsibility but president trump aposs top diplomat secretary of state mike pompeo placing the blame squarely on iran in a moment we aposll speak exclusively with white house counselor kellyanne conway but first the latest from kevin corke who aposs live in the north lawn of the white house with us on this sunday kevin kevin corke correspondent bill the president said after those attacks he spoke with the crown prince of saudi arabia mohammed bin salma he offered u s support and vowed that america would keep oil markets stable and well supplied reassuring words from washington amid an unfolding drama half a world away begin videotape corke its aftermath could be seen for miles as yemeni houthi rebels took credit for knocking out more than half of saudi arabia aposs oil output over the weekend despite the group aposs claim secretary of state mike pompeo blamed iran writing on twitter that there was no evidence of the attacks came from yemen iran aposs foreign minister shot back javed zarif tweeting having failed at max pressure secretary pompeo is turning to max deceit and a revolutionary guard commander saying american bases and aircraft carriers in the region are within range of iranian missiles the attack stoking fears that tensions between washington and tehran have now reached their highest levels since the iranian hostage crisis of 1979 and comes just days ahead of a gathering of world leaders at the u n general assembly in new york and a possible meeting between president trump and iranian president hassan rouhani and a meeting that would have seemed far less likely before the sudden departure this week of former national security advisor john bolton whose hawkish tendencies were believed to be frequently at odds with president trump aposs own sensibilities among those said to be on the long list of possible replacement top hostage negotiator robert o aposbrien special envoy for iran ryan hook and german ambassador ric grenell who attended a white house dinner last night with the family of otto warmbier the american college student who died in 2017 after being held captive in north korea for more than a year end videotape corke bill the white house hasn apost set what prompted that dinner although publicly the warmbier family previously was critical at the president aposs suggestion that north korea aposs leader kim jong un was unaware of warmbier aposs deteriorating condition bill hemmer kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thank you joining us now counsel to the president kellyanne conway and welcome back to fox news sunday kellyanne conway counselor to the president good morning bill to you and your viewers thank you hemmer we have a lot to get through let aposs see how much we can cover the next 10 minutes first on iran that the administration believes iran is responsible what are you willing to do about it conway secretary pompeo aposs made clear that the iranian regime is responsible for this attack on civilian areas and infrastructure vital to our global energy supply and we aposre not going to stand for that in fact our department of energy stands ready to tap into the strategic reserve the petroleum reserve if we must to stabilize the global energy supply but more importantly secretary pompeo and secretary of treasury mnuchin just this last week stood in the white house press briefing room and announced additional sanctions and that is because we will continue to call out maligned behavior continue with the maximum pressure campaign in iran and this is a president who withdrew us from a very bad nuclear deal with a ne aposer do well regime so this president also through his energy policy bill has made us less dependent on these foreign dictators and bad regimes for energy supply we now in the u s are net exporters of natural gas and oil at the highest levels this country has ever seen and that will continue people always complained here ph nothing is made in the u s anymore of course that aposs changing under president trump but we have energy under our feet and off of our shores hemmer ok let me conway and this president is leading the way to responsibly develop it so that when iran attacks saudi arabia as it has over 100 times we are prepared to take action to crosstalk hemmer ok we have a few a few specific questions senator lindsey graham says you can should consider attacking iran aposs oil fields is that a consideration conway well you know this president and his national security team and secretary pompeo our nation aposs chief diplomat keep many options on the table particularly when it comes to retaliating against maligned behavior and protecting american interests and americans and our american economy so i won apost get ahead of secretary pompeo and the president in saying that but this is why it aposs so important to have a president who isn apost a typical politician because he and his team don apost sit around and say well let aposs study it let aposs have a competition about it secretary pompeo went right out there and pointed the finger at the aggressor here the iranian regime others are trying to deflect the responsibility but i think kevin corke aposs reports from the white house is important when he says it aposs probably the most aggressive action in the 40 year last 40 years between iran and the u s but that started because this president inherited a bad deal bad nuclear deal where we shoveled over cash for really nothing and he took us out of that deal and i think that shocked many people who just figure whoever the president is republican or democrat just goes along to get along doesn apost keep those campaign promises and that was a big one for this president so we would continue to crosstalk hemmer yes understood on that he also said conway talk to iran when we need to hemmer yes he also conway yes hemmer talk to iran is the next question on that because just this past week he suggested twice that he is willing to meet with the iranian leader in new york city two weeks from now does he still want that meeting conway he said he aposll consider it and he conditions also always must be right for this president to make a deal or take a meeting we see that we see that with the trade agenda i think an expedient president would have already had a so so half baked deal with china and to get him through the next election but that aposs not the way president trump thinks he aposs patient he waits for the deal that aposs a benefit of having a businessman in the white house he also knows that you don apost sit down and meet with people unless you have all of these other accoutrements around the new ph relationship like the maximum pressure campaign like pulling of the iranian nuclear deal like the secretary of treasury and secretary of state just days ago bill from the white house announcing new sanctions so all of that is still in play whether or not the president includes iran in one of his meetings i aposve seen a plenary agenda he aposs very busy obviously doing a lot of bilateral meetings making address to the united nations and indeed to the world so we aposll see what happens but this would not have crosstalk hemmer so just to cut through ph with that a meeting conway attacking saudi arabia hemmer a meeting is still on the table correct conway well the president can sit well the president will always consider his options and he aposs never we aposve never committed to that meeting at the united nations general assembly the president just said he aposs looking at it so i aposll i aposll allow the president to announce a meeting or a non meeting but when you attack saudi arabia and as the secretary of state has noted they aposve attacked them dozens and dozen times you attack civilian areas critical infrastructure to indeed the world ph the global economy global energy stability you aposre not helping your case much hemmer last point on this what would you expect from that meeting if it were to happen conway well i don apost engage in hypotheticals like that though but you aposve seen a president who is willing to take meetings with any number of world leaders because he believes as he has said many times if we can bring peace and prosperity protect the peace and prosperity of our nation but bring it to other hotspots around the world he aposs going to do that why bother being the president of the united state if you aposre donald trump why bother giving up the great life he had the very successful life he had outside of government for 70 years and if you aposre not going to engage if you aposre not going to do things differently if you aposre not going to try to denuclearize the korean peninsula if you aposre not going to try to meet with other folks to get better deals he aposs renegotiating these bad trade deals all across the world for similar reasons he thinks americans and american interests and american workers have been screwed for far too long by people on both sides of the aisle by typical politicians worried about the next election and not worried about your next paycheck hemmer ok john bolton this week is gone there aposs a job opening in the west wing here aposs how the president described his management style just three days ago begin video clip trump a lot of people want the job and we it aposs a great job it aposs great because it aposs a lot of fun to work with donald trump and it aposs very easy actually to work with me you know why it aposs easy because i make all the decisions they don apost have to work end video clip hemmer we know he is confident but with the level of turnover does he have enough of a team around him kellyanne conway he does indeed and i aposve heard these stories again and again from day one i aposve been there from day one and the fact is what the president just described is part of the transparency and accountability that he allows himself as president and commander in chief every single day we aposve never had a president so accessible to the press and indeed the public bill in an ongoing basis he engages in social media regularly he gives these press avails and what he said there is exactly right but this but let me walk back a couple before the president makes a decision i can tell you as someone who is in here daily in front of him he invites dissenting opinion he enjoys he not just accepts he expects disagreement and diversity of viewpoints i see any number of issues including national security and foreign policy and then he weighs consequences hears everybody out reads the paper reads the briefing papers thinks about it meets two different teams and then he makes the decision you know why because in the entire west wing actually in the entire trump pence administration only two people were elected to anything and their names are donald j trump and michael r pence so we are there to give our counsel and put out all the consequences and i think the president is also a great reader when people have personal agendas when they aposre not thinking about the american interest they aposre thinking of their own personal interest crosstalk hemmer did john bolton did john bolton have a conway i don apost think many of them had survived a lot of them can get through the door crosstalk hemmer was john bolton in that category conway no no that aposs not that aposs not a comment about him no that is not a comment about ambassador crosstalk hemmer when will we get an answer as to conway thanked for his service hemmer yes when do we get an answer on who replaces john bolton crosstalk conway john bolton and donald trump were aligned on many different issues maybe as soon as this week or the next week the president is engaging with interviewing indeed actually interviewing a number of highly qualified candidates for that position and it is the president aposs agenda his foreign policy national security beliefs which will go forward and i would point you to the president aposs speech about afghanistan in august of 2017 eight months into his presidency or so where he said this will not be the policies of the last couple of presidents we aposre going to look at conditions on the ground not have some false timetable that we publish for the world to see so this president has been out there he introduced his international security strategy a while ago and he thanked ambassador bolton for his service as i do people who want to serve at the levels on behalf of our country at that level and take an oath to the constitution should be applauded hemmer ok conway and not derided by large swaths of the american people hemmer on gun control now the president wrote this on twitter back in august he said serious discussions are taking place between house and senate leadership on meaningful background checks i aposm the biggest second amendment person there is common sense things can be done that are good for everyone then three days ago he was asked whether or not he would support expanded commercial background checks and this begin video clip trump if this is a movement by the democrats to take your guns away then it aposs never going to happen because we aposre never going to let that happen we will always be there for our second amendment end video clip hemmer so mitch mcconnell says he wants to know what the president will support has he made a decision on that conway the president has been actively engaged on the second amendment issue the entire time particularly after the mass shootings in el paso and dayton and then of course odessa after that and he has talked just this week i was there he talked to republican and democratic united states senators who also were actively engaged we want this to be bipartisan but we aposre not going to allow bad actors who should not have firearms in the first place who then a murder innocent americans to be the excuse that a bunch of liberals and socialists have to confiscate firearms from law abiding citizens who have legally procured them and i aposm not going to allow people who are constantly maligning and the deriding our law enforcement to be in charge of public safety public policy and so when leader mcconnell says he wants to put on the senate floor something the president will support that aposs advice ph so why are the democrats talking about things that president obama didn apost support cxrosstalk hemmer i just i don apost hear support for a specific piece of legislation does that mean the decision has not yet been made conway there is ph well there are pieces of legislation that already exists that we have looked at the president has been briefed on many of my colleagues in the west wing missed their summer vacation they have working on this every single day we met with the president several times just this past week he has been talking to members who will vote on this on both sides of the aisle and he wants to do something all at once the president has been listening to the best practices in the states that have risk protection orders he aposs been listening to strengthening mental health he aposs been listening he has done more on background checks than any other president in this way any other recent president in this way in march of 2018 bill president trump signed into law the fix nics that would have prevented a number of these murderers from having firearms in the first place senator coons a democrat of delaware senator pat toomey a republican of pennsylvania they aposve got fix nics plus we call it lie and try if you even try to get a firearm and you shouldn apost be you aposre already on a list that gets reported to the authorities crosstalk hemmer so what i aposm hearing is that conway bill i want to look america aposs i want to look america aposs other mothers in the face and tell them that we need to look at the fact patterns that happened in places like parkland florida and dayton ohio and together we aposre all scratching our heads and say how can this happen so we have to look at what has happened and fix that for the next time not just pass bills willy nilly because the government the democrats like beto o aposrourke admitted it the other night we aposre coming for your guns crosstalk hemmer we will get to that a bit later conway senate unsuccessful in texas hemmer yes i don apost mean to interject but conway but there are a number of pieces of legislation the president is considering hemmer i get it i aposve got two minutes left conway something else lie and try hemmer yes i get it quick lightning round a little bit delay on the set ph out here my apologies on china trade beijing gave a little this week we gave a little are we fighting to a stalemate on this issue yes or no conway no we aposre getting to a great trade agreement that stops screwing the american worker and american economy why do we have a 500 billion trade deficit with china the world aposs second largest economy why have we as america just sat idly by and look to the way where they aposve been forcing technology transfers and stealing our intellectual property so this president doesn apost make a quick half baked deal when he can get a better deal longer term hemmer ok i said lightning round conway and i think it aposs a positive progress that the chinese are coming to america the chinese are coming here now and the president wants a bilateral trade agreement that helps americans hemmer two more things one minute left here on impeachment what does he think about those in the house pursuing it conway complete nonsense even jerry nadler said oh impeachment is just a term this is a process they can apost even they need to get a messaging meeting and they need to read the constitution of the democratic party hemmer we saw conway americans the congress work for you they work for you and they aposre wasting your money and their time on trying to impeach a president where there are no high crimes and misdemeanors they thought the mueller report would be the end all they even had bob mueller come and talk about the mueller report and it was a disaster so they work for you tell them to vote on the usmca get that trade deal done tell them drug pricing infrastructure keep this great economy humming along and stop the nonsense of harassing and embarrassing this president and the people around him when you aposve had no constitutional or legal basis to do so hemmer last point he said it aposs biden warren or sanders does he still think that for the democratic nomination conway sure well anything can happen we saw that in 2016 although at this point in 2016 president trump was the front runner had center stage in the debates never lost that place and is now the president sure but i think it aposs the ironies should be lost on no one that the democratic party bill that has said we are for we need a new generation of leadership they have candidates of color they have female they have female candidates of color they have they aposve got so they have young candidates young up and coming candidates but is it lost on anyone that the three front runners are sort of older white candidates i think that aposs pretty ironic because that aposs the democratic primary electorate who is rejecting these younger candidates in this quote generational transformation donald trump can beat any of them you hear in debate after debate people creeping toward socialism folks wake up already people are fleeing ph socialist countries to come to our great democracy of capitalism and freedom our girls and women have rights in this country socialists has impoverished millions of people hemmer all right conway and taking even worse from them so this president is ready for any of them hemmer ok conway i think he aposs watching with more amusement and very little fear hemmer i aposll leave it there but thank you for your time we aposll work on the lightning aspect next time kellyanne conway i appreciate you being with us today thank conway bill thank you hemmer thank you in a moment democratic presidential candidates came to the debate stage spoiling for a fight and they got one we aposll ask our sunday group whether anyone move the needle next commercial break begin video clip pete buttigieg d presidential candidate this reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about washington scoring points against each other poking at each other and telling each other that my plan your plan look we all have different visions for what is better castro yes that aposs called the democratic primary election pete that aposs called an election applause that aposs an election you know this is what we aposre here for it aposs an election sen amy klobuchar d minn presidential candidate yes but a house a house divided cannot stand end video clip hemmer 2020 democrats there on stage in houston on thursday night laying out the risk of going after one another time now for our sunday group josh holmes former chief of staff to senator mitch mcconnell neera tanden president and ceo for the center of american progress catherine lucey who covers the white house for the wall street journal and townhall com editor katie pavlich welcome to all of you in this sunday and thank you for being here on thursday morning the a p summarized the debate from thursday the following way nine months into the nomination fight divided democrats have yet to answer fundamental questions about who or what the party stands for beyond simply opposing president donald trump neera i aposll start with you you aposve had three days to think about it what do you think about that laughter neera tanden center for american progress i actually think that was false i think that the debate on thursday really shows different visions obviously it is a robust primary debate but there are various visions about how to move the country forward on health care everyone of course opposes president trump aposs effort to eliminate health care for 20 million people but they have different visions about how to expand health care and get health care to the rest of americans so i actually thought and there are various views on climate but there are that aposs what a primary debate is for but every one i mean very single one of those candidates is offering ideas and agendas about how to move the country forward hemmer ok tanden past the trump election ph hemmer did thursday night katie move anything in terms of the race itself did it change anything katie pavlich townhall com editor i don apost think it changed much in terms of who is going to be the front runner i do think that joe biden is going to have to come up with more of a platform than just relying on his work with president obama and come up with some real policy points that he can articulate against someone like elizabeth warren who was gaining on him but we did learn i agree we did learn a lot about what democrats stand for in this debate and others they stand for eliminating health insurance for 140 million people by eliminating private service to bernie sander aposs legislation which was pointed out in the pages makes private health insurance illegal we know that democrats want to spend a lot more money when it comes to implementing socialist programs and the government takeover of a number of industries they want to eliminate fossil fuels in the next 20 years which will also cost the economy billions of dollars and one thing also that we learned that was to president trump aposs credit is that when it came to the economy no questions were directly asked about the economy but they did get that topic through the issue of trade not a single democrat on the stage advocated for the repeal of the tariffs that the president has put on china which means they don apost have a different approach and again it aposs going to be different for them to come crosstalk hemmer i know you aposre tanden i just have to respond very quickly to this on each of these charges every single person there on that stage is trying to get more people covered than like president trump who is trying to get less people covered even on pavlich by making private insurance illegal tanden that issue of private insurance is a robust debate in the democratic party crosstalk hemmer ok i wish tanden i just need to say many of those candidates didn apost support and many oppose him on trade hemmer i wish we have three hours like they did on thursday night i just one of the moments that aposs been talked about unidentified female asking for fairness that aposs all hemmer one of the moments that was talked about the most julian castro said this begin video clip castro are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago i can apost believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you aposre saying they don apost have to you aposre forgetting that end video clip hemmer is that fair game josh josh holmes former mcconnell chief of staff well look it ended up to be a little bit of a cheap shot but castro is obviously trying to capitalize on vice president biden aposs biggest liability which is most democratic voters at this point don apost know whether to cast the ballot for him or call in a silver alert because i more than not on stage he seems unsteady now i think he was better in this debate than he was in the first two but there is time and time again where the former vice president is a little unsteady and castro is clearly trying to make an issue of that hemmer toward the end of thursday night this happened in one of the closing statements begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate it aposs not they don apost want to help they don apost want they don apost know quite what to do play the radio make sure the television excuse me make sure you have the record player on at night the phone make sure that kids hear words end video clip hemmer hard to overlook that catherine catherline lucy the wall street journal yes i aposd note the record player comment is i think attracted a lot of attention i aposm not sure that my kids have ever seen a record player but i mean more broadly i think that answer has raised questions and conversations about the muddled answers that the vice president has given at times in these debates although in this debate at many moments he did turn in a stronger performance than other nights but i think also he pulled back more broadly one thing to think about with the vice president is that despite a lot of questions about debate performance some gaffes you know his age he has remained atop the polls and his lead has stayed pretty durable so it aposs not clear at this point sort of heading into the last stretch before we start seeing voting in iowa and new hampshire to what will change hemmer i want to bring you all in a moment here but at the risk of piling on there was this moment of what appeared to be a confusion also on thursday begin video clip biden it cannot be put together let me say it again it will not be put together the three different countries pakistan owns the three counties the three provinces in the east there are not any part of the inaudible run it i will go on and on end video clip hemmer so it aposs a confusing matter because he mixed up iraq and afghanistan he aposs been proponent of dividing iraq in three actually for a better part of 20 years neera tanden yes i have to say i think i think most democratic primary voters which is who aposs looking at right now don apost compare joe biden to other democrats on some of these issues they compare him to donald trump who to a lot of the country seems pretty gaffe prone a lot of the time so i think for democratic primary voters the idea that you aposre mixing up the words country and province or county and province versus the kinds of things that we see from donald trump on a regular basis where he mixes up words i laughed hemmer i asked katie do you think thursday changed anything yes or no tanden i think actually the middle tier candidates did very well for democratic primary voters cory kamala klobuchar beto and i think they may rise i aposm not sure it did anything to eliminate joe biden aposs support hemmer another debate in october katie go ahead pavlich correct but if you aposre going to compare joe biden to donald trump which is something obviously a few months of nomination we will be looking at joe biden aposs big selling point is that he knows what he aposs doing he aposs been in washington for over 30 years he has experience and yet he aposs not showing that when he confuses these answers on the campaign trail and i just want to get back to the record player comment on the surface level it aposs kind of funny to think that this is about age and he aposs just not with the hip new technology we have but really his answer was he was asked what you do about minority communities and school choice and his bigotry of low expectations answer on that was to have social workers from the government come into the homes of minority and poor families and tell them how to raise their children by playing the record player he aposs going to have a better answer than that for for parents who want to send their who want to send their kids to better schools neera tanden center for american progress i am so sorry i am so sorry i really have to get it on this i have to say this i have to say and i think i think a lot of people not just democrats look at these answers and say it aposs ridiculous you have a president who attacks people of color regularly he has been regularly via tweet he goes to rallies where people say send her back hemmer well i know sam the point pavlich inaudible hemmer neera hang on allow her to allow her to respond tanden i know but i just need to say on what standard are you judging vice president biden when you will not say one word against donald trump pavlich on the standard of of his on on the stand of his own words tanden one word pavlich and president trump actually believes in going into minority communities doing criminal justice reform allowing tanden come on pavlich parents of of of children to choose schools of their choice and inaudible tanden uh huh and he also believes in attacking members of the inaudible hemmer hang on neera as i said it i wish we had three hours we don apost panel i aposve got to take a break ok see you a bit later in the program here today in a moment democrats struggled to get on the same page on impeachment even as the judiciary committee takes a big step in its ongoing investigation a key member from that committee will join us live next commercial break hemmer house judiciary committee chair jerry nadler promising and aggressive series of hearings next week as democrats decide whether or not to recommend president trump aposs impeachment that aposs a move group that could put pressure on the house speaker nancy pelosi who has taken more of a wait and see approach with me now congressman david cicilline of rhode island a key member of the judiciary committee and house democratic leadership and congressman welcome back and fox news sunday rep david cicilline d r i thanks good to be with you hemmer first on impeachment there seemed to be a fair amount of confusion as to what the process was this week what is your committee trying to accomplish sir cicilline well i don apost i don apost think there should be any confusion the judiciary committee has been engaged in the world of our committee to determine whether or not to recommend articles of impeachment to the full house we are looking at obstruction of justice abuse of power corruption broadly we aposve engaged in hearings we aposre going to continue to bring witnesses before the committee compel the production of documents to make it clear that no one in this country is above the law including the president of the united states that he has to be held accountable we aposre going to follow the facts where they take us and at the conclusion of that investigation make a recommendation to the full house hemmer ok so then many of the democratic freshmen are holding back a lot of them in swing states too donna shalala out of florida said this it aposs sucking the air out of all the good stuff that we aposre doing if you aposre doing good stuff why go this direction cicilline well yes i mean donna aposs right in one point look we aposve passed over 250 pieces of the legislation legislation should drive down health care costs to protect coverage for pre existing conditions to help rebuild the infrastructure of our country to raise family incomes to reauthorize the violence against women act to provide equal pay for equal work universal background checks we aposve passed a lot of legislation eighty percent of those bills are sitting on mitch mcconnell aposs desk so we aposre getting the word done for the american people addressing the anxiety the economic concerns that folks have driving down the cost of prescription drugs and of health care broadly raising family incomes rebuilding the infrastructure of our country hemmer but she says cicilline we aposre getting that done and she aposs right there aposs not nearly enough coverage of that but the real story is we aposre doing both things we aposre delivering on the promises we made to the american people to make their lives better and at the same time we aposre holding the administration accountable we have to do both and we there aposs a lot more discussion about the second point by the media by hemmer but she said she had 11 town halls in florida back in august and she received a grand total of four questions on this issue and two of those questions came from the same person it would not appear that your voters care much about your pursuit cicilline well i think there aposs no question that voters care about the issues that we aposre focused on and you know we aposre trying to protect the affordable care act and protect coverage for pre existing conditions and drive down the cost of prescription drugs our republican colleagues are doing the opposite we aposre trying to raise family incomes by making sure that women have equal pay for equal work ph we aposre raising the minimum wage but hemmer but i was asking you about impeachment cicilline right hemmer and that word did not even come up during the three hour debate on thursday night cicilline no i i think that aposs right i think the reality is the american people expect that those of us who have the privilege in serving government from the president on down are acting in the public interest not in their own self interest they want to be sure that people are held accountable no one is above the law that if misconduct has happened that those individuals are held accountable so they may not talk about it they may not ask lots of questions about it but fundamentally people want to have confidence that those that are serving in government are acting in their best interest and not in their own financial interests to the benefit of their corporation or their family business and i think that aposs why the accountability is critical we have to do both things i think the american people elected us to do both things to deliver on the important priorities in their lives and to make sure government is working for them hemmer ok on gun control this happened in houston on thursday night begin video clip beto o aposrourke d presidential candidate hell yes we aposre going to take your ar 15 your ak 47 we aposre not going to allow it to be used against fellow americans any more end video clip hemmer as you know democrats are members of the nra too how does that message help the current issue cicilline well look i think that that message doesn apost help but the reality is we passed two important gun safety proposals back in february universal background checks and closing the charleston loophole universal background checks work three million gun sales have been prevented because people who are not eligible to buy a gun because of their criminal record their domestic abuse their mental health status went into a gun store and tried to buy a gun and they were denied so we know background checks work the problem is one in five gun sales happens in this country without a background check so we passed legislation to fix that to close that loophole it aposs been sitting on mitch mcconnell aposs desk since february and so first and foremost hemmer you just said that that that comments from beto o aposrourke does not help and many will say that democrats are coming for their guns cicilline yes that aposs just not true look where there aposs no proposal to do that in the congress we have legislation that is designed to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn apost have them to try to prevent people from possessing the most lethal and dangerous weapons of war that aposs been our focus there are dozens of proposals to reduce gun violence but we have to do something the american people are demanding that we do something it is no longer safe to be in synagogues and churches and shopping malls and schools you know i grew up and we did fire drills that was the most scary thing we did now young children are doing active shooter drills because they aposre trying to be taught to prepare for an active shooter in their school we can apost allow this to continue we have the ability to reduce gun violence to make certain that people don apost get guns who shouldn apost have them mitch mcconnell ought to bring those bills to the floor immediately hemmer ok cicilline and we aposre going to send him some more hemmer we we will see what realistically that can be signed into law perhaps this week on saudi arabia now you aposre calling for the u s to end its involvement in the conflict between saudi arabia and yemen do you stand by that given the events that the administration ties directly to iran over the past 24 hours cicilline look this is the war in yemen has created a humanitarian crisis of epic proportion there is no question that their recent action by iran if iran is responsible for this bombing has a is an escalation of iran aposs you know malevolent behavior in the region but this is made very complicated because the president doesn apost appear to have a strategy for dealing with iran he ripped up the iran deal which was a deal that prevented iran from becoming a nuclear power with nothing to replace it this is a sort of pattern of the president he rips up a deal doesn apost have anything strategy to replace it hasn apost worked with our allies and now we aposre left with an iran that is engaging in more dangerous behavior with not a lot of options left for the united states so i think the president needs to staff up his national security team he needs his director of national intelligence and a national security advisor in place he aposs operating with a very thin team right now he needs to develop a strategy to box iran in and work with our allies but this is a very alarming develop hemmer some would argue that iran aposs been at that for 40 years now quickly and cicilline no questions about it hemmer yes you aposre also involved this past week with big tech and it was announced that big tech is now in the crosshairs of government security in a significant way and that includes google and facebook amazon and apple sir what did they do wrong cicilline well look we aposre we have launched an investigation it aposs a bipartisan investigation of the judiciary committee being led by the anti trust subcommittee to look at the digital marketplace broadly we have very large technology platforms with enormous market power that are engaged in what appear to be pretty clearly anti competitive behavior where they aposre favoring their own products and services where they aposre excluding rivals we want the marketplace to work right so there aposs real competition so the next amazon or the next facebook can be born and be successful and so competition matters because it promotes innovation it protects consumers it protects workers and this concentration is hemmer ok and they would argue yes that they aposve led the way in giving consumers choice through their own capitalistic innovation i think the question is are you cicilline well i mean the problem is the problem hemmer are you the question is sir are you ready to end that cicilline no look we want to be sure the market is working so there aposs more competition there are more competitors there are more start ups more entrepreneurs consumers have control over their own data that their privacy is protected so this is a marketplace where you have basically people acting like monopolies and what we need to do is make sure that competition is working in that marketplace so that more competitors will enter the market so consumers and workers will be protected this is a bipartisan investigation we aposre studying why the competition doesn apost exist in that marketplace hemmer ok cicilline and what we can do to get it working properly inaudible hemmer david cicilline i really appreciate your time on this sunday morning thank you for being here cicilline my pleasure hemmer thank you sir cicilline in a moment our sunday panel comes back to talk about the politics of gun control and impeachment with a divided congress commercial break begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif don apost ask me what we haven apost done we have done it and if you are inaudible it aposs my impatience it aposs because people are dying and senator mcconnell hasn apost acted why don apost you go ask him why if he has any regrets for all the people who died because she hasn apost acted end video clip hemmer strong words the house speaker nancy pelosi this week blaming senate majority leader mitch mcconnell for stalling gun legislation back with the panel now josh i aposll begin with you he aposs your former boss josh holmes former mcconnell chief of staff yes i mean what you saw out of nancy pelosi is a fundamentally unserious approach to an extremely serious issue what she aposs talking about there is a bill that got a veto statement issued by this white house in february of last year she aposs had six months to think about how to get around that and how to work on it if she wants to do something with with the issue of guns she aposs chosen not to she aposs chosen to make it a political issue in contrast to that what we aposve seen out of the white house and i think kellyanne spoke about this on the program earlier is they aposve taken a three week period to talk to lawmakers like chris murphy one of the most notable liberal anti gun senators in the senate to talk about his ideas joe manchin the author of the manchin toomey background check bill they aposve they aposve brought people in to talk about where is a potential solution that could actually have the votes to pass the senate past the house and be signed into law that should be the exercise we aposre engaged here i think i don apost think there aposs a parent in america that doesn apost have a lot of anxiety over this issue they should at the very least hope that their lawmakers are using this as more than a political punching bag which is unfortunately where the speaker of the house has this hemmer you cover the white house is the president ready to announce what he is willing to support catherine lucey the wall street journal well here aposs what we know as josh said they have been going through this review process they have looked at a lot of different ideas they aposve gone back over previous proposals there have been a lot of talks with republican and democratic lawmakers and the president was briefed on some of the options that the white house has sort of put together on thursday we heard him speak a little bit about that meeting he hasn apost yet committed to what he aposs going to do there is a hope that he may sort of roll out some ideas this week but really it aposs not clear exactly what he aposs going to get behind and specifically what that will look like with background checks which is a big question for a lot of people hemmer yes i mentioned this beto o aposrourke thing a bit earlier in our show here ted cruz gave an interview this week christian science monitor he said the following he said if republicans abandon the second amendment and demoralize millions of americans that care deeply about second amendment rights that could go a long way to electing a president elizabeth warren he aposs making the point it aposs hurting republicans democrats and others are making the point that beto o aposrourke aposs comments hurt democrats what is it pavlich well beto o aposrourke aposs comments also hurt americans who you know he aposs he aposs lying when he says this is a buyback there aposs no such thing as a government buyback when it aposs confiscation and there are serious consequences for not obeying what the government has done americans don apost buy their guns from the government so therefore the government cannot buy them back but in terms of the news actually that got missed last week beto o aposrourke saying those things is one thing and he aposs just exposing what the left has been wanting to do for decades on gun control they say they want to do implementary ph policies but the truth is they really just want bans on a number of firearms that americans lawfully own and use in this country but joe biden on friday actually did an interview with a local station and said that if he was on the supreme court he would have voted against the heller decision which is a big deal considering heller reinforced the idea that the second amendment as an individual right now he aposs the frontrunner and so that is something that he aposs going to have to explain to voters that they are trying to get back in blue states like pennsylvania and michigan and wisconsin hemmer i want to i want to get to this issue of impeachment because i know you have some thoughts on this ok doug collins is the republican tanden i really i aposm so sorry i need to respond on guns hemmer one second i one second on that i really want to get you to react to this ok tanden ok i aposll i aposll respond inaudible hemmer doug collins on impeachment of the committee this week begin video clip rep doug collins r ga the judiciary committee has became a giant instagram filter to make you appear that something aposs happening that aposs not we aposre so in fantasy land here nobody knows what aposs going on i think this is the problem you just went back to what we said instagram snapchat twitter it doesn apost matter we aposre not in an impeachment inquiry end video clip hemmer we come back to this question whether anything come from this committee on impeachment does it tanden the the committee has an invest has an impeach inquiry into whether to impeach so as you saw from what david cicilline said they have a number of questions and they have a formal process for that and an important part of their process is insuring the president aposs council is part of the process so but i i really do just need to respond to a few things that were said here about the issue of guns because i think this is a central issue for the country i think it belies any credibility that the president doesn apost apos t isn apost it aposs not he aposs not capable of making a decision and he aposs not capable of bringing the senate with him the president all the the senate mitch mcconnell democrats they all know what the ideas are in front of them and they have those ideas and it aposs really incumbent on the president and mitch mcconnell to pass a background check bill which just for the record there are people getting through background checks now who are not having background checks who are murdering people so it aposs a simple bill to pass and you josh you and i both know that the president holmes inaudible you know you want to just take take a minute for yourself here tanden just to take no just there are tweets he does every day holmes the i think the biggest part that democrats just fundamentally don apost understand about this is that there are large swaths of this country that have a cultural identity with the second amendment tanden sure holmes just because that doesn apost anchor in new york city or san francisco doesn apost mean that we just have to willy nilly pass everything tanden ninety percent of people support background checks ninety percent holmes this takes a very thoughtful process with the end goal tanden ninety percent holmes the end goal should be for everyone tanden absolutely holmes to try to pass something that stops this violence tanden absolutely so holmes which is not where democrats are inaudible tanden ninety percent hemmer we will see what comes of this pane thanks to you on the issue of impeachment corey lewandowski is first up tuesday afternoon before that committee we aposll see what happens then thank you in a moment our power player of the week a conversation with robert kennedy aposs oldest child on how his words still resonate in today aposs political climate commercial break hemmer political speeches at one time inspiring soaring rhetoric and calls to meet great challenges in our country and if you think our national discourse has gotten uglier in the recent years on all sides well you aposre not alone here aposs chris wallace with the power player of the week begin videotape kathleen kennedy townsend robert f kennedy aposs daughter if you aposre an american you get involved you act you make a difference you don apost stand on the sidelines chris wallace anchor voice over kathleen kennedy townsend on her father aposs message in his final campaign 51 years ago robert f kennedy we are a great country an unselfish country and a compassionate country wallace there aposs no mistaking townsend all american shares a common future wallace she aposs robert kennedy aposs daughter wallace on camera do you realize as i listen you talk and look at your face that you aposre the living breathing embodiment of your dad townsend no well thank you very much that aposs sweet of you to say language can lift us up and i think right now is a time that we do need our language lifted up wallace voice over townsend was talking about her father this spring and the relevance of a collection of his most famous speeches called rfk his words for our times kennedy martin luther king was shot and was killed tonight in memphis tennessee wallace speeches like the one he made april 4 1968 in indianapolis despite warnings from local police kennedy and we dedicate ourselves to what the greeks wrote so many years ago to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world townsend here is a man who came from privilege who quotes the greeks in an inner city and calms the crowd and in the sense speaks to the better angels of people aposs nature and succeeds wallace or a speech he made at the university of mississippi in 1966 hostile territory for the former attorney general who led the fight for civil rights kennedy it is far easier to accept and to stand on the path than to fight for the answers of the future townsend he was the devil too many people of the university of mississippi and it just taught him that if you are honest if you go to where it aposs difficult you can win over hearts and minds being in washington is just so filled with memories wallace townsend was the oldest of robert kennedy aposs 11 children she remembers how he always pushed himself townsend my bedroom was next his bathroom and every morning i would hear him do his sit ups while he listened to shakespeare so that he could have the language to speak to the deepest issues in our in our american spirit wallace she was 16 when her father was assassinated wallace on camera do you feel at all cheated that you didn apost have all the years with him you should have had townsend we were always taught about martyrs we talked about sacrifice it aposs hard to grow up in our family without the idea that life is filled with sacrifice wallace voice over townsend hesitates to speculate what her dad would think of our current politics but she has no doubts on one subject wallace on camera what do you think your father would say made of donald trump townsend he would be hurt by the pain that donald trump has caused so many people and the glee it seems that he takes in causing other people such pain wallace voice over one more reason she says to keep her father aposs message alive townsend the idea that we aposre a generous people that we aposre a compassionate people that we have a goodness in us and that we need leaders that
