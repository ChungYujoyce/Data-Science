presidential primary tuesday night cementing the 78 year old democratic socialist s status as the de facto frontrunner for the party s nomination it s a big victory for sanders and a pivotal moment in the democratic party s hard left turn toward socialism with 86 percent of precincts reporting nbc news and decision desk hq both projected that sanders would win the state south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg was close on his heels and sen amy klobuchar d minn was expected to finish a respectable third meanwhile sen elizabeth warren d mass and former vice president joe biden suffered complete collapses though neither gave any indication that they would drop out indeed for the time being this is a relatively competitive five way race new hampshire uses proportional voting meaning that its 24 delegates would be split fairly evenly among the top three finishers 9 for sanders 9 for buttigieg and 6 for klobuchar still there s no denying that sanders is now the most likely eventual nominee he has a large and steady base of support and warren is not currently a significant threat for the arch progressive vote the moderate lane on the other hand is quite crowded biden is hoping to rebound in the upcoming south carolina primary where he polls well with the state s significant number of black voters but the former vice president will eventually have to contend with former new york city mayor mike bloomberg who has a nearly unlimited pile of money to spend on campaign advertising in his remarks buttigieg congratulated sanders on his strong showing i admired sen sanders when i was a student said buttigieg i respect him greatly to this day the sanders surge though is understandably concerning to the more moderate members of the democratic coalition the significance of sanders s standing in the race goes far beyond the next round of primaries wrotethe atlantic s russell berman in the modern history of american politics no candidate so firmly planted on the left has been so well positioned to capture the nomination of the democratic party new york magazine s jonathan chait lamented that biden s anemic performance had crippled the chances of any mainstream democrat and handed the nomination to a comparatively weak nominee if not for biden a mainstream liberal democrat might well have begun to consolidate support of a party establishment that is not looking for a candidate who willembrace wildly unpopular policies and a wildly unpopular socialist label while emphasizing transformative economic change in the midst of the best economy in a generation wrote chait incredibly the sheer disarray of sanders opposition has made him the favorite whether sanders support for fundamental changes to the economy and self avowed socialism will actually render him a weak general election candidate remains to be seen socialism is broadly popular with younger voters and in any case there s some evidence that sanders himself is popular with precisely the kind of independent working class swing state voters who handed the election to donald trump in 2016 this victory here is the beginning of the end for donald trump sanders said in his speech tonight it might also be the beginning of the end for moderate democrats 2020 aspirations at present the party belongs to the democratic socialist from vermont next trump administration files

each other apart for months to come let it be long let it be bloody and capped off with a vicious brutal and nasty team d brokered convention that costs a ton of money hillary wins if only you were being sarcastic the dems must be sure that all the candidates are never on the same plane it s funny because this comment and the one about trump is definitely going to win are exactly what i was thinking in 2016 about the republican primary and clinton s prospects you re always wrong jeff this is a learningesson for you except trump was not pushing socialism he was a moderate in policy if not in tone the near opposite of mcgovern i mean bernie you think bernie can win even massachusetts you mean corbyn then that s on you for blinding yourself to hillary s innate unelectability and how poisonous obama made the party to the wider public sanders is popular in the abstract he hasn t had to face real opposition to his policies the gop is already forming their strategy they will attack him on his promise to abolish border control his promise to raise everyone s taxes his anti gun policies his support for dictators such as the castro brothers his support of free college which is not fiscally feasible his lack of actual accomplishments etc people know his soundbites and that is about all oh and his support of the green new deal and his promise to ban all fracking in the us this would drastically increase gas prices and electrical prices and carbon emissions yep i m just shocked the media hasnt taken a hint from schweitzers book and started showing how bernie made himself a millionaire by campaigning basically campaigns can funnel 15 of ad buys without disclosing the recipients his wife just happened to be the person who was the middle man for ad buys bernie essentially enriched himself by skimming from his political campaign when does the desperate media start highlighting this when everybody they like isn t equally guilty that s never stopped them before they remain silent on their favorites hype those they hate it s a rubicon of sorts name one and someone else will name another then it s all over and too many in the journalism business have a vested interest in that same game banning fracking will make us more dependent on middle eastern oil because banning fossil fuels will not make economically viable alternate energy sources magically spring up overnight if alternate energy sources were economically viable they would have sprung up on their own and crowded fossil fuel out of the market already ban fracking now and force higher prices and energy starvation mostly affecting the poor and working class what kind of socialism is that joseph stalin ukrainian holodomor kind something something eggs and breaking and omelettes i mean venezuela is one of the most oil rich nations in the world yet socialism killed their wealth but hey let s try it again also having three houses and being a multi millionaire who wants wealth equality this guy is a political nightmare come to life he s the result of a lack of options watched fnc for the first time in 3 years laura ingraham actually made a good point that if the moderates want to stop sanders they need to coalasce around a single candidate biden s staying in only helps sanders by splitting the moderate i use that term lightly votes the same way the more moderate centrist infighting benefitted trump in 2016 if i were a republican the one that would scare me the most is klobuchar she seems halfway sane her platform is actually fairly centrist on a lot of issues don t agree with her on gun control she seems good on drug legalization and sentencing reform and bail reform she is for stopping new leases on federal land for oil and gas don t agree with that but she supports expanding nuclear power to combat climate change she supports charter schools she is bad on the minimum wage favors 15 hr and is middle of the road on immigration supports daca but is also in favor of increased border security including funding the wall opposes medicare for all well wanting to expand the aca skunk wants to end the electoral college never would get ratified but still a damn stupid idea she has a fairly balanced policy platform i think ingraham was right that any may be the moderate that could appeal to the broadest spectrum of voters hell she has enough positives i wouldn t even be really upset at this point with her as president with a gop congress to quell some of her dumber ideas raising corporate taxes but not to 2017 levels still not a good idea raising capital gains taxes raising taxes on the upper incomes which i am not even close to i also would like to hear more on her agricultural platform it is a lot of talk about subsidies to transition to sustainable practices that is a good buzz word but has little actual meaning first subsidies are not the answer second if it promotes unscientific practices such as organic which is not better by just about any measure including carbon sequestration then it is doubly bad however her being from a farm state maybe it may actually be science based rather then emotionally based all in all she is a mixed bag but far better then any of the alternatives however i see joe staying in and michael bloomberg splitting the more centrist wing buttigieg is a wild card he talks like a moderate but is full bore to the left on every issue and can he carry his success beyond this point i think there is little chance of sanders not getting the nomination albeit if buttigieg continues to perform well it could result in a brokered convention said the same thing in 2016 about cruz and rubio they could have beaten trump if they had teamed up instead they cancelled each other out rubio didn t cancel cruz out i don t think they were in the same lane rubio jeb and kasich were in the moderate lane and the most pro immigration trump cruz and carson were in the conservative lane and its pretty telling the 2 most conservative candidates and the least likely to compromise on immigration were the top 2 finishers i don t agree rubio has always been billed as a teapartier even though he s the new school of establishment republican they were both young sharply dressed hispanic smart guys with a reputation for conservative principles their perceptions may be different than reality but they definitely bumped each other out klobucharoses the minority vote with her record as a d a klobuchar would swing more votes to trump the issues with klobuchar are her personality the pizzazz of a cold wet fish and treatment of subordinates verbally abusive the only one that can really take her down a few pegs is fauxahontas looking forward to watching that catfight unfold i d prefer klobuchar over bernie a large chunk of the bernie bros won t turn out for anyone but sanders especially if they force her at a brokered convention i feel sanders has the possibility to become a monster of our own making although trump would probably beat him if he isn t tied up in more coup bullshit yeah he should be greedy af like the other rich assholes huh the other asshole who made his money while working in the private sector as opposed to bernie who somehow became a millionaire buy has never had a job outside elected office really you want to go with that bernie s the greediest piece of shit in the race you just refuse to see it because you re blinded by your own fucking greed by way of his promises to absolve your debt and mow your lawn using everyone else s money and he ll drag the rest of the party down with him the democrats are making a big push to try to beat mitch mcconnell in kentucky running a former marine pilot named amy mcgrath she s explicitly saying in her campaign ads that she opposes medicare for all and free college good luck getting moderate voters to buy that with bernie sanders at the top of the ticket sanders has problems from a border perspective until 2016 he was for closed borders open borders would seem like pandering he was also generally opposed to gun control until 2016 he had to flip on a few issues to please the democrat party masters just remember one thing the bern has a seriously committed base you know committed people like james hodgkinson he hasn t had to face real opposition to his policies but the election won t be about policies but a referendum on trump his lying cheating race baiting pussy grabbing and so on policies are for nerds and nerds have already made up their minds by now but the election won t be about policies but a referendum on trump his lying cheating race baiting pussy grabbing and so on i think we already had that referendum in november 2016 and since there has been a collective sigh of relief by many republican voters since the worst fever dream fears of a trump presidency have failed to materialize even slightly i m not sure what would lead you to believe things will be different this time i m not sure what would lead you to believe things will be different this time the election will have a different cast of characters for one i think sanders will be a stronger candidate and will be able to pick up votes from trump s base better than clinton did who ran on the issues rather than the dirtier more personal campaign that is called for you want him to get into a mud wrestling match with trump and you think he ll win it that is just downright funny you want him to get into a mud wrestling match with trump do you have another idea he doesn t really have to win anything just garner more electoral college votes it is always a referendum but the thing is is the opponent has to also be palatable enough for people to vote for him based upon the economy wage increases unemployment and stock market the historic trend states trump should have an easy victory the economy is always the strongest indicator of the incumbents chances at being re elected and with decades high consumer confidence it is going to be hard to beat trump especially by someone who is promising to raise everyone s taxes to pay for free goodies the economy is always the strongest indicator of the incumbents chances at being re elected this is precisely why i m saying the democrats will make this a referendum on trump avoid policy and play dirty you seem to disagree though why i don t know that almost never works the republicans tried it in 2012 and 1996 the democrats tried that in 2004 so far it seems to be a loser of a strategy that was dole romney and kerry wasn t it i don t think any of them really wanted to gain the presidency they were just play acting don t confuse a loser candidate with a loser strategy clinton played the issues and got beaten sanders will play the man and may win that was a pretty weak win last night considering he won nh in 2016 with 60 of the vote to barely squeeze out a win against buttigieg is less than impressive it could be down to 4 after sc and nevada if biden doesn t win in sc he is toast perhaps 5 i have no idea what s happening with steyer in sc he s in 2nd place in a couple of polls and he s not out of single digits anywhere else that won t matter trump promised tariffs and the economically illiterate voted for him anyway most amusing looking forward to the democratic party meltdown over the next few weeks this impeachment stuff really didn t work out for joe biden i mean if you re going to gaslight your family s obvious corruption a political witch hunt with no evidence and no charges is the best way to go about it i wonder if nancy got the go ahead from biden before she pulled the trigger on impeachment i m dead certain the whistleblower must have touched bases with biden before he went ahead with his complaint they must have thought they could neutralize hunter and joe s burisma problem by making the issue about trump then none of the other democrats could bring it up but really the thing speaks for itself there isn t any legitimate explanation for giving a crackhead with no experience a million dollar a year job and it s easy for the voters to see why trump wanted to find out more about it the biggest victim of this impeachment imbroglio is vp biden the people of ia and nh have spoken after hearing about biden s corruption they have rejected him i hope vp biden makes it through super tuesday and gets 20 of the delegates just enough to throw their convention into total fucking chaos a la 1968 it might have nothing to do with his corruption biden is creepy i think it an example of the dangers of having the media so far in your tank the media had previously avoided or downplayed it to such an extend that most democrat voters were ignorant of the apparent corruption so they all pelosi biden everyone mistook the ignorance for indifference and thought joe would get a pass oops i don t think it was intended to help him i think the party establishment must have decided that biden couldn t survive a general election campaign and set out to take him out early enough for somebody viable to replace him one more point sanders win was by far less then anyone expected bret bair probably stated it the best they expected to call it shortly after the polls closed but it was way to tight all night sanders and buttigieg are essentially tied but sanders has more campaigning experience and better organization the closeness of new hampshire is a sign that more rank and file democrats don t want sanders and are desperately seeking an alternative not only was the vote totals down for democrats they were explosive for trump trump got 112k votes incumbents going back to bush got between 40k and 70k enthusiasm seems to be on the gop side eh possible another possibility is that the dnc could be putting its fingers on the scales a little bit we saw them try to do it in places like broward county down in florida in 2018 and heaven knows they had no problem rigging their primary last time around maybe they figure that they only have to keep pete competitive until the convention where they ll have more power this is turning out to be a best case scenario for trump sanders buttigieg and bloomberg are all candidates that large numbers of the democratic base just won t vote for klobuchar is probably the least objectionable option left to the largest democratic cohorts but she has a black lives problem that s going to get more play with her higher profile it s pretty great the party has so many purity tests that no one can actually pass all of them every last candidate is un electable for some significant portion of the party i really think it s going to cause a split just like that swedish commie pointed out the other day the party is being taken over by woke sjws and it s causing problems for them implementing actual economic policy seems to be happening to leftists worldwide i m not sure i have enough popcorn available disappointed to find no actual tallies reported other than the 9 9 6 delegates so i looked it up bernie sanders 70 361 25 7 9 pete buttigieg 66 760 24 4 9 amy klobuchar 53 952 19 7 6 elizabeth warren 25 511 9 3 0 joe biden 22 952 8 4 0 tom steyer 9 871 3 6 0 tulsi gabbard 8 858 3 3 0 andrew yang 7 746 2 8 0 that is pretty bad for warren i d bet it s her angry shrill aunt karma warren s only hope is to pull 2nd place in california and then try to stay part of the conversation but i can t see anyplace where she has a chance to actually win one and biden is absolutely finished if he doesn t win south carolina i hope fauxahontas becomes more querulous and gets something along the lines of 10 to 15 of the sdelegates on super tuesday just enough to keep going raise and piss away money and throw the team d convention into complete and utter chaos someone needs to hire some women to metoo mayor pete don t you mean men our society doesn t much care what happens to men there goes the democrats party excuse of we re not socialists it seems the majority of the registered democrat party members in new hampshire disagree i wonder if they re still going to pretend that they aren t anti american while trying to and i quote fundamentally change america into a socialist country nominate the modern day hitler i e bernie the lead man pushing for nazism i e national socialism yes nazi is just an acronym for the bernie plan look it up it seems the majority of the registered democrat party members in new hampshire disagree where the fuck do you get that from bernie won on a very weak plurality in a wide field with just barely over 1 4th of the vote majority of registered democrat party members my ass still there s no denying that sanders is now the most likely eventual nominee he has a large and steady base of support and warren is not currently a significant threat for the arch progressive vote sanders isn t arch progressive he s a socialist he tries to paper it over by calling it democratic socialism but he is unable to define how his socialism differs from that of the soviet union or nazi germany both of which were nominally democratic and socialist as well at this point there are really only two possible outcomes either the democrats self destruct in the next election or the country self destructs in the unlikely event that sanders actually gets elected barring of course the possibility that sanders keels over from a heart attack before taking office of course reason treats this as if it was no big deal that a proponent of a totalitarian destructive murderous ideology looks like the likely nominee of the democrats tds in full swing it s no big deal in the sense that this is what the democratic party is and has been for a while the only difference between sanders and the other candidadis that he s honest about his goals same destination for all of them but some just want to try the longer road to avoid public backlash i also think that sanders is moderately better in how he advocates for state power but doesn t seem particularly interested in wielding tyrannical power the others plainly want the power to control the population but bernie seems to actually believe he will give the people power nah he s just a better con man communists have a long history of that sort of pretense doing it in ingrained in them believe me if you decide you don t want to comply with the 5 year plan he ll be down with shipping you off to the gulag for your own good of course he ll be down with shipping you off to the gulag problem is that most americans wouldn t know a gulag if they fell over one and they don t care america already has the world s highest incarceration rate and they don t care about that either complete falsehood points directly to denmark etc get out of here with your bs turning the us into denmark would mean massive tax increases on the middle class massive decreases in education welfare and healthcare spending massive decreases in middle class incomes and stagnant growth that is denmark spends far less per capita on education welfare healthcare housing etc than the us the danes simply live with it they don t have a choice are you saying that s what sanders is promising good luck running on that i certainly wouldn t want to live in such a shitty country and i think most americans wouldn t either and of course the danes consider themselves a capitalist country to begin with that is denmark spends far less per capita on education welfare healthcare housing etc than the us the danes simply live with it they don t have a choice truly pathetic if you aren t willing to run on trump and his record but against denmark for christ s sake a country our fellow americans can t even point to on a world map that s a sign of desperation oh for fuck sake even you are smart enough to realize he was responding to wearing it s uneducated comment about pointing directly to denmark your post is the height of intellectual dishonesty if you can t debate honestly go fuck yourself it was noyb2 that started railing against denmark i pointed out the fecklessness of such a campaign strategy to be fair a campaign praising denmark a foreign country nobody cares about would be almost as ill advised honest debate if democrats want to win this year they ll have to come up with something better than that no he pointed out several facts about denmark that fly against bernie s endlessly repeated misinformation and you started blathering about trump like the sorry fucking idiot you are just shut up the election will be about trump not denmark i understand you want the election to be about gulags venezuela and denmark but it s going to be about trump his railing against denmark was directly in response to wearing it s comment praising denmark his railing against denmark railing against denmark has to be the stupidest electoral strategy i ve heard today maybe you can top it since he was responding to another posters comment about denmark the fact that you continue with this just demonstrates that you a sophomoric i know i am evil i ve heard it all before denmark isn t a socialist country and the prime minister sent a letter to sanders to stop using denmark as an example of democratic socialism they are a capitalist society with a strong welfare state however the population is growing increasingly tired of the high income taxes and vat and the government is finding it can t support it s welfare programs so they are actually decreasing benefits they also tend to have less business regulations and low corporate taxes and low capital gains taxes pretty much the opposite of what sanders is proposing of course reason treats this as if it was no big deal that a proponent of a totalitarian destructive murderous ideology looks like the likely nominee of the democrats tds in full swing the election will likely be a referendum on trump it won t matter who the democrats run they will focus on trump yes that s what democrats are trying to do tell voters how does trump compare to the ideal president of your imagination not the disgusting senile communist we nominate we have to live with the person we elect for 4 8 years president sanders should scare the shit out of people we should make this a referendum on socialism do we want to turn this country into venezuela or cuba or the soviet union heck even if europe were socialist as bernie falsely claims we should make this a referendum on europe do we want to turn this country into denmark or italy or portugal we should make this a referendum on socialism do we want to turn this country into venezuela or cuba or the soviet union but it will be a referendum on trump the president americans know nothing about venezuela or the ussr and they don t care the fact that even trump supporters like yourself aren t keen on running on trump and his record speaks volumes we are discussing sanders most trump supporters are excited to run on his record god keep arguing fucking straw men this is about sanders and your retort is why don t you talk about trump are you scared what are you in 9th grade it is completely puerile most trump supporters are excited to run on his record not according to comments here trump supporters seem most content to blather on about gulags hitler venezuela sweden and anything but trump or his record this is about sanders the election will be a referendum on trump though i understand your reluctance to admit it because this is an article about sanders and i m saying sanders will campaign as a referendum on trump how many more times until it sinks in and people have already pointed out why that is a stupid strategy so why is it you keep on discussing it without anything interesting to say i might add i mean the lowest unemployment rate in decades the strongest economy in decades hispanic and african american unemployment at record lows incomes up across the boards especially in the lowest quarter of earners a trade deal with china mexico actually enforcing it s southern borders increasing buyer confidence 74 of americans agree they are better off then they were a year ago and 64 expect to be better off next year than this year highest job approval in 2 decades for the gop highest approval rating of his presidency impeachment was a dud the mueller investigation was a dud judges throwing out sentences and the doj prosecutors resigning because of questionable conduct during the mueller investigation the first meaningful justice reform in decades regulations cut conservative judges appointed to courts at all levels you are so right trump supporters should be afraid to run on that record a trade deal with china a boring untrumpian laundry list of things nobody cares about pussy grabbing lying cheating race baiting are what democrats will focus on they didn t care in 2016 and the economy is doing really well they didn t care in 2016 this is 2020 and the election will be a referendum on trump the liar cheat the race baiter pussy grabber and fucking moron little wonder you haven t the stomach to defend him pointing instead to the economy you re as feckless as the idiots who think repeating gulag will get trump elected when has that ever worked in the past when was the last time trump ran for re election the fact that even trump supporters like yourself aren t keen on running on trump and his record speaks volumes the fact that you have to endlessly retreat into delusion speaks more just keep saying gulag if you think that ll do the trick i am making a good salary from home 1200 2500 week which is amazing under a year back i was jobless in a horrible economy i thank god every day i was blessed with these instructions and now it s my duty to pay it forward and share it with everyone here is what i do follow details on this web page read more if you really care about the tax rates that billionaires pay or the potential increase in the levy charged on some rich douche s yacht you

software i see buttigieg as the likeliest nominee at this point the bottom line is that the progressive pair sanders warren has significantly less support than the moderate group buttigieg klobuchar biden as candidates drop out this should weigh strongly in favor of the last moderate standing while much is being made of buttigieg s alleged troubles with black voters i don t see why sanders would be all that attractive to black voters either perhaps i m missing something i m thinking it will be a sanders buttigieg ticket warren is collapsing almost as much as biden albeit not as abruptly she s been sliding in the polls for months sanders gets the nomination and then picks buttigieg as his vp to deal with the age issue and to balance the ticket to the extent you can call a communist paired with a socialist balanced there aren t any moderates left in the field at this point 538 currently gives him a 38 chance of going into the convention with an outright first ballot majority and a 52 chance of being the plurality candidate if he s anywhere near a majority of the delegates it would tear the party apart to deny him the nomination i think that or something like it is a possible scenario the democrats try gluing together a moderate and one of the socialists i agree i see buttigieg as the likeliest nominee at this point the uber liberals and progressives will see nominating him as totally avant garde they ll collectively pat themselves on the back for being so daring the dichotomy here is they have a platform of hate the wealthy while mayor butthead is plying the billionaire uber wealthy crowd for moolah and counting on mini mikey to dump in 2b of negative ads toward potus trump i see mayor butthead reaching out to a klobuchar as a second banana perhaps i m missing something i think people can see that sanders believes what he says that will help him connect to voters sanders also has the advantage of scaring the pants off hard core trump supporters i think people can see that sanders believes what he says so did hitler and stalin and their message was pretty much the same i guess they connected with people too hopefully americans are smarter than that and the winner take all american system will prevent extremists like sanders from coming to power sanders also has the advantage of scaring the pants off hard core trump supporters sanders should scare the pants off anybody who knows history or has actually seen socialism in the real world that doesn t include privileged ignorant american basement dwellers like you of course so did hitler and stalin hitler was an extremely popular politician whom many germans idolized until very close to his end he was also transparent and sincere when he wasn t lying his popularity stemmed from the fact that he was such a persuasive speaker comparing him to stalin is ridiculous stalin was never a public speaker and relied on bureaucratic maneuvering and terror to do his thing hopefully americans are smarter than that trust me they re not politicians know this even if you don t anybody who knows history or has actually seen socialism in the real world will probably vote democrat the higher the level of education especially in fields like political science history or sociology the higher the likelihood of voting donkey hitler won his first election with only about 30 of the vote i m not sure i d label that very popular hitler was the most popular politician in germany in his day did you have a more popular german politician in mind did you have a more popular german politician in mind obviously not so why waste my time with your idiotic quibbling i think people can see that sanders believes what he says yeah the pissant crowds of deluded college kids he convinces to max out loans and credit cards and convert into campaign donations anyway who would you have him delude nice us dollar rain earns upto 550 to 750 per day by google fantastic job oppertunity provide for our community pepoles who s already using facebook to earn money 85000 every month and more through facebook and google new project to create money at home withen few hours clickclick there s some evidence that sanders himself is popular with precisely the kind of independent working class swing state voters who handed the election to donald trump in 2016 lol yea nothing middle america wants more than a coastal socialist destroying their jobs sanders might get less than 40 of the popular vote no joke all literally all the democrats i know in pittsburgh will not vote for bernie they re at least smart enough to know there s a difference between socialism and a democrat in fact most are still praying the pa primary is relevant because they want to turn it against him coastal st lawrence seaway ahh yes just like how middle america didn t want some slick nyc conman huh fwiw trump has 1 5 million fewer jobs in his first 3 years than obama s last 3 years tell me again how good it is much easier to add jobs when unemployment is at 6 than when it s at 3 well don t worry about it if sanders were to win he ll lose jobs at an astounding rate as businesses and investors move abroad gains are easier when you start from such a deficit it gets much more difficult as you approach zero well western pennsylvania isn t going to be bernie territory from 2007 to 2019 the number of people directly employed in oil and gas in pennsylvania went from 5000 to 30000 with average annual salaries well over 100 000 a year with some estimates saying over 200 000 additional jobs created all that will be wiped away with the stroke of a pen if biden sanders warren or steyer get elected no democrat can defeat president trump in 2020 what a waste of time and effort by the communist party bernie sanders wins the new hampshire primary donald trump says good but it s not good because america is going to keep alternating between party control so we need both parties to be at least moderately sane as things stand now the democratic party is moving left so fast they re leaving a vapor trail even the moderates in this year s race would have been considered laughably left wing a few years ago this is where i have faith in democrats or at least the older ones most of the non hipster democrats i know are planning to vote against bernie in the primary because they want nothing to do with socialism and know it s a loser in november if bernie gets the nom as many or more democrats will stay home in november than did for hillary trump should start recruiting those disenfranchised dems especially the ones near his age asap if seeing their out of the closet socialist standard bearer crushed in the general wont cause them to rethink their choices then nothing will yeah but remember how labour spend years in the wilderness until tony blair brought them back to the center and it looks like the same thing is happening now with corbyn the tories are a left wing pro capitalist party labour is trotskyist carter did much the same with the democrats after mcgovern not all the way to the center but closer the moderate lane on the other hand is quite crowded there are no moderate democrats robby try looking at actual statements not just comparing the total communists to the regular communists who are lying about it buttigieg tied sanders in iowa and new hampshire so where do the pundits come off saying buttigieg doesn t have a similar base of support like maybe the youth vote these democrats don t seem to handle democracy very well maybe elizabeth warren big fan of stormborn daenerys targaryen dragon lady of game of thrones can hatch her own dragon egg and come back and command the others bend your knee to me or be holocaust by my dragon i thought it was hilarious when she said that did she not realize that daenerys is an insane and power hungry tyrant she makes terrible choices and acts out of emotion rather than reason she made a good case for how bad of a president she would be i admired sen sanders when i was a student said buttigieg i respect him greatly to this day jfc haha the shade being thrown instead of student he should have said in kindergarten it looks like about 30 of the democrats who were interested enough to actually vote prefer a socialist since registered democrats are around 35 of all voters more than registered republicans that means he has a lock on about 10 of the nation given the proportional distribution of democrat delegates it appears there will be no first round winner invest in plate glass replacement companies in the milwaukee area i m torn sanders being the nominee would probably guarantee the dnc would lose to trump but really feel like vomiting at the thought of sanders winning anything i find the pure hatred and vehemence that sanders supporters have of buttigieg to be the most curious thing this election cycle though start getting paid every month online from home more

you guys also and start earning money online right now by follow details online work i m surprised no one has pointed out that bernie is simply following the same path as he did in 2016 a close second finish in iowa followed by a win in new hampshire in fact due to a less crowded field he had more delegates at this point 2016 but it ultimately didn t get him the nomination i think we will see a few more dems drop out over the next few weeks and coalesce behind a single contender who will pull ahead of bernie on super tuesday if biden does well in nevada and south carolina it will be him otherwise it will be mayor pete i get paid over 90 every hour telecommuting with 2 children at home i never thought i d have the option to do it however my closest companion gains over 10k a month
