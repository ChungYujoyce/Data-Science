apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion taipei and shanghai taiwan s political class is nervous yet again i am in taipei to speak on whether u s china strains endanger taiwan i think not certainly president donald trump shinzo abe in japan and scott morrison in australia three key countries for taiwan show no sign of reduced support a slew of lesser asian countries may hesitate to help taiwan in a crisis but all prefer a separate taiwan to the island being swallowed into the people s republic such a disaster would bring the greatest change in east asia s balance of power since the second world war consider that during seven decades of washington beijing ups and downs taiwan was unscathed today the island is more prosperous and confident of its identity than ever its existence is a textbook case of deterrence working thanks uncle sam and japan economic stagnation on the mainland which is quite possible would not destabilize taiwan political crisis in the mainland much less likely would harm taiwan because of the flight of urban chinese from shanghai and other cities yet leaving aside gyrations in u s china relations and non stop military calculations of both the pla and pentagon demographic trends and tricks and the stealth and reach of social media could together destroy taiwan as a democracy without a shot being fired top stories

fbi director of having role in deep state population totals favor china russian people are a drop in the bucket alongside chinese siberia faces a chinese population surge as russia s birth rate and economy lag china s russia s economy is one eighth the size of china s australia with only 23 million people may become a chinese flavored nation as it once was british flavored taiwan is more vulnerable than russia australia or many others to demographic games sichuan province 90 million has four times the people in taiwan 23 million it would take only a tiny slice of the young males there or equivalent numbers from taiwan s close neighbor fujian province 40 million if encouraged by beijing to go to taiwan as tourists then marry taiwan girls to produce a demographic reset of taiwan s democracy no submarines or soldiers required subjectively one feels taiwan s vulnerability when flying from shanghai to taipei from communism to capitalism yet fewer minutes than a hop from chicago to boston china cleverly uses the web to further a world future for socialist authoritarianism professor hsu chien jung of national dong hwa university in taipei began his research on beijing s electronic assault by asking a question why do huge numbers of chinese individuals subscribe to facebook when beijing blocks facebook for prc chinese how many americans know that millions of chinese adherents to facebook are physically in taiwan these selected taiwan folk are a fifth column devised by beijing they spout beijing s policies to facebook friends political influence is the tip of a seismic social iceberg culture and technology give youth new enjoyments as they offer china new weapons reality looks different to teen agers than to their parents youth make their own reality and others will try to make it for them you may think you re talking to a pretty lady or a handsome man says mr hsu but it s a robot somewhere spitting out opinions with a new chinese app called zao a kid may fix her head on the body of a sports hero or pop star and say whatever she likes a jimmy lai face can opine day and night that taiwan belongs to china not the hong kong media magnate s real view

invisible deniable anonymous electronic tricks reading a book or newspaper is an act initiated by an individual from below the internet from above from somewhere makes the individual a target taiwanese president tsai ing wen who hankers for taiwan independence fears a huge if under the table effort to vote her out of power in january true the ccp has overreached before in its 70 years in power regretting it later and to be fair fake voices are less horrible than real bombs beijing has shown with its confucius institutes that chinese soft power can backfire it may overreach on taiwan as it already did in hong kong however it is a fact that tidy millions of pro ccp chinese youth are in the world vanguard of it if this spooky stuff ultimately becomes a free speech issue the west will prevail if it is won on high tech skill not so clear internet attacks peacefully entering taiwan living rooms 24 hours a day may consign submarines and soldiers to the museum if this becomes the
