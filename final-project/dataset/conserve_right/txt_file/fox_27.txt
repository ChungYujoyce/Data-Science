his defense strategy with jay secular a member of his legal team plus president trump announces a rollback of the obama administration aposs opening to cuba trump effective immediately i am canceling the last administration s completely one sided deal with cuba wallace we ll ask our sunday panel if the new policy goes too far or not far enough and our power player of the week one man aposs journey bringing comfort to foster children unidentified male a child deserves to own something that aposs brand new that belongs to them wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace hello again and happy father aposs day from fox news in washington the nation aposs capital is still shaking from this week aposs attack where a gunman opened fire on republican members of congress during a baseball practice house whip steve scalise has been upgraded to critical condition to serious after several operations and on both sides of the aisle officials are asking how they contributed to the toxic political climate and what they can do to change it democratic senator amy klobuchar joins us in a few minutes but first from springfield illinois congressman rodney davis who was on that field during wednesday s shooting congressman first of all and most important how are you four days after the attack how are you doing davis you know chris it aposs still pretty surreal i can tell you that this is the best father aposs day i ve ever had to be able to come back home and see the outpouring of care and support from the people that know me best including my family it aposs just been a really humbling event and very memorable for me and my family wallace have you gotten over it in an emotional sense or are you still in shock davis you know people tell you how you are supposed to feel but it never seems that you do i mean i still sense normalcy there are times when i m probably a little more agitated there are things that i m going to do differently in my life and in my workplace to ensure that we probably put security more as a priority than we had in the past and it aposs a sad state to be in when you just woke up a few days ago got in the car went to a baseball field to practice for a charity game and the next thing you know bullets are flying wallace i want to take you back to just after the shooting here you are sir begin video clip davis this political rhetoric and political discourse that has led to hate has led to gunfire i called my wife and my children immediately when i got a hold of a phone i told them i love you and dad s ok end video clip wallace congressman you said that you were at your breaking point and to call this an act of political rhetorical terrorism now that you aposve had a few days to think about it what do all of us politicians and media what can we do to change it and frankly how long do you think that new leaf ph will last davis well i may have made it too complicated chris i want to change that to just political terrorism because obviously the evidence from the shooter this maniac who began firing at all of us shows that he turned his religion into politics and when somebody turns their religion into politics they are no better than anyone else who hijacks a religion and tries to indiscriminately kill innocent people that aposs what we experienced that day and i thank god every day those two capitol policemen agent bailey and agent griner were there to save us all i hope and prayed that we can take this day this day this tragedy that could have been much much worse and turn it into an opportunity to come together as americans because no one i don apost care what side you are on no one deserves to have the violence that we all experienced just four short days ago wallace in 2011 after congresswoman gabby giffords was shot in a shopping center outside tucson president obama made a similar appeal take a look sir begin video clip barack obama former u s president it aposs important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that appeals not in the way that wounds end video clip wallace but congressman as you know all too well since then the political discourse in this country has only gotten worse davis you know it has chris and the polarization has seemingly continued to rise on both sides and creating the fringes on the right and the left and that aposs why since i ve been elected to congress i ve tried to be somebody who talks about bipartisanship who actually has a record of bipartisanship and now i want to stand up and ask the american people those of us who are the majority in this country who want republicans and democrats to work together let aposs stand up to the hate on both sides let s stand up to the rhetoric that we see that lead to this polarization that led to bullets being fired at a baseball field just a few days ago wallace final question there aposs been a lot of talk about beefing up security for members of congress even talk about members like yourself being able to carry your own guns for self protection how do you think we can balance on the one hand the fact that you want voters to have access to you but on the other hand you need to be protected davis well that aposs a debate that we are going to continue to have but i think it aposs an important debate to have and chris i want to tell you and all of your viewers that i was cleaning out my baseball bag a couple the day after the shooting after we played our congressional baseball game for charity and as i pulled something out from the area where you store your bats i saw something drop on the ground and here it is today chris this is a piece of shrapnel from a madman who came to politically kill innocent people this is the reminder that all of us have that we have to take a step back in this country we have to tone down this rhetoric and we ve got to come together as a nation as americans and say enough is enough i thank you for having me on too chris wallace well i thank you for that message sir thank you thanks for your time i know this will be a special father aposs day for you and your family sir davis yes it will wallace and joining us now for minneapolis democratic senator amy klobuchar senator i want to start with the town hall last month in north dakota where one voter confronted congressman kevin cramer about the effort to repeal and replace obamacare here it is begin videoc clip unidentified male a question answer yes or no will the rich shut your mouth will the rich benefit from if the health care is destroyed do the rich get a tax cut yes or no rep kevin cramer r north dakota of course not end video clip wallace it was the same back in 2010 when republicans members of the tea party were going after democrats for trying to pass obamacare in the first place has our politics gotten out of control senator sen amy klobuchar d minnesota thank you for that question chris and i first of all want to say i m so pleased by the words from congressman davis i m glad he s safe i m so glad representative scalise that his condition is improving and i do think that the language the rhetoric on both sides has gotten out of control and as you know it is on both sides i m someone that believes you have to treat people civilly but you can disagree and that courage is truly not whether you are going to yell at someone in the middle of an empty chamber but whether you are willing to stand next to someone you don apost always agree with for the betterment of this country and that means finding common ground and higher ground i think senator enzi of wyoming a republican who has said you know we disagree on a lot of things but we can agree on about 80 percent of the things 80 percent of the time and so trying to find those areas whether it d be funding for roads and bridges whether we need to upgrade that whether we d be looking for ways that we can all say you know not everyone needs a four year degree let aposs get more kids into jobs where we have openings and give them those skills i think there are areas where we can find common ground and that aposs what i ve tried to do in my work wallace but part of the problem senator is we seem to be in a vicious cycle back in 2010 democrats passed obamacare without a single republican vote this year republicans seem to be trying to pass and replace without a single democratic vote how do you stop the vicious cycle klobuchar well you can start right now as you know the american people would really like to see us work together on health care and there were plenty of changes that we need to make to the affordable care act like bringing the prices of prescription drugs down bills that i have with senator mccain and senator grassley two republicans as well as work we should be doing to make sure the exchanges are strong but doing this behind closed doors is actually not what we did with the affordable care act so i m hopeful this would be an opportunity given what we are seeing across the country with the prices of prescription drugs where we could work on that together wallace but look let klobuchar and i found common ground go ahead wallace let me just ask you a question about that and you know part of this is both sides got to admit they re doing some things wrong having democrats held up an awful of trump nominations i know some of them are conservatives but some of them are well within mainstream i saw an item today that the average wait between nomination and confirmation for george w bush and obama was a couple of days for donald trump it has been 25 days the average wait the delay hasn t would you agree that your party is guilty of some obstruction here klobuchar i m not saying we are perfect throughout time but i do know that all of his cabinet nominees are now in place that they have been voted on some with significant democratic support and that also now we are working down to the next level and they ve actually been well reported haven apost put people up for a lot of those positions when they come up especially in the military area the security area we try to move quickly on those so we need to do what we can to fill those positions but again the president has to govern and not just squander those moments away when he sends out tweets at 7 00 in the morning because i do think there are many of us that want to govern that believe we re out of a crisis in the economy we are at a time of opportunity so let aposs use that opportunity wallace i m going to get to those tweets in a moment but generally after an attack like this democrats are quick and you in some cases have been quick to talk about gun control this time almost all democrats including you have been silent about tougher gun controls how come klobuchar well i think first of all this was a man with severe mental illnesses we don apost know all the facts here yes we came together with republicans like pat toomey of pennsylvania and said we should have better background checks we did that the last time after sandy hook we were unsuccessful but i think what we need to look at of course i m ranking on the rules committee we should be looking at security how we can beef up security at events like this and in the capital but the bigger lesson from this comment to me is that i hope people just like they did on that baseball field i was there with a 25 000 people that joined in all four letters were out on the field actually looking like they liked each other at the end when the democrats won the game they gave the trophy to the republicans and ask them to put it in representative steve scalise aposs office we need to take that spirit and go from two teams to one team for america wallace i want to ask you as a member of the senate judiciary committee you mentioned tweets and i want to ask about president trump aposs tweet on friday let aposs put it up on the screen i am being investigated for flying the fbi director by the man who told me to fire the fbi director witch hunt question do you believe the president is trying to get rid of deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and perhaps also the special counsel robert mueller klobuchar well i hope not speaker ryan speaker ryan has given him the advice to let the special counsel do his job and as a factual matter rod rosenstein has told the senate in a briefing and he said we could say it publicly that the president had made up his mind already to fire jim comey before he even wrote that memo and then finally these tweets chris these tweets really every time one goes out it does squander this moment of governorship i think that there are areas we can come together with the administration with republicans including things like infrastructure things like doing something on workforce training doing something on tax reform but it aposs going to be really hard to do that when those tweets come out at 7 00 in the morning and then the whole focus of washington and the country is on what the president said last time so let aposs use this moment to govern wallace final question if the president does go ahead and there are some talk about firing rod rosenstein or firing robert mueller what would the reaction be in congress klobuchar i think that would be to use lindsey graham s words a disaster because mueller is just starting to do his work the chips will fall where they may this is about a foreign government the country of russia trying to influence an american election as marco rubio himself has said this time it was one party one candidate next time it will be another so we need to figure out what happened and then move forward together as a country and the president should not be firing the man rod rosenstein who was in fact the person that was appointed by george bush has served valiantly as a u s attorney and is simply trying to do his job bob mueller former fbi director strongly supported by republicans in the past let them do their work wallace senator klobuchar thank you thanks for joining us always good to talk with you klobuchar happy father aposs day chris thanks for having me on wallace thank you thank you remember to get your kids to call their dad klobuchar yes that aposs a very important thing i m texting my daughter after we stop and reminding her to do the same wallace well maybe she watched the show so maybe you won apost need to klobuchar yes exactly if she s awake wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss calls for unity here in washington and how long they will last commercial break wallace chilling footage from wednesday aposs attack on the gop congressional baseball practice that left four people shot including a member of congress and the gunman dead and it s time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume columnist for the hill juan williams julie pace the new washington bureau chief for the associated press congratulations julie julie pace associated press thank you very much applause laughter wallace there s applause but yes anyway washington examiner contributor lisa boothe does deserve applause brit obviously nobody can directly link this attack the actions of a deranged man to the political climate in washington but why have things turned so venomous here over the years and is there any way to stop it brit hume fox news senior political analyst well i want to say chris i think that congressman davis had it part right and part wrong because i think the poisonous political climate and the poisonous language with which people who disagree speak of each other is as much and the attitudes on capitol hill as much a reflection of what aposs in the country as they are a cause of it and we hear people speak of each other today in twitter in political debate in a way that never used to be the case to this extent people don apost really disagree they think the other party the other side is evil and must be stopped this is really something new we need to keep a civil tone and america and recognize humanity and the decency of the other side and what we have is the most vicious sort of name calling and it doesn apost help from the president who were certainly been a victim of this himself adds to it with the force of his own rhetoric people you know you aposve got lyin ted and crooked hillary and bad people he says are investigating in so it all feeds and it contributes to this climate of rage and hate of the two political viewpoints that predominate this country it aposs poison wallace juan i want to pick up on that because there was a very interesting story in the new york times this week where they there was a study was done and it found that people in the two political party i m not talking about politicians now i m talking about people voters they used to basically have no use for each other now they hate each other now i mean there is it was a thermometer from one to 100 in your feelings and the average now was zero that aposs how ice cold their feelings are for people of the other party and i guess the question is how do you change it juan williams fox news political analyst well i think you have to understand that the confirmation bias that exists in terms of media content where you get your information from and are you living in a bubble it aposs almost become secure in this area of the internet that people look for points of view that affirm their pre existing prejudices friday was the anniversary of lincoln s famous house divided against itself cannot stand speech i feel like we are in that moment this is one of the most divided moments by that measure in the new york times you talked about but just by living in this community that i ve ever experienced in all my years in washington you know the part that is so i think damning was spoken by jim mattis the defense secretary recently he was asked what worries him the most he didn apost say any military enemy he said it was the divisions among us as americans the failure to talk to listen to be able to compromise and some solution he said we can apost go on like this because what we fight for in the military are american principles and values and yet those are shattered wallace president trump made several appeals this week for unity here was his weekly address begin video clip trump though we have our differences what unites us is so much stronger our love of our country our devotion to its people now more than ever these values must guide us and bring us closer together end video clip wallace julie did they feel any responsibility in the white house did you hear any talk about that for this division obviously it didn apost start with donald trump but i think as brit would say a number of people would feel that he has added to it and is there any sign that the president through all of that talk intends to dial back his rhetoric pace well i think if you look at the way the president handled the immediate aftermath of the shooting his remarks not only there but also in the diplomatic room just hours after this happened it was measured it was responsible it was sober and then you look at some of his tweets and he aposs going back to calling hillary clinton crooked hillary i this is just part of his persona he does not seem to believe that any of the rhetoric that we aposve heard from him both during the campaign and as president has contributed to this heightened sense of tension that we have between these parties i don apost anticipate that you are going to see a dramatic shift from him though again i do think that he handled the immediate aftermath in a very responsible way wallace now we should point out there aposs plenty of blame to go to both sides because on the other side you got that tasteless on the left there you can see photo op by kathy griffin not funny and then you also have a production of the julius caesar shakespeare in the park in new york city were julius caesar as you can see it looks just like donald trump i mean there aposs plenty of hate on the left as well isn t there lisa lisa boothe washington examiner contributor yes there absolutely is look you had members of congress who are on the field being shot at in the aftermath calling for unity yet when i question the sincerity of some on the left of their calls for unity the day after the shooting nancy pelosi when asked if the political culture our coarsened political culture if it was equally affecting the left in the right proceeded to attack republicans going back to 1990s calling them the sanctimonious republicans accusing the president mind you this is the day after a known bernie sanders supporter with a list of republicans to assassinate in his pocket proceeded to carry out that exact thing this also comes on the heels of october 2016 a gop office firebombs february 2017 a 71 year old staffer of dana rohrabacher knocked unconscious may 2017 wallace i know we can point to all those we can also point to gabrielle giffords being shot a democratic congresswoman boothe but there is no known link between the shooter and the tea party yet you even have the new york times editorial board last week crosstalk wallace are you really suggesting it aposs all on one side boothe no i m not saying that but i m saying that when posed this question by minority leader nancy pelosi the simple answer would have been yes hume chris these are politicians they lead to some extent but they also follow and the divisions that you see play in capitol hill and elsewhere in this town the white house as well are a function of the sentiments of constituents that aposs why for example you don apost have any real effort to make a deal on capitol hill on the part of democrats with trump with whom they might be able to it aposs because their constituents think trump is utterly evil and unsuited for office and they don apost want any part of him and they don apost want anybody who represents them to have any part of it that is part of that is a reflection the causes of that go much deeper but it s not the leaders can lead and it takes a great one to lead us out of this if that aposs going to happen but they are also a following and it aposs the broad climate of the country on both sides that is responsible wallace all right we have to take a break we ll see you all a little later up next the president tweets he is under investigation a member of mr trump s legal team joins us live commercial break wallace coming up president trump rolls back the obama opening to cuba begin video clip trump we challenged cuba to come to the table with a new agreement that is in the best interest of both their people and our people end video clip wallace we ll ask our panel if the president aposs decision will push the castro regime to compromise commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway at erin hills in wisconsin where the world aposs top golfers are competing in today aposs final round of the u s open the investigation into possible links between russia and trump associates and whether the president has tried to shut down that probe took some dramatic new turns this week joining me now is jay sekulow a member of the president aposs legal team jay i want to start with the president aposs tweet friday that i discussed with democratic senator amy klobuchar here it is again i am being investigated for firing the fbi director by the man who told me to fire the fbi director witch hunt has the special counsel robert mueller formally notified the president that he is under investigation jay sekulow trump legal team the president has not been notified by anyone that he s under investigation that tweet chris was in response to the washington post story that alleged that five unnamed sources anonymous sources leaked to the washington post that the president was in fact under investigation so that tweet was in response to that there s been no notification of an investigation nothing s changed since james comey said the president was not a target or subject of investigation nothing s changed wallace well but you don apost know that he isn apost under investigation now do you sekulow well no one s notified us that he is so i i can apost read people aposs minds but i can tell you this we have not been notified that there aposs an investigation to the president of the united states so that nothing has changed in that regard since james comey aposs testimony wallace i i want to go after another part of this tweet why is he going after deputy attorney general rod rosenstein first of all he seems to imply that rosenstein is investigating and that aposs not true it mueller and secondly he made it clear in an interview with nbc that that he decided to fire comey well before he ever met with rod rosenstein take a look begin video clip trump i was going to fire regardless of recommendation lester holt nbc news so inaudible trump he made a recommendation he s highly respected a very good guy avery smart guy the democrats like him the republicans like him he made a recommendation but regardless of recommendation i was going to fire comey end video clip wallace i want to ask you a direct question does the president think that rod rosenstein has done anything wrong sekulow the president has never said anything about rod rosenstein doing anything wrong here aposs what what is the legal situation here there is a constitutional issue when you have this scenario the president made a determination based on consult of advice he decided ultimately he s the commander in chief he gets to make that decision that james comey had a go that was coming by the way from groups right left and center over the last year you you and i know that so there had been concern about james comey it was put forward in a memorandum that aposs what the president aposs referencing from the deputy attorney general and the attorney general requesting the removal of james comey as the fbi director and ultimately that aposs the president aposs determination so here aposs the constitutional threshold question chris the president takes action based on numerous events including recommendations from his attorney general and the deputy attorney general s office he takes the action that they also by the way recommended and now he aposs being investigated by the department of justice because the special counsel under the special counsel relations reports still to the department of justice not an independent counsel so he aposs being investigated for taking the action that the attorney general and deputy attorney general recommended him to take by the agency who recommended the termination so that aposs the constitutional threshold question here that s why as i said no investigation wallace well i what what what aposs the question inaudible i mean you you stated you stated some facts first of all you ve now said that he is getting investigated after saying that you didn t sekulow no wallace you you just sir that he s being sekulow no he aposs not being investigated wallace you just said that he s being investigated sekulow no chris i said that the any let me be crystal clear so you you completely understand we have not received nor are we aware of any investigation of the president of the united states period wallace sir you just said two times that he aposs being investigated sekulow no the context of the tweet i just gave you the legal theory chris of how the constitution works if in fact it was correct that the president was being investigated he would be investigating for taking action that an agency told him to take so that is protected under the constitution as his article one power that aposs all i said so i appreciate you trying to rephrase it but i m just being really direct with you chris this is let me be wallace no i i sir i didn apost rephrase it the tape will speak jay the tape will speak for itself you said he is being investigated and it s not that big sekulow chris he is just no chris that s inaudible unfair chris wallace wait a minute wait a minute jay and it s not jay it aposs not just being investigated for firing comey there aposs also the question of what he said to comey when comey was still the fbi director so there aposs more than just the fact that he fired comey sekulow he chirrs let me be clear you asked me a question about what the president aposs tweet was regarding the deputy attorney general of the united states that aposs what you asked me and i responded to what that legal theory would be so i do not appreciate you putting words in my mouth when i aposve been crystal clear that the president is not and has not been under investigation i don apost think i can be any clearer than that wallace well you don apost know that he aposs not under investigation again sir i mean you might sekulow you know i can apost read the mind you re right chris i can t read the minds of the special prosecutor wallace well then good ok so we re in agreement you don apost know whether he s under you don t know whether he s under investigation sekulow but i have not been notified no one has been notified that he is wallace you don t know whether he s under investigation or not sekulow chris i wallace the question i aposm asking you is does he think that rod rosenstein it aposs a very simple question does he think that rod rosenstein did anything wrong sekulow the president has not expressed any opinion about rod rosenstein wallace does he think that robert mueller has done anything wrong sekulow first of all he has not said anything about robert mueller and chris let me say something here you re asking me if i had a conversation which i have not had about robert mueller with the president of the united states on or anyone else for that matter i can apost discuss that and would that with you unlike james comey who leaks information to the press i actually respect the attorney client privilege apparently he did not wallace does the president believe well you re speaking for his legal team so you re out here to represent him and tell us what the president s belief is is that correct sekulow no i aposm out here to tell you what the facts are and the legal issues are i aposm not to tell you what the beliefs are i aposm not the client s conscience i m his lawyer wallace i understand that and the and the client have you spoken the have you spoken to the president at all sekulow yes but i aposm not going to discuss those conversations with you those are privileged under the attorney client privilege wallace well i assume that if he asked you to say something for instance marc kasowitz said all kinds of things about after comey aposs testimony i assumed he was speaking for the president sekulow marc kasowitz made a general statement to the press after the testimony of james comey that aposs what that was about this you re asking me now questions about what people are thinking in their minds which i don apost read minds and you re asking me also what i may or may not have had a conversation with the president about and you understand this i respect the attorney client privilege unlike james comey wallace does sekulow i want to be real clear on that too i aposm not going to give you conversations i aposve had with have or have not had with the president of the united states so when i ve had conversations with the president of the united states wallace well i your sekulow as his lawyer it aposs privileged period wallace does the president think that rosenstein because you talked about this constitutional theory that he took action that aposs on the advice sekulow yes wallace although he says he didn apost take it on the advice of rosenstein does he think that rosenstein should recuse himself and is healing the groundwork to fire rosenstein and mueller sekulow i ve had no conversations and i ve heard nothing without that at all nothing i think this chris this points out let me tell you one thing quickly about the constitutional theory as you called it it aposs actually called the constitution you know the president has certain inaudible authority under the constitution it s wallace well you called it the constitutional theory sir sekulow yes it is a constitutional theory based on the constitution wallace i understand that sekulow not so called it aposs the constitutional theory it s part of the constitution the president has inherent authority here aposs what you aposre trying to here s what you re trying to do chris and i appreciate that you re you re trying to push back wallace well now you re reading minds again now you re reading minds again sekulow no chris i deal with fact and law you were asking me to read people s minds that i don t do wallace well don apost tell me what i aposm trying to well don t tell me what i m trying to do because you don apost know what i aposm trying to do actually what i aposm trying to get is a straight answer out of you let me ask you this sekulow yes well sure wallace as a matter of law does the president think that he can be indicted under the constitution sekulow the president i haven apost had that conversation with the president but the president can apost be indicted under the constitution of the activity alleged in something like this of course not wallace why is that sekulow because there aposs not an investigation and there s there s no inaudible against the president wallace well you don apost know whether there s an investigation oh boy this is weird you you don t know that there s whether there s an investigation you just told us that sekulow chris you re asking me to speculate so then what you re asking me to do is to speculate on wallace and it would matter i aposm asking you as a matter of law not whether there aposs an investigation does the president think he can be indicted as president sekulow for for wallace that aposs a constitutional issue isn t it sekulow for obstruction of justice no the constitution s wallace no for any of it sekulow now chris you know let aposs let s be realistic here you know what the the answer is can president be indicted for obstruction you know what the position has been at the department of justice since the 1970s and again stated in 2000 that aposs not what president that s now how you engage a president there s a political process if somebody did something wrong you re talking about you re conflating a constitutional process criminal law with an issue of political consequence so i am his lawyer i m not his political advisor wallace senator dianne feinstein a top democrat on the senate judiciary committee responded to the president aposs tweet this week with this statement the message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesn apost apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired is she wrong sir sekulow yes she aposs wrong first of all dianne feinstein also called for an investigation of james comey and loretta lynch for that whole episode regarding her engagement and calling it a quote matter not an investigation but with regard to this particular issue i mean the tweet there aposs nothing illegal or inappropriate about the tweet if the tweet came on the heels of a washington post story that had five anonymous sources and didn apost even identify the agency from which those sources came from and that aposs what he tweet in response to it aposs that simple period wallace final question the president just just added john dowd a high powered washington lawyer to his legal team should we expect him to hire other criminal lawyers and in a sense is he preparing for a potential legal battle here sekulow look i mean john dowd is is a legal legend you know that in in in the in washington d c and the president is doing the appropriate thing by hiring lawyers necessary if there was to be an investigation if there were to be an investigation you have the lawyers in place we ve got a great legal team led by marc kasowitz we ve got john dowd on the team this is a solid team contrary to some of the press reports a deep team if necessary wallace do you think i i i misspoke i m going to ask one more question because i aposm not allowed to ask you what the president thinks do you think that he should stop sekulow of course wallace do you think he should stop tweeting about this case sekulow look i here aposs the thing on that you know people have been asking me that look the president has changed the way in which engagement goes in i mean you aposve got great ratings no doubt about it chris but let aposs face it the president speaks to 107 million people through his social media platforms he revolutionized the election process by utilizing media in a different way so i i think look the president knows the effectiveness of social media he s been very effective at it again i m his lawyer i deal with the issues nothing that he aposs tweeted is causing me any issues whatsoever at this point nothing wallace jay thank you thanks for coming in sekulow thanks chris wallace it s always it s always interesting to talk to you please come back and we ll sekulow thanks chris wallace we ll continue it and maybe this time we ll get on this you know what be here in studio and we can stay on the same wavelength sekulow there we go wallace all right sir sekulow happy father aposs day wallace happy father aposs day to you too sir up next we ll bring back our sunday group to discuss the latest development in the special counsel aposs investigation plus the president rolls back mr obama aposs cuba policies what would you like to ask the panel about the reversal just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip rep paul ryan r house speaker i think the best thing to do is to let robert mueller do his job i think the best vindication for the president is to let this investigation go on independently and thoroughly end video clip wallace house speaker paul ryan one of a chorus of republican leaders wanting president trump not to fire the special counsel who s investigating links to russia and a possible attempt to obstruct justice and we re back now with the panel julie you ve got quite a story out this week from ap saying that the president feels increasingly under siege about the investigation and is now taken to yelling at the television when he sees coverage of the investigation what what can you tell us about what the president s mood is pace well the president increasingly sees himself as a victim of a politically motivated attempt to undermine or perhaps end his presidency and what really seems to have him frustrated according to sources wallace you could argue that he aposs right about that pace you you could except that this investigation is going to go on whether he feels that way or not and and one of the things that his associates his advisors say is that he aposs frustrated because he doesn apost have the ability to control this so you see him lashing out in these various ways on twitter he is consumed by the coverage of this investigation and he watches it in real time from the minute he wakes up until the minute that he goes to bed he has the televisions on he s watching what s being said about him and it aposs really fueled this anxiety because again this is not something he aposs going to be able to control this is something that is going to continue and and the tweets and his reactions to this seem to actually be causing the investigation to expand not contract wallace yes i want to pick up on that i mean there are two things that can both be true here lisa one it can be a witch hunt it can be an effort by his opponents to bring him down but you can also argue that he aposs made things worse james comey kept telling him he s not under investigation so he fire comey now he is under investigation and then there are those tweets boothe i i think you aposre right i think both of those can be true and and look the president has every right to fire comey i think the problem was one the conflicting messages from the white house and then also the alleged conversations that happened between him and the fbi director but if you re the president i actually think calling this a witch hunt is a smart political strategy because if you look at it from the sense of ok so you have the fbi director who the new york times said made an extraordinary statement i think it was back in march announcing the fact that they were looking into trump associates and the russians in regard to russia so but meanwhile behind the scenes telling him that he himself is not under investigation while everyone else is calling for impeachment from him then you of the former fbi director leaking memos as he said to force a special counsel investigation when he took instruction from loretta lynch to call it a matter as opposed to an investigation and now he aposs allegedly being looked at for obstruction of justice despite what senator rich ph pointed out during when comey testified at the senate intelligence committee nobody s ever been prosecuted for using the word hope so i think actually calling this a witch hunt is a smart political strategy looking at all of those things wallace all right enough about all of this we re going to talk about one of the real subjects affecting people aposs lives that that you all want to hear about and i want to turn to president trump announcing this week that he is partially rolling back president obama aposs opening of diplomatic and economic ties to cuba here he is begin video clip trump america has rejected the cuban people aposs oppressors they are rejected officially today they are rejected end video clip wallace brit how significant is the president aposs decision really when you consider the fact that yes he is rolling back some things on the other hand the u s embassy in havana is going to stay open u s airlines u s cruise ships are still going to be able to serve the island hume what he did was he dialed back part of the of the outreach to cuba a signal i think to the cuban american community in florida and elsewhere that he is with them and would like to see the castro brothers done there s not not going to be any real detente between the u s and havana between washington and havana but it but it you know it was not a he called it a complete rollback reversal it wasn apost really a reversal wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from pamela murray who writes what benefit did we gain by changing the policies in the first place juan how do you answer pamela and and specifically the question of after president obama in 2014 had this opening this this effort to reach out to the castro regime did they really release the you know ease up on the repression political repression in the country williams no short answer to pamela is no the the thing is you know i m going to say this on a very personal level i was somewhat conflicted i i was a critic of the obama aposs rapprochement ph because to me my family had experiences in latin america with these castro like dictators it aposs not healthy it s repression and a repression that leads to political prisoners as you were describing but the thing is chris you have 50 plus years of failed u s policy with regard to cuba that has not led to the release of political prisoner increased human rights or even press freedoms in cuba so the idea that you would have and this is specifically an answer to pamela an infusion of americans with american values american capitalism and american democracy coming into cuba challenging the way of life giving people new reason for hope is to me a significant change and one of the realities wallace but you agree that in the two and a half years that it was in place it didn apost actually change the way things were going on here williams no no it changed i think the key if you care about the cuban people yes there was change if you care if you re saying were prisoners released did press freedoms increase you no but this is a slow and steady process and there was no change in the previous 55 years hume chris this has been an enduring debate as to how to deal with these dictatorial ph regimes one theory holds that if you open commerce up as we ve done with china for example that eventually that will have a democratizing effect and will tend to diminish the repression the results from china i think are mixed at best as to whether that aposs effective it aposs worth it s i think it was always it s worth a try cuba s a somewhat different case because you know they have a have a have a 1920s economy there and and the early indications is once you just at least on the political repression is that it has not ended i think it remains to be seen whether the commerce will have the effect that we hope it will have but but that s that s a long running debate and the and and there s no certain answer to whether that works or not wallace julie in the white house how do the trump officials advisors reconciled his call and his defense of human rights in cuba with a few weeks back when he was in the middle east his silence on that issue when he was in saudi arabia pace it aposs a pretty jarring contrast i was on that trip in saudi arabia and you know this is this is a country that other u s presidents have dealt with despite their pretty grim human rights record so it s not as though trump is the first person to do it but he completely ignored the human rights violations when he was on that trip yet we hear him talking about cuba and saying that this is a human rights issue you can look at this two ways you can say that this is cynical and this is just an attempt to try to roll back something that obama did or you could look at people like marco rubio at some of these other lawmakers who truly do believe that this is a human rights issue and has been putting a lot of pressure on this white house to take this step hume one important difference cuba s an american adversary for sure it has been forever saudi arabia s an ally and has been for a very long time williams yes but i think cuba is our neighbor and we know you know they have been posed a direct threat to us going back to inaudible and the like and it aposs time for change the younger generation in florida of cubans they re they re for obama aposs plan it s the older generation that i think is still entrenched in the hatred anger wallace yes well let s not diss the older generation williams no no no pace you ve got to watch the meaning ph in there wallace we ll see you next sunday i ve got to speak up for us up next our power player of the week how a father is changing the lives of thousands of kids one comfort case at a time commercial break wallace and now for a father aposs day story you will never forget here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape rob scheer founder comfort cases the only thing you should be using your trash for is to take trash out and if you take a trash bag and give it to a child what are we telling them wallace voice over rob scheer is talking about the 400 000 foster children in this country who often are sent from home to home carrying all their belongings in a trash bag scheer we re telling them that they re worth no more than trash wallace scheer who spent eight years in foster care wanted to send a different message so in 2013 he started something called comfort cases scheer we wanted to make sure that they had more than a trash bag so we give them a case with a brand new pair of pajamas a toothbrush a bar of soap a blanket and a book wallace on camera what difference can that make scheer it makes a huge difference wallace voice over to understand listen to rob s story when he turned 18 and the government checks ran out his foster father put him on the street rob ended up working in a taco restaurant while he went to school scheer the owner knew that i was homeless and so he would leave the outside bathroom door unlocked for me to sleep in at night wallace on camera so you graduated from high school homeless scheer graduated from high school homeless wallace voice over but after a stint in the navy rob went into the mortgage business and married reece and in 2009 they decided to adopt from foster care scheer maya ph was four and her little brother maky ph was two we were told that the little boy was probably never going to speak and that if he did walk he would walk with braces on his legs he had such severe alcohol fetal syndrome wallace three months later they took in another pair of siblings greyson ph and tristin ph it was while raising his new family rob made a discovery scheer a child deserves to own something that aposs brand new that belongs to them this is what we ve got to do there are checklists that you will grab wallace so rob and reece started comfort cases organizing packing parties scheer are we having fun yet wallace the first year they put together a couple of hundred duffel bags and backpacks by last year 25 000 to six states and d c scheer thank you thank you thank you for coming wallace maya is now 13 scheer she is amazing she loves the charity my son greyson who is ten i always call him my spokesperson wallace but that aposs not where this story ends reece read that being around animals could help someone with maky s condition scheer so three years ago we bought a farm and we bought a farm with goats and chickens and we were barely getting by with maky and now three years later maky gets on a school bus every single day and turns around and waves bye to his dads every single day maky looks at me and for the first time last year said i love you daddy wallace rob cites shocking numbers three quarters of the people sent to prison have some link to foster care more than 70 percent of foster children will become homeless his goal scheer that every single child in foster care no longer carries a trash bag but i really hope that we as a community realize that the over 400 000 children deserve the same thing that we give
