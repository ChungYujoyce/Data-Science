apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic shrimp catfish and other seafood farmed in china will be banned immediately from entering the u s because they contain harmful chemicals the food and drug administration said yesterday the agency stressed that the contaminated fish are not being viewed as an immediate health risk and said consumers should feel comfortable eating fish currently being served in restaurants grocery stores and their homes however a nationwide industry alert was issued over china s seafood because the fda continues to find traces of carcinogenic chemicals in fish imported from china top stories trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender it is the first nationwide import ban on seafood there s been a continued pattern of violation with no signs of abatement said david acheson assistant commissioner for food safety at the fda the u s imports 81 percent of its seafood china is a major source of that seafood accounting for 21 percent of total imports more than 80 percent of the shrimp consumed in the u s is imported of which 7 percent is from china about 10 percent of catfish comes from china according to the national fisheries institute china is the third largest exporter of shrimp to the u s alongside the philippines and mexico which are also significant seafood suppliers fda officials said there are about a half dozen import alerts on specific companies from other countries that import seafood to the u s also for using harmful chemicals the fda will start to detain farm raised catfish shrimp baa eel and dace which is related to carp from china at the border until the shipments are proved free of residue from contaminants that are not approved in the united states for use in farm raised aquatic animals the announcement caught the attention of lawmakers on capitol hill who have been critical of the fda s job in protecting the nation s food supply today s revelation appears to be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to contaminated and dangerous chinese goods coming into the u s said sen charles e schumer new york democrat there is no question that too many chinese manufacturers and food producers put the bottom line ahead of safety the fda still needs to do much more to address this worsening crisis we need stricter standards more thorough inspections and harsher penalties for chinese companies and american shippers that turn a blind eye to safety the import ban by the fda comes after several southern states already blocked the sale of chinese seafood because it contained contaminants but fda officials said the agency was following its normal strategy and was not slow to respond to the situation during targeted sampling from october 2006 through may the fda repeatedly found that farm raised seafood imported from china was contaminated with antimicrobial agents that are not approved for use in the united states despite the alert federal health regulators said that the chemicals found in the fish do not represent a major health risk there is no acute health concern rather it is a long term health issue we are not talking days months or even years here but it is clearly something we wouldn t want to ignore said dr acheson china has been in the news repeatedly in recent months for contaminated products from toothpaste to pet food to tires entering the u s market the health concerns triggered a cleanup in china s food industry chinese authorities shut down 180 domestic food manufacturers during the past six months for making substandard food or using inedible materials for food production chinese news media said this week the fda increased monitoring on products imported from china since health scares over pet food and toothpaste and the agency says it has been vigorously monitoring seafood since before 2001 the focus is on china we re looking for problems where we think they exist said margaret glavin associate commissioner for regulatory affairs at the fda chinese

gentian violet have been shown to be carcinogenic with long term exposure in lab animals and the use of fluoroquinolones in animals raised for food may increase antibiotic resistance none of the substances are approved for use in farm raised seafood in the united states and the use of nitrofurans and malachite green in aquaculture is also prohibited by chinese authorities chinese officials
