apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic maybe it s just a temporary glitch in the big media machine but some observers are now saying that the liberal press is getting tense and or mournful that president trump may not be impeached on schedule or he may never be impeached exasperated liberal journalists are convinced the only way to save the republic is to impeach donald trump and yet increasingly hosts reporters and pundits are clearly worried they and the democrats might have missed their shot writes geoffrey dickens deputy research director for the media research center who has been tracking this trend for a month on cnn msnbc nbc cbs abc and in several print news organizations those he cited include meet the press moderator chuck todd who on sunday compared the impeachment inquiry to the trial of o j simpson top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time he was innocent but everyone knew he was guilty the host told his guests mr todd also coauthored an nbc news column which asked this question would richard nixon have resigned from office in 1974 if there had been a fox news back then the press however is not likely to dwell on passing disappointment or the prospect that even if the house impeachment vote passes it could fail in the senate they are not done with mr trump by any means don t expect trump to get the friendly pass a decent chunk of the news media and presidential historians have given bill clinton over the years despite his impeachment trump is much more likely to get the nixon treatment where his impeachment will be brought up as regularly as nixon s resignation and the watergate scandal writes cnbc columnist jake novak who says impeachment ultimately gives the president more assets than liabilities he credits a mix of timing and the unique nature of the trump presidency but as much as historical legacy clearly matters to this president and all presidents a flawed legacy was probably guaranteed for trump long ago as it stands now the future negatives seem like a small price to pay compared to the multiple ways this impeachment actually works for his political present mr novak notes trump reassures pennsylvania president trump a master campaigner will be in hershey pennsylvania on tuesday for another happy jumbo rally with some 10 500 fans at a local arena reminding them to keep america great and to remember that the state has added 158 000 jobs since mr trump took office vice president mike pence will be at his side voter support in the quaker state is vital mr trump was the first republican presidential candidate in almost three decades to win pennsylvania which offers a hefty 20 electoral votes he won by 44 292 votes in the state which now has a 3 8 unemployment rate its lowest in 43 years the bottom line is he needs the state he s going to fight for pennsylvania perhaps more than any state in the country muhlenberg college political science professor chris borick told the patriot news a

presidential hopeful michael r bloomberg has donated millions of dollars to cities which are likely campaign stops according to a new york post investigation of the candidate s tax filings from 2017 and 2018 there s evidence of the bloomberg philanthropic footprint nearly everywhere he goes writes analyst carl campanile the mike bloomberg family foundation has poured money into a slew of programs

campanile says the total amount of donations over the years has reached 8 billion mr bloomberg however has already rejected claims that he is trying to buy the election a possibility cited by several of his democratic rivals i m not buying anything i m doing exactly the same thing they re doing except that i am using my own money they re using somebody else s money and those other people expect something from them nobody gives you money if they don t expect something and i don t want to be bought mr bloomberg told cbs news the bloomberg camp agreed telling the post that these donations have nothing to do with running for president democratic party the reality check in an attempt to bolster his campaign joe biden keeps insisting that democrats aren t leftist enough to nominate elizabeth warren or bernie sanders is he really that out of touch with his own party asks john merlin editor of issues insights his party has been drifting leftward for many years to the point where it now fully embraces socialist policies that it never would have considered when say biden first ran for president mr merlin writes noting that the shift began as early as 2013 why are republicans routinely depicted as the party of extremists and not democrats for the simple reason that the press the entertainment industry and academia the forces that shape and direct the national conversation are far more leftist than they once were to them talk of a government takeover of health care free college 40 trillion spending plans is mainstream mr merlin observes the more joe biden tries to pretend that his party isn t comprised mainly of radical leftists today the more out of touch he appears not to us but to those who identify as democrats poll du jour 60 of small business owners approve of the way
