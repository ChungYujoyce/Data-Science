be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump s personal attorney rudolph giuliani said in a video posted friday that senators should move to dismiss democrats articles of impeachment because they do not allege anything for which the president can be removed as mr trump s trial entered its fifth day mr giuliani said democrats should finish their entirely partisan picture of why they believe mr trump abused his power vis a vis ukraine and then obstructed congress he also thinks republicans should respond with an opening statement as to why this didn t happen and why this is totally unjustified top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk but then there should be a vote a motion should be made to dismiss the articles of impeachment for failure to state an impeachable offense similar to dismissing an indictment for failure to state a crime mr giuliani said i believe that that is the correct outcome mr giuliani opined on the case against mr trump in volume 1 of his podcast titled common sense after thomas paine s famous pamphlet ahead of the american revolution he said the president can only be impeached for treason bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors and that democrats articles do not cite a specific offense he said as a longtime lawyer he is familiar with the criminal statutes there is no crime there called abuse of power mr giuliani said it s a nebulous term it s a debatable thing it s more of a theory than it is a charge that s defined mr giuliani who rose to fame as a federal prosecutor and new york city mayor said he will use his podcast to reveal the somewhat startling information he dug up in his capacity as mr trump s attorney in particular mr giuliani has been investigating former vice president joseph r biden a frontrunner in the 2020 democratic primary and his son s business ties to ukraine for months the issue is at the heart of mr trump s ongoing impeachment trial mr trump stands accused of improperly withholding military aid to ukraine unless the country s leaders agreed to open up an investigation into the bidens in 2018 mr biden had boasted about threatening to withhold 1 billion in loan guarantees unless ukraine agreed to fire the country s top prosecutor who had reportedly been looking into corruption at an energy company where hunter biden held a lucrative seat on the board mr biden and his team have consistently said he did nothing wrong the push to oust the prosecutor was in line with u s policy at the time and the investigation into the company burisma had been dormant by the time mr biden was advocating for the ouster rep sylvia garcia one of the house impeachment managers on thursday pushed back on the notion that mr biden was trying to oust viktor shokin to protect his son it would actually increase chances of a burisma investigation the texas democrat said also noting that the push was in line with obama administration policy yet mr giuliani is indicating he will not back away from the type of sleuthing that led to mr trump being impeached appearing on fox and friends he teased that he had additional information forthcoming that could be damaging to mr biden and said he hopes the ex vice president will ultimately be placed under investigation i started investigating biden two years ago when he was thinking about running for president mr giuliani said on the cable tv program i never thought he would run looked to me like he couldn t cross the street much less run mr giuliani didn t answer directly when asked if mr trump wants him to continue with his investigative efforts would you like me to give it up he asked host brian kilmeade should i give it up brian i m scared of them attacking me he said cowering sarcastically they re a bunch of phonies i did my job as an attorney i did it well i did it honorably and i did the country a service in bringing out this corruption that everybody else is afraid to touch mr giuliani s new podcast is essentially a youtube video series on a dedicated website seated before a microphone he stressed that what s going on is extremely rare mr trump is only the third president to be impeached and that democrats are seeking to oust mr trump less than a year before the presidential election he said the founders were worried that members of congress would oust a president over political jealousy so alexander hamilton is not having a restful period right now they ve alleged things that are not impeachable offenses the senate should make that clear mr giuliani said and hopefully it will act as a deterrent so another president does not have to go through this and this does not become a new part of the political leverage that we have mr trump has made similar arguments in refusing to turn over documents or acquiesce to democratic demands for testimony from his current and former aides he says the demands will undermine executive privileges and harm future presidents for now the president is following his trial closely and tweeting about developments as democrats wrap up their case he says democrats have dithered putting his defense team in a lousy television slot looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on saturday which is called death val
