rsecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic loose money policies in the united states have combined with robust growth in china and other emerging nations in recent months to set off a price spiral in food energy and other basic goods needed to run the economy the trend threatens to pick up speed and become an obstacle for the global economy this year as growth in the united states accelerates to as high as 4 percent and contributes to burgeoning demand for basic goods obtained in global markets the chain reaction behind the phenomenon is reminiscent of the commodity price spiral that occurred in 2008 which led to record high prices for oil corn wheat copper iron and other necessities china in particular is playing a key role in translating the federal reserve s loose money policies aimed at reviving the u s economy into global commodity inflation through its policy of linking its currency to the u s dollar that makes for one

risk michael drury chief economist at mcvean trading investments said china really is more to blame for the inflation uptick than the fed although the u s central bank can be faulted for largely ignoring evidence of growing inflation in raw materials since such commodity prices often fluctuate widely fed officials adamantly contend that what matters is the core rate of inflation which excludes food and energy and which currently remains tame a report released thursday that showed a flare up in food and energy costs pushed up wholesale inflation in the u s by 1 1 percent last month the most in a year but while the fed concedes that prolonged inflation in such commodities eventually can push up the overall inflation rate paid by consumers it typically focuses on the rate excluding them which was up modestly by 0 2 percent in december and rose by only 1 3 percent during the full year 2010 the fed s preferred measure is not a very good measure of inflation because it not only ignores vital necessities that consumers use each day but it excludes fast rising investment prices like home prices another blind spot at the fed that resulted in the housing market bubble and collapse mr drury said still despite the fed s shortcomings today the inflation that is most on the radar screen is food inflation in china he said and that is mostly the result of china s policy of translating the fed s loose money policies into loose money policies in china via its exchange rate mechanism food prices are rising so fast in china that people are starting to stockpile food as a hedge against rising prices he said a series of global weather events have tightened food supplies back to inflationary levels not seen since the 1970s he said citing the fires that destroyed wheat crops in russia last year and this year s floods in australia s grain growing region with much of u s farmland now being used to raise corn for the production of ethanol the world is faced with tight stocks of all edible grains and oil seeds and little available acreage around the world he said even as supplies tighten the incomes of consumers in china and other emerging countries are growing rapidly and people are clamoring for more expensive and resource intensive foods like meat that means the risk remains decidedly on the high side for agricultural prices mr drury said the transmission mechanism by which the fed s loose money policies result in higher commodity inflation starts with the fact that all major commodities traded in global markets are priced in u s dollars the rest of the world obtains dollars to purchase those commodities primarily through trade with the u s over several decades the u s has run lopsided trade deficits that have flooded the rest of the world with dollars the deficit with china has been particularly large ranging to more than 200 billion a year and enabling china to amass a giant war chest of 2 8 trillion in foreign exchange reserves but nearly every u s trading partner has accumulated surplus reserves of dollars china india and other fast growing countries use their reserves and the dollars they earn through trade with the u s to bid up the price of wheat corn and oil to fuel their rapidly growing economies thus for example the price of premium crude oil spiked to two year highs of more than 90 a barrel recently despite lackluster demand in the u s the biggest consuming country the result is what mr drury calls a commodities trap the fed remains lax on monetary policy because u s unemployment remains high and core consumer inflation remains low while china and other countries translate this lax policy into high commodities inflation but ironically the higher prices force american consumers to spend more on food and energy and less on nonessential services further driving down the core inflation rate and depressing u s growth that leads the fed to further loosen the money spigot and sets off the chain reaction all over again u s leaders from fed chairman ben s bernanke to treasury secretary timothy f geithner are keenly aware that china s policies have boxed in the fed and much of the world economy through this vicious cycle they have registered increasingly sharp complaints against china and are promising to raise the issue during the chinese president s visit we are at a turning point in the u s china economic partnership said commerce secretary gary locke in remarks to the u s china business council on thursday the policies and practices that have shaped our relation over the past few decades will not suffice over the next few decades mr geithner warned china on wednesday that it must speed the appreciation of its currency the yuan against the dollar to avoid an adverse reaction around the world this is not a tenable policy for china or for the world economy he told the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies if china does not allow the currency to appreciate more rapidly it will run the risk of seeing domestic inflation accelerate mr geithner added that he expects china to act because the alternative would be too costly for china and for chinas relations with the rest of the world meanwhile as fast rising food and energy prices push up the overall inflation rate analysts say that will increasingly put the fed on the defensive as it carries out plans to flood the economy with money through purchases of u s treasury bonds this year it will become troublesome for the fed going forward as financial markets are increasingly focusing on the threat of higher inflation said john spinello chief technical strategist at jefferies co the significant price increases for food and energy will bite into households pockets in the united states as elsewhere said harm bandholz economist at unicredit markets this is particularly true for lower income families who spend a relatively larger share of their income for necessities moreover the increased inflation pressures will force the fed to confront questions once again about whether it s using a proper measure for the underlying inflation rate when it focuses exclusively on the so called core rate o
