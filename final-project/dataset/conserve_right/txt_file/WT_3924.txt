and are being done and should be done the white house brought the families together to offer comfort and an update from the front lines of the epidemic the session was a tearful one though a current of hope and perseverance coursed through it with parents saying they don t want any more americans to join their ranks it s the same story over and over and i keep seeing it said gayle watkins who lost her son george tripp watkins at age 24 after a klonopin prescription for anxiety turned into a deeper problem laura mchugh badura of wisconsin said her son archie self medicated with marijuana before turning to opioids and dying of a heroin overdose in 2014 she said the u s needs to crack down on every chemical formulation of fentanyl a synthetic opioid that s emerged as the number one killer in the crisis jennifer tolson of richmond virginia said parents wouldn t keep heroin in an unlocked cabinet at home so they shouldn t leave prescription medications in one either she said her son blaize got hooked after raiding her pills leading him to forfeit a football scholarship at penn state university before losing his life to heroin at age 23 in 2016 jennifer and kevin derr also of richmond have committed themselves to fighting stigma around addiction after losing their son billy at age 24 and there was donald mihalek a former secret service agent who lost his sister denise don protected several presidents but he couldn t protect his sister his wife valerie mihalek said in an emotional address to the room mr mihalek said there should be a national standard for treatment so insurance programs aren t paying for fly by night treatment options that don t work white house drug czar james w caroll addressing the group with a kind of empathy and emotion that s unusual in washington said the administration s new website findtreatment gov only endorses state licensed treatment providers he also touted efforts to train more specialists in addiction treatment congress passed bipartisan opioids legislation in 2018 to expand treatment options and reel in the rampant flow of pain bills building on a wave of action that began at the end of president obama s term and reached new heights under mr trump who declared drug addiction to be a public health emergency in 2017 their efforts are starting to pay off provisional federal data say deaths from drug overdose dropped slightly to 68 000 in 2018 compared to 70 200 in 2017 it is the first year to year decrease of its kind in nearly three decades opioid related deaths showed a very slim decline to 47 236 from 47 600 many of those dying from opioids today started on prescription drugs but turned to cheaper heroin that is laced with fentanyl a powerful synthetic that is often made in china or mexico and shipped across borders hundreds of cities counties and states have sued opioid makers and distributors resulting in talks over a potential resolution that could resemble the big tobacco settlement of the late 1990s also federal prosecutors in new york have subpoenaed several drug companies as part of a potential criminal investigation into their alleged roles in sparking the crisis mr caroll told the times he is pleased that widespread efforts to rein in high doses of opioids at the pharmacy counter are causing the pill driven aspect of the crisis to plateau though said policymakers and the public can t take their eye off the ball we could easily slip back he said in an interview the harder we push the more we ll see success nancy and michael gray of the greater new york city area said their daughter amanda self medicated intermittently because of a mental illness at 24 years old she was killed by a dose of pure fentanyl that she did not realize she was ingesting due to a bait and switch by the person who gave her the substance her parents remembered her as someone who loved big and deployed trademark hugs when she hugged you you were being loved and you knew it mrs gray said deaths tied to synthetic opioids like fentanyl rose from 28 400 in 2017 to 31 600 in 2018 so the administration is pressuring other nations to do more the administration is cautiously optimistic that china is cracking down on clandestine labs in their country citing recent prosecutions and moves to schedule forms of fentanyl as illegal almost all the drugs that are killing americans are coming in from outside the united states that s why i went to china to tell them cut it out that we mean it the president is serious and they responded mr carroll said mr carroll said he will head to mexico in the new year to address drug flows across the southern border saying the u s stands ready to assist as mr trump vocally ramps up pressure on cartels in the meantime mr carroll said his secret weapon in the fight is staff member tom murphy a retired virginia state police trooper who worked in narcotics but lost his own son jason to an overdose after a workplace injury led to opioid addiction mr carroll and mr murphy crossed paths decades ago when they both worked in virginia the drug czar said he hired mr muphy as his assistant director for state local and tribal affairs because he wanted parents who ve lost children to addiction to be represented on his staff mr murphy told the group that after rehab and an arrest on drug violations his son died from a heroin and fentanyl overdose at
