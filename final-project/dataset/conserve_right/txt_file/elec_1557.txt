opinion analysis opinion now even donald trump is taking himself seriously he s trying now to be colorful without being reckless careful not to be rude when he doesn t have to be and playing less the showboat and more like someone trying out for the team he s still donald trump and he hasn t been to the barber shop he can t put a leash on his arrogance and he still can t resist taking cruel and telling shots at jeb bush but the jeb is a shrinking target throwing darts at him is becoming an indulgence top stories cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces you are not going to die from covid 19 postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud the donald signed the loyalty oath thursday demanded by reince priebus the chairman of the party promising not to run as a third party candidate if he doesn t get the republican nomination i just wanted fairness from the republican party he said thursday i will be totally pledging my allegiance to the republican party and the conservative principles for which it stands such a decision was a no brainer if he had declined it would have spoken volumes about how he as a front runner rendering the other candidates as mutts chasing the meat wagon in his gut measures his chances in iowa and new hampshire besides mr priebus and the rest of the republican establishment can t do anything about it if the donald comes upon a burning bush by the side of the road later and changes his mind he would offend only the establishment and the party s prospects in the election but not his considerable ego now that he s the runaway front runner he has to act like one success is the curse of insurgents the successful insurgent has to remember who brung him to the dance and he can t run against himself tempting as it may be to try two new public opinion polls show just how successful the improbable mr trump continues to be one of them a survey by monmouth university of new jersey finds him polling nationally 30 percent up 4 points and leading in every ideological category he s the choice of the tea party of the very conservative of the somewhat conservative of liberals men women young people and old people it s a remarkable performance every more remarkable the runner up though distant at 18 percent is ben carson another outsider gaining on everyone the message to the party regulars who measure every word and whose milk toast message is vote republican we re not as bad as you think it s hard to get anyone to throw his hat in the air over that when many of the people in the weeds the jonson grass and grass roots think establishment republicans are indeed just as bad as you think these voters think the party won the lottery in 2012 and 2014 on their nickel and they re in a rage over the theft the insurgents are telling the republican establishment loud and clear you stink so get out of the way the collapse of jeb bush tells this story in full plain and blunt and with neither tact nor tenderness the onetime governor of florida promised that he would mount a different kind of campaign he would be the happy warrior apparently no one reminded him of what happened to al smith the original happy warrior he had never liked the grit and grime of take no prisoners politics anyway and he just wouldn t be part of that he s down to the single digits in the public opinion polls far from the sound of the guns safe from grit and grime civility is nice but not this year grit and grime is the natural home of donald trump who boasts of his prowess at the art of the deal he s a veteran of conflict with construction unions banks investors and government bureaucrats who think it s their job to stand in the way of anyone trying to get something done bluster is more effective than bonhomie in these wars and to the astonishment of everyone and to the terror of the regulars this year it works in politics too ben carson has the surgeon s assurance that he s got the answers and everyone should give him room operating room nurses joke that the difference between god and a surgeon is that god doesn t think he s a surgeon mr carson is selling the same elixir the donald is peddling with just a touch more sugar to make it go down and his elixir is beginning to fly off the shelves in his shop too it s still difficult to see how either the donald or the doctor can get the delegates to actually win the nomination and actual delegates not polling numbers is what the race is all about but nothing seems beyond imagination this year when the establishment in both parties in taking a licking this is what makes politics the most entertaining game in town wesley pruden is editor emeritus of the washington times manage newsletters copyright 2020 the washington times llc
