and the black t shirts that have become their uniform police announced about 10 30 p m that they would clear the area asking protesters to leave and warning they would use appropriate force if they encountered resistance the actions prompted organizers of a separate peaceful march against the extradition bill to change the endpoint of their protest from the legislature to a nearby park after police asked them to either call it off or change the route police wanted the march to end earlier in the wan chai district but organizers said that would leave out many people who planned to join the march along the way police estimated 190 000 people joined the peaceful march the third major one in as many weeks hong kong has been wracked by weeks of protests over a government attempt to change extradition laws to allow suspects to be sent to china to face trial the proposed legislation on which debate has been suspended indefinitely increased fears of eroding freedoms in the territory which britain returned to china on july 1 1997 protesters want the bills formally withdrawn and hong kong s embattled leader carrie lam to resign lam who has come under withering criticism for trying to push the legislation through pledged to be more responsive to public sentiment but has not responded directly to protesters demands in an address after a flag raising ceremony marking the anniversary of the handover lam said the protests and two earlier marches that attracted hundreds of thousands of participants have taught her that she needs to listen better to youth and people in general this has made me fully realize that i as a politician have to remind myself all the time of the need to grasp public sentiments accurately she told the gathering in the city s cavernous convention center she insisted her government has good intentions but said i will learn the lesson and ensure that the government s future work will be closer and more responsive to the aspirations sentiments and opinions of the community security guards pushed pro democracy lawmaker helena wong out of the room as she shouted at lam to resign and withdraw the evil legislation she later told reporters she was voicing the grievances and opinions of the protesters who could not get into the event mainland china s entirely state controlled media made no mention of monday s protests the main evening news broadcast carried video of the flag raising ceremony along with parts of lam s address and shots of hong kong residents praising displays put on by the people s liberation army garrison in the territory chinese media outlets have barely reported on the protests since they began last month other than to blame foreign forces for stirring up unrest the extradition bill controversy has given fresh momentum to hong kong s pro democracy opposition movement awakening broader concerns that china is chipping away at the rights guaranteed to hong kong for 50 years under a one country two systems framework the two marches in june drew more than a million people according to organizer estimates jimmy sham a leader of the pro democracy group that organized monday s march told the crowd that lam had not responded to their demands because she is not democratically elected the leader of hong kong is chosen by a committee dominated by pro china elites we know that carrie lam can be so arrogant sham said rallying the crowd under a blazing sun before the start of the march at victoria park she is protected by our flawed system the protesters are also demanding an independent inquiry into police actions during a june 12 protest when officers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a demonstration that blocked the legislature on the day that debate on the bill had been scheduled to resume the police say the use of force was justified but since then have largely adopted softer tactics even as protesters besieged police headquarters in recent days pelting it with eggs and spray painting slogans on its outer walls the area around golden bauhinia square where the flag raising ceremony took place was blocked off from saturday to prevent protesters from gathering to disrupt it before the morning ceremony protesters trying to force their way to the square were driven back by officers with plastic shields and batons the retreating protesters pointing open umbrellas
