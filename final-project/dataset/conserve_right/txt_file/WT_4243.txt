may seem impossible that one person could hold so many titles but almost everything about halim flowers can be called impossible and the 39 year old lifelong washingtonian is just getting started he s set his sights on two more dreams that may seem implausible becoming a billionaire and changing how america thinks about prisons top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century we need to put programs inside the institutions that get people becoming viable entrepreneurs or employees in this global market mr flowers told the washington times there should not be a law in place that someone can t get a certain license because they have a felony that s one thing i like about republican theory minimum regulation marc howard founding director of georgetown university s prisons and justice initiative first met mr flowers while teaching a class at the d c jail and continues to be inspired by him he is the living embodiment of everything i believe in which is people are capable of doing much more than the worst thing they ve done he said it is a tremendous story of human growth and transformation at 16 mr flowers was thrown away sentenced to 40 years to life in prison after being convicted of murder although prosecutors concede he didn t pull the trigger a teen crack dealer mr flowers robbed three men at gunpoint inside a northeast washington apartment according to court documents exiting the apartment the men jumped him and a melee ensued the gun went off but did not hit anyone mr flowers fled with the gun but no money he and another friend were enraged the robbery was foiled and returned to the apartment another fight broke out and one of the men elvern cooper ran into his bedroom prosecutors said mr flowers friend fired three times through the bedroom door hitting cooper who died days later mr flowers insists he did not return to the apartment nonetheless he was convicted because in the district of columbia like in most american and british jurisdictions anyone involved in a felony that results in death can be prosecuted for murder i didn t go to prison the first day i committed a crime it was a trajectory he said roughly two years into his sentence mr flowers discovered the work of george jackson a 1960s activist whose writings from prison were compiled into a collection of books just seeing how his words were received by the world had an impact he said he was inside of a cell but he developed himself in a way that his ideas were so valuable that people all over the world consumed what he had to say it taught me that my ideas have value it was now my task to find a way to articulate them and get them out into the world he continued that is what kept me going mr flowers vowed to educate himself he gobbled up every newspaper and book available in the prison library the wall street journal the new york times biographies books about finance politics physics and math all became part of his daily reading the words leaped off the page inspiring him while incarcerated mr flowers wrote and published 11 books including memoirs about his time in prison self help books and four collections of poetry mr howard said that when he first met mr flowers the young convict stood out from the prison crowd intellectually halim has a tremendous amount of firepower but he is a generous caring loving person who i got along with immediately mr howard said if you can t appreciate halim you can t appreciate anyone the former pupil s story also has inspired mr howard s current georgetown students and a duke university law professor whose writings mr flowers addressed in an essay he embodies grace and compassion said mr howard in march mr flowers was released from jail through a new law that allows for review of cases involving people who ve been sentenced as juveniles and served at least 20 years now a free man mr flowers mentors incarcerated youths and pushes for sentencing reform mr trump earlier this year signed into law the most significant criminal justice changes in years known as the first step act the law reduced mandatory minimum sentences and allowed hundreds of thousands of prisoners to be released or have their terms shortened the law is a good start mr flowers said but warned that if america is serious about reducing the incarceration rate the best solutions are economic ones he has become a passionate campaigner for private sector investment in poor communities and equipping prisoners with entrepreneurial skills black people account for 13 of the u s population but only own 7 of the businesses across the country according to 2018 statistics from the u s census bureau in washington where black people are nearly 50 of the population they own only 28 of the city s businesses those statistics need to change if there is to be a meaningful reduction in crime mr flowers said when you drive along new york ave you see these young guys selling water and gatorade in 100 degree weather he said we know they are willing to work we know they have drive ambition and salesmanship they don t have entrepreneur mentorship or investment mr flowers story is proof that others can become business savvy growing up in washington s rough woodland terrace neighborhood with a father who was addicted to crack mr flowers taught himself financial policy while in prison when you live blocks away from the federal reserve international monetary fund and world bank and you don t know what these institutions do and you come from a household where your parents don t have checking or savings accounts these are things that lead to crime he said while incarcerated mr flowers became frustrated with the courses available for example the prison offered agriculture classes in urban washington mr flowers who travels in progressive liberal circles eschews political labels he has pointed criticism for democrats whom he says have done little for the black community just because i m black i wouldn t be a democrat because you look at all the inner cities the black people are suffering socially and economically in those democrat led cities he said so the party has failed us tremendously others in the black community also are becoming disenfranchised with democrats he insists i believe african americans are looking at the parties differently he said a lot of people are seeing their lives really didn t improve through eight years of obama now trump has been in office for nearly four years and i ask people what law did he enact that has deteriorated the quality of your life and they can t he said i can t see any law that he s passed that had a negative impact on me tax reform and opportunity zones to spur private investments in underprivileged communities are among the trump proposals mr flower ticked off as positives his message to the black community in 2020 is to educate themselves about the candidates and how their policies will affect day to day lives i really want african americans to look at the plans all of the candidates are offering in 2020 and not just look at party he said it s not about a party it s about how policies will improve your lives mr flowers said the republicans are missing an opportunity within the black community by not promoting former house speaker paul d ryan of wisconsin paul ryan has what we call in the black community swag he said he reminds me of john kennedy and i think he has the political savvy to get the black vote although he possesses a strong interest in politics mr flowers says he s not ready for that arena he s too busy trying to get his fashion line off the ground working with incarcerated youth and hobnobbing with kim kardashian west people are always going to thumb their nose at people like me he said those who see people who see human beings as deserving of love will continue to work with those who agree with
