across the country in a scheme that authorities said helped fuel the nation s opioid epidemic a jury reached the verdict after deliberating about eight hours in the case against aaron shamo the conviction for running a criminal enterprise carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison he s 29 and his life is over defense attorney greg skordas said top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century shamo s reaction was stoic the lawyer said i don t know if any of this has come to him yet prosecutors said shamo was the kingpin of the ring that peddled fake prescription pills laced with fentanyl a drug that authorities say can be deadly with just a few flakes to thousands of people the government s case offered a glimpse at how fentanyl which has killed tens of thousands of americans during the opioid epidemic can be imported from china pressed into fake pills and sold through online black markets to people in every state authorities say the 2016 bust at shamo s suburban salt lake city ranked among the largest in the country at the time shamo was convicted of 12 counts including drug distribution and money laundering the jury deadlocked and made no finding on a charge that shamo sold the drugs that caused the overdose death of a 21 year old california man the death resulting charge was a very difficult one assistant u s attorney vernon stejskal said ruslan klyuev of daly city also had alcohol and a substance associated with cocaine in his system when he died authorities testified russ made some poor choices he certainly isn t responsible for his death and mr shamo is but it was difficult for the jury to come to that conclusion given all the complicating circumstances the prosecutor said prosecutors didn t file any other charges involving fatal overdoses but said the operation could have been linked to dozens of deaths family members of some of those people were in court the verdict was emotional tova keblish who traveled from long island new york to attend the trial her son gavin keblish died after he had surgery and bought counterfeit fentanyl laced oxycodone she said there s never any closure ever it s going to be something that s part of our lives every

he couldn t have run the operation alone and there wasn t proof he caused any overdoses shamo testified during the trial that he convinced himself that he was helping people who needed the drugs while making money for himself and his friends more than 1 million was found in his dresser according to court documents with the help of a handful of friends shamo bought the powerful opioid fentanyl online from chinese manufacturers pressed it into fake oxycodone pills and sold it on the dark web prosecutors said two friends shamo had met while working at ebay packaged the pills sometimes processing so many that they had to vacuum them off the floor prosecutors said another former co worker sent them out through the u s mail skordas argued that shamo was a college dropout who was naive enough to buy much of the drug making equipment in his own name he started with a partner who set up the pill press to make counterfeit xanax before another friend suggested scaling up to make fake oxycodone and yet another buddy handled most of the manufacturing of the pills authorities said shamo is a follower he s a pleaser he ll do anything these kids tell him to do because he wants to be friends skordas said in his closing argument the trial traced the operation from its start when shamo and his roommate drew crandall started selling their leftover prescription adderall pills online the enterprise expanded to party drugs mushrooms and cocaine before they decided to buy a pill press and start making fake xanax a widely abused anti anxiety drug crandall testified crandall later pleaded guilty to drug distribution and money laundering charges and testified in a deal with prosecutors as did several others who once worked with shamo sales started skyrocketing after shamo got a new partner and at the suggestion of another friend added a new product pills pressed to look like oxycodone but made with fentanyl the pills were sold online through a dark web marketplace called
