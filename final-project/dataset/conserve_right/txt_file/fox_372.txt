that federal rule of criminal procedure 6 e protects thesecrecy of grand jury materials and that the exception allowing the disclosure preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding didn apost apply especially given trump aposs acquittal by the senate in an impeachment trial earlier this year but democrats have argued that preliminary impeachment hearings in the house constitute a pending judicial proceeding they emphasized in their filing with the supreme court onmonday that thed c circuit court of appealsexplicitly agreed with them on that point b ecause that exception
