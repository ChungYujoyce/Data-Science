an unlikely pair of fixers two soviet born business partners from florida documents show lev parnas and igor fruman made hundreds of thousands of dollars in political donations to republicans while facing lawsuits from disgruntled investors over unpaid debts the pair used wire transfers from a company they controlled to make a 325 000 donation to a trump allied political action committee in 2018

may 2018 facebook post showing him and fruman with trump at a dinner in the president s private residence at the white house the big may 2018 donation to american first action was part of a flurry of political spending tied to parnas and fruman with at least 478 000 in donations flowing to gop campaigns and pacs in little more than two months it is not yet clear when the two men first met giuliani president trump s personal attorney but earlier this year according to ukrainian media reports parnas and fruman were spotted in kyiv where they were frequent visitors to then prosecutor general yuri lutsenko who sought to portray himself as an uncompromising fighter against corruption multiple ukrainian media outlets later named parnas and fruman as helping arrange a january meeting in new york between lutsenko and giuliani as well as other meetings with key government officials giuliani s efforts to launch a ukrainian corruption probe into the biden and his son s dealings with a ukrainian energy company a request later echoed by trump in a july 25 call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky are at the heart of a burgeoning congressional impeachment inquiry a whistleblower complaint by an unnamed intelligence official released this week makes reference to associates of giuliani in ukraine who were attempting to make contact with zelensky s team though it s not clear that refers to parnas and fruman that could put the two men squarely in the middle of the investigation into giuliani s activities fruman did not provide comments to ap this week parnas in an interview with the miami herald on thursday called the impeachment inquiry a soap opera and defended trump he said the ukrainian government has access to information on alleged wrongdoing by the bidens but that the u s government proved indifferent to receiving it through official channels thanks to his friendship with giuliani parnas said he and fruman became the best people to get it into the trump administration s hands i got certain information and i thought it was my duty to hand it over parnas told the herald adding that the former new york city mayor was his lawyer as well as a friend there has been no evidence yet made public that either the former vice president or his son violated the law parnas 47 came to u s from russia as a young child while fruman 53 made his way to miami from belarus following the fall of the iron curtain corporate filings and court records show several lawsuits involving the men including detailed allegations of fraud against parnas that led to

supporting trump s re election shortly after it was first disclosed last year the may 2018 donation among the largest the committee received that quarter was reported to have been made by global energy producers lcc other campaign finance disclosures list parnas as the ceo of the company and fruman as president but there is little public evidence that global energy producers was ever a thriving enterprise that could generate the income to account for its outsized political giving the company has no listed office address or phone number no announced deals or contracts and a bare bones one page website that features only a countdown clock that long ago ticked down to zeros details of the source of the funds only emerged earlier this year as part of a long running unrelated lawsuit involving the estate of a navy veteran from new york who accused parnas of defrauding him out of nearly half a million dollars in loans and investments in a hollywood movie project that turned out to be a mirage those records and deed filings in florida reviewed by the associated press show the money for the 325 000 donation to the trump pac on may 17 2018 came from the same corporate entity that two days earlier received the proceeds from a 3 million private mortgage that loan was secured by a luxury high rise condo unit in north miami beach owned by a separate corporation tied to fruman more than half of the proceeds from the 3 million loan appear to have been used to pay off a prior bank mortgage on fruman s condo with the remaining 1 2 million wired from a miami lawyer s

political donations the funds for which originated from unknown sources the center last summer amended its complaint to include the wire transfers showing the movement of the funds from aaron investments i to the trump allied pac under federal elections law political donations must be attributed to the person or entity actually providing the money as a way to avoid straw donations that the source of the donation was not the same corporation as the one listed on the pac s federal disclosure report global energy producers is a potential violation of campaign finance law as a result of this secrecy scheme the public didn t know that trump was backed by shady characters with questionable connections and a trail of failed ventures said brendan fischer an attorney who is the director
