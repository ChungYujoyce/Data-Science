 sign in stakes high for gaffe prone vice president manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong with president obama looking to an unpredictable and gaffe prone joseph r biden to get his campaign back on track in thursday s debate the pressure on the vice president couldn t be greater vice presidential match ups usually don t have the power to change the course of the election but this year could be different mr biden is acutely aware that mr obama s dismal performance in his first faceoff with republican rival mitt romney largely erased mr obama s lead in several key battleground states ratcheting up the stakes for his performance thursday night at centre college in danville ky as mr obama s no 2 mr biden doesn t have the burden of looking presidential so can bare some teeth and punch hard against rep paul ryan of wisconsin mr romney s running mate but getting too loose and looking angry against mr ryan a budget expert 27 years his junior could easily backfire on the vice president leading him to veer off script and reminding viewers of sen john mccain s grumpy 2008 debate performance against mr obama who remained calm and collected top stories postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud gall and nerve val demings rips trump for trying to capitalize on biden you ain t black comment you are not going to die from covid 19 with this in mind mr biden has been assiduously preparing for his prime time clash with mr ryan holed up for much of the week in a hotel in wilmington del the vice president has been scrutinizing videos of mr ryan s speeches and interviews and holding mock debates against rep chris van hollen maryland democrat who is playing mr ryan in debate preparation as well as david axelrod a senior adviser in the obama campaign mr biden s frequent gaffes on the campaign trail have given republicans plenty of campaign fodder but the vice president seemed keenly focused on trying to keep his tongue in check thursday i don t want to say anything in the debate that s not completely accurate he told reporters late last week though mr biden has created a few headaches for mr obama throughout the election mr biden is a seasoned debate veteran who has run for president twice and delivered a strong performance against then alaska gov sarah palin in 2008 relatively untested mr ryan is more of a blank slate his aides say he has participated in a debate only once when he first ran for congress 14 years ago mr ryan also has been hunkered down in debate preparation over the past week spending days at a resort in the blue ridge mountains 150 miles southwest of washington where he was joined by former solicitor general ted olson who played the role of mr biden in mock debates four years ago mr biden approached the debate against mrs palin cautiously careful not to get too rough with the newcomer to the national stage but after mr obama s lethargic showing last week mr biden is expected to come out swinging i expect the vice president to come at me like a cannonball mr ryan told reporters earlier this week he ll be in full attack mode and i don t think he ll let any inconvenient facts get in his way if what mr biden has been saying on the campaign trail is any indication he will likely try to force mr ryan to defend mr romney s proposals on taxes and spending and seize any opportunity to tie mr romney to mr ryan s medicare plan which includes caps on future spending and a plan to partially privatize it just last week mr biden and mr ryan sparred over the democrats desire to let the bush era tax rates for households making 250 000 and up expire at the end of the year even though the call for a tax hike on top earners wasn t new mr biden s blunt language admitting that he and mr obama want a 1 trillion tax increase gave mr ryan an opportunity to go on the attack campaigning in council bluffs iowa mr biden said mr romney and other republicans often say obama and biden want to raise taxes by a trillion dollars guess what yes we do in one regard we want to let that trillion dollar tax cut expire so the middle class doesn t have to bear the burden of all that money going to the super wealthy that s not a tax raise that s called fairness where i come from mr ryan pounced on the quote at a campaign stop in virginia last thursday what we don t need is a trillion dollar tax increase he said what we don t need is a tax increase on our successful job creators that will cost us 700 000 jobs in just two years when mr romney picked mr ryan medicare became a major issue in the campaign and mr biden is likely to do everything he can to score points on the topic during the debate polls have given mr obama the edge when it comes to handling medicare the most recent cnn survey had mr obama leading romney ryan on medicare 53 percent to 44 percent and abc news had mr obama up 4 points on the issue in early september while campaigning in mr ryan s home state of wisconsin mr biden said the romney ryan ticket would turn medicare into voucher care we are for medicare they are for voucher care he said it s basic but mr ryan has not tried to run away from the medicare issue memorably joined by his 78 year old mother betty douglas when he delivered a speech on medicare reform in the villages fla a large retirement community in mid september during the address he accused mr obama of siphoning off hundreds of billions of dollars from medicare to pay for his 2010 health care overhaul medicare should not be a piggy bank for obamacare he said reassuring seniors that he is committed to protecting the medicare guarantee for current seniors and for generations to come it s a line mr romney used repeatedly during last week s debate against mr obama pointing out that mr obama is responsible for shifting 716 billion out of medicare to pay for his health care law but after the debate democrats said mr ryan protected those cuts in his budget and fact checkers have deemed the charge that mr obama robbed medicare of the amount as mostly false a point mr biden will undoubtedly try to hammer home thursday night copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view comments click to hide terms of use privacy policy
