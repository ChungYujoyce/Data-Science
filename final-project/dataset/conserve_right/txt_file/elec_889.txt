 mike pence won it wasn t especially close in my book a few thoughts 1 kaine was peevish and annoying with his incessant interruptions to which pence responded calmly occasionally evincing forcefulness atother times appearing amused donald trump s running mate also made a point of highlighting kaine s painfully rehearsed lines mocking them gently andnot so gently each time on style this was a clock cleaning 2 on policy substance pence was fluid and prepared kaine was also familiar with his briefing book it appeared as though kaine was instructed to raise anti trump attack lines and talking points at every single opportunity if that was his goal mission accomplished others havemade these observations but i ll amplify them kaine did not seem interested in winning this debate he seemed interested in emptying his rhetorical clip of opposition research on the man at the top of his counterpart s ticket and pence declined repeatedly to answer specific charges and challenges about things trump has done and said he made a choice not to defend the indefensible these dynamics were sore thumb obvious a fair question some haveasked was pence so polished informed relaxed and smooth that he only accentuated the reality that trump is none of those things 3 while kaine was constantly on offense against trump occasionally defending mrs clinton with brief talking points pence picked his spots he prosecuted a tough case against the clinton foundation s foreign donations he raised her email scandal on multiple occasions including in the context of cyber security where trump whiffed last week and over and over again he would not let kaine get away with the ridiculous claim that the iran deal ended that anti american regime s nuclear program it does nothing of the sort and effectively guarantees that iran will be a threshold nuclear state when the agreement s restrictions automatically expire even president obama has more or lessadmitted as much kaine kept advancing a mischaracterization and pence kept calling him on it the indiana governor s decision to go criticize hillary clinton s extreme views on abortion was also a great move especially since he underscored kaine s politically motivatedreversals on those questions causing the virginia senator to squirm in his seat 4 the moderator was pilloried by viewers online throughout the evening and i agree that she seemed inclined to cut pence off as he was getting into the meat of clinton s various scandals but in her defense she repeatedly called kaine out for interrupting and asked pointed substantive questions of both candidates including two queries pertaining to the national debt and entitlements maybe i m an outlier here but i thought she was fine overall even if she didn t pick her enforcement spots perfectly 5 i m not sure any of this matters this election is the trump and clinton show and while pence was effective at prosecuting a tough case against the democratic nominee and sometimes painfully side stepping challenges about trump s long rap sheet of statements kaine remained relentlessly on message as an attack dog that may have frustrated and turned off many viewers but negativity works if donald trump wants to reverse theself inflicted negative momentum he s experiencing in this race he s going to have to do so himself on sunday pence passed this test with flying colors but he s not the man in the spotlight the hoosier state republican did everything he could to help his ticket and he may have created a favorable and stabilizing impression but the undercard debate cannot and will not be decisive i ll leave you with this decisive who won tonight s vice presidential debate 22 say mike pence 4 say tim kaine vpdebate and closer but a win cnn poll debate watchers48 pence42 kaine alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
