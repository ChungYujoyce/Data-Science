working with a republican majority in both houses of congress congreff from a libertarian perspective there are some grounds for cautious optimism but there are more reasons to be deeply worried by all this trump sounded distinctly authoritarian notes during the campaign and he s no fan of free speech free trade and anything remotely resembling open borders on foreign policy he s bounced back and forth from straightforward denunciations of 21st century interventions into the middle east and north africa as terrible and bragging that he d bomb the shit out of isis which trump will show up on january 20 who knows his tax plan would make national debt massively bigger and he s hardly a fiscal hawk either his daughter is already making calls to push a taxpayer funded maternity leave program and his infrastructure plans vague as they are have boondoggle written all over them so who is going to stand up to him the dems are a sorry lot as a group whether they backed bernie or were with hillary they put up no serious resistance to foreign policy disasters under george w bush and barack obama and few of them gave a shit about civil liberties too busy pushing for higher national minimum wages during a crap economy and lobbying for student loan relief for the relatively small number of in debt brats of a middle class too dumb or insecure to send their kids to relatively inexpensive state schools i guess and the republicans come on beta dogs such as paul ryan and mitch mcconnell are already cowed by the donald and puckered lower lip how many sad sacks in congress were like utah s jason chaffetz who cried never trump for like 15 minutes before tweeting on october 26 i will not defend or endorse realdonaldtrump but i am voting for him most republicans bless their pointed little heads just want to roll with a winner they like being good little boys and less often girls they ll go along with much of what trump wants especially if when it comes to muslim bashing and bombing baiting immigrants and taking it to those rapist mexicans who stopped coming here around 2007 because their own country is a better place for them given what america has become lord knows that the last time the party of lincoln ran the white house and congress things went off the rails like a crazy train at least when it comes to the size scope and spending of the federal government each of those things grew exponentially and here we are with nothing to show for that binge other than a debt hangover the size of mt rushmore with that as a backdrop here s some good news via politico libertarians emerging as trump resistance katie glueck points specifically to sen rand paul and rep justin amash in her piece among other elected officials but gives props to the larger liberty movement as well that s groups such as reason cato the campaign for liberty which grew out of ron paul s presidential aspirations and more one of the reasons why such groups are in a good place is because they we put principles before politics the gop doesn t exist to do anything particular as much as it exists to fill seats in congress and elsewhere libertarians who disagree even on who should be considered libertarian agree that politics and policy is too important to be left to the folks elected to congress and the white house consider amash first he never endorsed trump and he s not about to put up with demagoguery nobody should burn the american flag but our constitution secures our right to do so no president is allowed to burn the first amendment https t co nvkq6wcbhv justin amash justinamash november 29 2016 when trump started bleating about slapping 35 percent tariffs on goods produced by companies who outsourced jobs amash responded this would be a 35 tax on all americans a tax that especially hurts low income families maybe the slogan should be makeamericavenezuela here s a blast from rand paul about trump s flirtation with naming former u n amb john bolton to a big job at the state department my efforts to insert myself into the public debate are not to oppose donald trump they re to support what donald trump said in the campaign paul said speaking at a time when bolton was under more serious consideration to lead the state department though paul has reiterated his opposition to bolton in any role since then regime change made us less safe and the iraq war allowed for chaos i agree on those things trump said i would just hate for at the very beginning that those things he professed on the campaign trail to be diminished or besmirched by having someone in charge of the state department who doesn t agree with donald trump paul endorsed trump and voted for him but like amash paul is drawing lines in the sand about what he will or won t support in an interview earlier this week paul told me that he could never support diplomats or appointees who had failed to learn the lessons of the iraq war the libyan intervention and what s unfolding in syria now the key insight he said was that regime change almost always leads to something worse than what we had he also stressed that he will refuse to vote for any budget plan that never achieves balance which the current republican budget blueprint fails to do pretty specatacularly this is what real resistance looks like fighting members of your own team when they stray from the principles they claim to support and on which they were elected i don t agree with amash and paul on everything maybe not even most things but i know that i m happy as hell to see these guys brawling not with a bunch of loser democrats over phony issues but with their own kind over very important issues and especially basic principles about the role and limits of government that will take us a whole lot closer to limited government than the sort of resistance that keith olbermann is putting up in short video clips at gq com arguably the last step before the gutter for a guy who bounced from espn to

images hd well i sure as hell hope that paul and amash are on trump watch the first thing i d like to see them do is block sessions what you want christie or giuliani as usag every president s ag sucks but at least sessions is strong on 10a i m willing to bet that any bi partisan coalition empowered and able to reject sessions for consideration would apply the same standard to those two as well just a hunch no i want paul or amash you sill ninny not a drug warrior dinosaur and for the record i think sessions will be confirmed in fact i think nearly all of trump s appointments will breeze through i think he decided to troll the left as hard as possible but would be forced to comprise on his nominees in most instances but i think he underestimated the right s willingness to say fuck all and push through anybody he wants which hopefully creates a lot of libertarian leaning policy changes intentionally set forth or not lord knows that the last time the party of lincoln ran the white house and congress things went off the rails like a crazy train at least when it comes to the size scope and spending of the federal government each of those things grew exponentially and here we are with nothing to show for that binge other than a debt hangover the size of mt rushmore the squirrels keep saving my quotes and eating my responses it s weird anyway blah blah blah don t ignore the tea party they only now vanquished the establishment republicans from the speaker s chair they arose in response to all that you re probably neglecting to close a tag tips to avoid squirrel attack

take your nuts and by neglecting to close a tag i mean blockquote you quoted something here blockquote leaving an off at the end there eats everything else you type by neglecting to close a tag i mean using a malformed tag the euphemisms around here keep getting more obscure i m actually sort of ok with trump at this point besides his retarded sessions pick and making bolton anything above whitehouse basement janitor meh i kind of like bolton at the un just because it is such a pointless position and he would spend all his time there reminding everybody of that really all he would really have to do is occasionally veto israel is worse than satan resolution 3 269 976 and his job is 99 done you nailed it sir i am so glad guliani and bolton didn t get the pick and like you said bolton wouldn t be able to do any damage at the un and might actually help stick a wrench in their already unproductive gears doe will implode with rick perry at the helm maybe that s a good thing doe will implode with rick perry at the helm maybe that s a good thing good for once the doe will produce some energy why inflict bolton on the janitorial staff omg that s too good for words keep up the sarcasm it s right on the money he recently appointed a pro trade libertarian to head the cea which is great and a millenarian jew who makes netanyahu look like a pacifist to be ambassador or something to israel which isn t good he s all over the place at this point best bet is he is drawing his appointees out of a hat we have a roulette wheel for a president always bet on black president 45 always loved that movie i ll place all my money on red as in our budget will go further into the red big gov gop is coming back see the massive expansion of 2002 2007 and obama s record low since eisenhower spending increases will be completely forgotten by the libertarian trumptards commentors here obama s record low since eisenhower spending increases bloop boink blop derp the republicans promise less intrusive less expensive government but will they deliver in the past they have said they would shrink the state but then they came into power and spent more consider george w bush s eight horrendous years the budget grew 89 percent from 1 86 trillion to 3 52 trillion john stossel https reason com archives 201 cut gover we will come in just under 4 trillion this fy so i know you re a math dumbass but try this time just once so i know you re a math dumbass but try this time just once a mathematician could count out enough coins to pay bets that they lost what i love is that nearly a trillion fucking dollars was added to the last fiscal year of bush s term by obama double benefit massive crony spending which the asshole dems baked into the budget with continuing resolutoins and obama could blame bush for blowing the budget and shitheads like you just lap this shit up bullshit the cbo put spending at 3 52 trillion before bush left office turd the slimebag who never posted a stat which wasn t cherry picked for starting or ending date is stossel a shithead democrat the problem is you bush defenders are so tied in with the gop you reflexively defend them gop s gonna nominate jeb and he s gonna lose to hil dog party of stoooopid fuck you betty now that made me laugh it would make me laugh if it were the first time i d heard that stupid cherry picked statistic if obama was such a frugal spending prez then how did our national debt go from single digit trillions to 19 trillion and change in 8 years could it be that he only lowered spending when compared to a 1 time binge of tarp in 08 which was paid back anyways but i still don t support it because it introduced more moral hazard into an already corrupt banking system fact is that obama will have added a lot more to the national debt than even bush did in his 8 years explain that to me please rand paul and justin amash are changing gillespie s shit in pants maybe they could even toilet train him there is far too little rational criticism of trump it is good to see some these are just the guys to do it agree 100 gillespie giving em both barrels i respect him for giving it hard to both parties he is the face of reason in so many ways and clearly the guy who has to take the shit from both parties and their pundits when they turn to recognize reason and then subsequently attack it if we keep calling it a libertarian moment someday we will be right olbermann in that picture looks like he just got pulled out of someone s basement sex dungeon by the police and is waiting to be taken to the hospital ha i was thinking something along those lines i don t get the look he has going it looks something along the lines of a trump presidency means all people of good will need to cower in fear now is the time for olbermann to come to the aid of his party i ve never wanted to burn a flag until seeing that picture thanks for commenting on the picture i didn t know who that was and thought it was a stock photo out of the creepy patriotic moron selections ugh this is almost entirely wrong headed it matters not who leads the resistance to trump the democrats the left the msm and academia have that covered the real issue and opportunity is whether libertarians can stop being purists learn from how the fabians advanced socialism and lead trump in a libertarian direction where they can he s a businessman and not an ideologue he wants to do things that work ideally cheaply work with that libertarians have lots to offer there advance a libertarian flavored replacement for obamacare that unleashes market forces push for cutting corporate tax rates and regulations cut bureaucracy there s lots in trump s position papers that libertarians should like concentrate on getting in front of those and making them happen and less on whining and resistance trump didn t run on anything remotely libertarian he stood for 1 building that wall 2 rounding up and deporting the wets 3 banning muslims he never mentioned one single regulation he would cut he supports government run health care how is that sf weed must be good is someone speaking welch your google skills are astounding there s nothing here that s remotely libertarian regulations taxes second amendment health care he never mentioned one single regulation he would cut cutting one single regulation wouldn t be very libertarian either it s hard to imagine getting agency heads under any other republican who actively advocated abolishing said agencies now maybe they go full retard when in office after they get drunk on the power or something but that s a pretty positive sign to me they haven t all been positives but there are definite trends indicating we can get smaller government here mindlessly touting how you are going to resist trump is stupid pick spots to resist and do so intelligently paul and amash do have a lot of power now on that front if they stick together but you aren t going to get shit if you just try and take some hardline anti trump position this is very much overly optimistic trump isn t a pragmatist he s a people pleaser he s not making realistic compromises he s trying to go in six different directions at once because he s made so many opposing promises during his campaign to try to win voters on both sides of every argument sooner or later everyone s going to have to accept that he may well pursue a virulently anti trade big deficit spending foreign policy interventionist agenda at best hes a coin flip or a dice roll in short he may actually turn out to be a giant douche he might but being a people pleaser is to a great degree being a pragmatist he wants to do well for the country and make citizens happy that s not a bad thing it s far superior to the hillary obama attitude of taking things away from us for our own good and of dragging the deplorables into the wonderful progressive future and since i think libertarian solutions can work i think he d be amenable to some so i think it would do reason well to think positive and try to make lemonade from these lemons i think that s basically the attitude reason took often with obama and most of us didn t like it i d rather they take the skeptical position i think politicians are less dangerous when they know their every move is being scrutinized by journalists doubt he reads reason though as opposed to minimizing or rationalizing that the other guy would ve been worse histrionically declaring him the end of the world and rallying to his side because he s not the other guy or girl aren t the only options one can also choose to be calmly but rationally critical skeptical of him that in fact seems like the logical position for a libertarian he s a businessman and not an ideologue he wants to do things that work ideally cheaply trump is a rich kid who wants to put his name on yuge expensive projects built with other people s money there is nothing libertarian about trump if libertarians hitch their wagons to trump they will go over the cliff with him trump is a baby boomber continuation of the obama era bigger government bigger debts loss of freedoms and opportunities the last stages of the bankrupt welfare state the system will inevitably collapse trump republicans conservatives and libertarians will be blamed for the mess caused by big government central planning trump s successor will be a millennial socialist unless the liberty movement develops a viable alternative not likely to happen if most libertarians waste their time and credibility on trump i won t believe trump will do any of the things he talked about until he does them they put up no serious resistance to foreign policy disasters under george w bush and barack obama iraq libya exactly alike well except for 2 trillion and 4500 dead us soldiers in iraq but other than that detail exactly alike we are two obumbles terms out from bush are we going to have to listen to you whine about bush until the end of time i have even slacked off on giving shit to the jug eared moron in the white house surely you can finally let go of blaming the weather on bush bush made him welsh on the bet man fucking bush everywhere it s like 70s porn look let me explain something to you when you group items together there has to be some equivalence if i am talking about nfl qbs and i want to name some great ones i don t use tom brady and brock osweiler it s stupid i think even you can understand this analogy putting iraq and libya together as foreign relations debacles by a us president is likewise stupid libya cost us a few rounds of munitions nothing else of course you wouldn t use brady as a great qb because you re stupider than boiled eggplant 1 goat military losses on the coalition side 22 march one usaf f 15e flying from aviano crashed in bu marim northwest of benghazi the pilot was rescued alive by us marines from the 26th marine expeditionary unit based on the uss kearsarge the weapons systems officer evaded hostile forces and was subsequently repatriated by undisclosed forces 201 202 the aircraft crashed due to a mechanical failure 203 the rescue operation involved two bell boeing v 22 osprey aircraft two sikorsky ch 53 sea stallion helicopters and two mcdonnell douglas av 8b harrier ii aircraft all launched from the uss kearsarge 204 the operation involved the harriers dropping 227 kg 500 lb bombs and strafing the area around the crash site before an osprey recovered at least one of the downed aircraft s crew 204 205 injuring six local civilians in the process 206 207 21 june an unmanned us navy mq 8 fire scout went down over libya possibly due to enemy fire 9 nato confirmed that they lost radar contact with the unmanned helicopter as it was performing an intelligence and reconnaissance mission near zliten 9 nato began investigating the crash shortly after it occurred 9 on 5 august it was announced that the investigation had concluded that the cause of the crash was probably enemy fire with operator or mechanical failure ruled out and the inability of investigators to access the crash site the logical conclusion was that the aircraft had been shot down 209 just counting unit costs the f 15e was 31 million dollars and the mq 8 was 14 and a half million dollars 35 million i have read that libya cost the us about 300 million but iraq cost over 2 trillion again false equivalence obama s foreign policy of don t do stupid shit is about as libertarian as any potus since coolidge you re shucking and jiving around the point you made the unqualified claim that libya cost us a few rounds of munitions nothing else i proved your claim false with indisputable empirical data you were rhetorically sodomized boy just accept what happened you d have better luck getting him to pay a bet hm the reason that deadbeat junkie snorts so much coke is that it makes the pain of what happened to him go away i believe his point was that your claim that it only cost a few rounds of munitions was hyperbolic bullshit more eloquently but perhaps less entertainingly put 35 million is nothing a low low cost pity the pedant you are 35 million is nothing a low low cost pity the pedant you are and yet the relative value of 35 million dollars wasn t the point here you made a claim that was false i showed that it was false you now look like an enormous ass speaking of asses this is a depiction of what is happening to you in this argument 35 million is nothing a low low cost pity the pedant you are and yet the relative value of 35 million dollars wasn t the point here you made a claim that was false i showed that it was false you now look like an enormous ass speaking of asses this is a depiction of what is happening to you in this argument now snort some more coke to ease the pain you junkie piece of shit damn the squirrels wanted to make it some gang bang shit you re fucked bro you now look like an enormous ass so no difference jcr palin s buttplug 12 16 16 6 48pm look let me explain something to you lying misdirection obfuscation a primer by turd we also would have accepted oh this should be good shreekie s freaking out man he s freaking out shit those pants shreek maybe it s a good sign if he got over trump winning and is back to his own self maybe the bulk of the proggie herd will follow soon maybe the bulk of the proggie herd will follow soon yes i see exactly where he said iraq and libya were exactly alike tell me what s it like being this dishonest i fail to see why you think that turning a region into a hotbed of terrorist activity is any sort of thing to be celebrated as an achievement yes we managed to get a failed state without deploying troops and for less money but you re acting as though the costs of libya have finished being counted what happens when the terrorist groups that are now competing to run that country manage to pull off a major attack against the west you don t think there will be money and lives spent then it is a clear example of false equivalence see my other example if i am talking about nfl qbs and i want to name some great ones i don t use tom brady and brock osweiler both brady and osweiler are nfl quarterbacks but both are not great nfl quarterbacks the two things are not the same both iraq and libya are foreign policy disasters the fact that one is greater for now in monetary and manpower costs than the other does not change that both are disasters it is not at all a false equivalence maybe you should look up the definitions of the terms that you are using libya was not a foreign policy disaster it was a nato success story a low cost support effort for the people of libya against a tyrant too bad iraq could not have cost so little and had nato behind it libya was not a foreign policy disaster ranking contender for unintentional understatement of the year pls die kthx libya is now a failed state and a hotbed of terrorist activity that has produced a horde of migrants fleeing the country in addition to countless numbers of civilian casualties the region is now totally destabilized and isis al qaeda elements are flourishing they tyrant has now been replaced by a cadre of warlords many of whom are actively hostile to the united states and its allies which ghaddafi was not even obama has admitted that it was a terrible idea calling it the worst mistake of his presidency and for obama to admit something was a bad idea is saying something the only ones still cheerleading it are you and hillary clinton at least she has the excuse that she was running for president and couldn t admit failure it was a nato success story because it was the policy of nato to overthrow qaddaffi especially after he voluntarily gave up his nuke program you really do push the limits of peak derp on a regular basis you probably have hillary pin ups on the wall begins barfing uncontrollably 500 dollar gold libya was as much of a nato success story as iraq was a successful case of nation building you re such an asshole a man of so lacking in imagination where facts are concerned it s mind boggling the unintended consequences in libya egypt and syria have been no less catastrophic with hundreds of thousands dead never mind the displacement of millions who ended up flooding southern italy and greece most of the time when people talk of the failures and stupidity of intervention they do so with the lives of both american soldiers and civilians injured or killed yet here you are considering but one side of the equation and claim one iraq is worse than the other libya that makes you a partisan buffoon incapable of realizing the fact where the last 16 years are concerned it s not red or blue but rather purple obama hillary just packaged their lust for war differently and people like you eat it up some classical liberal you are http fpif org adding costs h tons wars the unintended consequences in libya egypt and syria have been no less catastrophic with hundreds of thousands dead never mind the displacement of millions who ended up flooding southern italy and greece one of the people i work with is from italy she despises the progtard freakout she said she would never have voted for trump but is seething at hillary over libya because she sees it as a straight line to the growing political instability there it s none of our business we should let the middle east implode like it wants to why you are on a libertarian board is beyond explanation you can t legitimately call it let the middle east implode when we re the ones doing the plurality of middle east exploding letting it implode is a good principle help overthrow gaddafi is not a good implementation of that principle the west is playing its part in that implosion yes the middle east has been a basket case and mired in a dark age for decades if not centuries where the arabs are concerned but never discount our role in that however small in the bigger scheme of things you re the last person to speak of libertarian street cred the absolute last as more than a few people were saying throughout this election cycle the left has nothing to offer libertarians glad you re coming around to that libertarian gop vs conservative gop is the only area seeing any action there is nothing remotely libertarian about conservatism i know you conservatives deny that fact though then why when polled on most issues do self described conservatives on avg give answers that are much more libertarian than the avg person s answers it depends on how the answers are weighted i am a supporter of the aclu and its constant defense of the bill of rights and others oppressed by the government and police state conservatives tend to despise the aclu and polls show how unpopular the aclu is with the authoritarian loving gop explain that the aclu selectively supports the bill of rights tough luck trying to getting them to defend the 2nd amendment and half the clauses in the 1st more bullshit the aclu has defended the 2a many times but since the largest lobbyist in the country exclusively defends it the aclu directs its money to the rest of the bor what the hell are you talking about they say clearly on their website that they believe that gun rights does not pertain to individuals they oppose the citizens united ruling and they re against rfra after they supported it of course i have no patience for sellout libertarians like you reason has covered a number of cases here is one https reason com blog 2007 04 gun rights that s the aclu of texas not the national group the national group is quite clear that they believe gun ownership is not a personal right the aclu s official position is that the second amendment guarantees a collective not individual right to own guns also the nra is far from the largest lobbyist in the country it has far fewer members 5 million than the aarp well over 35 million in terms of expenditures it lags behind the chamber of commerce by orders of magnitude the nra in 2015 spent a little over three million dollars on lobbying activities the coc in the same year spent 85 million dollars the second place finisher was the national association of realtors at 38 million you really should try harder or at least stick to claims that aren t so easily revealed as total bullshit buttplug comes from the collectivist end of the libertarian spectrum so his take on the aclu defending the 2a is actually ok for him but even then he only comes alone and sitting in front of his computer don t you just love it when a plan comes together one can only imagine after i ve destroyed and humiliated shreek over the years that he only returns here because he s some sort of masochist would you like some more shreek i m sorry you re so delusional oh well keep battling them demons meanwhile i ll continue to fly the libertarian colors maybe you should try finding out what colors those are before attempting to fly them nazi collaborator who are these nazis with which i m collaborating and what do the voices in your head think of them you think colors are the obstacle here there s pulleys and all sorts of physics involved beyond hopeless you re right he ll probably end up hanging himself trying to hoist the thing if you can t agree with amash on most things how can you really be a libertarian we all know bill weld is the gold standard i think some reason writers are desperately trying to rebrand libertarians as progs who like guns rather than republicans who like pot toward that end any good thing said of a republucan must be done in the manner of basically treating said republican like a good german there will be plenty of time and i imagine plenty of reasons to oppose trump but it seems that nick is falling for the same act the mainstream media is take what trump says literally and then let him make you look like a fool when what he does is something different altogether you might be right it is a sad statement on us as a nation when we elect a reality tv star who is knowingly either full of shit or deliberately lying he might do anything next year but he is off to a sorry ass fucking start based on his cabinet choices it was also a sad statement when we elected a one term senator with essentially no other experience or qualifications other than a degree from harvard demographic appeal and sounding good reading off a teleprompter who also was either full of shit or deliberately lying hey here s a hint politicians pretty much all of them are full of shit or deliberately lying clinton was too but i guess it makes you feel better that she rose to prominence on the coattails of her husband and was a lousy senator and secretary of state rather than a success as a television personality what his education and energy picks are yuge and he consulted with judge napolitano on his supreme court pick yesterday at trump tower so far only sessions seems problematic rick w perry is an idiot ben carson admitted he is unqualified for any dept head his sec of state is a russia firster and enabler so that exxon will maintain access to oil reserves for starters the trump team is inept and it is not just sessions should you be commenting on vox he probably lost a bet there too compelling analysis truly um if you re a libertarian who wants smaller government why would you want smart people running agencies that likely shouldn t exist who can more effectively use them to bludgeon you it s like complaining that the guy shooting at you has such bad aim feeed meeeee hells no rogue one a star wars story is the political and religious parable we need right now granted it helps that this band of mavericks are portrayed by an enormously talented troupe of actors who as mentioned are indeed super diverse as one of my theater companions excitedly whispered early on in the film there s not a single white american man on screen right now rogue one centers on the story of jyn erso a rebel without a cause who eventually finds one aptly performed by felicity jones well i still want to see darth vader slice and dice probably will see it was there a white european man because that seems like a very specific denial after the last four disappointments i ll probably wait for it to hit cable unless there s some overwhelmingly positive reactions from the non sjw crowd keep hearing mixed things it s probably okay because of the production quality but at the same time whenever a studio forces a production into reshoots that s always a bad sign disney is just going to milk the franchise for all the money they possibly can by playing it safe and never taking any risks whatsoever with the star wars property that just rubs me the wrong way and turns me off to it all there s not a single white american man on screen right now to be fair that s what i like to see in my pornography as well jus sayin white american man i assume they re referring to the actors because you know galaxy far far away and stuff immersing yourself in the narrative and all that or you could just spend the whole movie making mental notes based on your narrow minded racial and socioeconomic worldview and patting yourself on the back for it also literally every death star scene in the first movie till millennium falcon lands on it passes that test now white english men fuckin imperialists it s probably just me but it seem the definition of white is getting more restrictive to my eyes i thought there were plenty of white people in rogue one is there a color chart for reference do you have to have blue green gray eye color if you have a hispanic name you can t be white how does this work it s all very confusing as one of my theater companions excitedly whispered early on in the film there s not a single white american man on screen right now it is hard to fathom how these people can be such naked racists and be unaware of it i like to point it out just replace it with irish did the companion realize the same during mad max or tinker tailor soldier spy also if the robot character was in that scene it s only half correct alan tudyk would have been there as they were shooting but his white americanness was erased by the multicultural hegemon as one of my theater companions excitedly whispered early on in the film there s not a single white american man on screen right now plot who needs that shit just so long as the cast is appropriately diverse those people are insane i didn t vote for trump for some of the reasons nick brings up his personality looks like it may lend itself to abusing executive power what he was saying about trade could bring about the greatest depression and last time the repubs controlled everything the budget exploded and they passed the anti free speech campaign finance reform what trump does could be the opposite at this point who knows from what i ve observed that s exactly the way trump likes it here s some good news via politico libertarians emerging as trump resistance noted last night that piece mentions one specific gripe rand paul s opposition to the appointment of bolton to state and also that libertarians would generally oppose any tariffs tho there s nothing specific to oppose quite yet and then lists about a dozen things libertarians are thrilled about several libertarian leaders noted there s been much for libertarians to cheer about as well from high hopes for scaled back regulations to strong selections in their view for appointments to lead departments like the environmental protection agency and health and human services people have some concerns but for the most part i think are pretty positive with the big picture outlook with regard to lower taxes less regulation said brian darling a former top senate aide to paul so i think you ll see the liberty movement moving forward being critical at times but being very supportive on big issues like repealing obamacare regulation reform tax reform in short the actual story doesn t quite live up to the claims of the headline if there s opposition its because libertarians are perpetually in that role its nothing new nor anything specific to trump by contrast the potential gains for liberty under trump seem many it would seem the smart play would be to encourage the good also encourage the good doesn t mean don t fight the bad it means look for opportunities for real gains and push them i think the mistake would be to celebrate opposition for its own sake a posture libertarians have been in forever by default they want to goad paul to break with party as much as possible and resist trump they ll cheer that on when they can get it and then instantly turn on him when it s convenient once again sort of like what they ve done since he was first elected these are the same people who ignored him on hillary s orders when the primaries were starting true and thankfully true mind you trump is an abysmal person and threarens to be an abysmal president but he s also a narcissistic vindictive child if paul an amash play the anti trump resistance it ll be a nice little symbolic protest but they ll just be on the outside looking in and the rest of the gop isn t likely to follow them so it s akin to resigning in protest paul is doing the right thing play his friend flatter him convince him that the time he agreed with you was his real position bend him in the right direction he seems susceptible to it the fact that elected republicans with a libertarian bent are the primary check on trump really highlights why the johnson and reason strategy of continually pandering to the left makes zero sense they re all statists not a single one challenged president obama s drone wars attacks on religious freedom or expanded executive authority you have to admit that the democrat lite strategy is an epic failure i m sorry but rothbard s and paul won this argument not koch and johnson not a single one challenged president obama s drone wars or the conventional kind find me a single editorial bemoaning the us refueling of saudi bombers over yemen koch and johnson wyden doesn t count he s not a reliable libertarian by any mean but he was involved if fighting the nsa bullshit arguably earlier than paul was wyden is a good point he did join rand for a little bit in his drone filibuster ok 1 this works on so many levels mmmm t 34s kv 1 ppsh su 100 please rise for the new and improved russian national anthem https www youtube com watch v kx kj2wwwqq serious talk i have no idea why they kept the soviet anthem instead of going back to the original if it was a bit slow tchaikovsky gave them a perfect arrangement and they could bring out the cannon for special occasions hmmm that sounds like something a kgb infiltrator would say without question what we need is more t 34s t 34 the honda odyssey of tank design say what you will about the tenets of national socialism they build sexy tanks my heart belongs to russian military hardware designs the t 55 t 72 zis 3 ak and rpk mig 21 and 29 the mi 24 only german tank design i like esthetically is the czech t 35 38 and the gloriously ugly hetzer built on its chassis oh and stug iii i find the cromwell tank to be the most profoundly ugly pan zagloba confirmed as red alert vehicle driver oh god don t get me started on british tank designs of ww2 and their hatred for the concept of aesthetics the matilda the a cruiser series crusader excepted the churchill gaaaaah their post war stuff starting with the centurion is rather fetching though i agree a tank should look like a tank not a land battleship or you fully commit to battleship design it was garbage but makes an awesome model it s possible to both go full battleship and have a sense of aesthetics eleven barrels of hell probably doesn t work out so well in real life though i like tanks to look like the rolling fortresses for jawas it sounds like they ve stolen the lyrical melody from this tho i think their use of lucky strikes as a symbol of americana is funny the brand was sold to bat british american tobacco in 1976 and hasn t even been sold in the us in the last 10 years its a huge brand in asia and popular in parts of europe but i don t think a single american has smoked them or could if they tried since the 1980s it feels right though you can get lucky strikes in the states you have to go to an actual tobacco shop a little over a year ago i was buying some cigars in a specialty tobacco shop in layton utah and saw a few packs of luckies in the cigarette rack i haven t smoked cigarettes since about 1980 when i mentioned to the clerk that i hadn t seen them in years and years he said yeah it s mostly stupid young hipsters that buy them here i forgot how good some of the smbc theater skits are its the silliest nitpick but she starts the sketch going i m finally 18 who to vote for then the first question she asks is about student debt does not compute also then the republican goes when i made it financially viable for a bank to lend you 300 000 for a poetry degree actually federal involvement in the college loan market goes back to the higher education act of 1965 part of johnson s great society programs not that republicans have done much to fight the expansion of the free shit train over the years but it seems odd to pretend that it was a brainchild of the gop meh they lean pretty democrat at smbc but they seem to be a little more self aware than most given that her 1 and 2 issues were student loan debt and gay rights yeah i d say they re very much in tune with flyover country to be fair in her age group those often are what single issue voters care about because teenagers early twenty somethings have underdeveloped brains why yes i m in favour of raising the voting age to 25 why do you ask they tend to be better when they re just bitching about politics in general their war skit is pretty good 1 00 was the actual correct response to her question i forgot olberman a long time ago how was i to know trump was with the russians too well the shit has apparently hit the fan send lawyers guns and money dad get me out of this rip warren god dammit russia stop trying to live up to your reputation a russian tv network has launched a real life version of the hunger games contestants will have to survive on their own for nine months in siberia producers say that anything goes including rape and murder although they warn people taking part that they re still subject to the rule of law and can be arrested at any time you must understand that the police will come and take you away we are on the territory of russia and obey the laws of the russian federation the 20 male and female participants taking part in

will come and take you away we are on the territory of russia and obey the laws of the russian federation you have been convicted of rape and so we banish you to oh fuck it a new prisoner arrives at the gulag the guard asks him how long and what he did 10 years for nothing at all he says you liar says the guard you only get 5 years for doing nothing at all no guns in siberia fuck that they have grizzly bears they armed their cosmonauts for exactly that reason cool that is basically a howdah pistol i want a howdah eh the eskimos deal with polar bears and they managed to get by without guns for a long time the eskimos have guns now in the days before they did a lot of bears had breath that smelled like eskimo i used to wonder how amazonian indians get around in the amazon basin without getting snake bitten i finally got to spend some time down there and found out how they don t that s because eskimos eat a lot of seal so their livers have deadly amounts of vitamin a if a polar bear eats an eskimo liver it will die the bears don t know that it s the liver specifically so they just avoid eating eskimos catnip for pan zagloba the unconventional church ru ica church ru ica in which the defenders of belgrade received their last communion is listed as one of the most unusual churches in the world the main reason why among many others lies in its horos made of firearm parts gun and bayonet bullets used in the great war as well as serbian officers sabers of that time chandelier made of swords and bullets hell yeah i remember in grade 4 reciting the speech of major gavrilovic at a school function they sadly got shellacked when they attacked then general von mackensen built them a monument securing his place as serbs favorite german or maybe second favorite if we include a guy so badass he won both the iron cross and legion of honor hitler oh wait richtofen what about catherine die grosse fbi backs cia conclusion on russian hacking motive there has been no specific persuasive evidence shared publicly about the extent of putin s role or knowledge of the hackings that lack of proof undercuts democrats strategy to portray putin s involvement as irrefutable evidence of a directed russian government plot to undermine america s democratic system http www sfgate com nation a 802061 php ditto a lack of evidence for hacking at all if the fbi and nsa agree why aren t comey and clapper saying so why is it coming through the head of the cia seems a bit odd to me that they had to meet for a powwow of agency heads to determine there was this consensus just days after it was reported that fbi analysts disagreed they re likely afraid to lose their jobs come january like i can trust a guy who conspired with putin to steal the election from hillary or a guy who perjured himself in front of congress about the rogue agency he was running look it is completely unfair that people found out the truth about hillary that wasn t supposed to happen no fair goddmmit sevo i hope you have a commenting account there and are loyally up voting all my comments more importantly than keith olbermann which is everything what do you guys think about marrying a girl 4 years older than yourself please note that i m not entering into such a thing while knowing i m going to divorce her in a few years like i m sure ashton kutcher did x 2 7 is acceptable or 18 whatever that s the equation for deciding if she s too young unless you re talking about waist size yeah her age is x this time in communist russia girl objectifies you true comrade honestly 4 years is nothing unless you re 18 23 not necessarily a big deal that s a good point and honestly its a done deal in my head i just wanna make sure i m not missing something none of my friends are old enough to have any realistic marriage advice shrugs i don t see what the big deal is for what it s worth my wife is 7 years younger than i am i m nuts over my wife she s this tall holds hand at waist level swiss impression thanks i ll take it from here narrows gaze that s where i always assumed i would end up sometimes life throws you a big breasted curveball sometimes life throws you a big breasted curveball nice age has nothing to do with anything i married a woman 13 years older than myself i m 22 years i think in and they have been the happiest 22 years of my life she really is the love of my life i know what i am talking about before i married her i went through at least a hundred of them no exaggeration a hundred at least crazy mean passive aggressive chronic cheaters dead fish every personality disorder there is one was a compulsive shoplifter ffs when you find a good sane faithful woman latch on tight you will find that age has nothing to do with it my brother is jealous of my extensive experience with the fairer sex he married young and is still with the same woman they seem happy to me no matter how hard i try i cannot convince him that i am being sincere when i tell him he didn t miss anything i was the one who missed out until i found my current wife yeah i ve been all over the block its pretty exhilarating at times but so is hanging out with my current girlfriend all the time personalities are almost impossible to find on the other side of the fence takes notes i wouldn t say age has nothing to do with it 25 35 45 year old single women are looking for vastly different things it s a dichotomy there is under thirty and over thirty just when they are hitting their sexual prime they notice that men aren t looking at them anymore thats gotta be hell vastly different desires and vastly different attitudes being a dorky 18 year old malewith no money must be hell too it all evens out so if you re 20 4 years is 20 of your life by the time you re 50 it s only 10 what i mean is that as you both agree the difference becomes less good point when i was 30 i married a woman who was 36 and she was married twice before to boot we just celebrated our 30th anniversary what counts is personality broadly defined congruence age is not important people still get married one thing i ll never comprehend i d rather not lose half of my bike ikea sofa and xbox

make blow jobs look boring this would be a 35 tax on all americans a tax that especially hurts low income families maybe the slogan should be makeamericavenezuela not bad amash is able to insult trump and bernie bros in one tweet justin is one of the very few politicians who have ever received any campaign contributions from me i ve been quite satisfied with his conduct in office jcr started off with a gulden draak 9000 on to a trappistes rochefort 10 capping off day off work of picking up stocking suffers and hitting the shooting range actually watching a recorded red eye with matt welch tammy pescatelli also a guest yum what does this carpetbagger have in his luggage chicago transplant robert pickens came to savannah about five years ago and immediately detected a deficit in the food scene when i got here i noticed there was no chicago food and deep dish pizza was nonexistent pickens says pickens immediately found his niche in savannah and dedicated the last four years to perfecting his epic deep dish pizza pie as of march 2016 pickens became the owner chef and delivery boy of windy city savannah discreetly located inside barrelhouse south on west congress street the south is so bizarre they have no shitty midwestern food i d be shocked if you couldn t find a chicago hotdog in savannah you can chicago hot dog polish sausage italian beef sandwich joints are all over the country i ve found them in small cities that have their own strong distinct coney culture in business you need an inventor and a promoter in politics you need an intellectual and a promoter and trump is a promoter libertarians are mostly intellectuals unable to promote their ideas on a large scale partly due to a lack of promoting skill partly due to the fact that this country is not yet ready for pure libertarian ideals if trump takes small steps toward greater freedom e g an epa executive who will cut regulations a department of education executive who will increase privatization a department of energy executive who will increase domestic energy production a foreign policy that will curtail nation building senseless wars and billions of dollars in giveaways to foreign countries the libertarians will complain that his steps are not good enough the fact is that even rand paul himself would not have been able to take bigger steps toward freedom even with the power of the presidency he would have better ideas but he wouldn t be able to implement them because he wouldn t be able to effectively promote them and the blowback would ultimately result in even less gains lastly i can t believe that an alleged libertarian is against tax cuts did you read steve chapman s latest article the retard is strong with that one and partly due to the fact that libertarians have as many blind spots about the real world as anyone else ok maybe not as many but they have some i think the underlying complaint is that tax cuts with no spending cuts is really just shifting taxation from the present to the future and trump seems stimulus happy which bodes ill for spending cuts libertarians should follow ludwig von mises who persuasively argued that taxes merely shift spending from individuals to the government on the pretentious assumption that politicians know what s best for individuals libertarian thinkers have excellent plans for reducing the deficit without increasing taxes ron paul says that fed should just burn all of its treasury bonds why should us taxpayers owe the fed money my broker peter schiff says that we should threaten chinese holders of treasury bonds with default in order to negotiate better terms why should us taxpayers pay for a reckless fed that has printed and borrowed money at whim behind our backs and why should rich chinese investors make money on their foolish investments well for one the us government would never be able to borrow again or loan again for that matter which is fine if you intend to abolish the government much like businesses even governments that run balanced budgets in the long run still need to borrow in the short run due to illiquidity of assets so to those of us who aren t anarchists renouncing the debt is just absurd and if you think trump is a promoter of libertarian ideas you re at least as delusional as chapman the libertarian plan should be to replace fiat currency with gold silver the united states treasury could demonetize american currency and americans could go to their banks and replace the old currency with gold and silver certificates which could be redeemed on demand the us government owns at least 8000 tons of gold and the imf own an additional 3000 tons you re right if we default on the debt no one would ever trust our fiat money any more but gold and silver have universal value and respect because they cannot be printed we should not try to live beyond our means and there is no reason to borrow money from foreign countries we only need to trade with foreign countries using gold and silver as the medium of exchange another crucial point to make is that if our country needs money it should tax its citizens not borrow money from foreign countries citizens feel the pain of taxes and will openly revolt if they think the alleged needs of the country are frivolous in contrast when we borrow money from foreign countries the alleged needs are often frivolous but since the taxpayer doesn t feel any pain from this our government can get away with this time and time again america s official tax calendar is set for next year and the filing deadline has shifted to april 18 a tuesday the nation s 16th president is the reason tv series about the civil war cancelled donald trump is to blame of course are they waiting for civil war ii don t want to remind democrats what happens when they get way too butthurt about a republican winning an election already happened but was invisible and of course the commenter are your typical right on lefty types

mike banerian is a youth chair of the michigan republican party and an official elector obligated to cast his electoral vote for president elect donald trump mike banerian i ve been inundated with hundreds and hundreds of letters to my house and facebook messages and some of those facebook messages are death threats i ve had people threaten to put a bullet in the back of my mouth people saying to throw myself in front of a bus sending me pictures of a noose saying if i don t do the right thing that they ll get me who are the bullies now i think i ve found the most hilariously sexist mysogynistic un pc film in history its like lolita meets throw momma from the train or dirty rotten scoundrels a comedy about pedophilia and con men le far da padre bambina 1974 translated i ll take her like a father in order to convince raimonda a wealthy noble woman to finance his project for a holiday resort saverio gets engaged to clotilde her mentally disturbed and sex obsessed adolescent daughter he plans to have her kidnapped and raped by an accomplice so she won t be a virgin anymore and he ll have an excuse to get out of the impending marriage but what he doesn t plan is to fall in love with the girl scheming middle aged man falls in love with retarded nymphomaniac teen hilarity ensues i came across this while scanning lots of 1970s european movie soundtracks obviously the cover made me inquire further about the film i may be wrong its not really anti pc so much as actually confirming the sjw s wildest imaginations about how men would actually prefer to behave all the time maybe it s time for someone to do a gritty remake is quentin tarantino doing anything pedro almodovar roman polanski but he ll use drugs i never said it was a good movie all i ve seen of it is some creepy clips of titty grabbing and child groping and having said that i think i ll give it a pass winks at preet and his everseeing eye pbuh oh please its still less exploitative than your average music video frantically motions finger across throat jesus that was fucking disturbing you don t remake good movies i just want to force sarkeesian marcotte and valentine to watch that movie then ask did you notice any differences between it and say age of ultron i think marcotte and valentine are real but i m starting to think that sarkeesian is a legitimate conwoman she s made way more than either of them over the past couple years and i d honestly applaud her if she suddenly turned around a few years from now and said stupid american bastards i just made millions poorly regurgitating half baked women s studies lectures that made you feel noble and self righteous now i m going to take my money and fuck off to the caribbean given that she hasn t delivered on her kickstarter obligations after all this time con woman she is but she ll ride the feminism pony to the end you don t remake good movies meh we could debate this for a month even if the og movie is weak in its first version the essence of the story has to be good e g one of my favorite remakes doa the plot concept is what makes it such an easy thing to update man discovers he s been poisoned and has 24 hours to catch his killer 2 stories i ve always thought would made a great remake or adaptation were typhoon joseph conrad and stray dog 1949 the latter being the easier of the 2 the former is the dreaded boat movie which hollywood hates both are super simple stories that allow for a wide range of subtle subtexts i just want to force sarkeesian marcotte and valentine to watch that movie then ask did you notice any differences between it and say age of ultron lol did they call the avengers movie sexist i watched i again the other day i do recall the love story between hulk scarlett johansen being sort of silly almost shakespearean lotsa stuff out there not for sjws you sugarfree d the link oops how sluts die i thought 1970 s italy cranked out zillions of those i think you re right italy at the time late 60s early70s had a thing where if there were a single successful film they d pump out 2 dozen copies of it until they d become an entire genre often the one decent one was lost in the pile of ridiculous copies the 1970s really were like that peak libertinism parents should be able to decide whether to circumcize their sons to put it mildly the brain is an important part of a person s body it s certainly more important than the foreskin of the penis one s brain is inevitably shaped by the parents or guardians one has as a child this is not some metaphorical allusion to the information that s put into one s brain nor am i referring to one s genetic inheritance no the physical structures of one s brain are changed based upon one s training and education we rightly value self determination but our ability to choose our own path and make our own decisions about our bodies begins after our bodies have already been shaped by our parents in ways we are powerless to change in this light agonizing over the loss of a foreskin is an unwarranted excessive reaction what kind of shit is that parents can do one thing so anything goes c mere ron i have something to show

html r 0 fuck that a turbulent and misunderstood era uh huh lots of people left the south after the war and it had nothing to do with politics they left because northerners flooded down here and as my grandfather put it stole every goddamned thing in sight my own family tried to leave they packed everything in 4 wagons one of which was loaded with logs to make a raft out of and headed for texas when they got to the sabine it was flooded so they camped out to wait for it to go down three weeks later it hadn t gone down and the women had had enough so they made the men bring them back home we still own that land i bet that shreeky is eating a big old box of crayons right now hey shreeky which tastes better the greens or the reds tampa will celebrate the fun parts of florida history we surveyed our audience for what else they would like to see said c j roberts the history center s ceo they answered pirates pirates pirates so that is what they ll get i hope they have the open bar and wench display drinking before noon does not make you and alcoholic it makes you a pirate why is it so hard for people to accept that trump s demagoguery may have been mostly demagoguery it s almost like they want him to be evil incarnate like they ll be disappointed if he isn t it s like right wingers back in the day sitting around hoping there will be another terrorist attack so they can say i told you so it s like bored firemen sitting around in the firehouse wishing there were a fire they could go put out if trump doesn t build the wall doesn t renegotiate gatt and nafta doesn t herd illegal immigrants out of the country by the millions and doesn t throw muslims out for being muslims the cosmo left may be more disappointed by it than trump s supporters i guess we ll have to wait and see but i m starting to suspect that trump helped the left build him into a strawman and the joke s gonna be on them for being afraid of its shadow and the joke s gonna be on them for being afraid of its shadow nope they ll claim they kept him from doing that stuff cause righteousness bored firemen go put out why is it so hard for people to accept that drumpf s demagoguery may have been mostly demagoguery not hard at all it seems to be really hard for you though anybody know what this is supposed to mean hi tulpa drumpf deep thoughts trump sounded distinctly authoritarian notes during the campaign and he s no fan of free speech free trade and anything remotely resembling open borders i don t know when he sounded authoritarian other than just sounding kind of like an a personality asshole the free speech i don t think is a real threat given the constitution i am not buying he does not like free trade given his business experience using it granted the 35 tariff bs is moronic but i don t think it will ever happen but can the big l libertarians explain to me how open borders would remotely make things better in this country given our current tax code and welfare state it is a tax burden benefit if employers hire non citizens and then pay shit so they get government aid how does that promote the economy and or a free employment market when one group is cheaper than the other by tax breaks or is there some free market utopia that will magically appear if we don t have borders and every person who wants to be in the us makes it here ah grasshopper the laws of supply and demand and of incentives work everywhere except for with labor see importing millions of workers and increasing the supply of labor in no way causes the cost of labor to go down or maybe it does but just because the cost of labor goes down in no way causes wages to decrease of course that s not true the problem is that libertarians tend to be like most people unwilling to admit that the theoretical best course is not always the real best course in the real world if both the us and mexico for example were fairly free and uncorrupt and if both had similar welfare programs an open border would be ideal many libertarians refuse to accept that in the real world an open border between mexico and the us means that the us imports poverty no i think they just think that having millions of very lowly paid workers is a plus no matter what same with wall street they want cheap labor period after all it helps their profits in the end i totally read that first paragraph in a david carradine voice and it made as much sense as the shit he said on tv back in the 70 s nice perhaps the libertarians will realize the real world is not theory some day what if i m a entrepreneur who wants both the cost of labor and the wages i have to pay to decrease oh i can sympathize but do you seriously disagree that an open border between the us and mexico imports poverty that by expanding the welfare roles and paying to teach non native speakers english in schools at the opportunity cost of using those funds on native speaking children or reducing taxes the government is not subsiding labor costs for business open borders in the real world is not libertarian it is cronyism but do you seriously disagree that an open border between the us and mexico imports poverty i m not sure what you claim is so terrible about importing poverty i mean this doesn t look like a group of plutocrats to me people who have been successful in their native country tend not to immigrate wherever they hail from as a group immigrants are poorer than the native population that s why they are willing to work for less wages in my factory that by expanding the welfare roles and paying to teach non native speakers english in schools at the opportunity cost of using those funds on native speaking children or reducing taxes the government is not subsiding labor costs for business assuming that we re talking about legal immigration those immigrants would be paying taxes for those services at the same rate their native peers would be as such it is no more problematic than any government spending for entitlements that native born citizens would use i reject your claim that hiring an esl teacher for a public school is any more of an example of objectionable government subsidy than the fact that the bill for my groceries is artificially inflated from government agricultural subsidies combined with heavy tariffs placed on cheaper foreign corn milk and bean products agree with all of that except the immigrants tend not to be successful in their native countries part my personal anecdote refutes that my personal anecdote refutes that you ve always been exceptional in my eyes straff looking for scratch that s it right there i ve been able to work in various countries because of my passport and would be a massive hypocrite if i denied that to others that simply want to make a little scratch by serving their fellow man ah well legal vs illegal is a red hearing to a point legal immigrants tend to be exactly those you describe hard working smart people that add to our wealth i m referring to hordes of illiterate unskilled semi skilled blue collar workers to pretend that importing millions of those doesn t equate to importing poverty is non rational and by importing poverty i don t mean just importing poor people it is importing the wage of a third world economy and thus displacing us workers who are now poorer because they are competing for work against people who think 10 per hr while sharing living quarters with 12 other families is good money you get rid of the welfare state and public education i ll agree to open borders since the welfare state is the cause and not immigration get rid of the cause i will agree to open borders when we get rid of the welfare state public education and make employers pay fica taxes on temporary visa workers aka h1b h2b and any other of the temp stuff then i am all in or just get rid of fica that works too or they leave because they are among the more well off and they want to leave for a country that has things money can t buy like safety a less polluted environment a government that won t get in your way at every turn and then rob you blind if you somehow succeed despite it um is it so different from importing half of europe s poverty between 1850 and 1920 last of political will to assimilate immigrants due to anti nationalism lack that makes you smart seems to me the libertarian platform concentrates on just the cost of labor going down the other aspects of wages seem to be a back burner issue the other aspects of wages seem to be a back burner issue how so i ve read plenty of articles here about inflation sticky wages and sound money i was referring to the other part of wages as in fica h1b for instance fica is not an issue the employer does not have to pay it in your factory are you going to hire the kid out of college who you have to pay half fica or the guy you can get from pakistan on a visa who you don t have to pay anything or if it is unskilled and said employee is here illegally not to mention if a business hires a refugee additional breaks if said person makes that cut i have worked in quite a few countries over the past ten years to be allowed to work in all of them i had to prove i was not taking a job that a citizen of said country could better fill and in the last one prove that i was actually training their citizens in their job to be more productive in their society i don t know i think we do it wrong and it is getting expensive heroic mulatto 12 16 16 10 10pm the other aspects of wages seem to be a back burner issue how so i ve read plenty of articles here about inflation sticky wages and sound money hm luv ya i m glad you re doing the heavy lifting tonight i ll add this in the hopes it helps in aggregate tariffs harm the importing country which imposes them regardless of any temporary gain in employment as a result i can t see selling labor as any different dear westernsloper if you want to watch normally sane smart people turn into gibbering idiots simply ask about open borders i ll get the popcorn obama signs bill to review civil rights era killings obama signed the bill friday it indefinitely extends a 2007 law that calls for a full accounting of race based deaths many of which had been closed for decades the law was set to expire next year the law provides federal resources to local jurisdictions to look into the cases and extends the time span of cases to be considered to dec 31 1979 it will also require the justice department and the fbi to consult with civil rights organizations universities and others who had been gathering evidence on the deaths pick those scabs obumbles pick em good well trying to solve genuine murders that are legitimately within federal purview is probably the most utterly unobjectionable thing he s done in his whole presidency even if it s probably an exercise in futility nope he is picking scabs community organizing those crimes as bad as they were are ancient history most of the perpetrators victims families and witnesses are dead and gone solving them will solve nothing but keeping them fresh in people s minds will foment resentment and anger which of course is the point the law provides federal resources to local jurisdictions to look into the cases and extends the time span of cases to be considered to dec 31 1979 37 years ago is definitely a cold case but it doesn t mean the people involved are cold especially since murder is a young man s game hell they still manage to dredge up the occasional nazi for trial dunno saying the electors will certainly put trump in is almost like predicting hillary was a shoo in prior to the general election funny though how lefties embrace the finer points of constitutional law after eight years of writing the constitution off as an embarrassing anachronism of course the electors will vote for trump to do otherwise would mean more than a constitutional crisis it would cause civil war literal killing the other guys civil war i doubt that riots sure and maybe a steady decline in public trust toward political nihilism but a shooting war over trump i don t think so i wonder how many people who voted for hillary would prefer to see the total meltdown of the us economy were trump to be denied wild stab but 40 eh basically what 60 something would have to change their vote for hillary to win if no one has 270 then congress votes and they are certainly going to vote for trump but frankly i think while a lot of republicans hate trump they hate hillary even more they only hated trump when they thought he was going to lose now that team red has all branches of government well then trump is the reincarnation of ronald reagan enough electors are obligated by law to vote trump that he has it in the bag the casting of the votes is symbolic if those electors try to vote otherwise they will be removed and replaced with alternates that will follow the law trump is our next president period the left is just has an epic case of denial they can tantrum all they want it won t change anything if they are encouraging electors to violate election laws to throw the election isn t that basically agitating for a literal coup it doesn t have to involve violence just the unlawful usurpation of power seems dangerous to do publicly especially when the person you re acting against has a reputation as someone who is not shy about fucking his enemies i don t really expect a lot of sympathy from john q public either i tried to overthrow democracy because i was butthurt about losing an election and now the government is being totally mean to me ok if it s death camps maybe you d get some posthumous sympathy but if it s just a bunch of state worshippers on the wrong end of unrelenting bureaucratic harassment so who is going to stand up to him well not republicans and republicans posing as libertarians reason com denizens would still be blaming hillary who was never president obama and maybe fdr the debt has never bothered republicans other than of course when obama was in charge watch them spend like drunken sailors cheer led by reason com while looking to criticize a sportscaster turned commentator turned for what comedy oh look tard got himself a new sock puppet reason supports massive debts troll grade f generous generous it s ok mr squirrel they saw it the first time btw tard i spent the booosh years arguing against the administration and their unconstitutional actions during the obama years i did the same but simple minded folk can t see beyond the two parties if you disagree with a democrat you must be a republican and if you disagree with as republican you must be a democrat retards like yourself simply can t see beyond the duopoly no one here out side of our lefties pitches spending this is lefty bored on a friday night hoping for attention i m hoping no one wastes electrons on this sorry piece of shit even for the possible benefit of some 3rd party reason screws up often enough but i ve yet to see the rag or the e version or the commentartiat pimp for more spending hell even reagan gets beaten up here just posting blatant lies ought to qualify for the ignore pile just noticed the post upthread this is the ass which shows up every week of so with a new handle and simply posts contrarian crap i m always amused by the posters who accuse a community with a surprising amount of canadians as all being secret republicans i mean come on at least call some of us tories i have a feeling the ass s vocabulary and knowledge don t extend to tory you re a tory damn straight god bless the empire you should appreciate this especially since it s played on a renault https www youtube com watch v xrxwwbo mx0 republicans posing as libertarians reason com denizens where do the real libertarians reside since you seem to know i d like to see what they talk about g this is a troll who shows up every week or so tosses out horseshit like that and goes away you ll get no real answer since the claim was never honest sf artists get eviction notice amid crackdown the tenants of a live work space built out of a commercial warehouse on peralta avenue in san francisco a brightly painted building in bernal heights near highway 101 said they received an eviction notice this week that gave them 30 days to find somewhere else to live http www sfgate com bayarea 802072 php the owner really doesn t have a lot of options and you can bet the artists yes scare quotes aren t going to pay for an upgrade even if they did would the owner accept rent control some of the comments are whining that the owner profited until now ignoring of course that the tenants did too after the warehouse fire in oakland that killed so many every city is going to do this those things are peppered all over the country i think it just happened in shreveport large artist community but nothing about it hit the news i cant blame them i live in a part of sf which was fairly dense with the arrangements say 30 years ago some were well arranged windows to dive out of if need be others not so much there are still some multi story units which are not code fire escapes etc run by non profits in sf that means taxpayer money handed out to those who support the local supervisor come election i would bet those supervisors are back peddling like crazy right about now making sure their name is nowhere in the records well arranged i love me some divin windows playa if you had to vacate through that public space to get out in case of a fire the window that let you do that was well arranged i have one i m allowed to call it an office but not a bedroom the actual bedrooms are tuck and roll where there s an overhang every ten feet the office is a straight shot to concrete 30 feet below better than getting burned alive but still i love me some divin windows defenestration is an underappreciated sport right now i can t remember from whom you stole that but it had to do with greasy wymyms and the lack of early tv content i can t remember from whom you stole that not whom where and when from prague the defenestrations of prague czech pra sk defenestrace german prager fenstersturz latin defenestratio pragensis were two incidents in the history of bohemia in which multiple people were defenestrated i e thrown out a window the first occurred in 1419 and the second in 1618 although the term defenestration of prague more commonly refers to the second each helped to trigger prolonged conflict within bohemia and beyond i think its a wonderful way to express your dissatisfaction with a political regime throw them out the window it s also handy in case of a swat raid which might be of some interest to the people living there i was talking with my progressive friend about the election and he voiced his support of doing whatever we can to prevent trump from being president i asked him does he know that by doing that he and his ilk will create a very dangerous precedent of invalidating the election results simply because the winner is perceived as being horrible his response was yep because trump is an existential threat to this country sigh yeah the left has me a little worried their inability to accept electoral defeat is the existential threat they want power at any cost when the electoral college hands trump the victory we will see what they do ask your friend why he hasn t picked up his rifle and gone off to fight the good fight if he really believes that trump is an existential threat their inability to accept electoral defeat is the existential threat thank you those are the words i needed push him more ask if he would actively assist with an assassination plot if he declines roll your eyes and say guess he s not that much of an existential threat then literally hitlarr 11 existential e z sten t sh l adjective of or relating to existence philosophy concerned with existence especially human existence as viewed in the theories of existentialism logic of a proposition affirming or implying the existence of a thing i was hazy on the actual meaning of that word so i had to look it up thank god for people like your friend he is saving the world unless your friend is israeli or sartre he shouldn t even try using that word his response was yep because trump is an existential threat to this country did you ask to to justify that conclusion like how exactly will trump s presidency cause the united states to cease to exist and if he doesn t cause the end of all things in the next 4 years what exactly will your argument be then this kind of talk is making me nervous the left has gone utterly bonkers over trump and heaven knows there are enough nuts and fanatics who will take this apocalyptic rhetoric seriously the secret service is going to be working overtime i m surprised there s only been one assassination attempt which by the way the media seemed to care very little about and the guy just got an amazingly light sentence which nobody seems to care about either same here pap i am confident that things would go badly for them so i try to take heart in that but the cost would be very high for everyone i believe the judge patted him on the head and called him a nice but confused young man or something along those lines which is totally what he would have done if the guy tried to whack the lightbringer if trump needs a name for the enemies list there s a place to start well in fairness to democrats we re entering into entirely uncharted historically unprecedented territory we have a situation where america has become incredibly polarized between republicans and democrats and between different regions a major issue is related to a minority population whose legal status is below both citizens and legal immigrants currently many business elites rely on them as a source of inexpensive compliant manual labor especially in agricultural fields and democrats see them a means to increased representation in congress and the electoral college republicans are particularly concerned about the latter republicans and workers in their states have moral and economic and sometimes racist reasons for opposing the democrats in all this though there is a split between those who want to grant more legal rights to the minority and those who want to repatriate them to their home countries both republicans and democrats fear the balance of power is unstable and will lead to total permanent dominance of one over the other now a deeply polarizing republican has been elected and democrats are convinced that it s the end of the line for them they re talking of openly defying federal laws that would deprive them of their minority workers or even seceding to protect their way of life if only history could educate us about what happens next honestly if it were kasich who won but lost the popular vote there s at least a 50 chance he d be saying the same thing damn nick good good let the hate flow through you if trump is successfully opposed when he runs afoul of libertarian small government separation of powers principles that will only serve to make the outcome of his term s better i am mixing up another drink and watching my favorite florida woman videos https www youtube com watch v oq gkfxmohc https www youtube com watch v omukyho6haw i think i will mix this one a double a diet of mostly fish will give a person a lean physique it seems watch some of her blue water videos she will spend an hour cranking a fish that weighs three times what she does up from depth that will slim you down too my kind of girl my first serious girlfriend a live in was a solid country girl she hunted barefoot so she could be extra quiet she could skin a deer in fifteen minutes she would wake me in the middle of the night and make me take her coon hunting she could fish like a champion if she hadn t been dead set against me going to college i never would have left her d00d stinkin thinkin stop it it was now is now i am not one to take advice from coon hunting deplorable i ll be in my bunk i love fishing shows so does podesta ha nice legs smells like fish i posted a darcizzle video months ago and it had a lot more ass you re fired dammit fired already i posted it for the fishing hm is the ass specialist here s more it s a bonus for anyone who has only ever heard fake coonass accents in movies i love these guys https www youtube com watch v ntgmkkod g4 and her https www youtube com watch v nx pou64ajy t 173s i think i am drunk and trolling like eddie but with better links i like you you gotta snowbird place we can rent while it s a frozen hellscape up here i just sold it last year most of my family has moved away so we didn t need it anymore we are empty nesters we have two extra bedrooms and a bayou in the backyard the bayou is kinda scary though it s chock full of alligators and fish bigger than you are i can get behind this i think i am drunk and trolling like eddie but with better links yeah that s what all the drink trolls think it s why i never read the dumb shit i posted the night before the morning after drunk oh i have embarrassed myself on here bad enough in the past that almost nothing i do now is worth worrying about i did once i will never do that again link i feel free to post here at any time sober or drunk though no one can ever tell thank you all how many of you are here probly me for one reason or another getting my next passport should be fun well i guess if you need two passports that could raise some flags you know i didn t vote for either one johnson got my vote but clinton was the better of the two do you want free minds or free markets i want both but the foundation of libertarianism is liberty and the right to make choices democrats have a far better history on this than the past 3 decades of presidents both are crappy on the economy democrats want to give away the 1 ers money and republicans want to bankrupt the country and give it to the 1 ers however dems have a better record on individual rights minus the 2nd amendment oh well i m just ranting trump is going to be a horrible president from a libertarian perspective however dems have a better record on individual rights minus the 2nd amendment 1st amendment free speech nope citizens united is all about trying to regulate political speech dont even get started on their attempt to control the internet or the hate speech nonsense 2nd amendment as you note ha ha 4th amendment privacy don t think so its probably a tie but depends on specifics both dems and republicans have allowed domestic surveillance used it in domestic prosecutions tried to force companies to break encryption still give the edge to republicans conservatives scalia for instance barred law enforcement from being able to search phones how about the right to property lol nothing you own belongs to you according to the dems right to work freeing people from union compulsion basic protections from unfair prosecution 5th 8th again there are violations by both but in the sum of details republican jurists have a far longer and deeper track record of protecting due process drugs alcohol weed legalization has happened faster in purple western states its happening slowest in solid blue places like ny and ca with exceptions ma recently dems are culturally cooler with weed but faster to regulate every aspect and increase petty enforcement we could go on but why bother democrats want to give away the 1 ers money sigh anyone who uses the term 1 ers in an unironic fashion needs more book learnin clinton actively showed her disdain for the first amendment she was corrupt and sycophantically supported by large parts of the media establishment she was openly inviting armed conflict with russia so she could look tough and claim smart power cred she was not the better of the two trump will have an active media challenging him not to mention one not worshiping the concept of an imperial presidency his cabinet is more libertarian leaning than the past two administrations and is definitely more libertarian than anything clinton would have done if he goes for someone like janice rogers brown for the supreme court he will have done more for libertarianism than anyone else has done in forty years he s bound to have some stupid trade positions likely some police abuse problems and probably some other populist bullshit though if he goes for someone like janice rogers brown for the supreme court he will have done more for libertarianism than anyone else has done in forty years i should better define this better i meant in the context of libertarians or libertarian leaning people with actual political and legal power not culturally which in many ways i think is more important because it s playing the long game i may be rare around here in that i m agnostic as to whether hillary would be worse than trump but i d say romney was definitely less bad than obama and who did the dems have that was less bad than reagan democrats want to give away the 1 ers money try the 25 ers or even the 50 ers the 1 ers account for too little money to do anything with besides run the dnc lobbying firms ngos and other nonprofits the democrats have no interest in really sucking that teat dry because it s what keeps party apparatchiks living cushy lives no substantial spending initiatives require either debt which is paid by all diffusely or tax increases on the middle class or both to put it plainly the top 1 may have incomes 3 5 times larger than the top 25 but the 25 have 25 times the number of taxpayers which is greater 3 5 or 25 ok those numbers are wrong it s actually kind of hard to get decent numbers for the top 1 correct numbers this time the top 3 have incomes 2 2 times those of the top 25 but the top 25 has 8 3 times the number of people elizabeth true that janice s comment is unimaginable last saturday i got a top of the range mazda mx 5 since i been bringin in 9155 this last 5 weeks and just over 10k this past month it s certainly the most financialy rewarding i ve ever had i began this 10 months ago and almost straight away got at least 69 per hr browse this site http www homejobs7 com too busy pushing for higher national minimum wages during a crap economy and lobbying for student loan relief for the relatively small number of in debt brats of a middle class too dumb or insecure to send their kids to relatively inexpensive state schools i guess so someone who thinks it s 1 ok for the poor to put up with slave wages that barely earn enough to live on and 2 that only rich folks deserve to go to good as distinct from crap schools so as to obtain an education in order to get a job that pays a decent living wage as distinct from the slave variety next thing you know he ll be doing a marie antoinette and telling them to eat cake except that 1a without low paying jobs how do people get the skills and experience to move into higher paying ones 1b what if people just need some spending money not a living wage or whatever 1c how s the minimum wage working out for the homeless and other people at the margins of society who can t justify being hired at full wages full time with a full slate of benefits 2a if the problem with crap schools was monetary then it would have been solved 40 years ago at least the feds and most states even out funding discrepancies arising from property taxes with income tax revenues indeed some of the best funded schools in the country are those in the poorest neighborhoods it doesn t change the outcomes much if at all 2b why is so much poverty concentrated in the inner cities anyway the whole reason people moved there is because that s where the jobs were a big part of the answer is that city governments have put in place onerous and unsustainable policies that deprive people of wealth and opportunity for example on 2b baltimore city s real property tax rate is 2 248 per 100 of assessed value in nearby anne arundel county the property tax rate is 0 915 per 100 of assessed value meanwhile the population and economic dynamics of the two places show growth in aa county and decline in baltimore next thing you know he ll be doing a marie antoinette and telling them to eat cake do you understand this analogy at all the death of the french monarchy entitled and out of touch though they were was followed by the reign of terror where people were executed left and right for no real reason at all which was itself ended by napoleon becoming emperor and waging war across europe that resulted in millions of deaths it would take another 60 years after napoleon before the french finally shook the monarchists for good but they still maintained an oppressive colonial regime for another 90 years after that lying liars and their lying cageliner oh and its got weigel too twitter a soon to be contracting circle jerk of apparatchiks media operatives and other narcissistic celebrities they ll go along with much of what trump wants especially if when it comes to muslim bashing and

the phrase we put principles before politics i laughed out loud remember the libertarian party fielded gary johnson twice primarily because he could supposedly win over more voters by downplaying or
