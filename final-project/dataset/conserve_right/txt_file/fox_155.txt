he democrat s victory put more pressure on the gop to pass tax reform before he gets to the senate this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday december 17 2017 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news sunday host i aposm chris wallace republicans release their latest tax plan will congress send it to president trump to sign before christmas begin videotape rep paul ryan r wis speaker of the house this is real relief this relief gives people a simpler system and a fairer tax code wallace as gop leaders push their measure to overhaul the tax code we aposll discuss the bill aposs prospects and what it means for you with secretary of the treasury steven mnuchin then democrat doug jones wins in alabama putting even more pressure on the gop to pass tax reform before he gets to the senate sen chuck schumer d ny senate minority leader it would be wrong for senate republicans to jam through this tax bill without giving the newly elected senator from alabama the opportunity to cast his vote wallace we aposll sit down with the senator elect in his first appearance on fox news since the start of the campaign plus lawmakers question whether political bias has taken over special counsel robert mueller aposs investigation rep steve chabot r ohio how with a straight face can you say that this group of democrat partisans are unbiased and will give president trump a fair shake rod rosenstein deputy attorney general we recognize we have employees with political opinions it aposs our responsibility to make sure those opinions do not influence their actions wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about new documents the white house says show extreme bias against mr trump and our power player of the week a photojournalist who has risked her life to show what aposs happening in the world aposs most dangerous places unidentified female they were about to execute us and we aposre literally at one point i looked over and i saw each of my colleagues literally begging for their lives wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington republicans appear ready this week to pass the most sweeping overhaul of the tax code in three decades opposition among gop holdouts has melted away and party leaders in congress are looking to hand president trump his first major legislative victory in a few minutes we aposll discuss what the plan means for american families and businesses with treasury secretary steven mnuchin but first to correspondent peter doocy live on capitol hill with a preview of both the tax vote and the effort to avoid a government shutdown before christmas peter peter doocy fox news correspondent good morning chris the next movement on this tax bill comes tuesday when house lawmakers hope to pass the bill and send it to the senate where the math gets a little tougher the account there is expected to be so close that the vice president mike pence has delayed a long planned trip to the middle east just to be available to cast a tie breaking vote if necessary but president trump is confident that it gets done by the end of this week begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we have a tremendous spirit for the tax reform this is going to be one of the great christmas gifts to middle income people end video clip doocy there are still seven tax brackets under the new plan but the rates are lower until 2025 the new top rate for top earners dropped from 39 6 percent to 37 percent the child tax credit doubled to 2 000 per child and the standard deduction nearly doubled as well to 12 000 for single filers which means that fewer people are expected to itemize their deductions there is a new 10 000 cap on deductions for state and local taxes the mortgage interest deduction will be capped at 750 000 and obamacare is fine for people who don apost want insurance under the individual mandate disappears so the first half of this week republicans will try to transform the tax code and the second half of the week they are going to have to try to keep the government funded there will be a government shutdown next weekend if they can apost figure out how to do that by friday night chris wallace peter doocy reporting from capitol hill peter thank you joining me now is the secretary of the treasury steven mnuchin and welcome back to fox news sunday steven mnuchin secretary of the treasury great to be here with you thank you wallace can you say flatly that congress will pass this tax plan this week and send it to the president to sign before christmas mnuchin i can it aposs a historic moment and we aposre excited to be here wallace and you have no doubts that congress will pass it this week mnuchin i have no doubt this is been a terrific process with the house and senate working together in conference and there is a terrific bill that aposs going to get to the president to sign wallace all right let aposs run through several aspects of this terrific bill as you put it and the first one i want to deal with is fairness here aposs what senate democratic leader chuck schumer had to say about it this week begin video clip schumer god bless wealthy people i aposm glad we have them but they don apost need a tax break end video clip wallace let me pick up on that because critics note the tax rate for top earners dropped from 39 6 percent to 37 percent the corporate tax rate is cut from 35 percent to 21 percent and the owners of so called pass through companies get a 20 percent deduction the tax policy center analyzed the earlier senate bill which did not even have all of those provisions and said the top tenth of 1 percent of taxpayers would get 42 percent of the benefits question mr secretary do wealthy americans need all of those tax breaks mnuchin well chris first of all the reason why we aposre lowering the top rate is because we aposre getting rid of lots and lots of deductions and there aposs a big part of the country that has state and local taxes that we aposre getting rid of as a matter of fact schumer has been complaining about taxes going up on rich people in new york so it aposs just not the case that there aposs all those taxes going to rich people wallace and what about all the other aspects of it and the analysis from the tax policy center 42 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent mnuchin well i don apost agree with those numbers what this is all about is middle income tax cuts matter of fact i researched you grew up in chicago the median person family that makes 50 000 is going to get extra money back close to 2 000 and a family making 150 000 in illinois is going to get over 4 000 back that aposs very meaningful and people are going to see these tax cuts starting in february because we have the irs already working on new tax tables wallace but again just to push this question of fairness and i take your point that because of the fact that you are doing away with most of the state and local deductions that aposs going to be a tax increase for people in high tax states like new york or california but still we are talking about a family that makes over 600 000 a year do they need to have their taxes cut from 39 6 percent to 37 percent and in the so called pass throughs because of the deduction that you aposre going to give to them you aposre going to get a situation where a lot of the employees who work for those companies will be taxed at a higher rate than their bosses mnuchin well let me just say pass throughs are the engine of growth in this country this is about creating the lowest tax rate for pass throughs since the 1930s that is going to be massive massive economic growth and it aposs about fixing a broken business tax system we aposve had one of the highest corporate rates in the world with companies leaving trillions of dollars offshore to so that they don apost have to pay taxes this is a historic event to fix a broken tax system wallace but what about the point i just made that you could end up with employees of these pass throughs and these are companies that are not formal corporations and they end up the owners of them end up paying our taxes through the individual tax rate not the corporate tax rate the idea that you could have employees paying a higher tax rate than the owners of those companies mnuchin chris you know it aposs a very complicated tax system and this is about simplifying ph it so the reason why we have the pass through tax break is because we believe there will be about 4 500 in wage growth that will go back to workers so this is this is all about creating a tax system that aposs good for workers good for working families wallace let aposs talk about the point you just brought up because that was one of the other aspects that was a big selling point that you were going to be making the tax code simpler and in fact there was an event that i want to show where president trump met with top congressional leaders and talked about this is going to be so simple you will be able to file your tax return on a postcard take a look begin video clip crosstalk trump great job thank you i didn apost know i was going to be given a prop laughter end video clip wallace but analysts say that in fact the gop tax plan you didn apost end up cutting out all of those deductions makes the tax system more complicated for millions of americans especially those involved in these pass through companies who are going to have an even more complicated tax system to deal with and are not going to have any chance of looking at filing on a postcard mnuchin chris that aposs just not the case i couldn apost be happier overseeing the irs over 90 percent of americans are going to fill out taxes on that postcard or a virtual electronic postcard this is about simplifying taxes and simplifying the business system so there will always be people who complain that they aposre losing tax breaks but this is about making it simple for the american public wallace i want to press on that because that aposs a new number i aposd heard that originally but i you aposre still saying over 90 percent of americans will be able to file on a postcard mnuchin absolutely they aposll take the standard deduction and that aposs what they aposll file with and we aposre in the process already of designing new forms so that americans don apost have thousands of pages of tax forms wallace let aposs turn to the deficit your treasury department issued a one page statement this week that was pretty controversial you said the combination of tax cuts rollback of regulations infrastructure and welfare reform will not only pay for tax reform but reduce the debt net by 300 billion over ten years good for the economy fair to working class americans donna edwards former u s congresswoman well i think clearly it aposs a boon for corporations and the super wealthy i mean this tax bill really gives them a huge benefit but for the middle class families i mean i urge people to do what i did and simply you know put your income in a calculator and start running some of these changes to the tax code and i think a lot of middle class families are actually going to find that it aposs either going to be a wash for them or they aposre actually going to end up paying more taxes depending on where they live wallace what specifically do you worry about in this bill edwards so i worry about a trade off for the standard deduction even though the standard deduction goes up wallace almost double edwards that aposs right but there are other things that people lose if you itemize your state and local income taxes your property taxes those things really hurt you if you are a family that has you know where you get the individual mandate now is in place and it aposs taken away for many families that means that their health care premiums are actually going to increase which then affects their quality of life and so you know this really i think you know it aposs not a reform of the tax code anybody who thinks they will be able to put their taxes on a postcard i aposve got something else i want to sell you because that aposs not true that aposs what was promised and this is not going to be a fair benefit for middle class families wallace brian i want you to join the debate on the merits but also let aposs talk about the politics because assuming that this does pass as secretary mnuchin said as everybody is saying this will be the first big legislative victory for donald trump is it enough to go to the voters in 2018 and will it help them brian kilmeade fox friends co anchor it aposs going to be fascinating because we are actually going to have a legitimate report card in 2018 it aposs not who was the best slogan who has the best message who aposs better on the stump it aposs going to say i aposm not sure immigration is not going to get on the 2018 either but let aposs say this is the only piece of major legislation we aposre going to feel it in february and if you are right congresswoman and people are paying more and it aposs not working out and most of the american people say this is terrible he aposs going to pay the price but if things begin to improve and the growth rate does go over four and everything is on the right track right now then that aposs all you can ask for if you are president trump and if you are a republican say grade me on what i did now when i watch marco rubio and i watch senator lee and i watch senator johnson all lobby hard to get what they want in this bill i ask you where are the five or six democrats in conservative districts and states that could have done the same thing if joe manchin put his hand up and said you get me to 24 i aposm in jon tester heidi heitkamp why didn apost they try to get in this debate this was all a one party debate and it didn apost have to be wallace juan juan williams fox news political analyst this is all about politics and it aposs all about the midterms it aposs all about saying that republicans in the first year of the trump administration with a republican house republican senate republican control of the white house got something done they didn apost get obamacare done they haven apost gotten immigration plan down they got something done so let aposs look at the polls let aposs get away from all of this and say what are the american people this sunday morning think about this plan the majority not a plurality a majority more than 50 percent say it aposs a bad plan for themselves and for their families mike bloomberg says this is a trillion dollar blunder the joint center on taxation goldman sachs say this is a bad plan for the economy so this is not a political judgment these are people goldman sachs is in the moneymaking business and they don apost see this as good for them or for america instead i think what you have is republican donors the donor class saying yes this is what we want from republicans we want tax cuts and they aposre delivering on the tax cuts rich lowry national review it aposs not as though republicans just came up with this idea of corporate tax form out of the blue yesterday because they need to pass something president barack obama talked about the importance of corporate tax reform bill clinton talked about the importance of corporate tax reform because our system was out of whack with the rest of the world and was hurting us crosstalk williams but i think that if you talk about tax form rich you got to keep in mind that the actual rate that these corporations is paying is much lower because of deductions and the like lowry it aposs such a complicated system and that makes no sense that aposs why you want to lower the actual rate and knock out some of those special interest provisions and this crosstalk edwards this is actually let aposs be clear this is not a tax reform package it doesn apost reform the tax code what it does is it continues many of those special interest breaks it gives additional special interest treatment to certain kinds of corporations and income pass through income being one of those things and on top of that it adds a trillion dollars to the deficit and that aposs by the joint center on taxation ph wallace let me bring in the point to both you congresswoman edwards and to you juan as critics of this plan the trump economy is doing pretty well we got 3 percent growth 4 percent unemployment record highs every week in the stock market if this brings further stimulus to the economy isn apost that going to be a pretty powerful message going into 2018 edwards it aposs a big if i mean the fact is i mean almost no economy tells you that the growth rates that are being projected by the congressional republicans is actually in line with trump himself is actually going to create in this in this economy and so it really is i mean it really is a mistake to call this sort of adding to the growth rate it aposs corporations wanting to put more money in the economy they aposve got all the capital in the world to do that right now there aposs nothing in this tax reform bill that incentivizes it kilmeade i would say this if you aposre running a major corporation you aposre probably a very bright man or woman and you know this is a window of opportunity where you finally got the tax deduction that you said was keeping your money offshore and your investment away now this is a window now if you don apost take it manage of that window if you just buy back your stock or keep it overseas you aposre never going to get this opportunity you aposre going to have a liberal democrat in the office and your life will never be as bad economically and i will say this the markets have already weighed in the prospect of having this passed boomed ph the market and it continues to rise so mike bloomberg who wants to take your guns and take away the combustion engines williams oh stop crosstalk williams the minute you jump the broom there and start talking about guns i understand that you aposre in losing position brian kilmeade no but you understand he wants to hurt donald trump any way he can williams that aposs look let aposs just talk about taxes let aposs forget the you know politics the sport aspects of this and talk about the reality the reality is we have a very good economy right now stock market booming low unemployment good gdp that aposs growing we aposre still struggling with wages and workforce participation but the reality is that there is high income inequality in this country americans don apost want what paul ryan is talking about a huge deficit then says we aposre going to shrink the government and we aposre going to cut social security and medicare next year wow crosstalk kilmeade standard deduction don apost you see some of the things built into this plan already built into this plan already that aposs going to help the working class and help the crosstalk williams what helps the working class wallace gentlemen crosstalk lowry higher growth helps the working class it helps everyone wallace take it outside williams yes laughter wallace we aposve got another segment and we aposll have you back later in the show thank you up next senator elect doug jones we don apost want to miss him his first appearance on fox news since the start of the campaign and what he wants to do in congress after his upset victory in alabama that was great commercial break wallace coming up gop senate candidate judge roy moore still refuses to concede in alabama begin video clip roy moore r alabama senate candidate we are indeed in a struggle to preserve our republic our civilization and our religion and to set free a suffering humanity end video clip wallace senator elect doug jones joins us live next on fox news sunday commercial break wallace doug jones pulled off a stunning upset this week becoming the first democrat elected to the senate in deep red alabama since 1992 while his opponent judge roy moore vows to fight on president trump called doug jones to congratulate him the senator elect joins us now live mr jones congratulations and welcome to fox news sunday doug jones d ala u s senator elect thanks chris i appreciate the opportunity wallace let aposs start with what you see as your role in the senate starting early next year here aposs what you said on election night begin video clip jones we aposve tried to make sure that this campaign was about finding common ground and reaching across and actually getting things done for the people end video clip wallace given the fact that republicans control the house and the senate and the white house where do you see an opportunity to find common ground and work with president trump jones well you know chris i think there aposs an opportunity at every turn it doesn apost matter what the issue is there aposs always the opportunity to find common ground you know and i hope to have that voice i said on election night that i hope this is a message not to just republicans that we aposve got a democrat who aposs willing to reach across the aisle i hope it aposs a message to democrats to try to find that common ground you know it aposs one of those things where you aposve got to reach across you aposve got to try but it aposs a two way street i mean people have got to respond backwards and that aposs why i aposm hoping that we aposll be able to do that with this new voice and a new and i think sense of enthusiasm coming out of the state of alabama wallace well let aposs talk some specifics it looks like the senate and congress is going to pass the tax bill before you get to town but if you were here this week if you had a chance would you vote for this bill or against it jones well i aposve got to be honest with you chris that aposs a 500 page bill for just landed on people aposs desks just the other day so i haven apost had a real chance to look at that and study it as has a lot of people have not which is one of my biggest concerns about the way things are going up there right now this seems to be done plopped into a vote too quickly there aposs obviously what i aposm seeing and hearing and just reading about there aposs things that i like about it cutting corporate tax rates cutting some things for the middle class and increasing the standard deduction but my biggest concerns are the process and also the fact that it aposs going to increase the deficit by over a trillion dollars that causes me great concern and i aposm just very surprised that that aposs going to go i don apost buy into the fact that it aposs going to grow the economy such that that trillion dollars debt will get wiped out i think that aposs a major problem so we aposll wait and see how it goes we aposre going to start looking at it just in case i aposm up there ahead of time but it aposs a complicated bill this is not the simplification process that we were all told about early on five hundred pages is a pretty complicated bill wallace well let aposs talk about another one and this is one that you may get a chance to vote on immigration would you support a deal that fixes daca that protects the so called dreamers but on the other hand has tougher border enforcement and includes some money for continuing to build president trump aposs wall jones we aposll i aposd have to look i you know i have said before that i opposed the building of a wall i think that aposs an expense that the taxpayers just don apost have to incur because i do think you can increase border security without having to go to the incredible expense of building that wall at least the figures that i aposve seen i do support the daca program and would love to see that extended i hope there can be some bipartisan efforts reached to do that immigration has been one of the toughest political football aposs going on up there right now and we aposve had bills in the past that just fell by the wayside because of politics if there aposs comprehensive immigration i think it aposs going to be very complicated and but it aposs something that i would love to look at i know it aposs been important to my state although i aposm not as sure it aposs as important as health care and some other things right now wallace but but i mean this is a good kind of case study and we aposre talking theoretically because obviously there aposs not a specific piece of legislation there are things you want you want the daca fix are you would you be willing even though you aposre not crazy about the idea to include some funding for the wall which is something the president and republicans want if you get your half of the load ph jones well let aposs see how that shakes out it aposs hard to talk in hypotheticals because right now you haven apost seen anybody really kind of trying to reach those compromises it aposs a you know draw you know what i aposm seeing up there is you draw a line in the sand and you haven apost had an opportunity to reach i aposm going to consider anything chris i mean look i aposm up here to try to as i aposve said before to try to find that common ground i know it sounds like a broken record i also know that it sounds like it aposs just pure pie in the sky but the fact is we aposve got to try and look and try to do those things for the american public so rather than just talking in hypotheticals i aposll leave all the options on the table with regard to that and try to come up with the right way to approach immigration or any other issue wallace president trump called you the other day and invited you when you come to washington to come visit him at the white house but during the campaign he said that you if you were elected would be a puppet of democratic leaders pelosi and nancy pelosi and chuck schumer here here is some clips from all of that begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we don apost need a liberal person in there a democrat jones i aposve looked at his record it aposs terrible on crime it aposs terrible on the border it aposs terrible in the military sarah sanders white house press secretary he likes doug jones and looks forward to meeting him in person end video clip wallace so which trump do you believe the one before the election or the one after jones i aposm going to believe the one after you know you say a lot of things during the in the heat of a campaign and we were expecting to you know that kind of checklist of things but his call to me was very gracious it truly was we had a very good talk no substance but just kind of a personal call i aposm looking forward to meeting him i aposm looking forward to getting up there and trying to find those issues that we can work together on for both the country and the state of alabama wallace you know the line of questioning that i aposve been engaged in and i think that a lot of reporters since your victory is answering the big question here in washington which is which kind of a democrat will you be you talk a lot about your mentor when you worked here in washington in the senate howell heflin who stepped down as alabama aposs last democratic senator 20 years ago we have a picture up right now at a committee meeting and there aposs heflin and there is a much younger doug jones right next to him heflin was ranked as the democrat with the most consistent record of support of any democrat during his time in office for ronald reagan do you see yourself as the same kind of moderate or even conservative alabama democrat jones you know chris i aposm just going to be candid about this i have resisted trying to put labels on myself people are going to do that left and right i aposve tried to resist that i aposm going to continue to resist that i aposm going to be a doug jones democrat for sure i aposm going to be looking at issues on both sides i aposm going to do what i believe is in the best interest of both the country and my state other people will label me i think the world has changed a little bit and i think politics has changed and all i can do is to try to go forward with what i believe is the best thing to do and that aposs the only thing i can do so we aposll see how that shakes out in the next year or two to see what kind of labels you guys in the media want to put on me wallace well and we will jones i know wallace two more questions i want to i want to get in one your opponent judge moore continues to refuse to concede says that this race is not over and this week issued this video begin video clip moore today will no longer recognize the universal truth that god is the author of our life and liberty abortion sodomy and materialism have taken the place of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness end video clip wallace what aposs your reaction to that and do you think that roy moore is hurting alabama by continuing this contest continuing this fight jones well i just have quit trying to figure out what judge moore means when he says things like that it just i find i don apost find it in the mainstream of america i don apost certainly don apost even find it in the mainstream of alabama i think it aposs time to move on and i think he is hurting the people of this state i have told folks and i want to try to represent everyone i aposm not going to be a senator in which people are going to agree with a hundred percent of the time but i am going to be the kind of senator the people can talk to that we can reason with i want to get an education from them i want to educate the people so i do think he aposs ph hurt and i think it aposs time to move on and let aposs get get beyond this divisive kind of rage the war rhetoric that you hear from him from others wallace final question you aposre not up for reelection until 2020 but i want to ask you about the 2018 midterms because some folks say that your victory as well as the victory of the democrat in the governor aposs race in virginia put out a kind of blueprint a game plan for how democrats should proceed in 2018 i want to put up some numbers on your victory you won the black vote 93 percent to six the younger vote 62 percent to 36 women 55 percent to 43 and independents 55 to 42 question how do other democrats energize those pillars of the traditional party base for the 2018 midterms jones well you know chris i think that anybody that runs for office ought to talk to those people i think that was one of the things that we did early on in our campaign we went straight on issues roy moore didn apost talk about issues that we had in common he talked about issues that divide us and i think when you talk about those issues that you have in common among all of those groups you just rattled off every one of them have the same issues in common about health care education jobs the economy trying to raise to a living wage those are the issues that people responded to and i think that whether it aposs democrats or republicans i think people now have to start focusing on those issues and not just depend on whether or not there are going to be some kind of straight ticket voting wallace senator elect jones thank you thanks for your time this weekend and we aposll see you up here in washington pretty soon jones thanks chris i look forward to it and thanks for having me this morning wallace when we come back the fbi under fire the president launches tough new criticism of the agency plus what would you like to ask the panel about allegations of political bias in the fbi just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump it aposs a shame what aposs happened with the fbi but it is very sad when you look at those documents and how they aposve done that is really really disgraceful and you have a lot of very angry people that are seeing it end video clip wallace president trump taking aim at the fbi after the release of anti trump text messages between two senior officials peter strzok and lisa page who were involved in the special counsel investigation until last july and we aposre back now with the panel well brian the washington post had a story this week and i don apost know if you saw it that said that these texts back and forth between strzok and page were really an effort to cover up the fact right wallace that they were having an extramarital affair and the question i have is does that clear it all up for you kilmeade yes thanks we have some time left in this segment so i aposll fill it no i absolutely not you aposve got to be kidding me they were the one thing that stood out on the text messages more than anything else was the fact is they were building in a plan just in case on august 15th and i think you even referred to it earlier in the show on august 15th they were going back and forth on a text messages that talked about a plan just in case donald trump won and he went on to say just like having an insurance policy inaudible wallace well let me let me let me put this up and let aposs put it up on the screen if you if we can guys and this was a text that peter strzok sent to lisa page on august 15 2016 and it says i want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in andy aposs office we think andy was andrew mccabe the number two official in the fbi the path you threw out in andy aposs office that there aposs no way he trump gets elected but i aposm afraid we can apost take that risk it aposs like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before your 40 continue kilmeade what i aposm trying to say is for any republican who was worried or on the fence that there might have been some bias amongst the top level of the fbi when it come to the investigation and against his candidacy that is proof positive unless they aposre referring to andy griffith who starred in matlock as well as his own black and white tv series who had a lot of success but i could see that wallace proof positive of what kilmeade proof positive that there was an anti trump bias at the top and peter strzok was all around this investigation enough to make you want to probe and that aposs what jim jordan indicated that bob goodlatte is going to be doing when we get back from christmas break wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this as a tweet from john h converse who writes we demand the military be apolitical on duty even though we allow them to have political ideology is it too much to demand the same of the fbi irs doj department of justice juan how do you answer john and brian williams well just as the military has political opinions you know so do people work are jurors who are lawyers who are judges who are fbi agents we aposre human beings wallace but if a if a judge had if we had read statements that were blatantly favoring one side against the other they would be forced to recuse themselves williams no but that aposs not the point the point is what not wallace well it aposs not your point it aposs my point williams no no i was making i aposm speaking to your point the fact that you write them down i my point is that you have these opinions it aposs no question that people have opinions the question is their integrity can they perform their job in an impartial way despite their opinions and what we know is that according to the attorney general jeff sessions the deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and the fbi director christopher wray just this week all have said the fbi is performing its jobs very well wallace yes but wait wait they weren apost saying that about lisa page in peter strzok williams that aposs this is a total distraction let me just say this whole discussion is so interesting to me because it aposs all part of the trump legal team assault on the integrity of law enforcement in this country intended to distract people kilmeade it aposs not the rank and file williams distract people from the potential the investigation into ties between the trump campaign and its officials and russian interference and this is all a setup potentially to fire bob mueller wallace deputy well will get to that in a minute williams they aposre not doing it wallace deputy attorney general rod rosenstein testified before congress this week and he took some heavy fire from republicans on just this issue take a look begin video clip rep steve chabot r ohio congressman how with a straight face can you say that this group of democrat partisans are unbiased and will give president trump a fair shake rod rosenstein deputy attorney general we recognize we have employees with political opinions and it aposs our responsibility to make sure those opinions do not influence their actions end video clip wallace and we hope that he aposll be able to clear the frog ph out of his throat but congresswoman look nobody is talking let this is a red herring nobody is talking about the fbi in general everybody agrees that it aposs a good solid agency we aposre talking but individual actors here when you read those texts where they just trash trump they say that he aposs loathsome that he aposs an idiot and then specifically this august 2016 one where they talk about you know we aposve got to have an insurance policy in case he gets elected you don apost find that troubling edwards and so what i mean you know the fact is that you have two employees who were having an affair they were taken off the investigation in july last year and now you have a series of indictments that have come from the mueller team and this line of questioning attacking mueller attacking the investigation based on a couple of employees who had an affair and were covering that up and writing stupid emails so what i mean lowry and look a lot of texts they are stupid they are embarrassing they aposre not necessarily sinister the sinister one is the insurance policy text and we need wallace the one we aposve been talking about lowry right and we need to hear from strozk under oath about what he meant by that i also think there aposs enough now to be worried by this investigation i think bob mueller for his own good should dismiss andrew wiseman ph who aposs a democratic partisan who aposs a top deputy also sent an anti trump e mail and jeff sessions should bring in an outside district attorney who has some independence to look into the entirety of how doj and the fbi handled 2016 and to get to the bottom of it but but if donald trump takes from all this a permission slip to fire bob mueller it would be a catastrophic mistake and the irony is here as far as we know it looks like mueller is not turning up evidence of collusion so i think if trump could just sit tight mueller probably will vindicate him at the end of the day and firing him will do more damage to trump than just sitting this out kilmeade i talked to three different white house officials and that is what congresswoman speier said is total fiction there is no interest in firing mueller it wallace yes we should point out what did she say kilmeade and what she came out and said that there aposs word is and rumor on the hill that before christmas he aposs going to make a major speech and say mueller aposs fired investigation over they said we haven apost even discussed that in private conversations it has not come up three different people who work at the white house just to make sure that i had the right information for you because i know you demanded it absolutely wallace now don apost go single source on me kilmeade i know because inaudible wallace this is like watergate here boy inaudible kilmeade and i know i aposve two great people here to debate with so that aposs not going to happen but what happens they are trump wants this to end he wants to see what it aposs like to have a presidency without this hanging over its head edwards well then he needs to stop attacking the special counsel kilmeade this is real though this is sub edwards he needs to stop attacking mueller kilmeade this is substance edwards and he needs to let the he needs to let the investigation play out kilmeade but he has you notice he has not comes from inaudible it is not specifically left to mueller edwards well it hasn apost stopped it hasn apost stopped his allies on the hill from attacking mueller kilmeade because they are finally understanding the there aposs something to attack cross talk lowry when in d c when in washington d c has there ever been an independent counsel special counsel investigation of a president that hasn apost engendered a partisan reaction i we all recall the 1990s and the democrats were not very nice to ken starr if i remember correctly williams yes fine but this is this takes it to a new level rich i think you know people talk about colin kaepernick black lives matter undermining trust in our police they did nothing as comparable to what this president has done to the fbi at this moment lowry well the fbi has also hurt its own credibility wallace all right you know what i liked about this panel i had to do very little work thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the remarkable woman who took these powerful pictures from the front lines commercial break wallace if you ever read the new york times or national geographic or time magazine chances are you aposve seen her work riveting photographs that bring the savagery of the front lines into your home here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape lynsey addario photojournalist i never consider myself brave i just consider myself very sort of committed to the story and that takes me to places that are dangerous wallace voice over lynsey addario is one of the great photojournalists of the last two decades just listen to where she has worked since 9 11 addario i aposve covered afghanistan iraq libya darfur congo south sudan somalia wallace on camera question why addario there are great injustices that go on in war zones and its fundamental for someone to be there to document that wallace voice over darfur 2004 addario there were skeletons across the desert people fleeing for their lives we witnessed villages that had been burned to the ground wallace with u s troops in afghanistan aposs korangal valley in 2007 addario and i woke up i put on my night vision took this picture and fell back asleep wallace in pakistan aposs no man aposs land trial area with the taliban in 2009 for a story that won the pulitzer prize addario if they invite you to their home they will not kill you they will protect you with their lives so we knew that or we hope that once we got there because we had been invited they would not kill us unidentified female the new york times says four of its journalist reporting on the conflict in libya are now missing wallace but addario aposs luck almost ran out when she and three colleagues were taken prisoner by gadhafi aposs forces in 2011 addario they were about to execute us and we aposre literally at one point i looked over and i saw each one of my colleagues literally begging for their lives and i remember i could barely speak and i just said please and at that moment a commander came over and said you can apost kill them they aposre american wallace addario and the others were beaten and held for six days but then finally released two months later she went back to work not on the front lines but still in gaza and afghanistan and senegal and by now she was pregnant wallace on camera did your family did your friends did you question what the heck you were doing addario the fact is i was pregnant and i was surrounded by pregnant women and oh my god it was the most natural thing i always feel like i aposm in the wrong place when i aposm here i want to be there when i aposm there i want to be home wallace voice over addario aposs son lucas is now almost six when she comes home he sits on her lap while she edits her pictures sometimes of war refugees addario and he asks about war and i say it aposs fighting and some people get killed and he said well then mommy can apost you get killed and to me that aposs like how do i answer that because i can apost just lie to him and so i just say i aposll be fine wallace so why does she do it why has she risked her life these last two decades why does she keep risking her life with lucas waiting for her back home addario i don apost need to take pretty pictures anymore it aposs not at all about the you know just being there to travel and take a picture it aposs really about the storytelling about journalism about truth about telling people stories about making
