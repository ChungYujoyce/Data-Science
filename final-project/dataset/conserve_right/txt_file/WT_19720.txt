ndicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic former vice president joseph r biden may have placated progressives by switching positions on taxpayer funded abortions but he also put his brand at risk by swerving to the left of moderate and working class voters at the heart of his 2020 election strategy conservatives and pro life activists argue that mr biden the democratic presidential primary front runner made a stunning tactical error by reversing his 40 year support for the hyde amendment which prohibits federal funding for most abortions while joe biden may be taking a political expedient position in the democratic primary as candidates race to the left on abortion he will pay the price in the general election said marjorie dannenfelser president of the susan b anthony list which supports pro life candidates top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning democratic clerk charged with

abortion while 36 percent supported it until thursday mr biden was the only top democratic candidate who openly backed the hyde amendment joe biden is supposed to be the one candidate who can win back working class democrats who backed trump ms dannenfelser said in a statement this will prove to be a fatal move should he be the nominee joebiden s flip on the hyde amendment will prove to be a fatal move should he be the nominee says marjoriesba https t co ttyjt4rk4p a day after his campaign reaffirmed his hyde amendment support mr biden announced thursday he had changed his mind at a democratic national committee fundraiser in atlanta for many years as a u s senator i ve supported the hyde amendment so i make no apologies in my last position and i make no apologies for what i m about to say mr biden said if i believe health care is a right as i do i can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone s zip code he referred to red states passing bills this year restricting abortion access notably fetal heartbeat bills which ban most abortions after about six weeks none of the laws have taken effect and all are expected to be locked in court battles for years mr biden s stance on federal abortion funding is now essentially the same as the other top democratic presidential contenders boosting his primary chances on the left while weakening his claim to the moderate middle a move that could come backfire if he wins the nomination there are many democrats setting aside the pro life democrats there are moderately pro choice democrats who biden i think was right there with them and now he s going to tug tug tug over to this really shocking position that s becoming basically mainstream in the democratic party said conservative pundit guy benson on fox news live action s lila rose said that there is no longer any candidate in the democratic field that pro lifers can support a poll released thursday by cnn found that 30 percent of adults would only

parenthood counters that its abortion services are not supported by federal dollars planned parenthood affiliates perform abortions in the same facilities and clinics used for other medical procedures such as std and hiv testing mr biden s reversal also opens the door to questions about his stance on partial birth abortion which he voted to ban in 2003 the procedure is used in late term abortions which received a green light this year in the illinois new york and vermont legislatures the democrat controlled illinois legislature voted to repeal that state s partial birth abortion ban as part of its sweeping reproductive health act now at the desk of democratic gov j b pritzker who is expected to sign it his dramatic u turn on taxpayer funded abortion is just the beginning of the candidate biden vs senator biden abortion debate said maureen malloy ferguson senior fellow of the catholic association in a statement does he stand by his senate vote to ban late term partial birth abortions
