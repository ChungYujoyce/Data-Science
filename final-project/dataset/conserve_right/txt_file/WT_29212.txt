want to emphasize we don t need to take it that far where we change the narrative of the story he said he told pence the lawmakers attending agreed that the chant was inappropriate and could prove a harmful distraction and pence concurred and said he d discuss it with trump said another participant who described the conversation on condition of anonymity in north carolina trump berated each of the four congresswomen and said they never have anything good to say that s why i say hey if you don t like it let em leave let em leave he added i think in some cases they hate our country his
