tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion most of us have vivid memories from september 11 2001 many remember where they were who they were with and the feelings they had as they watched the twin towers fall in new york city i remember searching the various news outlets all that day looking for fresh and accurate information eventually settling on shepherd smith s reporting on fox news the reason i opted to watch shep was that unlike others who were wildly speculating about what was happening with little or no evidence to back up their claims and fears smith broke things down into two very simple categories 1 here s what we know and 2 here s what we don t know on a very emotional and confusing day shep smith kept it factual fast forward to march of 2019 and special counsel robert mueller s report on president trump and allegations of collusion with russia during the 2016 campaign emotions are running high on both sides of the political fence and the hyperbole from each party is difficult to stomach in an effort to emulate the work of shep smith back on that dark day in september of 2001 allow me to share what we do know and what we don t know about the mueller report top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey what we know the special counsel s work took 675 days his team consisted of 19 attorneys 40 fbi agents intelligence analysts forensic accountants and other professional staff the team issued 2 800 subpoenas they interviewed 500 individual witnesses and obtained nearly 500 search warrants including the offices files and computer records of mr trump s former personal attorney the office of the special counsel got more than 230 orders for communications records issued almost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers and made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence we know president trump answered mr mueller s questions in writing we know the special counsel s work was not cheap through september of 2018 the investigation had cost in excess of 25 million we know separately the house intelligence and senate intelligence and judiciary held 28 hearings and issued three related reports grand total of nearly 42 million we know the mainstream media was obsessed with the story according to the media research center between mr trump s inauguration and the march 21 2019 evening newscasts on abc nbc and cbs spent a combined 2 284 minutes over 38 hours on the mueller investigation in 2019 their coverage was 92 percent negative against president trump we know it has been the no 1 issue in americans for the duration of the investigation the social media analytics company newswhip says that since may 2017 there have been 533 074 web articles published about russia and trump mueller these articles have generated a whopping 245 million interactions including likes comments and shares on twitter and facebook we know that the special counsel found no evidence of mr trump or the trump campaign colluding with the russians we know this because the attorney general of the united states william barr told us so after he reviewed the special counsel report one can be quite sure that if that information was contrary to the contents of the report someone from team mueller would have spoken up what we don t know former cia director john brennan spoke on more than one occasion on cable news networks of having first hand knowledge of evidence of trump russia collusion one would assume a former cia director might have intel most of the rest of us don t we don t know what that alleged evidence was what the source of it was or why the mueller team found none of it in their exhaustive search we do know a red faced brennan has acknowledged that despite his previous surety he must have received some bad intelligence congresswoman maxine waters before during and after the special counsel investigation has repeated some variation of with all the evidence we already know of in the trump russia collusion case over and over even after the attorney general provided his initial summary this past weekend ms waters again referenced all the evidence we already know of we don t know what alleged evidence she is referring to nor why the special counsel found none of it congressman adam schiff is the chairman of the house intelligence committee as such he has access to information most americans cannot reach mr schiff has spent nearly two years talking about the mountains of evidence of collusion between mr trump and the russians we don t know what the alleged evidence he referenced was nor why the special counsel failed to find any of it mr schiff also believes that despite the two years 19 attorneys 40 fbi agents and countless others that worked on the special counsel report costing tens of millions of taxpayer dollars that congress must investigate the matter further we don t know why he believes they are likely to find a different outcome than the special counsel msnbc news personality chris matthews complained on air shortly after the attorney general received the mueller report and it became apparent there was no wrong doing on the part of president trump mr matthews wanted to know how could they let him trump get away with this we don t know what mr matthews meant by this or what law he believes this violated more that we do know we know one 2016 presidential campaign did take information from the russians paid for it and attempted to use it to impact the outcome of the election when that failed they used it to impact the presidency itself we know that was the hillary clinton campaign we know one 2016 presidential campaign chairman had an existing relationship with the russians and conducted business with them that netted him tens of millions of dollars we know that was john podesta chairman of hillary clinton s campaign in 2016 we know one u s president promised vladimir putin he would have more flexibility more room to maneuver after his election we know that was president obama conclusions all of the information above breaks down what we know and what we don t you may make your own conclusions from that information in the meantime attorney general william barr has promised a more comprehensive look at the report and hopes to scrub it of parts that are prohibited by law from being made public then release all that remains house and senate democrats have demanded it be released in its entirety despite knowing the law doesn t allow this which means no matter what mr barr eventually makes public they will feign dissatisfaction bottom line keep an eye out for all details as they become available but don t fall for the speculation and conjecture in the meantime each of us should make an effort to determine what you know what you don t know and react ac
