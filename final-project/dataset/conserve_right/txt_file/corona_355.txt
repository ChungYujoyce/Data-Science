that sanders medicare for all proposal has no chance of passing a republican controlled senate and claimed that if sanders supporters want a revolution now they should support his obamacare like plan we can do that now he stated i can get that passed both candidates attacked each other for fueling their campaigns through super pacs though both denied the other s claims sanders asked biden to disavow his super pac while biden claimed sanders had nine pacs funding his campaign the second hour of the debate featured a number of questions on key issues to liberal voters which both candidates

comments praising former cuban dictator fidel castro s literacy programs and his sunday lines on china just moments prior the praising of cuba the praising just now of china china is an authoritarian dictatorship biden noted that s what it is we have to deal with them because they are there the idea of occasionally saying something nice about a country is one thing he continued the idea of praising a country that is violating human rights around the world is in fact makes our allies wonder what is going on these are flat out dictators period and they should be called for it straight up the moderators noted that when looking at the results from the primary states to vote thus far both candidates are struggling with key demographics biden receives significantly less support than sanders from hispanic voters while sanders has the same problem with the african american community look my message is resonating across the board biden said when asked to address his lackluster
