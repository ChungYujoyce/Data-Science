the virus will be vanquished by a cocktail of drugs and brazil s tropical climate it s possible but analysts say a more calculated political gamble may underlie his increasingly defiant position

normal and people get back to work his athletic past he said rendered him impervious to the virus the next morning he told reporters he and his health minister would decide to isolate only high risk
