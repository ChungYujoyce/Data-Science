december quarter growth inched down to 6 8 percent the weakest quarterly expansion in six years china s growth has fallen steadily over the past five years as the ruling communist party tries to steer

once seen as an engine of global growth that has depressed international financial markets even as the united states and europe show signs of improvement official data do not point to a hard landing in the fourth quarter of 2015 but they provide little reason to stop worrying about china s drag on the global economy either said economist bill adams of pnc financial services group in a report growth was in line with private sector forecasts and the ruling communist party s official target of about 7 percent for the year china s shanghai composite jumped 3 2 percent and other asian markets also rose investors were relieved that more pessimistic forecasts about fourth quarter growth were wrong and also expect beijing to continue rolling out stimulus measures to prevent a hard landing beijing responded to ebbing growth by cutting interest rates six times since november 2014 and launched measures to help exporters and other industries but economists note china still relies on state

activity said louis kuijs of oxford economics in a report meanwhile though consumption continued to expand robustly supported by solid wage growth said kuijs the robust growth in the consumption and services nexus is key for policymakers they need it to avoid labor market stress global financial markets were rattled by a plunge in chinese stock prices in june chinese stock markets have little to do with the rest of its state dominated economy but investors abroad took the decline as a sign the economy as weaker than thought a growing number of private sector analysts question the reliability of china s data suggesting economic growth is much weaker than reported julian evans pritchard of capital economics said other measures of activity suggested economic growth in the latest quarter was 4 5 percent though that still would be among the world s strongest spending on online commerce grew by 33 3 percent over 2014 an encouraging sign for official efforts to nurture a consumer economy
