ats are looking to regain the majority in the senate come november jacqui heinrich reports want fox news halftime report in your inbox every day sign uphere presenting your senate power rankingsit may be helpful to think about this year s senate contests in the way that meteorologists think about river levels in a hurricane it depends on how big the storm is out on the ocean and where it hits while a popular incumbent senator can make his or her own weather in a midterm year think ofjoe manchinwinning re election in maga fied west virginia in 2018 in presidential years it aposs extremely hard to fight the current republicans currently control the senate with 53 seats to democrats 47 thirty five senate seats are on the ballot this fall 23 republican and 12 democratic to take control of the chamber democrats need a net gain of four seats or three seats and the vice presidency we see 10 seats right now as being at least potentially competitive this cycle and all but two of them are republican held so it s certainly fair to say that the senate is within reach for the blue team but it isn t that simple many of these seats are frommitch mcconnell s greatest triumph of the obama era democratic held seats in traditionally republican or swing states where the then president s approval rating was the pits this was the class that made the republican majority defeating democratic incumbents in five states and flipping four more open seats for a jaw dropping nine seat reversal the largest since 1998 the bad news for republicans is that means they are defending a lot more seats this cycle similar to the disadvantage democrats had in 2018 the good news for republicans is that most of the seats are in states their party won in the last presidential election in a hard to forecast presidential year handicapping senate races is tricky given the fact that such a wide range of outcomes on the presidential level is possible from a democratic landslide to the republican incumbent improving on his 2016 victory we need to be capacious in our initial list we still don t know the size or direction of the hurricane of a presidential election churning in the steamy waters of late spring we also don t yet know much about the challengers especially with coronavirus delayed primary elections it will be months more before we know who is challenging whom in several races we also don t know which incumbents are neatly rigged for stormy weather and which will come apart in a gale but here s a place to start you ll find the most competitive races above the fold as toss ups then below the fold there are less competitive races that are still worth watching lean republican or lean democratic we expect lots to change as the primary calendar plays out and the national race goes on as always we love hearing your assessments and observations toss upsarizonaincumbent martha mcsally r democratic primary august 4republican held since 1969last election mcsally appointed in 20192016 presidential result trump by 3 5 pointsthis is the race democrats love the best mcsally is a former congresswoman who lost her 2018 bid but was appointed to the senate anyway after sen john kyl tapped to replace the latejohn mccain retired mcsally s loss to now sen kyrsten sinema resentment over mcsally s appointment and arizona s new status as a swing state would have made her a prime target no matter what but when national democrats landedmark kelly a retired astronaut and the husband of popular former rep gabby giffords the blue team was all in on arizona while kelly has to wait for august to be crowned the nominee his fundraising and endorsements reflect a unified democratic effort one upside for mcsally because arizona is a presidential swing state she will continue to benefit from spending and voter mobilization for the national race coloradoincumbent cory gardner r democratic primary june 30republican held since 2014last election gardner 48 2 mark udall d 46 3 2016 presidential result clinton by 4 9 pointsgardner s 2014 win was perhaps the high water line for republicans in that midterm year colorado has become increasingly hostile to the gop in recent years so beating an incumbent especially one with a famous last name in western politics there was a big deal gardner a former congressman executed a near perfect campaign but things look different this time around with democrats heavily favored to win the state again on the presidential level gardner faces seeking re election with a republican president unpopular in his home state but maybe the biggest difference is in gardner s likely opponent former gov john hickenloopermay not have been popular with democratic primary voters but his popularity hasn t wavered at home gardner will have to show he can make this a real race in the early summer or he may find funds hard to come by good news for voters both are temperate thoughtful men so the race may be a shade better than the typical mud wrestling match north carolinaincumbent thom tillis r democratic nominee cal cunninghamrepublican held since 2014 last election 2014 tillis 48 8 kay hagan d 47 3 2016 presidential result trump by 3 6

repeats his solid showing of 2016 tillis has every reason to expect re election but he may face the same fate as his predecessor former sen hagan tillis the former speaker of the state house of representatives ran as a mainstream moderate alternative to an incumbent he said was too closely connected to a president unpopular in the tar heel state with cunningham democrats hope to run the same operation he s an army reserve colonel and a former state senator from the winston salem suburbs who is careful to maintain his moderate brand if trump struggles in north carolina tillis could certainly find himself haganed maineincumbent susan collins r democratic primary july 14republican held since 1979last election 2014 collins 68 5 state sen shenna bellows d 31 5 2016 presidential

the same span every cycle democrats say this time will be different but there s reason to think they might be right this time collins brand has been perfect for a maine republican in her previous four victories she s a moderate on social issues who favors big defense spending and generally maintained her independence regardless of who was in the white house but collins got sucked into the culture wars in a big way with the confirmation hearings for now justicebrett kavanaugh whose nomination she was instrumental in saving collins lost the backing of feminist supporters and found herself an immediate target for pro choice groups democrats are lining up behind state house speakersara gideonand working on the assumption that trump s stock has fallen with mainers believe this is the year to

8 state rep amanda curtis40 1 2016 presidential result trump by 20 3 pointsthe advantage of incumbency is a great deal about having a famous name but it won t likely work that way in montana this year despite republicans holding the state on the presidential level for almost three decades montana often goes democratic for its senators including daines stable mate jon tester the same goes for governors including current gov steve bullock after abandoning his long shot presidential campaign bullock jumped in the senate race causing big headaches for daines bullock is moderate popular and a household name likely better known than the incumbent he is facing daines got into the senate without a real test his 2014 opponent was a little funded very young state legislator who was picked after the incumbent democrat dropped out amid a resume scandal the good news for daines is that we can pretty much tell which way the wind will be blowing in montana state politicos don t expect trump to do quite so well this time around but a double digit winner at the top of the ticket would do him lots of good denotes incumbent the rulebook when you know you know you know experience is the oracle of

rhode island and virginiafrom the bleachers from friday s halftime report on the would you pull a ford vp biden play and i quote below chairman peter rodino the jerry nadler of his day summoned ford to testify in mid october pellegrino peter rodino was a womb to tomb democrat no question there and highly liberal and partisan to the core but the only comparison nadler is both were house judiciary chairman pete rodino was a good man at heart and nadler is not it would be as if to calltip o neillthenancy pelosiof his day and that is so wrong also keep up the otherwise insightful writing gregg hart buffalo grove ill ed note politicians are like toddlers at a restaurant every one but yours is unbearable i certainly didn t mean the rodinio nadler comparison in a universal sense only practical but i m very sure we could have found lots of nixon backers in 1974 who did not share your kindly view of rodino s motives and morals i also think we could find today lots of democrats who think that nadler is a good person too maybe just as many as there are republicans who share your assessment partisanship creates screwy incentives for character judgement just run the current president and his three most recent predecessors through the partisan grinder how would democrats have received a republicanbill clinton s sexual misconduct how would republicans have treatedgeorge w bush s often hostile relationship with american english if he had been a democrat what would democrats have had to say about republicanbarack obama s looming self regard how would republicans view democraticdonald trumpabout his solipsism what we find refreshing or charming in someone we like we find grating in someone we dislike that s true with our family and friends and it aposs certainly true with partisan loyalties i try to remember that no matter how noxious someone is to me there s probably somebody somewhere who loves them and when i assess someone s conduct i try to test it against my response if it had come from someone else i liked your piece about thegerald fordpardon and it got me thinking never a good sign recall that ford did not pardon nixon for actual crimes but rather for any crimes he may have committed i wonder if trump would consider granting a pardon to obama for any crimes he may have committed wouldn t that set the cat mongst the pigeons george fuller st louis ed note now that would be the nobel prize in presidential trolling predecessor and his 2016 rival punished it s a terrible cycle that if sustained will quickly lead to ruin please clarify if the intent of this commentary paragraph is to suggest that the nation accept a potential overthrow of the peoples choice for the result of the 2016 election if it is proven that a cabal of persons attempted to subvert the 2016 election results for the presidency i cannot believe that you are suggesting there should be no punishment for the crimes possibly committed please clarify this paragraph for me david l kramer sr wesley chapel fla ed note we could debate the specifics but it certainly is not far fetched to argue that john kennedyand his team stole the 1960 election illinois was a fraud o rama and there are lots of questions about the numbers from louisiana and texas the home of landslide lyndon johnson not only do we know it now butrichard nixonknew it then nixon decided that claiming fraud would be too divisive and that given the unlikelihood of a clear reversal doing so would not only undercut national unity and respect for institutions but end up leaving him looking like a sore loser anyway it was the same thinking that led nixon to resign rather than be impeached of course it was partly his recollection of 1960 that led nixon to cheat in 1972 despite a clear path to re election in their presidencies kennedy and johnson had both engaged in serious misdeeds including using federal agencies to target their political rivals one of the frustrations that nixon s supporters had was they felt their man got the political death penalty for things that had been winked at before or how aboutbill clintonselling presidential favors our recent history is littered with presidential misconduct some of it very serious but in all of those cases their successors opted to not prolong what were politically charged investigations in favor of unity and forward progress ifjoe bidenwere to follow trump s lead and demand the prosecution of his predecessor how would that go would the biden justice department be viewed as more impartial by republicans then than the current administration is seen by democrats today criminalizing politics erodes confidence in both criminal justice and politicians certainly members of administrations should be subject to the criminal code and when merited carefully and impartially prosecuted but when it comes to presidents the better remedies for misconduct are removal from office by voters or congress your view of politicians being responsible for the bad government simply does not contort with the facts but it s the one voters would probably be most inclined to want done if the voters did not want the criminality that kennedy lbj nixon et al were responsible for they would never have been presidents want proof that it is the american people that are responsible for bad corrupt govt simply look at the current president and the presumptive nominee all that is left is for the usa to make the other parties views illegal and start jailing the opposition and you have completed the wishes of one half or the other aposs true dream come true who are you blaming again i blame the voters you can see by my name my heritage thucydides made the dangers of what the voters would probably be most inclined to do quite clear and it ain t pretty george chapogas rivas nicaragua ed note you re not all wrong mr chapogas but i would say that our system is very much arranged these days to shut out the majority of voters who are less partisan and favor moderation our two party system is failing us in part because the parties themselves have lost the ability to function as intended i think given the chance to vote for a unifying candidate if the person had an impressive resume and good character americans would go for it in a big way voters are responsible for their choices but we have to take the system in which they are
