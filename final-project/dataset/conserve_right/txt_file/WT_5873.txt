prepared to tap other suppliers and to conserve parts that they had stored now they face fast moving new threats that seem beyond their control falling sales and sickened factory workers as the covid 19 disease spreads through the united states and europe the result is that the auto industry which helped lead the u s economy out of the financial meltdown more than a decade ago could be forced to reduce spending slow or shutter factories and draw upon cash stockpiles to weather a pandemic that is likely to tilt the world into a recession top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in

garrett nelson senior equity analyst with cfra said auto sales in china are a good harbinger of what would happen as the virus spreads further in the u s and other countries sales in china fell 44 during the first two months of the year including an 82 plunge in february with much of the country on lockdown in the seattle area which is suffering through the worst covid 19 outbreak in the nation

three customers so far that said they won t come down here weston said we have employees now that are saying they won t come in if the people aren t going to be contained sales she said were pretty decent during the first week of march despite the outbreak then word got out about the hotel and traffic tanked we are getting a few customers but very few she said keeping factories open may also be

or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough for some especially older adults and people with existing health problems it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia the vast majority of people recover from the new virus initially when the virus was just in china it looked as though the auto industry would face a formidable parts supply problem the area around wuhan the epicenter for covid 19 is home to many auto plants with substantial parts exports but automakers had stocked up on parts in the fourth quarter ahead of a u s china trade deal and before the chinese new year holiday in january said kristin dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research an industry think tank in michigan it s not clear yet whether that stockpile will help delay production halts or mitigate them until factories restart once the virus eventually ebbs she said dziczek cautioned that even a disruption of one part could depress some u s auto production we need all the parts to make a car she said we can t do it with 99 9 once it became clear in january that the virus would be a serious threat auto and parts makers established task forces and war rooms to locate other parts

barra said the company was prepared to manage parts shortages in the united states into late march since then spokesman jim cain has noted since then that auto and parts plants in china have started to come back on line but dziczek said that while production is starting to return in china the virus is now affecting other countries that also make parts analysts say some parts suppliers could face cash flow problems if the virus continues to spread and sales and production fall should that happen automakers might not want to keep factories open anyway layoffs would be possible some countries could slip into recession if it goes so widespread you can t control it said lmc s schuster we ll have to see how it plays out that said whenever the crisis is resolved sales are likely to rebound swiftly from pent up demand as people who had been seeking new vehicles return to the market there is a feeling that things will come back quickly and that the economic fundamentals remain schuster
