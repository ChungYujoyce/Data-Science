n should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion william barr the attorney general of the united states now faces a likely contempt citation for failing to comply with a congressional subpoena and for misleading congress this is about the mueller investigation of russian interference in the 2016 presidential election isn t the investigation now complete how did the attorney general s veracity become an issue and thereby extend the life of the investigation here is the backstory when special counsel robert mueller completed his 448 page final report of his nearly two year investigation of russian interference in the 2016 presidential election the trump campaign and its relationships to russian agents and the personal efforts of president donald trump to impede the investigation he complied with the federal rules and delivered his report to the attorney general mr barr examined the report and decided to undertake two approaches to releasing it to congress and to the public top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century the first approach was to summarize its principal conclusions and the second was to redact from public and congressional view materials that federal statutes and court rules prohibit him from making public so late on a sunday afternoon in april mr barr authored a four page summary of mr mueller s conclusions which related that mr mueller and his team of fbi agents and prosecutors could not establish the existence of a conspiracy between the trump campaign and russian agents for the campaign to receive something of value from the russians mr barr offered the opinion that this conclusion exonerated mr trump on the conspiracy what the media falsely called collusion charge the second statement in mr barr s four page summary was that while mr mueller found evidence of obstruction of justice by mr trump personally he left the decision of how to proceed with this evidence to mr barr mr barr then concluded that the president would not be prosecuted in the meantime mr barr and his team began to scrutinize in private every word in mr mueller s report so as to reveal only what federal statutes and court rules permit to be revealed while this process was going on some folks on mr mueller s team leaked to the media their displeasure with mr barr s four page letter because they felt it had sanitized the report and failed to capture the flavor tone and gravity of the allegations it made against mr trump personally after media outlets published the story of this disenchantment mr mueller himself sent a letter to mr barr essentially objecting to the same matters that some on his team had complained about to the media while government officials often disagree with each other this little spat over whether mr barr s summary was faithful to mr mueller s report became important because of the following seemingly innocuous event when mr barr was testifying before a house subcommittee about his budgetary requests for the department of justice in the next fiscal year he was asked by a member of the subcommittee if he knew anything about any criticisms by members of mr mueller s team about his four page summary of mr mueller s conclusions he replied no i don t but of course mr barr did know because mr mueller told him in his letter of the complaints his office had about the four page letter did the attorney general deceive congress the democratic members of the judiciary committee grilled the attorney general later on this and he offered that a follow up telephone call between himself and mr mueller dissipated mr mueller s written complaint yet the fact that mr mueller a seasoned government official wrote a letter about this knowing its near certain permanent residence in government files is telling he made a permanent record of his complaint about mr barr s sanitized letter and mr barr hid that record from congress at the same time that all of the above was transpiring the house judiciary committee subpoenaed the full unredacted mueller report from mr barr and he dropped the ball again instead of challenging the subpoena before a federal judge and asking her to rule on the lawfulness of compliance mr barr ignored it this produced calls for the house to hold him in contempt a largely symbolic gesture yet an unpleasant one for mr barr what s going on here it is clear that mr barr s four page letter about which mr mueller complained to mr barr and some of mr mueller s team complained to the media was a foolish attempt to sanitize the mueller report it was misleading disingenuous and deceptive also because mr barr knew that all or nearly all of the mueller report would soon enter the public domain it was dumb and insulting mr barr knows the doj is not in the business of exonerating the people it investigates yet he proclaimed in his letter that mr trump had been exonerated when the report revealed 127 communications between russian agents and trump campaign officials in a 16 month period and the expectations of those officials of the release of hillary clinton s hacked emails that is hardly an exoneration was mr barr s testimony before congress deceptive in a word yes in a bit of bitter irony the statute that the house democrats now claim mr barr violated is the same obstruction of justice statute that mr mueller says the president violated engaging in deceptive or diversionary behavior for a corrupt purpose in order to impede a government investigation or inquiry this is a gravely serious charge against the attorney general mr barr s prosecutors regularly prosecute defendants for doing what it now appears mr barr has done and the president last weekend added fuel to this fire by changing his mind on whether he will allow mr mueller to testify publicly about his report he now won t permit it history teaches that these unpleasant events like watergate and whitewater can take on lives of their own and can often have unintended consequences but the lesson is always the same it would be better for all of us if the whole truth comes out and comes out soon andrew p napolitano
