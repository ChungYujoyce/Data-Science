public and international affairs at cuny s baruch college what s more people just don t like him polls show de blasio has the dubious distinction of being the only candidate or potential candidate out of 23 contenders to earn a negative rating among national democrats in a march monmouth university survey a total of 24 percent gave him a thumbs down while just 18 percent had a favorable view of him at home the numbers are even worse a staggering 76 percent of big apple voters don t think he should run according to an april quinnipiac university poll see also new york thinks de blasio s got no shot at 2020 presidential election he says he s not a betting man but mayor bill since de blasio was elected the 109th mayor in 2013 on a tale of two cities platform he s disappointed many of the liberals who put him in office the city s long struggling housing authority collapsed under the weight of a lead poisoning scandal culminating in a federal lawsuit alleging a massive cover up of toxic living conditions and a repair bill that hit an eye watering 32 billion in 2018 de blasio was forced to accept federal oversight of nycha to settle a lawsuit brought by manhattan federal prosecutors and has embraced the partial privatization once an anathema as one way to pay for renovations at many of its 325 projects while nycha rotted the city s homelessness crisis ballooned roughly 60 000 new

pet projects including pre k expansion de blasio ducked federal and state charges in 2017 after he was accused of handing out favors in exchange for donations to his political group but the city department of investigation concluded in 2018 that the mayor hit up individuals and companies with matters pending before city agencies to fill the coffers of the campaign for one new york and the corruption claims linger city comptroller scott stringer has subpoenaed the mayor for information about a 173 million real estate deal with developers stuart and jay podolsky who are represented by politically connected brooklyn attorney frank carone the city paid the podolskys 30 million above the appraised price for 21 buildings in the bronx and brooklyn to create more affordable housing carone donated 5 000 to de blasio s fairness pac last fall the mayor has defended the price tag saying it was cheaper than taking the properties by eminent domain he s also said there was nothing wrong with accepting carone s cash because it was cleared by his lawyers the scandal will likely follow de blasio on the campaign trail where he d rather talk up his progressive message of free pre k and paid sick leave they re the two shining examples from his time at city hall before he took office in 2013 there were under 20 000 city kids in public pre kindergarten now 70 000 4 year olds are

qualify for the debate because his poll numbers don t meet the 1 percent threshold history is also not on de blasio s side there are reasons why mayors of new york city haven t done well in national politics and that s because people don t associate with their problems with those problems said birdsell the cuny dean the checkered past goes back to 1812 when new york city mayor dewitt clinton lost to incumbent james madison john lindsay s 1972 white house bid petered out during the primaries and rudy giuliani came up short in 2008 the mayor must spend time bulking up his campaign team his
