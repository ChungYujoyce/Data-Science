grads our democracy is at risk ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century china always tightens security for high profile events like much of the rest of the world london for instance restricted air traffic during the olympics but many of beijing s rules seem extraordinary perhaps in an effort to smooth a once a decade transition that already has been bumpy bo xilai once a candidate for the all powerful politburo s standing committee suffered a spectacular fall from grace in which his wife was convicted of murder one of president hu jintao s closest aides was demoted apparently after his son was killed alongside two partially dressed women in an accident in his ferrari meanwhile protests over pollution land seizures and local corruption continue across the country human rights groups report that activists and petitioners are being rounded up ahead of the congress but the broader security measures may best illustrate how china is trying to leave absolutely no room for disruptions the government has blocked searches for the phrase 18th party congress on websites including china s popular twitter like sina weibo internet posters manage to get around that by using characters that sound like party congress one substitute sparta taxi drivers have been told to remove window handles to avoid sensitive parts of the city and not to open their

foreigners their passports when buying remote controlled model aircraft the official global times newspaper reported tuesday one toy store owner said authorities had told him to stop selling medium and large size planes this kind of plane can t fly over long distances and it can hardly carry anything said chen ziping holding up a model about 1 feet long they just told me to stop selling it and i have to follow the order the global times quoted an unnamed police officer from aoyuncun station in the chaoyang district as saying that people wanting to buy model planes during the congress should go to the vendor s local police station to register when the buyer receives approval from the station s police chief he can make the purchase the officer said still buyers won t be allowed to fly model planes in the city and balloons also are on the blacklist the newspaper said it cited another officer from the chaoyang district public security bureau as saying that pigeon owners must keep their birds in their coops during the congress chen jieren had a run in with the security rules sunday after the handle of his knife broke while he was cooking dinner he took his id card to the supermarket knowing that people must show identification when buying knives during sensitive periods well it didn t work this time mr chen said in a telephone interview i was told by the police that no more knives can be sold not even pencil sharpeners and i don t think the shopkeeper was kidding because several days ago i saw myself that police were asking the sales assistants in the stationer s not to sell pencil sharpeners i went back and got an old knife and tried to sharpen it i guess i have to live with it until the congress finishes he added glumly wang ye an engineer from beijing who
