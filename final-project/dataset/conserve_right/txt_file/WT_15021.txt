toughness secrets of the world class in many respects we ve lost our way presuming superiority without feeling we have to prove it said michael farr a cnbc contributor and president of the investment firm farr miller and washington we were a frontier people a founding people said alan dowd a foreign policy writer and senior fellow with the sagamore institute an indianapolis based public policy foundation we forged an empire of our own defeated european and asian totalitarians then faced down moscow now what has there been a softening i think it s a fair question whatever nation signs of our cultural anxiety abound a vague but creeping sense of unease if not yet a red cardigan clad president carter esque crisis of confidence from the political right it s the conviction that america s inherent entrepreneurial drive and bootstrappin ethos are being smothered by the loving terminal embrace of the nanny state creating an entitlement society of big government teat suckling sheeple from the left it s the notion that the nation is too materialistic overfed dumbed down and distracted by bread and circuses and fox news to tackle large scale problems requiring collective effort for instance climate change let alone halt the looting of the country by a system gaming cabal of wealthy corporate and political interests looking abroad we re afraid that other nations most notably a

was prohibited from tallying more than three touchdowns per game otherwise according to his school principal the gifted boy would score almost every time he touched the ball as if that s a bad thing in a recent time magazine cover story veteran political scribe joe klein wrote that during a tour of the midwest and texas the vast majority of the people he spoke with were in general agreement that americans had gotten soft and had a sense that the unprecedented affluence of the past 60 years had caused a certain lassitude that we weren t working as hard as we used to meanwhile in the trendier parts of brooklyn about as far from the heartland as say paris hipsters have embraced a neo lumberjack aesthetic of flannel shirts and brawny man before his metrosexual makeover beards umm compensating much have we gone soft pondered thomas connell a cross cultural communications consultant and instructor at the washington based national defense university physically speaking it s inarguable nicknamed dr culture mr connell teaches foreign nationals about american mores and habits his students invariably marvel at two things a the number of diabetes equipment ads on american television b the sheer size read abject tubbiness of their red white and blue hosts if we re out of shape we re out of discipline and that affects the mental side as well mr connell said we ve gotten soft in education soft politically soft in our attitudes we value being smart too little and being stupid far too much these days internationals want to modernize without westernizing many of the dynamics that made us great are still here but it s almost as if we ve become the whatever nation the great softening once upon a time the whatever nation produced the atom bomb and the marshall plan we built the hoover dam we responded to sputnik with the moon landing the greatest moment in the histories of both human achievement and in your face one upmanship we invented the microchip and the beer cozy and while lesser nations suffered the dual indignities of lukewarm beef patties and soggy lettuce and tomato our esteemed envied temples of industry and innovation birthed the mcdlt that was then in the here and now we ve botched katrina and iraq bungled the stimulus and solyndra blown any hope of a college football playoff or putting casey anthony behind bars we build bridges to nowhere we no longer send astronauts into space with our own rockets instead we rely on russia yet seem to open new cupcake boutiques faster than a neutrino in a european not american particle accelerator softness is everywhere no doubt about it mr seibold said in business in personal life there s a pervasive sense of entitlement we have the collective emotional maturity of a spoiled teenager we know more about who is winning on dancing with the stars than what s going on in our government survey the economic indicators and it s easy to see why america needs a pep talk our infrastructure is crumbling unemployment is high and stubborn wages have stagnated since the 1970s standard and poor s recently downgraded our national credit rating for the first time ever according to foreign affairs our federal debt as a percentage of gdp rose from 32 percent to 67 percent from 2001 to 2009 a borrowing binge to match the now busted balance sheets of state and local governments not to mention our tapped out private households from 1999 to 2009 our share of global gdp fell from 23 percent to 20 percent while china s increased from 7 percent to 13 percent putting china on course to surpass our economic output by 2016 from the perspective of innovation we are losing our competitive edge nicholas ashford a professor at mit and co author with ralph hall of technology globalization and sustainable development transforming the industrial state said money has been chasing money in this country but it has not been chasing innovation geopolitically america still retains the means to bomb just about anyone we deem threatening our military remains hard question is can we afford it our frustrating inconclusive occupations of afghanistan and iraq deposing saddam hussein good inadvertently strengthening iranian influence bad are winding down largely because they cost too much darn money a trend that shows no sign of abating according to the congressional research service the cost of supporting an active duty service member increased 33 percent between 1999 and 2005 the leader of the free world seems increasingly ok with leading from behind at this rate the world s policeman will soon be reduced to manning guard shacks at the front and rear gates to fortress america on the cultural front new york times columnist cum zeitgeist tea leaf decoder david brooks frets that america has become a genteel nation read squeezably soft by abandoning practical productive pursuits for pleasant enlightened ones put another way we ve become a country of communications and leisure studies majors falling behind in an engineering and computer science world on the right there s the tea party sense that the poor and unemployed lack accountability and that the occupy movement is the province of spoiled whiners as herman cain put it if you don t have a job and you re not rich blame yourself meanwhile the left fumes over the wealthy going soft jettisoning moral hazard by socializing risk all the while carping that the obama administration is anti business despite record corporate profits one thing everyone except treasury secretary timothy geithner agrees on we ve totally coddled bankers we are still settling for wall street executives who leveraged 40 1 to walk while the taxpayer pays mr farr said in his recent book the arrogant cycle mr farr argues that the financial crisis stemmed in part from cultural overconfidence and irresponsibility i talk to tea party folks and occupy wall street folks he said many are reasonably articulate but nobody seems to have a mirror nobody wants to talk about their own credit card bills about the average household debt doubling from 55 percent to 111 percent between 1980 and 2009 it wasn t just washington doing deficit spending collectively we have no inclination to endure pain or live within our means we say we want accountability but we re not willing to vote for it fat drunk and stupid speaking of coddling in the case of america v softness our schools are exhibit a sat scores plateaued in the 1960s the world economic forum ranks our overall educational system 26th in the world behind those of canada and singapore if america s classrooms were a college basketball team they d be in the also receiving votes category of the weekly polls time reports that american children spend less time in school than many of their international counterparts by the end of high school the average south korean spends almost two additional years in class in the highly ranked highly competitive finnish education system all teachers are required to have master s degrees and only one in 10 applicants to teacher training programs is accepted in the united states by contrast half of our teachers graduated in the bottom third of their college class while the rest of the world has been catching up our educational system from kindergarten through high school has slowly been collapsing mr ashford said so the basic skills understanding and talent of people coming into the universities is not what it used to be student softness isn t helping according to san diego state professor jean twenge research indicates that the percentage of high school and college students who spend 10 or more hours weekly on homework has declined since the 1970s a separate study of time use by college students found that just 23 percent of their weekday time was spent on classes and studying and that 50 percent of their weekly time went to socializing and leisure during the same period in which study hours decreased ms twenge said the percentage of students graduating with an a average doubled better grades for less work she said so why should we work our idea of overpraising and thinking that you re good instead of being good has lead to a rise in entitlement and narcissism literally the author of generation me and co author of the narcissism epidemic ms twenge notes that college students scores on the standard psychological test for narcissism have steadily risen since the 1980s for that matter so have the rates of plastic surgery the number of parents giving children unique names to stand out the amount of antisocial and narcissistic language in song lyrics the size of our homes and our self professed desire to wield authority over other people meanwhile our self reported desire to work hard has dropped as has the amount of weight that industrial workers are willing to lift on the job the cultural results one of the essential traits in narcissism is being unrealistic ms twenge said not thinking long term overconfidence taking too many risks is there a better explanation of the financial meltdown entitlement is there too a feeling of i deserve this even if it looks like i can t pay for it a more concise raison d etre for america s broken balance sheets there s vanity wanting people to notice you thinking everyone is entitled to your opinion you end up with people who think they know everything but actually don t hello reality tv also congress overall it s toxic to society ms twenge said in terms of going soft we re not going to be able to compete in a global market if we have a population who says they don t want to work particularly hard the countries we re competing against particularly china have strong work ethics moreover those countries aren t literally soft unlike us according to the centers for disease control and prevention no u s state in 1991 had a percentage of obese people of more than 20 percent last year no state s percentage of obese people was less than 20 percent america s unchecked pound packing almost 34 percent of the population qualifies as obese has consequences reduced quality of life increased health care costs it offers a window into our souls instead of the lean mean and hungry title character of rocky we re the bloated unmotivated champ of rocky iii about to get pummeled by mr t i did a tv interview in toronto the other day said mr siebold also the author of die fat or get tough 101 differences in thinking between fat people and thin people during the break they talked about how as soon as you go over the u s border you can see the difference how fat we are sadly they re right and we sugarcoat it we think about eating emotionally instead of critically i went on the today show and said if you re fat get tough fix it no one is stuffing pizza and doughnuts in your face afterward i got death threats of course we still have the aforementioned college football a fierce competitive crucible where only the mentally strong and physically fit survive where tomorrow s hard nosed leaders are today s tried by fire student athletes student athletes such as those of the louisville cardinals who recently lost to conference rival pittsburgh the reason according to louisville coach charlie strong his team was poorly prepared distracted by the previous week s release of the new call of duty video game on second thought maybe we re doomed don t squeeze our charmin or maybe not pop quiz who took the following stand against all american softness in a campaign speech while running for the presidency we ve become fearful to compete i want to see our nation return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again we ought to be a beacon for nations a mitt romney in 2011 b barack obama in 2008 c ronald reagan in 1980 all set the correct answer is d jimmy carter mr malaise himself in 1976 which just goes to show that the republic has always been going soft or at least fretting about the possibility scene the first thanksgiving plymouth 1621 pilgrim no 1 yum this corn tastes good so much better than starving pilgrim no 2 oh great now we re dependent on foreign sources of starch becoming wards of the wampanoag welfare state this does not bode well for our future economic growth asking if we ve seen our best days is as american as apple pie mr dowd said go back in history and it s very common for presidents to stand before congress and say things aren t very good but that sense of decline is often more about feeling than fact our softness it turns out is relative if america has a paunch we also still possess formidable biceps fact we account for more of the world s gdp than any other country fact in 2006 a u n report named our workers the planet s most productive fact according to foreign affairs we lead all nations in exporting goods and services and are the globe s second largest manufacturer behind china time reports that two thirds of 40 year old americans live in households with larger inflation adjusted incomes than their parents had at the same age of fortune magazine s global 500 largest corporations 133 are american more than double that of any other country contrary to conservative canards about entrepreneur shackling overregulation the world bank ranks the united states in the top five of nations with the most business friendly regulatory environments counter to liberal teeth gnashing about a parasitic elite grifting off the nation s wealth the top 1 percent of earners contribute 37 percent of collected income tax losing manufacturing jobs to robots and developing nations hurts but it doesn t make america soft it makes us ingenious and a nation with child labor laws that we cough china cough actually enforce on

laden read him his miranda rights and turn him over to lawyers at the hague they shot the world s most wanted terrorist in the face under mr obama the nation is killing more bad guys with drone

treasure soft or smart we are tougher on crime with the highest rate of incarceration in the world and violent offenses occurring at their lowest rate in almost four decades and absolutely brutal on our reality show contestants our higher education system remains unmatched of the world s top 25 universities 15 are in the united states not by accident has the elite college admissions process become an olympic shaming competition oh and our supposed laziness when we tell pollsters that we don t want to work as hard it s probably because we re already exhausted the average american works more hours per year than anyone else in the industrialized world including the french duh the germans no kidding and the japanese to quote keanu reeves whoa the trouble with america has nothing to do with a lack of elbow grease said derek leebaert a historian former marine and foreign policy professor at georgetown university we re in troubled times but the majority of our population is working its butt off trying to provide health care and education for their families in a difficult environment that takes a lot of courage perseverance and all around grittiness americans also volunteer more than any other people working for the boy scouts their churches the red cross combine that with our jobs and we are the busiest people on the planet are we fat guilty as charged but we re also home to

it just coincidence that our young soldiers excel as drone pilots brief history of softness in his 2004 book hard america soft america competition vs coddling and the battle for the nation s future political writer michael barone argued that the seemingly tough united states of the 1950s and 1960s was in many ways a cushier place thanks to a big government big labor and big business coalition that insulated society from the harshness of unrestrained market forces right or wrong his analysis reflects a fundamental aspect of our character we re forever stressing about our self diagnosed softness questioning whether we still have our former juice or are busy slouching toward charminville political scientists even have a term for it declinism 18th century our european ancestors widely
