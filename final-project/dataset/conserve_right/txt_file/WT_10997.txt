apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic fracking is going global the u s energy industry clearly still leads the way on the revolutionary drilling method that has upended global energy markets but the rest of the world is beginning to catch up as nations seek to replicate american success in oil and natural gas development taking the lead in europe poland plans to begin producing shale gas using hydraulic fracturing commonly known as fracking as soon as next year the country s treasury minister said recently more than 100 exploration concessions to more than two dozen companies have been awarded and the polish state geological institute estimates that the country s shale gas deposits may secure domestic production for at least 25 years britain has lifted a moratorium on fracking that was imposed after a previous operation was blamed for sparking an earth tremor top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots argentina the largest producer of natural gas in south america is eyeing the practice on a significant scale to better exploit its supply fracking uses water sand and chemicals to break underground shale formations and release fuel the technique has been key to economic revivals in localities across the u s and has helped domestic oil and gas production skyrocket international competitors now want in on the action everybody around the world has taken notice the past few years they re taking notice and starting to wonder if they can get a part of the same energy revolution that we have here said daniel simmons an energy scholar at the institute for energy research a washington based think tank and research organization in november the independent beijing based publication caixin reported on a secret chinese white paper saying the asian superpower is planning a huge fracking industry and that the model for china s anticipated success is the u s shale gas sector the same month fort worth texas based fts international inc a leading fracking equipment company announced the signing of joint venture deals with partners in saudi arabia and brazil saudi arabia in particular has reason to examine u s drilling success the international energy agency recently reported that american oil production will surpass saudi arabia s to become the globe s single biggest producer of oil and natural gas as soon as 2020 putting north america on track to becoming energy independent european pacesetter fracking offers a similar path for nations such as poland which are dependent on foreign suppliers they do not fully trust that s what is driving them to look for shale gas in that part of the world so they get out from under the russians thumb when it comes to energy mr simmons said some of those countries that are really dependent on russian natural gas are much pro hydraulic fracturing but much like the policy and regulatory fights in the u s resistance to fracking has sprung up in other parts of the world france and bulgaria have banned the practice the european union is in the midst of a broad study on the safety of fracking with results expected sometime next year following in the footsteps of similar american groups irish environmentalist opponents of fracking have started fracking free ireland the group s motto keep the frogs in and the frackers out global organizations no longer are targeting only the u s in the effort to slow down fossil fuel development they are expanding their efforts keenly aware that fracking soon will be more than an american phenomenon instead of exposing their citizens to the damages of modern drilling and fracking countries around the world should enact national bans on the practice and invest aggressively in the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies said last year s report on fracking by the international group food and water watch the oil and gas industry is now poised to take this nightmare global the study said green pushback in the u s those environmental forces have had limited success they have staged countless protests and put a great deal of political pressure on officials such as new york gov andrew cuomo a democrat who is weighing whether to allow fracking in his state those forces also created pressure that led to fracking bans in vermont and cities including buffalo n y and pittsburgh beyond that though their success mostly has been limited to holding raucous demonstrations and mounting public relations campaigns not so in europe analysts say where the green movement is an effective political apparatus that spearheaded the french and bulgarian fracking moratoriums it s more organized more focused they ve been able to gain more political traction that has not been seen here said kenneth b medlock iii an energy and resource economics fellow at rice university s baker institute environmental motives have been very strong and they ve been very successful in trying to steer not just european union energy policy but individual countries energy policies mr medlock said some already are warning that europe may miss out on a global energy revolution if the green forces on the continent prevail some european countries already made the decision not to go into shale gas so naturally when they do that there will not be development mohamed al mady chief executive of saudi petrochemical giant sabic told the financial times newspaper i think the trend you will see is more investors going to north america china and the middle east as in the u s mr medlock said it comes down to political geography more than anything else a ban on fracking in vermont was relatively easy to achieve because the state is thought to have little in the way of recoverable natural gas the same holds true in a country such as france mr medlock said for poland and others where fracking likely will lead to tangible energy benefits critics will continue to have a tougher time
