national review the 82 day dictatorship the cummings standard dominic cummings fights the blob ending abortion of down syndrome children in the united kingdom it s time to mothball the imf editor s note andrew c mccarthy s new book isball of collusion the plot to rig an election and destroy a presidency this is the third in a series of excerpts the first can be read here and the second here nrplus member article h orrifying as we ve seen candidates can get chirpy at final presidential debates less than three weeks from election day and hillary clinton was no exception what horror had her inveighing so the very thought that her republican rival would question the legitimacy of the presidential election donald trump being donald trump he wouldn t budge he would not pledge to accept the election results a priori okay no trump didn t use the phase a priori but he did speculate that the electoral process could be rigged until he saw how it played out the republican nominee said he could not concede that the outcome would be on the up and up first he reaffirmed an allegation for which he d already been roundly condemned foreigners could swing the election specifically millions of ineligible voters an allusion to illegal immigration the pi ata of trump s campaign second he complained about the gross one sidedness of the media s campaign coverage scathing when it came to him and between inattentive and fawning when it came to his opponent whose considerable sins were airbrushed away third he claimed there was deep corruption clinton he maintained should not have been permitted to run given the evidence of felony misconduct uncovered in her email scandal instead of prosecuting her law enforcement agencies of the democratic administration bent over backwards to give her a pass and congressional democrats closed ranks around her conducting themselves in committee hearings more like her defense lawyers than like investigators searching for the truth jwplayer

clinton responded that she was shocked horrified to hear trump talking down our democracy this way this was a top theme in her campaign s closing days the election was absolutely legitimate trump was traitorously condemnable for refusing to say so of course clinton and the democrats who parroted her would prefer that you forget that now and given her strained relationship with the truth they re right to suspect that you d never retain anything she said for very long the media democrat caterwauling over trump s election rigging spiel was not rooted in patriotic commitment to the american democratic tradition of accepting election outcomes they said what they said because they fully expected to win the polls all said they would mrs clinton and her backers president obama included would not abide a taint of illegitimacy affixing itself to her inevitable presidency except it wasn t so inevitable and when clinton lost they changed their tune about election rigging suddenly the inconceivable the heresy even to hint at was to be taken as gospel the outcome was illegitimate russia hacked the election there was however a very inconvenient problem for this narrative everything of significance that is known to the u s government about russian meddling was already known in those pre election weeks when clinton and the democrats were vouching for the integrity of the process and condemning trump for even hesitating to endorse it by now the story is well known russia s cyberespionage operations began in 2014 long before donald trump s entry into the race by summer 2015 hackers believed to be connected to russian intelligence agencies had access to dnc computer networks and the fbi began warning dnc officials of this in september of that year albeit with a lack of urgency that now seems stunning in march 2016 came the hacking of a private email account belonging to john podesta mrs clinton s campaign chairman who was sufficiently versed in cyber privacy issues to have authored a 2014 report on the subject while serving as a top obama white house adviser u s intelligence agencies were intimately aware of the penetrations obama s national intelligence director james clapper publicly acknowledged that hackers appeared to have targeted presidential campaigns by august 2016 cia director john brennan had interpreted streams of foreign intelligence to indicate that putin had personally ordered the cyber thefts with the intention of at least damaging clinton if not flipping the election to trump in a phone call brennan is said to have admonished alexander bortnikov the head of russia s security service the fsb to desist the next month in a face to face confrontation through interpreters at an international conference in china obama warned putin that we knew what he was doing and he better stop it or else meanwhile the administration conducted numerous high level close hold meetings weighing several options including retaliatory cyber attacks ultimately obama decided to do nothing the president s political allies and media admirers are now embarrassed about his inaction it is the hardest thing about my entire time in government to defend i feel like we sort of choked one anonymous senior administration official told the washington post as ever though they remain apologists for their man portraying a pained potus fearful that any action he took would make matters worse or be perceived as political or otherwise undermine confidence in the election what then is the collusion narrative and what s their story now it is pretty much the same story they rebuked trump for telling they peddle a three part rigged election claim 1 foreign interference not by illegal aliens who may have voted but by russians who did not affect the voting process 2 one sided press coverage they mean the russian propaganda press and the wikileaks release of dnc and john podesta emails which they d now have you believe had more influence on americans than did the media democrat complex and the grudging state department release of hillary clinton s own emails and 3 the corruption that lifted a low character candidate who should not have been allowed to run but who received extraordinary government assistance not from the obama justice department but from the putin regime to assess the democratic narrative as bunk is not to excuse russian duplicity which many of us were warning about while bush was embracing putin as a strategic partner and while obama was resetting with all due flexibility by late october the russian cyberespionage effort to meddle in the election was well known in the same debate in which clinton rebuked trump for refusing to concede the election s legitimacy she attacked her rival as putin s puppet and cited the finding of government agencies that russia sought to interfere in the election clinton was not at all concerned that putin s shenanigans would have any actual impact on the election she invoked them because she thought it was helpful to her campaign an opportunity to portray trump as ripe for rolling by the russian regime and how could she have taken any other position none other than president obama himself observed that there was nothing unusual about russian scheming to influence american elections which he said dates back to the soviet union obama deftly avoided mentioning that past scheming had never gotten much media traction because the soviets had been more favorably disposed towards democrats while he blamed the putin regime for hacking emails during the 2016 campaign obama described this as fairly routine he acknowledged moreover that it was publicly notorious well in advance of the election which of course is why clinton had been able to exploit it in a nationally televised debate three weeks prior to november 8 what happened here is very simple russia was unimportant to democrats and was indeed avoided by democrats until they needed to rationalize a stunning defeat prior to the election democrats had little interest in mentioning russia or putin attention to the kremlin was bad news for clinton it invited scrutiny of the clinton foundation s suspicious foreign dealings bill clinton s lucrative speech racket hillary s biddable state department and russia s acquisition of major u s uranium supplies it conjured embarrassing memories of the russia reset during which the supine obama administration watched putin capture territory in eastern europe and muscle his way into the middle east all while arming and aligning with iran it called to mind the intriguing relationship between podesta the clinton campaign chairman and former obama white house official and putin s circle specifically a 35 million investment by a putin created venture capital firm rusnano in a small massachusetts energy company joule energy just two months after podesta joined joule s board so while donald trump s russia rhetoric ranged from the unseemly blowing kisses at an anti american thug to the delusional the notion that russia iran s new friend could be a reliable ally against jihadism to the reprehensible moral equivalence between the murderous putin regime and american national defense operations clinton s own russia baggage rendered her unable to exploit it it was only afterward after she lost a contest she thought she had in the bag that the election turned illegitimate if you enjoyed this article we have a proposition for you join nrplus members getallof our content including the magazine no paywalls or content meters an
