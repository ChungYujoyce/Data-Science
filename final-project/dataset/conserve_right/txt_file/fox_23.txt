house budget director on impact of escalating trade tensions and a possible government shutdown this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday august 19 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news host i aposm chris wallace president trump puts critics on the intelligence community on notice as he pulls the security clearance of former cia director john brennan and reviews the status of nine others begin videotape donald trump president of the united states security clearance is a very important debate very very important and i aposve had a tremendous response for having done that john brennan former cia director i think he aposs abusing the powers of that office i think right now this country is in a crisis in terms of what mr trump has done and is liable to do wallace is it an effort to protect the nation aposs secrets or an act of political revenge we aposll ask retired admiral mike mullen former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and republican senator ron johnson chair of the homeland security committee then larry kudlow white house economic advisor our economy our investors our workforce are crushing it right now we are crushing it wallace we aposll discuss the state of the trump economy and escalating trade war and a possible government shutdown with white house budget director mick mulvaney plus a verdict is expected this week in the special counsel aposs case against former trump campaign chairman paul manafort trump i think it aposs a very sad day for our country wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what the manafort verdict means for the future of robert mueller aposs investigation all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington if president trump wanted to change the subject from omarosa this week he certainly did he pulled the security clearance of former cia director john brennan and is reviewing the status of nine other current and former officials a former top intelligence figures going back to the reagan administration reacted with fury in a few minutes we aposll discuss whether the president is protecting the nation aposs secrets or playing politics with the head of the senate homeland security committee ron johnson but first admiral mike mullen former chair of the joint chiefs of staff under presidents bush and obama admiral i want to begin with some of the things that john brennan has been saying about president trump starting with him accusing the president of high crimes and misdemeanors after a summit in helsinki with vladimir putin take a look begin video clip brennan this is nothing short of treasonous because it is a betrayal of the nation he is giving aid and comfort to the enemy i think donald trump has badly sullied the reputation of the office of the presidency just so reflective of somebody who quite frankly i don apost want you to use this term may be but he is drunk on power he really is end video clip wallace admiral is that appropriate for a cia director former cia director to say about the president admiral mike mullen ret former joint chiefs of staff chairman well i think for john and he and john is an extraordinary servant of the country but i think he has been incredibly critical of the president and i think that has put him in a political place which actually does more damage for the intelligence community which is apolitical even as he aposs retired so i really don apost support him being as critical of the president as he has been wallace the question of course is whether we are blurring the lines here between politics and intelligence i want to put up a statement that john brennan said in an op ed an opinion article in the new york times rather after his security clearance was cleared here it is mr trump aposs claim of no collusion trump aposs claims of no collusion rather are in a word hogwash richard burr chair of senate intelligence wrote if director brennan aposs statements is based on intelligence he received while still leading the cia why didn apost he included in the intelligence community assessment released in 2017 if however director brennan aposs statement is purely political and based on conjecture the president has full authority to revoke his security clearance as head of the executive branch can you understand why i say that to a certain degree saying in an op ed that the allegation or the denials of no collusion are hogwash it blurs the line mullen well john brennan knows based on the job he was doing before an awful lot about what happened with respect to russia that said he aposs no longer in the job per se and i worry that what he is saying now puts him in a much more politicized position i don apost think there aposs any question the president has a right to pull security clearances that authority is very clear that said i do worry about the fact that that one john is now in the political arena and two at the same time i don apost agree with the president pulling it i think i am concerned about the whole issue of free speech and as long as john is not revealing classified information that he shouldn apost then i then i certainly think he has a right to speak as far as the russian investigation is concerned i think bob mueller will get through that complete it and we should rely on him for what actually happened wallace admiral i want to ask you a question a lot of people have asked me this week which is why should a former official i know you have security clearance why should a former official any former official keep his security clearance when it aposs been years since he worked for the government mullen it aposs for a long time chris former officials have kept their security clearances to be able to advise on critical issues over time these are individuals typically that have a lot of both wisdom and experience and our entities inside the government there are contractors who support the government that ask for advice in certain areas i don apost find it certainly i have my clearance it aposs not used that often and the dependence on sort of a deep understanding of what aposs actually going on is not called for that often so it aposs been going on for a long time and i think for the most part it aposs been very useful and i have found no one that aposs abused that wallace you know this isn apost just about john brennan although most of the attention is being paid to him you aposve seen the list of one current and eight former intelligence officials whose clearances the president is reviewing and there are reports that the president and the white house have already drafted documents to remove some or all of their clearances what aposs the danger here why are you and the 14 or so other former senior intelligence and military officials why is everybody so upset about this mullen well i mean one of the things for somebody of my age it immediately brings back the whole concept of the enemies list for you know under president nixon and even before that in the early apos50s the mccarthy era where the administration starts putting together lists of individuals that don apost agree with them and that historically obviously has proven incredibly problematic for the country so it aposs that you know it aposs creating a list of political enemies in particular those who have worked in a government and some very specifically who spent their life in government and i think hearing from bill webster and bob gates is a pretty strong signal that doing this would really be off base wallace the one current official member of the justice department who security clearance is being considered is bruce ohr who along with his wife had links to chris steele the man who wrote the russia dossier here aposs what the president said on friday about them begin video clip trump i think that bruce ohr is a disgrace with his wife nellie for him to be in the justice department and to be doing what he did that is a disgrace that is disqualifying for mueller end video clip wallace how big a role do you think the russian investigation plays in all of this and what if because it has been speculated what if the president were to pull the security clearances of robert mueller and the other members of his special counsel team mullen well again i think that the president has the authority to grant clearances and to pull them i think pulling bob mueller aposs clearance would create you know a real political firestorm for him and i would hope that the president would just let bob mueller get through that investigation there is in the case of bruce ohr who i don apost know but there is a process that the president is concerned about what he did to have the inspector general look at it and then there aposs an appropriate official that could take appropriate action based on the investigation wallace finally president trump wanted to hold a big military parade in washington in november as you well know and it has now been canceled because of skyrocketing costs as a former chairman of the joint chiefs what do you think of the idea of this country holding a big celebratory parade for the military mullen well i had a great privilege of serving for over four decades with the greatest young men and women that the country has one of the things that our country has done is honor them in so many ways but i aposm not one that thinks we need a military parade and in fact whatever the costs are and there have been varied estimates i think those costs those funds can be put to better use the military is the best military in the world it aposs the best i aposve ever seen and support of them in terms of their pay and their benefits et cetera and what they are doing is what aposs really critical i don apost think a parade does much for them in that regard wallace admiral mullen thank you thanks for your time today always good to talk with you sir mullen thanks chris wallace let aposs turn now to the chair of the senate homeland security committee republican senator ron johnson senator i want to start with sarah huckabee sanders reading the statement from president trump this week explaining why he was revoking the security clearances of john brennan and reviewing the clearances of nine others here she is begin video clip sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary as the head of the executive branch and commander in chief i have a unique constitutional responsibility to protect the nation aposs classified information including by controlling access to it end video clip wallace question sir how does the president aposs action protect the nation aposs secrets what evidence is there that any of these ten people have misused classified information sen ron johnson r wi senate homeland security committee good morning chris i aposm not sure there aposs evidence that anybody has misused it but i do believe that former cia director john brennan abused his privilege when you aposre an ex cia director and you are going on all the cable news shows and acting as partisan as he is and accusing the president of the united states of treasonous behavior high crimes and misdemeanors last time i checked treason was punishable by death you just crossed the line and there aposs a difference between being eligible for receiving classified information and gaining access to it let aposs face it nobody was going to be consulted with john brennan he didn apost need access to any classified information not during this administration so i have no problem with the president pulled his clearance wallace but as i just discussed with admiral mullen we aposre not just talking about john brennan there are nine other people who were on the list that sarah huckabee sanders read in the white house briefing room ten people in all including brennan and the one thing they all have in common is to varying degrees they all have been critics of this president here aposs what senator mark warner the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee had to say about this begin video clip sen mark warner d va senate intelligence committee vice chair these people were being singled out to have either their clearances revoked or in the process of being revoked to me smacks of nixonian type practices of trying to silence anyone who is willing to criticize this president end video clip wallace and he compared it as admiral mullen did to an enemies list if you want to clean this up why not reformat and take away all the security clearances of all former officials why go after your political critics johnson well first of all i don apost want to see this become routine i don apost want to see it be politicized and the reason you don apost want to pull security clearance is exactly what the admiral mullen was talking about is being able to you know provide access to those individuals you want to consult with so the best way handling this is if you don apost have confidence in former cia officials or other government officials that you aposre not going to be consulting with just don apost give them access you know you gain access when you have a need to know and if you aposre not going to be consulting you just don apost have the need to know so again i don apost want this to become routine but again john brennan really did cross a line he aposs one of the leaders of the resistance movement i understand why president trump is pretty frustrated i aposve never seen in my life time a president not given any chance no honeymoon you know massive protests of the weekend after the inauguration i understand president trump aposs frustration but again security clearance is really split between eligibility and access and the best way to handle all of this if you don apost have confidence with people just don apost give them access to the classified information wallace well i was going to say but doesn apost mean that they would lose their security clearance just because you have security clearance johnson right wallace doesn apost mean you get access to the information and i want to follow up specifically on that you say you don apost want to be routine there aposs a report in the washington post this weekend that president trump wants to and in fact the white house has already drawn up documents to revoke the security clearances of some of those nine other people on the list and is in fact being advised to do so at specific times when there aposs bad negative news coming out to try to disrupt the news cycle if he goes after some of those other nine people on the list are you going to support him or are you going to oppose that johnson i don apost want to see him politicize this listen when you fire people from agencies their clearances are yanked but when people retire honorably i think let them keep their security clearances in place and if you don apost want to consult them just don apost give them access to classified material that aposs the best way of handling it just don apost give them access to the material wallace i just want to put up one more thing here and that is the backlash which really spread through the intelligence community and a lot of very senior officials let aposs start here more than a dozen senior intel officials wrote this it has nothing to do with who should and should not hold security clearances and everything to do with an attempt to stifle free speech some 60 former cia officers wrote this the country will be weakened if there is a political litmus test applied before seasoned experts are allowed to share their views and retired admiral william mcraven who led the special operations command that killed bin laden wrote this i would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well so i can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency i aposm sure senator you agree an awful lot of people on this list they go back to the reagan administration in the case of bill webster they bleed red white and blue johnson absolutely these are honorable americans i don apost agree that president trump is stifling free speech i don apost want to see an enemies list and again i aposll just repeat the west bay to handle this in any administration if you don apost want to consult with anybody you don apost necessarily have to yank their security clearance just don apost give them access to the classified materials it aposs pretty simple wallace senator johnson thank you thanks for joining us today always good to talk with you sir johnson have a great day wallace up next what aposs behind president trump aposs stripping the security clearances of his critics in the case against former trump campaign chairman paul manafort what will the jury decide we aposll bring in our sunday group to break it all down next commercial break begin video clip john brennan former cia director they are turning a blind eye and making excuses for someone who doesn apost deserve to be given this type of leash with the authorities of the office of the presidency doanld trump president of the united states many people don apost even know who he is and now he has a bigger voice and that aposs ok with me because i like taking on voices like that i aposve never respected him end video clip wallace president trump saying he aposs given john brennan a bigger platform and brennan using that platform to go after republicans for failing to stand up to this president and it aposs time now for our sunday group rich lowry of national review mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and the co host of benson and harf on fox news radio guy benson congresswoman harman let me start with you because brennan and some of those other former top intelligence officials are saying that this is an effort to shut them up but doesn apost the president make a good point there brennan has a bigger platform than ever he was all over cable tv he was in the new york times who was being shut up jane harman d cali former u s congresswoman well i aposm no shrink but the speculation is that trump likes a foil and he aposs setting trump up to be this foil to demonize him wallace brennan harman and frankly i think that brennan aposs irish as he calls it maybe is not as effective as if he talks more quietly but be that as it may he has a right to free speech and that letter that was discussed by 14 former senior cia folks plus the really compelling op ed by bill mcraven who was in charge of the takedown of osama bin laden i don apost know what political party he is but he was honored by the wilson center for his public services and is a genuine american hero says i think everything you don apost revoke security clearances when there aposs no violation of classified material i personally have one by the way because i aposm a member of the defense policy board and crosstalk wallace i aposm not sure you shouldn apost tell the president that harman i aposm telling you that on a fair and balanced show wallace i understand he may be watching harman well wallace all right there goes your security clearance rich what do you think of the president moving against brennan and according to reports apparently soon moving against at least some of these other nine officials he seemed to link a lot of this to the russia investigation telling the wall street journal here it is i call it the rigged witch hunt it is a sham and these people the ten people we aposre talking about here led it so i think it aposs something that had to be done your reaction rich lowry national review well first of all we aposre talking about mostly symbolism here right i mean no one the reason why former officials have the security clearances is in theory current officials can consult with them but no trump official is going to consult with john brennan over anything wallace but let me just pick up on that because there was a world prior to january of 2017 where they did consult and people were brought back in and the idea was you might want somebody who aposs an expert on russia or the middle east or whatever to be able to help you lowry the way brennan has conducted himself forecloses any opportunity to cooperate with this administration and i do think he crossed a line it aposs just a really bad idea to have someone who was wielding some of the most sensitive powers in the united states government immediately upon leaving his office reveal himself to be the most hackish political actor who is making wild and outrageous charges now if trump is just going to go through and pick through this list arbitrarily without any process without any clear standard i do think it aposs a bad idea it seems petty and it will even though he has broad powers in this area will invite some sort of first amendment challenge wallace i want to turn to another big story this week and that aposs the trial of former top trump campaign chairman paul manafort the first prosecution by the special counsel the jury right now not right now because it aposs the weekend but starting on monday will do its third day of deliberation on the 18 counts of tax and bank fraud here aposs what president trump said about the trial on friday begin video clip trump i think it aposs a very sad day for our country he worked for me for a very short period of time but you know what he happens to be a very good person and i think it aposs very sad what they aposve done to paul manafort end video clip wallace mo i am old enough to remember when we used to think it was shocking when a president weighed in on a pending case let alone a case for the jury is in deliberations what do you think of the president aposs comments and how important is this manafort case and the verdict that comes down for the special counsel investigation going forward mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics public service well i think it aposs remarkable that the president said what he said i think it was inappropriate you know but that can be said about half the things he says these days but you aposre right there was a time when presidents didn apost weigh in in the middle of a jury deliberation and wallace or if they did they got hammered i remember richard nixon in the middle of the charles manson case barack obama about trayvon martin elleithee yes it was inappropriate in those cases and this was inappropriate look i think if there is a guilty verdict i think that is going to create a sense of momentum behind the mueller investigation i don apost think there aposs any question about that wallace but what if there isn apost elleithee but if there isn apost then i think there aposs going to be further pressure from the president his allies on mueller to wrap this up and to just cut the cord now we don apost know what mueller is looking at we don apost know everything that he aposs got we know there aposs 32 at least people who have been indicted or pled guilty so far so this is just the first thread in what i think is an intricate sort of wallace but you have to agree he brought the case because he thought it was his best case if he goes down and again we don apost know what the jury is going to decide it would be very damaging elleithee we don apost know what the jury will decide nor do we know exactly what else he aposs got in his quiver of arrows i think most people kind of assume that manafort was his best foot forward but we don apost know everything else that he has wallace all right speaking of what we don apost know or didn apost know until this morning about the special counsel investigation there aposs a puzzling story guy in the new york times that it turns out that don mcgahn the president aposs counsel has done 30 hours of interviews with the special counsel with the special counsel robert mueller with the consent of president trump according to the story mcgahn was so surprised that president trump said no you can go talk in three interviews 30 hours that he and his lawyer worried was the president trying to set him up to take the fall for president trump what do you make of this guy benson co host benson harf i mean it was an astonishing story in a number of ways and that last piece goes to potentially a culture of paranoia inside the white house but for people who are looking wallace inaudible benson at the headline or the lead and saying oh my gosh this must be terrible for president trump there are a few concrete details in the story that i think actually are not totally vindicating but at least interesting for example according to the time story mcgahn told investigators quote that he never saw mr trump go beyond his legal authorities and also the very notion that the president said yes please go speak to mueller with no restrictions that did not sound to me like a president who believes that he has deep secrets to hide or that he aposs done something wrong if he aposs at least his initial position was to send the chief white house lawyer to talk to mueller in an unrestricted way with his permission i mean to me that is a fascinating nugget that does color our understanding of how the president views his culpability or lack thereof on the matter elleithee or that the president how the president views the white house counsel right i mean the white house counsel is not the president aposs personal lawyer the white house counsel is the lawyer for the white house wallace but he could have claimed ph executive privilege elleithee he could have claimed executive privilege but there aposs also some nuggets in that story about how the president thought that mcgahn would go out there and get his back in these interviews which is i think i misreading of wallace i just want a final word from you rich on all of this because the president has been on the twitter tear today about this and he saying that the new york times it aposs a fake story and that they are implying that somehow mcgahn turned into john dean in the watergate case who was a rat and in fact this was all done with the cooperation and consent of the president and it shows that he has nothing to hide lowry yes clearly they could have stopped him if they wanted to i just think it aposs malpractice even if you are in full cooperation mode not to try to limit this interview to some extent just to protect the prerogatives of the presidency but what guy hit on if it aposs true that mcgahn was worried that the president was going to throw him under the bus so he thought he had to go and do the fulsome interviews possible that speaks to a deep dysfunction at the very heart of the white house harman it could be rudy giuliani who moved in here and doesn apost want mcgahn around anymore that could be the motivation wallace it aposs a little late for that laughter wallace he aposs already done the 30 hours of interview harman well he aposs done the 30 hours but if he aposs removed now he presumably can apost do whatever it is that he aposs doing i mean there aposs too much intrigue i worked in the carter white house which was a lot quieter laughter wallace those were those were different times all right panel we have to take a little break we aposll see you a bit later in the program up next the trump economy has kicked into high gear but will it last white house budget director mick mulvaney joins us next commercial break wallace coming up the white house says the trump economic strategy is working begin video clip kudlow we have a president who in my words is telling folks to take a whip at the ball and they aposre doing it end video clip wallace we aposll discuss the economy and a possible government shutdown with white house budget director mick mulvaney next commercial break wallace the economy has been a bright spot for president trump highlighted by strong growth and low unemployment but trade wars and a possible government shutdown loom on the horizon joining us now white house budget director mick mulvaney director mulvaney let aposs start with the economy where there are clearly some great numbers i want to put them up on the screen gdp growth in the second quarter 4 1 percent overall unemployment 3 9 percent the jobless numbers for blacks hispanics and young people are the lowest in decades here aposs what white house economic adviser larry kudlow told the cabinet this week begin video clip larry kudlow white house economic adviser we are crushing it and people say this is not sustainable it aposs one quarter blip it aposs just nonsense end video clip wallace but director mulvaney there are other economists who say that we aposre on a sugar high based on tax cuts and big government spending that won apost last i want to put up the projection from the non partisan congressional budget office recent projection it growth of 3 1 percent this year 2 4 percent in 2019 and back down to 1 7 percent in 2020 are they wrong mick mulvaney white house budget director yes we we think that they are keep in mind all of the folks who are now saying it aposs it aposs just a short term sugar high it aposs just a blip it aposs not sustainable including the cbo are the same people who said it was impossible to get to 3 percent in the first place they have a vested interest in seeing us fail one of my favorite lines came i think from paul krugman who said that about the time we rolled out our first budget which introduced this concept of 3 percent growth sustainable 3 percent growth he said you could make him complete dictator of the country and he couldn apost get you there so there aposs a lot of folks who are interested in seeing us fail because we are proving that if you regulate inaudible you let people keep more of their own money that the american economy can grow and that that growth is sustainable wallace the white house talks you talk other top officials the president about all the jobs that have been created but i want to look at the record because i i found out and a surprising statistic this week 3 4 million jobs have been added during the first 19 months of the trump administration but 3 7 million jobs were added during the last 19 months of the obama administration more jobs so in fact there hasn apost been a spike in jobs created under this president mulvaney right keep in mind that when you aposre coming back from a recession it aposs actually easier to do that it aposs easier to do what president obama had done the criticism we had so many of us had including myself of president obama was that he wasn apost adding enough jobs that that those numbers that you saw coming off of a recession were way below historical american averages you look at how quickly the economy came back after the recession under the reagan administration that the obama recovery lagged behind all of our historical inaudible so wallace but but wait a minute sir the the the recession was in 2008 we aposre talking about 2015 and apos16 eight seven eight years into the obama presidency versus the first 19 months of the trump presidency mulvaney true but when you come out of a deep recession as we did in the 1980s and we did again in the 2000s you should see dramatically increased growth and increased job creation which you aposve seen here with our administration is we aposre able to started at a fairly high level and continue that growth level most folks would expect it to sort of tail off at this point but we aposre not we aposre actually growing faster we aposre adding jobs you aposve you aposve you aposve mentioned a lot of the statistics my favorite statistic is that for the first time in the history of the country we have more job openings then we have people who are there to fill them so we aposve been able to do this at a time that most folks again thought it was not possible to do but to get back to your original point about whether or not it aposs sustainable and the reason we do think it aposs sustainable is we aposre changing sort of the infrastructure of the economy the things we aposve done on the deregulatory agenda the things we aposve done on taxes are not a sugar high it aposs not a one time sort of pop to the system it aposs fundamentally changing the way we create wealth in the country we do think it aposs sustainable in the long term in fact i think we aposre already starting to see some folks project that we aposre going to have maybe again at least 3 percent maybe 4 percent growth again this quarter so as you see you aposre seeing it start to build that momentum wallace all right one possible roadblock out there one big issue for the next few weeks is the possibility the president has threatened a possible shutdown of the government on september 30th if he doesn apost get full funding for the wall and doesn apost get a number of other major immigration reforms does he have to get all of that by the end of the fiscal year september 30th or is he willing to put this confrontation off until after the midterm election mulvaney a couple different things i aposm always fascinated with the media the fascination with this narrative about a shutdown we aposre supposedly going to have a shutdown just about every six months according to the media we haven apost had one yet except for the one wallace well no wait wait wait wait i aposm not going to let you put this on the media president trump has been talking about a shutdown lots mulvaney sure wallace this is not generated by us it aposs generated by the white house mulvaney that aposs fair it aposs just i aposm always fascinated with the folks always want to talk about a shutdown but the only shutdown we aposve had since i aposve been in the trump administration was actually caused by senate democrats but come back to your to you question which is what does the president have to have i think this is the president aposs position on this and we aposve communicated i was in the oval office when he communicated this to the leaders in the house and the senate it aposs like look we aposre spending way too much money everybody knows it we had to give the democrats a bunch of money in order to get the national defense funding that we needed during that last omnibus what the president aposs saying is one no more omnibuses he aposs not going to do that anymore and number two i don apost think he should spend all of this money because we don apost need to but if you do i aposd like to have my priorities funded that aposs a reasonable position for the president to take wallace i i aposm asking a specific question mulvaney so again you and i know i don apost wallace i aposm asking a specific question though sir and that is does is mulvaney sure wallace is the drop dead time for that september 30th or is it going to push this off until after the midterms mulvaney oh and it aposs a fair question to ask but as i aposve told you before in the show i don apost negotiate with you we negotiate mostly with senate democrats so no we aposre going to continue to go through the process the house and the senate actually spend money under our system as you know they aposve actually done a pretty good job so far i think the senate has passed nine of their 12 spending bills i think the house may have passed almost all of theirs as well so they aposre making progress they aposre ahead of their schedule from where they were in previous years so i think all signs are good that we aposre going to actually get some spending bills passed before the end of the the end of the fiscal year wallace ok i want to get in two more subjects and we aposre running out of time the president announced friday that he is canceling the big military parade in washington in november because of skyrocketing cost he tweeted this the local politicians who run washington d c poorly know a windfall when they see it when asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that i canceled it never let someone hold you up the implication there director mulvaney was that somehow d c officials were trying to gouge the federal government but d c mayor muriel bowser came back she said the fact is although the president has been talking about this since february that your office omb never came to them until this last tuesday to talk about this that they said it aposs going to cost the city 20 million and it was the military that said it aposs going to cost them 50 million and that placing the blame on on the city is just wrong mulvaney a couple different things on that first of all if the parade had been canceled purely for fiscal reasons i imagine it would have been in the room when that decision was made and i wasn apost so my guess is there were other contributing factors but come back to the relationship between the city and the president i mean i like the mayor she seems like a nice lady but face it this is a city that voted probably i don apost know 70 80 percent against the president so to think that maybe the city council of washington d c is not trying to help the president accomplish what he wants to accomplish shouldn apost be news to anybody the 20 million that you aposve just mentioned to me is a number that i find that aposs a number let aposs put it this way i aposm not familiar with the numbers that i saw from the city were much higher than that wallace all right i aposm going to move on to my final subject and that is a story in the new york times this weekend that the trump administration will propose new regulations this week that will leave it up to individual states to decide how to regulate and even whether to regulate power plants fueled by coal isn apost this a national problem that needs a national standard not state by state solutions mulvaney chris i don apost mean to dodge your question but i believe that that matter is being considered right now at omb and our internal rules from administration to administration is that we do not comment on anything that aposs being overseen by the office of information of regulatory affairs i apologize i didn apost know you were going to ask that question but i don apost think i can speak to that and i do apologize wallace well let me just say the president supposedly is going to announce this on tuesday so it sounds like it aposs been decided mulvaney again you i can apost speak to that wallace director mulvaney thank you thanks for joining us today thank you for speaking to all the things you could and we aposll stay on top of all of these developments sir please come back mulvaney thanks chris wallace when we come back new york aposs andrew cuomo says america was never that great our sunday panel returns to discuss how this may affect his prospects for running against president trump in 2020 commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i do want to say that i was your guest at bastille day and it was one of the greatest parades i aposve ever seen it was two hours on the button and it was really very mighty end video clip wallace president trump telling french president macron he liked the bastille day parade so much he wanted to hold a big military celebration here in the u s a project that has now been shelved at least for this year and we aposre back now with the panel so guy no big parade down the streets of washington this november to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of world war i is that good or bad guy benson townhall com i don apost think it aposs either you know i i like the president aposs instinct here he aposs like you know bastille day that aposs a very cool event let aposs honor our military i think that aposs a good impulse if you look at the price tag attached to it you look at a lot of people in the military at the upper echelons of it saying this isn apost a terrific idea i think the american legion weighing in at the end of this decision making process and saying maybe we can use that money and help veterans get health care that seems like a pretty sensible counterpoint to all of this so it has been postponed indefinitely and i aposd be perhaps a little bit surprised if we ever see it during the trump years wallace but as somebody who likes a parade along with the president i will ask you this congresswoman harman some people i think it aposs fair to say mostly on the left are saying we don apost hold military parades in this country they do it in france bastille day every year and they do it every year without breaking the bank so why what aposs wrong with holding a parade jane harman former u s congresswoman d ca well with great pride i participated in the parades in my district on patriotic holidays and i also was responsible for the law that allows us to fly the pow flag on patriotic holidays very proud of that but i but in this case right now i aposm glad he pulled it we could use the money better elsewhere and there aposs a lot to celebrate in this country but i think we we could and should do it in a more varied way wallace all right i aposm going to turn to another story certainly more interesting the story of new york governor andrew cuomo who decided this week it was a good thing to say this begin video clip andrew cuomo d new york governor we aposre not going to make america great again it was never that great we have not reached greatness we will reach greatness when every american is fully engaged end video clip wallace rich how damaging for cuomo who aposs running for re election this november and one hears at least considering keeping the options open for running for president against donald trump in 2020 rich lowry national review well it was a ghastly and contemptible comment and it will haunt him for years and speaks to a temptation on the left you look at surveys liberals self identify as less patriotic than conservatives they say they aposre less proud of the country and that aposs because elements of the left they have a cosmopolitan view of the world or they aposre focused as in those cuomo comments on the sins of the country or they aposre they love the country more than the ideal rather than a lived reality and this is if if they run on anything like this message against trump in 2020 they aposre throwing away a huge opportunity to appeal to the middle of the country wallace all right let me let me let me just put up because the president not surprisingly jumped on this let me put up the tweet that he sent and you can tell he has a history with andrew cuomo he jumped on this with this tweet can you believe this is the governor of the highest taxed state in the u s andrew cuomo having a total meltdown and then let aposs put up the next quote the tweet from cuomo who tried to dig himself out of this on friday afternoon the expression i used the other day was inartful so i want to be very clear of course america is great and of course america has always been great no one questions that moe did cuomo dig himself out of the hole some people are comparing it to hillary clinton calling some trump voters deplorables mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public service well first having the president weigh in on this the guy put the phrase american carnage in his inaugural address so i aposm not sure he is the best arbiter of this but having said that this was a boneheaded comment by governor cuomo there is no question i understand the point he was trying to make at the end right that there are still too many people out there who are feeling left behind that is not a unique perspective that is the perspective that president trump ran on that there are too many people who are being left behind but the way but the way you do that is by leveraging pulling them out is by by leveraging american greatness we are the greatest country in the world for a person this is not going to impact his gubernatorial race i don apost think it aposs going to impact his re election but if there is any chance that he is going to think about running for president this is going to haunt him i agree with rich this is going to haunt him for years you cannot you cannot go out there and say america is not a great country wallace mo let me let me suggest one reason which has to do with his gubernatorial race why andrew cuomo might have done this i aposm speculating here he is running in a primary in new york right now against cynthia nixon the former actress and a self proclaimed socialist who is very much running against cuomo from the left do you think that this may have been cuomo who is leading in the polls by 20 or 30 points but somehow maybe feeling pressure to show i aposm good with the left too i aposm elleithee but the left doesn apost believe this the left does not believe that america is not great look i am on i am on the left harman right i wallace wait a second elleithee i am on the left please don apost tell me that i don apost believe america is great benson i didn apost tell you that elleithee right people wallace all right go ahead go ahead guy benson i think that there are elements of the hard left who do believe that the founding of this country is fundamentally problematic and he was in my view pandering to that element of the left of course the entire left doesn apost believe it you aposre criticizing him rightly but there are folks you you see them all the time and the hard element of the party and the left generally who do not believe this is a great country wallace all right congresswoman harman harman i think i so strongly disagree with that i aposm i aposm a centrist democrat so i aposm not on the left either and i was opposed by people on the left we aposre all patriots and demonizing any section of the electorate is a huge mistake and he aposs 33 points ahead of cynthia nixon in the last poll so i don apost know why he would think he has to pander in any way to the left but i aposd just like to make one other comment i think it was totally boneheaded i agree with all of you he was trying to contrast his language with the trump statement make america great again and i think he needs to keep apologizing for this and i think he will pay for it in the primary to some extent and i think wallace well would you agree would you agree that there are some elements on the left will do believe that the country wasn apost that great and are when they see the country they think of all the things in terms of race in terms of gender in terms of participation harman ok wallace and instead of thinking of the accomplishments it aposs mostly about grievances harman and i think there are some elements on the right that see the same thing the white supremacist for example think it was a huge mistake i don apost to include not just the african americans but women among voters in america so i think there are estranged parts of our electorate on both ends and a lot of them are in the middle of the country lowry but it aposs more than just estranged part of the democratic party you see brewing among in the democratic party among the base of the democratic party what will be the most radical and stinging and broad based indictment of america that we aposve seen in the modern era as fundamentally racist with a broken constitutional system that needs to be overturned that that is coming you see it coming harman i disagree elleithee and there was some applause there was some applause for what he said in the room harman yes well wallace there were also some gasps i have to say elleithee yes wallace all right we aposre going to have to leave it there thank you panel see you next sunday we aposve got lots of time to talk about this maybe three years up next our power player of the week how one man aposs hobby led to a discovery 100 million years in the making commercial break wallace dinosaurs space flight a time machine this story has it all is it this summer aposs blockbuster movie no as we told you back in february it aposs our power player of the week begin videotape ray stanford armature paleontologist it was almost unbelievable i couldn apost sleep for two nights it aposs like you aposve walked into the twilight zone and you you can apost believe what you aposve seen wallace voice over ray stanford is an 80 year old amateur paleontologist stanford well that aposs interesting wallace and he aposs talking about what he saw in the summer of 2012 after having lunch with his wife sheila who worked at the goddard space flight center stanford from my car about 90 feet away i spotted a smooth light brown rock sticking out and it looked like the kind of material that we sometimes find tracks in wallace when he says tracks stanford is talking about dinosaur tracks stanford much to my surprise the nicest nodosaur track that i aposve ever seen anywhere i think then it dawned on me this is goddard space flight center they aposre looking out into space millions of years ago i aposm looking down at the earth 110 million years ago and i thought wow this is a wonderful paradox i want to write some poetry wallace stanford aposs excitement is understandable because he aposs been hunting dinosaur fossils and tracks for the last quarter century and he aposs made hundreds of finds stanford yes this is a mammal footprint from 110 112 million years ago wallace one of them is in the smithsonian stanford it was the first hatchling nodosaur an armored dinosaur that had never been found in the whole world wallace but there was a problem with his latest discovery the gotthard center was putting up a new building there so they excavated the 4 tons stone and made a fiberglass cast of it which stanford got to study in his basement and that aposs when the excitement really started stanford well this was the nodosaur track the first find with the baby walking right right across it wallace on camera so this is the big dinosaur and this is a baby stanford that aposs the baby of the same species wallace voice over but along what appears to have been a prehistoric floodplain there were more than 70 tracks of eight different species stanford mammal tracks here some scratching around over there mammal tracks here you had theropods flesh eating small flesh eating dinosaurs walking across here wallace on camera so the theropods are here tracking the mammals stanford that well it certainly would appear because they aposre walking so slowly wallace how do you know that they aposre walking slowly stanford because they aposre so close together wallace they aposre creeping stanford yes and we aposve we aposve we aposve done a calculation they aposre moving less than a half mile per hour wallace voice over that aposs what stanford says was so exciting fossils show how these animals died but tracks showed how they lived stanford i was looking into a time machine and could see these big flying reptiles landing and the little theropods sneaking around looking down at these little mammals digging in and maybe that wouldn apost affect most people that way but it sure affected me that way wallace stanford aposs find was announced in january he calls it a snapshot created before more animals had a chance to cover the tracks stanford i suspect that a flood came after this had had a chance to dry out just a little bit a flood came and covered it and preserved it wallace on camera so washington really was a swamp stanford oh indeed it aposs been a swamp for over 110 million years wallace voice over stanford will keep looking for signs of dinosaurs but he knows where this discovery ranks stanford if anybody tells me i aposm going to find anything more interesting and important than this i aposll tell them they aposre probably crazy it aposs absolutely like hitting t
