apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing police announced wednesday the arrests of five people in connection with this week s suicide car crash in the heart of china s capital calling it a planned terror attack beijing s first in recent history and identifying the attackers as members of a muslim minority police said the five suspects were detained the same day as the monday noon attack at the forbidden city gate across from tiananmen square in the culturally and politically sensitive section of beijing where china s communist party leaders live and work a statement on the beijing police microblog said the perpetrators had also been identified as a man with an ethnic uighur name his wife and his mother the five suspects arrested on suspicion of conspiring in the attack also were identified with typically uighur names see also china s tiananmen square cleared as jeep hurtles toward crowd killing 3 an attack in one of the eastern population centers is something that the chinese authorities have been worried about for a long time said university of michigan expert philip potter once this threshold has been crossed it is a difficult thing to constrain potter said predicting tighter surveillance and scrutiny of uighurs in eastern cities all three attackers died when their vehicle exploded beneath the portrait of mao zedong hanging from tiananmen gate two tourists including a filipino woman were killed by the vehicle as it sped down a crowded sidewalk and 38 people were injured including three filipino citizens and a japanese man knives iron rods gasoline and a flag imprinted with religious slogans were found in the vehicle police said uighurs are muslim turks native to the restive northwestern region of xinjiang where extremists opposed to chinese rule have been battling security forces for years the statement said the five detained had helped plan and execute the attack and were caught 10 hours after it was carried out it said they had been on the run and were tracked down with the help of police in xinjiang and elsewhere it didn t say where they were captured but said police had found jihadi flags and long knives inside their temporary lodgings the initial understanding of the police is that the oct 28 incident is a case of a violent terrorist attack that was carefully planned organized and plotted the statement said the attack appears to mark a new boldness on the part of militants inspired by radical islam and follows a particularly bloody summer of clashes in xinjiang including an attack on a police station that have left at least 56 people dead this year the government typically calls the incidents terrorist attacks china has up to now been largely successful at limiting both the volume and effectiveness of domestic terrorist attacks while containing them mainly to xinjiang however the chinese government had warned that radicals might be planning attacks outside of xinjiang xinjiang borders afghanistan and unstable central asian states with militant islamic groups and uighurs are believed to be among militants sheltering in pakistan s lawless northwestern region china says much of the violence is

hotels and airlines are reported to have unofficial bans on catering to uighurs and many employers refuse to hire them hotels won t take us and you can t rent if your id shows a xinjiang residence people look at us with a lot of prejudice said yusuf mahmati 33 a uighur fur trader plying his wares on a busy beijing sidewalk across from a crafts and curios market uighurs in beijing say police
