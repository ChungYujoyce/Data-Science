 monday 05 november 2012 10 59 am the candidates are chasing each other through eight of the most competitive states as national and state level data show obama with a slim yet potentially decisive edge in the quest for the 270 electoral college votes needed to win meanwhile democrats appealed to a federal court in ohio for clarification on last minute rules imposed by the republican secretary of state on voters who cast provisional ballots generally used by those whose eligibility is in question and in florida where long lines risk turning voters away the action leaves open the possibility for further disputes that could last through election day republicans say they are concerned with preventing voter fraud while democrats argue they are working to protect voting rights the fight over every vote came as obama led romney 48 percent to 45 percent in an oct 31 nov 3 national poll conducted by the pew research center a survey that was deadlocked at 47 percent each a week ago polls conducted by nbc news with the wall street journal and abc news with the washington post also showed movement for the president in recent days albeit a one percentage point edge for obama that is inside the margin of error for both surveys state polls in weekend polls in ohio and iowa two of the most hard fought states the president held a slight advantage suggesting the race will turn on which candidate does the better job of turning out his own supporters don t wait to vote obama urged a mostly black crowd of 13 500 voters packed into cincinnati ohio s fifth third arena last night who do you trust obama asked the crowd which shouted back you saying he knows what real change is the president added i delivered it i ve got the scars to prove it romney pressing to expand his potential routes to victory made his first appearance in more than a month in pennsylvania a state that has favored obama in polls until recently your voices are being heard all over the nation romney told more than 20 000 people gathered at a farm in morrisville pa the people of america understand that we re taking back the white house because we re going to win pennsylvania late pennsylvania clash a muhlenberg college morning call poll conducted nov 1 3 found obama leading romney 49 percent to 46 percent within the margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points that s a smaller edge than the five percentage point advantage the president held late last month romney s performance in the first presidential debate rendered the state a great opportunity for him spokesman kevin madden said david plouffe a senior adviser to obama s re election effort called the republican s pennsylvania visit a desperate ploy elsewhere the movement in public sentiment signaled gains for obama virginia poll in virginia a nbc news wall street journal marist college poll released today showed obama with 48 percent and romney with 47 percent a reversal of the republican s one point advantage in the survey released oct 11 and well within the poll s margin of error of plus or minus 2 9 percentage points the telephone survey of 1 165 likely voters was conducted nov 1 2 in ohio a columbus

percent to 42 percent among likely voters while top strategists for both campaigns predicted victory romney betrayed slightly less conviction telling voters in cleveland ohio yesterday that an obama win was possible but not likely national polls indicated a slight enthusiasm advantage among likely voters for the president with abc saying 69 percent of likely obama voters were very enthusiastic compared with 62 percent of romney s and pew saying 39 percent of likely obama voters support him strongly compared with 33 percent of romney s early voting the republican s late pennsylvania push came as early voting returns showed the former massachusetts governor will start tomorrow lagging in several of the most competitive states obama s advantage is especially strong in nevada and iowa while romney has maintained an edge in colorado both campaigns put their spin on the numbers with obama s camp arguing they have built insurmountable leads and romney s countering that they are positioned to obliterate any advantage on election day for governor romney to win states like ohio iowa nevada and north carolina he s going to have to carry election day by a huge margin plouffe said on nbc s meet the press program yesterday rich beeson romney s political director said on fox news sunday that his team has done a better job at getting low propensity voters those who only cast ballots sporadically and typically need more prodding to do so to the polls in advance republicans for whatever reason tend to vote like to vote on election day he said nevada ballots in nevada where the equivalent of 72 percent of the total 2008 vote has been cast registered democrats have completed 43 9 percent of ballots republicans 37 percent and independents 19 1 percent state data shows in a sign that both sides believe the state is trending toward obama neither he nor romney visited during the final weekend of campaigning in iowa more than 613 000 people had cast ballots through nov 2

nationally almost 30 million people have cast ballots according to the united states elections project at george mason university in fairfax va more than a third of the total electorate is expected to vote early in ohio virginia and wisconsin voters don t register by party so it s less clear which party has the early vote edge still obama s campaign is buoyed by evidence that early turnout is strong in ohio counties that backed him in 2008 franklin and cuyahoga counties the most populous in the state had through yesterday achieved 88 percent of the early vote they recorded four years ago when obama won according to data from the elections project and the county elections boards early voting will continue through today ohio pace at the same time some smaller republican leaning counties carried by obama s 2008 rival arizona senator john mccain including warren in the southwest of the state and washington in the southeast have already outpaced their early voting total of four years ago both candidates were trying to appeal to the vast majority of voters who have not yet cast a ballot you reach across the street to your neighbor with a yard sign and i ll reach across the aisle to the people from the other party romney promised several thousand voters in des moines obama stumped with bill clinton working to tie his record and philosophy to those of the former president and
