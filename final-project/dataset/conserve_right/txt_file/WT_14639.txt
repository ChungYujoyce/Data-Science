that is good for no one moscovici told reporters trade wars are not easy they create no winners only casualties u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin disputed that protectionism is the issue people are trying to make this about the united states and protectionism that s not the case at all he said at a news conference this is about the united states wanting fair and free trade we very much support the idea that trade is important for the global economy but it s got to be on fair and reciprocal terms mnuchin said there had been no substantive discussions with china about trade during the meeting asked what it would take to re start talks with the asian giant he said anytime that they want to sit down and negotiate meaningful changes i and our team are available as the gathering wound up moscovici said differences of position remain despite talks these meetings have been taking place in an international context which is very challenging trade tensions remain high and they threaten to escalate further he said christine lagarde managing director of the international monetary fund has warned that a wave of tariffs could significantly harm the global economy lowering growth by about 0 5 percent in the worst case scenario mnuchin disagreed sunday saying that overall the u s economy has not been harmed by the trade battles set off by trump s get tough policies he acknowledged however that some individual sectors have been hurt and said u s officials are looking at ways to help them we see some micro impacts where people our counterparts are targeting very very specific items in very specific communities he said but from a macro standpoint we do not yet see any significant impact on the economy so far global markets have remained generally calm despite the u s china trade war and the other trade conflicts but analysts say they expect trump will impose more tariffs on china and potentially other key u s trading partners with those nations almost certain to retaliate the result could be higher prices for americans diminished export sales and a weaker u s economy by next year they say moscovici said the g 20 meeting had not been tense he said that countries must remain cool headed and maintain a proper sense of perspective and that the eu remains open to dialogue that s why eu president jean claude juncker and eu trade commissioner cecilia malmstrom will meet with trump in washington next week he said we hope this meeting will be productive and successful mnuchin said that the u s looks forward to those discussions the group of 20
