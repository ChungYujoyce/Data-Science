to enjoy all the benefits of our website the us and china are notmerely failing to provide global leadership they are obstructing thecause of multilateralism get the new statesman s morning call email the london summit of 2 april 2009 is often cited as a turning point in histories of the financial crisis it was the moment when g20 leaders came together and agreed economic support and new financial regulations under the leadership of uk prime minister gordon brown if the current crisis were going to have a similar moment it would have been 24 april when the world health organisation who emmanuel macron probably the nearest equivalent to a 2009 vintage brown figure today and others hosted a virtual summit to lay out a path to a vaccine that could be shared throughout the world we re facing a common threat which we can only defeat with a common approach who director tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said yet two particularly important parties were missing i hope we ll manage to reconcile around this joint initiative both china and the us added macron pointedly they were also largely missing on 4 may when european commission president ursula von der leyen gathered some 40 global leaders for an online summit donors pledged 8bn towards securing a genuinely global vaccine but again the two giants were missing china participated in a low key manner sending its ambassador to the eu where most were represented by heads of government and the us federal government was entirely absent though as many as 90 possible vaccines are being investigated even optimistic predictions suggest that it will take 12 to 18 months to find one then there is the question of producing billions of doses which could take much longer the nascent quest for a vaccine against covid 19 will go in one of two directions it might and should be an exercise in multilateralism countries contributing their financial and scientific resources so that the most vulnerable people worldwide can be protected as fast as possible irrespective of where they live or it might be the very opposite a race between countries to get exclusive control of a vaccine that can be used to inoculate domestic populations first and thus gain an advantage over others in reopening societies and economies and then used for geopolitical leverage this would be a world of bitter and perhaps violent conflicts and closed borders as governments stepped in to shield mostly vaccinated populations from unvaccinated ones there is also a third possible outcomein which no vaccine is foundand we simply have to learn to live with both the virus and a permanent spectre of lockdowns focusing instead on antiviral drugs but for now early indications suggest that it is the second world that is most likely in march a german newspaper
