on of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion last month the department of defense released its annual report on china s growing military power this year s report is full of useful data and well calibrated interpretations but for taiwan the picture it paints is not good the report concludes that china s people s liberation army pla acquisition of capabilities relevant to taiwan continues without any reduction deployments of advanced assets opposite the island have not eased and the military balance continues to shift in china s favor it judges that china is acquiring capabilities in the service of three objectives to deter taiwanese independence to influence taiwan to settle on beijing s terms and to deter delay or deny possible u s support for the island in case of conflict china thus seeks to enhance its options while restricting those of taiwan and the united states given china s fundamental interests these objectives make some sense superficially if taiwan were to become a separate country that would be a huge blow to china s sense of self and its great power ambitions and if it had to fight to reverse a taiwanese decision for full independence china would want to frustrate any u s effort to come to the island s defense top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century but these trends are still puzzling cross strait relations have improved significantly since 2008 president ma ying jeou has sought to reassure china and expand cooperation with it the long term chances that any taiwanese leader would push for full independence or that the public would support such a measure is probably low these trends do not mean unification will happen anytime soon but they do mean beijing can act on the basis of its hopes rather than its fears yet the military buildup continues why it does is something of a mystery the pla likely believes it does not yet have the capacity to deal with the worst case scenario which it has made the basis of its planning there is one area in which china may be showing restraint the deployment of short range ballistic missiles the defense department report estimate for this year is the same as the one for last year between 1 050 and 1 150 missiles yet this pause if that is what it is is less significant than it seems first the number of pla cruise missiles is growing perhaps by 100 in the past year the defense department s estimate of existing missiles is between 200 and 500 second china s ability to frustrate u s intervention to defend taiwan increases apace third the ballistic missiles themselves are becoming more accurate and have more effective munitions even if the number of missiles has remained constant the damage they can do to taiwan s command and control airfields ports and other infrastructure is increasing the scale of the potential damage is what is important to taiwan s security not the precise number of missiles what are the implications of these developments first taiwan needs to continue to strengthen its deterrence second the united states should continue to sell arms to taiwan to help it build that deterrence and reduce the island s sense of vulnerability third china should examine the counterproductive effect of its military buildup increasing taiwan s sense of vulnerability will not win the hearts and minds of taiwan s people it betrays a lack of confidence in the good sense of taiwan s voters china only hurts its cause by acting in ways that lead taiwanese citizens to vote on the basis of their fears rather than their hopes richard bush is a senior fellow and director of the center for northeast asian policy studies at the brookings in
