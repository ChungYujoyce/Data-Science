apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap as china s government faces mounting international pressure to grant imprisoned nobel peace prize laureate liu xiaobo his wish to leave the country for treatment of advanced liver cancer it s fighting back with a familiar strategy information control from coordinated leaks of hospital surveillance video to a near total news blackout for chinese language media and social media the chinese government s sprawling propaganda apparatus has revved up efforts to contain the controversy surrounding its most prominent political dissident in an update tuesday afternoon the hospital treating liu said he remains in critical condition and is now on dialysis and organ support top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender liu was convicted in 2009 of inciting subversion for his role in the charter 08 movement calling for political reform he was awarded the nobel peace prize a year later while in prison chinese media have hardly mentioned repeated calls by the u s the european union and others for beijing to let liu leave on humanitarian grounds instead state media provided extensive coverage this past week of president xi jinping s recent achievements especially his travels to russia and germany which they portrayed as a massive public relations triumph for china on tuesday state newspapers including the official people s daily and the english language china daily trumpeted xi s call to unswervingly advance china s judicial reform and improve the military meanwhile the daily barrage of questions about liu fired off by the international press at foreign ministry news briefings has been excised from the ministry s published transcripts as if they were never asked the few mentions of liu in the state media s overseas oriented english editions in recent weeks contained denouncements and tough language aimed at foreign audiences it is probably out of politics that some people and forces are requesting liu to be treated abroad the nationalistic global times tabloid published by the people s daily said in an editorial tuesday headlined liu s cancer treatment mustn t be politicized today s china is stronger and more confident and will not yield to western pressure it said accusing unidentified overseas forces of squeezing liu for their political goals foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang reiterated on tuesday that china hopes other countries can respect china s judicial sovereignty and not use such an individual case to interfere in china s domestic affairs the response is a reflection of the party s fear of showing weakness either at home or abroad said andrew nathan an expert on chinese history and politics at columbia university any sign of giving way would only encourage domestic enemies and foreign critics nathan said adding been tough up to now better continue being tough to the end a more subtle effort to shape the narrative came this week when a video from liu s hospital room emerged just as the government was saying that he was too sick to be transported abroad and was already receiving world class treatment in china surveillance video from saturday leaked to english language chinese state media showed two foreign doctors at liu s bedside telling his wife liu xia that the medical team assembled by china s government was doing its utmost for her husband however in a subsequent statement that was ignored by chinese media the german and american doctors said liu was capable of traveling abroad and the german embassy in beijing lashed out at china for selectively leaking the video to state media in a breach of doctor patient confidentiality it seems that security organs are steering the process not medical experts the embassy said this behavior undermines trust in the authorities dealing with mr liu s case which is vital to ensure maximum success of his medical treatment the hospital video leak followed a familiar pattern after liu s diagnosis was made public in june a jailhouse video montage quickly found its way onto youtube that showed him playing badminton with a prison guard chatting with his wife during a visit and sitting for a teeth cleaning all intended to show a decent quality of life behind bars at jinzhou prison at one point he was shown remarking about the great care that prison authorities have shown for his health watson meng who runs the overseas chinese language media site boxun that reposted the video told the associated press that he believed it must have been released by the authorities as part of their propaganda campaign outside of official channels unauthorized discussion of liu has been swiftly punished a police document that surfaced on the internet this week described how a 38 year old man in central hunan province had been detained for seven days for discussing liu s situation on wechat a social media messaging app local police in the city zhangjiajie said they could not respond to questions
