president trump calls a temporary truce in the trade war with china at a summit of world leaders in argentina begin videotape donald trump president of the united states we aposve made tremendous progress at the g20 with many nations wallace we aposll break down the summit and how the president dealt with challenges from china russia and saudi arabia with two key senators republican roy blunt a member of the gop leadership and democrat ben cardin a member of the senate foreign relations committee then remembering a war hero turned statesman george h w bush former president i really believe it i really believe there can be no definition of a successful life that does not include service to others wallace we aposll revisit some of our special moments with bush 41 do you feel a tremendous sense of pride when you see not just your children but your grandchildren carrying on the family tradition bush a total sense of pride and great happiness wallace and we aposll get reaction from former vice president dick cheney who served as his secretary of defense and james baker who served us as secretary of state together only on fox news sunday plus we aposll ask our sunday panel about the legacy of president bush bush made plenty of mistakes got some things right bottom line serve with honor wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace you are looking live at the ronald reagan presidential library and air force one that carried our 40th president around the globe in pursuit of peace and welcome to a special hour of fox news sunday from the sixth annual reagan national defense forum a gathering of key figures in national security it was here we learned of the death of former president bush who among his many roles served as reagan aposs vice president we aposll spend much of this hour reflecting on bush aposs accomplishments including a joint interview with dick cheney and james baker but we begin with breaking news president trump has put the brakes on his trade dispute with chinese president xi let aposs bring white house correspondent kevin corke live in buenos aires where president trump met with world leaders kevin kevin corke fox news white house correspondent chris by agreeing to effectively a 90 day cease fire president trump and his chinese counterpart sent a very strong message to a market rattled world that the ongoing trade dispute between the world aposs two largest economies could soon be entering a new phase begin videotape trump this is a very important meeting a lot of people are looking forward to it i know that president xi and myself are looking forward to it corke for two and a half hours the world watched and waited that aposs along the high stakes talks between president trump and his chinese counterpart lasted here at the g20 summit in argentina a working dinner that proved long on process but somewhat short on specifics we did learn that americans agreed to leave tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports at 10 percent at the beginning of the new year agreeing not to raise them to 25 percent as previously threatened in return china agreed to buy a substantial but unspecified amount of agricultural energy industrial and other products from the u s to reduce its trade balance both countries agree they will try to have this transaction completed within the next 90 days if it doesn apost happen the americans insist it will be raised to 25 percent meanwhile after avoiding any public interaction with russian president vladimir putin for much of the summit the white house confirmed that president trump did in fact have an informal conversation with the russian leader speaking at a cultural event here that not coincidentally was closed to reporters a bit of housekeeping for you chris we also learn from the president that his next meeting with north korea aposs leader kim jong un will likely take place in early 2019 january or february according to the president who also told us we would strongly consider a two week extension to avoid a government shutdown a funding extension that is as the nation mourns the death of president bush chris wallace kevin corke reporting from buenos aires kevin thanks for that joining us now with reaction to the meeting with president xi is one of the senate aposs republican leaders roy blunt senator as kevin just reported president trump has agreed to pause any inquiries and tariffs or new tariffs for 90 days while we negotiate with the chinese about trade issues trade architecture issues like trade technology and also about their buying more u s goods but isn apost that the kind of vague nonspecific offer from the chinese that the trump administration has rejected in the past sen roy blunt r mo vice chair republican conference well chris first let me join all the americans who express in such gratitude for president bush in his life and his great example but on this topic people like me who have really been concerned about the president aposs stated trade policy can take some encouragement about what happened in the last couple of days the signing of the u s canada mexico agreement that aposs a big step that six months ago or even just a few weeks ago we were concerned we would not be making that kind of progress and on the chinese front you aposre exactly right but we need more specifics here the ag products that come from my state that come the middle of the country i think the soybean exports to china have gone to virtually zero from about one out of every three rows of soybeans were being exported to china so whether it aposs those kinds of crops or pork or beef or chicken we need to see some real specific figures here this has hurt a lot of missouri farm families and farm families all over the country but the president aposs goal to get china in a better and fairer place in trade is the right goal i aposm just hoping that what we aposve seen in the canada mexico side of the ledger is now going to have the same kind of impact as we are negotiating seriously with china wallace do you worry and you kind of indicate you do about the impact that the president aposs trade wars around the world but especially with china are having on the economy we see the stock market jumping up and down gm announced layoffs this week that is going to close five plants and lay off 15 000 workers do you worry that the president aposs trade policy is playing a role in all of that blunt well i am concerned about it and the president knows that he aposs been very open to talking with me about it but i think it aposs hard to win a trade war and i also think though that the facts on the table with china are stronger than any other country in terms of our legitimate concerns in the more other things that the president can move off the table whether it aposs canada mexico the e u japan the more of those things he can move off the table the more flexibility he has with china but i aposd like to see china become the market that they should be for us but i would also like to see china create the opportunities for american companies that invest there to do things besides just steal our intellectual property and violate the agreements that china has clearly made and doesn apost stand up to wallace senator president trump also canceled his meeting with vladimir putin at the g20 he said because of russian aggression against ukraine but the russians a spokeswoman for the russian foreign ministry suggested that the main reason the real reason may be because of president trump aposs domestic political problems including new revelations from the special counsel two questions about that do you think that the special counsel aposs investigation has cast a cloud and made it more difficult for president trump to do business on the world stage and what you think of the fact because this is not the first time that robert mueller has announced some action just as the president was headed out on a foreign trip blunt well you know i haven apost thought a lot about the mueller thing here i certainly do think that lying to the intelligence committee that i aposm part of it is a big mistake for whoever does it and create lots of problems for the committee itself you know when you lie to a congressional committee when you live to an investigation were hundreds and thousands of man hours people hours are being spent the question you asked the next witness may be different a witness you don apost call may be somebody you would have called if you aposve gotten the right answer i aposm glad to see the special prosecutor taking that particular crime seriously but on the russian front i hope if the president did have any words to exchange with president putin it was outrage about what the russians are doing in ukraine it is totally unacceptable the president i think announced that he wasn apost going to have that meeting pretty quickly after what happened in ukraine as were opposed to in response to anything else and if the president had a chance to talk to president putin i hope his talk was very frank and no holds barred that we are not going to accept the kind of activity that the russians are looking at in ukraine and crimea and we better send a strong message about the rest of eastern europe wallace senator blunt thank you thanks for coming in blunt great to be with you wallace always good to talk with you sir joining us now the number two democrat on this senate foreign relations committee ben cardin senator your reaction to the pause that has been announced in president trump aposs trade war with china sen ben cardin d maryland well chris first it aposs good to be with you and clearly it is encouraging to see that we are talking with the chinese on the trade front china has created many problems with trade they have many obstacles to free trade my concern about the president aposs trade policy is that his first action was to take tariffs against our closest allies based upon national security exceptions we aposve lost the unity that we needed in dealing with china so now as we go to a g20 meeting the conversations take place we only two partners where we would have been stronger if we had our closest allies working with us in regards to a china solution ph wallace we talked with senator blunt about the gm layoff and you know about that personally because part of that layoff is the closing of a facility in baltimore that employs more than 300 people do you think that the president aposs trade policy and the imposition of tariffs not just on china but other countries around the world has played a part in the gm layoffs the added costs for steel and aluminum and for a lot of the economic instability that we are seeing right now cardin i do i do think that the way the president has gone about the trade policies imposing tariffs there aposs a consequence there aposs a domestic consequence and clearly general motors decisions are in part based upon the tariffs issue so yes it has an impact and it cost us jobs here in america wallace let aposs turn to russia and you heard my discussion with senator blunt about the canceling of the meeting varied reasons given the white house says it was because of russian aggression in ukraine the russians suggested maybe it was because of president trump aposs problems with the special counsel do you worry at all but the special counsel is casting a cloud over this president and his ability to do business on the world stage after all robert mueller has been at this since may of 2017 and yes there have been some guilty pleas including from michael cohen this week but there still is no solid evidence of any collusion between president trump and the russians cardin chris i worry more about this president interfering with an independent investigation and what impact that has not only in america but for the rule of law around the world mr mueller needs to be able to complete his investigation without interference he aposs already had too much interference from the trump white house so i think that america which stands for the rule of law the leading democratic country in the world our president needs to respect the independence of this investigation and that aposs a clear message around the world i don apost think this investigation is affecting america aposs ability to deal with our problems around the world wallace finally i got about a minute left president trump says that we still don apost have solid audio gap that saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman was responsible for the murder of jamal khashoggi first of all do you think is wrong and secondly even if you believe that mbs is responsible how do we balance our outraged over this horrific act with the fact that it may be in our national security interest to continue to have an alliance with saudi arabia cardin chris i sort of compare this to president trump aposs denial of mr putin aposs involvement in our 2016 elections even though the evidence was very clear there aposs no doubt in my mind that the crown prince understood what was happening in turkey and was very much involved in that we cannot allow that type of conduct to go unchallenged our strength american foreign policy the values that we stand for and what happened in turkey just affects all of our core beliefs the united states has to have a pretty strong position on it and we have to demand that there aposd be accountability that does not mean that we can apost continue to have a strategic relationship with the kingdom of saudi arabia they need america it aposs more important for that relationship from the saudi aposs point of view and we must make it clear that it can apost go unchallenged wallace senator cardin thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir cardin thanks chris wallace up next we will have a live report on the plans to honor george h w bush and we aposll take a look at some of his memorable moments right here on this program as fox news sunday continues from the air force one pavilion at the ronald reagan presidential library commercial break wallace president trump is designating wednesday as a national day of mourning for george h w bush and plans are coming together for the nation aposs farewell to our 41st president let aposs bring in senior correspondent rick leventhal live from houston with the latest on what we aposll see this week arrangements that george bush like all presidents approved as his final message to the country he loved so dearly rick rick leventhal fox news senior correspondent chris george h w bush was surrounded by circle of family friends and clergy during his final hours here friday night inside his home in this gated community and his final words were to his son george w who told him on speakerphone he aposd been a wonderful dad and he loved him bush 41 told his son i love you too and he passed not long after his body is now at a local funeral home tomorrow the casket will be transported to washington d c thanks to a lift from the white house begin video clip donald trump president of the united states most of you know the process the procedure but we aposll be sending air force one which is a special tribute that he deserves he aposll be missed he aposll be greatly missed terrific person terrific man end video clip leventhal president bush will lie in state in the capitol rotunda for 38 hours until 7 00 a m wednesday declared a national day of mourning stock markets will be closed and congress will hold off on votes focusing instead on a funeral service at the national cathedral where president trump and first lady melania are expected along with former presidents and scores of other dignitaries and heads of state afterwards george h w bush will return home for a family funeral at st martin aposs episcopal church thursday morning and that afternoon he aposll be buried in college station home to the bush library alongside his wife barbara and daughter robin who died of leukemia as a child today is expected to be quiet reserved for family and close friends chris wallace rick leventhal reporting from houston rick thank you i had the good fortune to sit down with george bush twice after he left office and i think our talks give you a real insight into why so many people who knew this president including me loved the man the first time was in his presidential library and museum at texas a m university i asked the president where he got his strong commitment to public service begin videotape george h w bush former president some of it was from my parents i watched my father at an early age not realizing what he was up to doing a lot of charitable works my mother pounded into us early on do something for others it aposs always been a part of my life but i really believe it i really believe there can be no definition of a successful life that does not include service to others wallace do you see a tremendous sense of pride when you see not just her children but your grandchildren carrying on the family tradition bush total sense of pride and great happiness i aposm not trying to sit at the head table anymore chris i aposve done that and i aposve enjoyed it and i aposve had a lot of challenges but i take an enormous pride his grandkids all of them and watching them come along the only thing about getting old is you know i just don apost i want to be around to see the success in life wallace i know you aposre not you aposre going to shudder when i say this but aren apost you a dynasty like the kennedys aren apost the bushes bush two words i don apost like dynasty and legacy we don apost think of ourselves as a dynasty onward it goes i mean that kind of thing i really hope some of my grandkids will be actively involved in politics wallace and why not legacy because i would think that you would like the legacy of public service and commitment bush well if that aposs what i would like to do is have somebody else figure out that aposs what motivates me and motivates barbara and i just think let the historians do it wallace you have led the most remarkable life war hero successful businessman ambassador to the u n liaison to china cia director vice president president elder statesman how do you explain it how was george w bush able to accomplish so much bush oh i guess some of it might be ambition which is not particularly worthy way of describing it when i was down president comes along and gives me an interesting assignment that aposs happened two or three times in my life so i don apost i don apost really find it that remarkable looking back i find that i aposve had a very exciting and wonderful challenge of a life but then i don apost miss a lot of the things that i used to live i used to pick up that paper or turn on fox and listen to the news and said listen to this look at this why is he saying that i don apost do that anymore i aposm kind of calmer quieter old guy wallace kinder gentler bush kinder gentler fellow ph i really am wallace as we walked through the bush library we walked through the presidency we started with the recreation of the oval office and i asked mr bush if he ever lost his sense of awe for the room bush i always feel a special place for the american people and for foreign visitors let them stand outside an american citizen i aposm going to go in there and tell this guy off you know and you get in there and they start shaking and they don apost tell you off and it has a majesty to it wallace it aposs been called the ultimate home court advantage bush it aposs true and i hadn apost heard that but that aposs very true every single day when i walked into this office from the store over here you feel a sense of awe and a sense of respect and i tried to treat the office with respect but i have many happy memories i looked down there and there was a secure phone in there i remember colin powell coming in one day and they said it aposs time to end of the shooting in kuwait and he picked up the secure phone right there and was on there to schwarzkopf in about 45 seconds give me schwarzkopf they got him on that and they confirmed it was time to end the battle wallace we then moved on to a version of the situation room were president bush and his team handle crises bush now i aposm going to sit down and watch you at work wallace you had to deal with choices the president faced during the first gulf war such as when to tell the american people in 1990 he was sending troops to saudi arabia to confront saddam hussein if it aposs known immediately that wouldn apost be prudent bush no it wouldn apost be prudent not going to do that wallace i aposll try three yes congratulations bush amazing role you are on here wallace easy for you to make a decision or would you agonize about it a lot bush well i aposve when they say we need a decision by 5 00 today because we want to move forces i had no problem doing but you always kind of hope you are right wallace we spoke with president bush again in january of 2009 just as george w bush was about to leave the white house and we discussed that historic relationship between a father and son who were both presidents do you know there aposs been a lot of pop psychology about you bush yes wallace and 43 i will call them in your presence and i know you hate these questions but i aposm going to ask what aposs the relationship crosstalk wallace what aposs the relationship bush like any other father and son that have a loving relationship total confidence in one another i aposve tried to stay out of his way on the issues but i aposm in touch telephone last yesterday evening we get home to houston the telephone it aposs the president how aposs mom how are you doing dad and like we are like any family and that aposs important i think especially in times of real difficulty for our country wallace do you think there aposs ever been and i say this quite frankly thinking of my father and me ever been a sense of competition to him with you or you with him bush you hear it but there isn apost any such competition and it burns me up a little bit when the president first came and i thought there aposs some people around him were trying to you have to establish her own persona and all he didn apost have to establish anything i aposve known who you are and he aposs known that we know that but i don apost think there aposs ever been in a competition of that nature than i aposm aware of and i don apost think he aposs ever felt it wallace we also spoke about his son jeb who was then the former governor of florida bush i aposd like to see him run i aposd like to see him be president someday wallace really bush or maybe senator whatever yes i would i mean right now is probably a bad time but there aposs enough bushes in there but no i would and i think he aposs as qualified and is able as anyone i know in the political scene now you aposve got to discount that he aposs my son he aposs my son that i love wallace would you really want after all you aposve gone through yourself and your son to have another son go through the way ph bush absolutely it aposs a question it aposs about service service to the greatest country on the face of the earth and the honor that goes with it but not just to be president to be something but to earn it and to do something that makes you worthy and i think jeb fits that description wallace when we talked about a year ago i asked you if you planned to mark your 85th birthday the way you spend your 80th birthday by jumping out of an airplane and you said yes at that time is that still your goal bush still on still on it will be right around june 12th as you can see them hobbling down the hall with my cane people are saying look at this old idiot he aposs going to make a parachute jump i am just because you are an old guy you don apost need to sit around sucking your thumb in the corner old guys can still do stuff and it brings out the fact that old people can still do interesting things scary things exciting things wallace but our lasting memory of this remarkable man and values was from an earlier interview his presidential library when we walked into the kind of tent where u s soldiers camped in the desert during the first gulf war it aposs got to be the hardest thing for any president to send troops bush oh it aposs the toughest decision the president make no question nothing compares to it when you send somebody else aposs kid somebody else aposs son somebody else aposs daughter whatever it is into harm aposs way wallace on a personal level how do you live with it bush well you with all respect you pray and you rely heavily on a team of experts but in the final analysis you live with the decision and sometimes things worked out great and sometimes i was very worried they wouldn apost and your suit up to be president that goes with the territory wallace the library had a powerful film that took you back to that night in 1991 when the air war was launched bush i will never forget that night wallace you must be thinking is this is going on you know get home everybody get home bush yes bring aposem home wallace the president remembered the courage and humanity of american soldiers and he grew emotional bush my favorite picture the picture of american soldiers surrounding a guy in a foxhole iraqi soldiers in the american guys says we are not going to harm you we are american soldiers wallace this really brings back the sacrifice doesn apost it sir bush it sure does you see that side of the war the fact that he treated those people with respect in spite of the fact they were the enemy it aposs really good end videotape wallace for years i have felt george h w bush was the greatest living american now we have lost him up next more recollections of president bush from two men who knew him well former vice president dick cheney and former secretary of state james baker as fox news sunday reports from the reagan presidential library in california commercial break begin video clip george h w bush former u s president march 6 1991 as commander in chief i can report to you our armed forces fought with honor and valor and as president i can report to the nation aggression is defeated the war is over end video clip chris wallace fox anchor president bush announcing the end of the gulf war and joining me now two men who knew him well former vice president dick cheney who served as bush aposs secretary of defense during that war and james baker who was the secretary of state gentlemen welcome back to fox news sunday secretary baker let me start with you you have called george bush one of our most underrated presidents what is it that you think people failed to understand about george bush and why do you think so many people missed it james baker bush 41 secretary of state well i aposm not sure why they missed it chris except perhaps because he was not re elected he was a one term president in my view and i would bet this is true with dick cheney as well he was the very best one term president this country aposs ever had and perhaps one of the very best presidents of all time but he didn apost blow his own horn he one of his wonderful character traits was to let other people take credit that was something he was brought up with and that aposs the way he operated but he was an extraordinarily if you think about it you go back and you look at the record he was an extraordinarily consequential president of the united states particularly in the arena of foreign affairs wallace let me pick up on that with vice president cheney i think it aposs fair to say that clearly the centerpiece of the bush presidency was the victory in the gulf war over saddam hussein what stands out for you about the way that he led that fight and what about the controversy that we continue to hear his decision not to go on to baghdad and topple saddam dick cheney former u s vice president and bush 41 defense secretary well in terms of his leadership the important thing to remember chris is what we put together during those years with skocoft ph at nsc and jim at state me at defense and then of course the president aposs commander in chief we aposd all worked together back during the ford years and it was in my opinion i aposm probably biased but about the most successful national security foreign affairs defense team that had been my experience to watch operate baker no you aposre absolutely accurate dick cheney and it was well the president obviously was a key part of it and jim and brent and i would have breakfast every wednesday morning and most of the time we could solve our problems among us once in a while we aposd have to take it to him and then he aposd resolve it but he was a consequential leader as you aposve said his knowledge of foreign leaders people he aposd worked with over the years his understanding of the military his willingness to support the military we gave him a very long list of things we wanted to have in the gulf before we launched the offensive weapons he didn apost turn them down on anything he approved all of them and said all right now show me how you aposre going to do it he was a great leader wallace secretary baker one of the things that strikes me about george bush is that he didn apost take the easy path he left yale to volunteer and to become the youngest navy pilot he left connecticut he could have had a very comfortable life there to strike out on his own and become an oil man in texas what do you think that was about baker well i think it was about taking on the hard challenges he was not afraid to take risks no risks no reward kind of thing but let me let me say a quick word if i might chris about the centerpiece as you said for his foreign policy presidency the war the first gulf war which was in my view a textbook example of a way to fight a war you tell the world what you aposre going to do you get all world all the rest of the world behind you to do it you do it you do that and nothing more you bring the troops home and then you get there countries to pay for it we aposve never done that before that is a textbook example of a way to fight a war but that while that may be the centerpiece of his foreign policy accomplishments it certainly wasn apost the only one and you look at the fact that he was able to manage an end a peaceful end to the cold war that was a huge huge accomplishment wallace mr vice president in 2015 president bush told a biographer that he worried that you had become too much of a hard liner in his son aposs white house and he called your approach excuse me his quote iron ass and i i wonder one what you thought of the criticism and two what did that due to your relationship with george bush cheney well first of all i was more i guess of an iron ass when i was vice president the thing that had intervened between my time at defense for 41 and my time is vice president was 9 11 we aposd had 3 000 of our people killed on 9 11 more people than we lost in pearl harbor and we moved i think legitimately into a wartime sitting rather than simple law enforcement i think it was important to do that now after he aposd made those comments he sent me a note one of the notes are great to have this one said dear dick i did it and then he went on at great length to tell me what a great american i was but he also that year we went to the annual alfalfa club he enjoyed those dinners and he invited me to sit at the head table with him at the dinner and that sort of dampened down any notion that there was a fundamental break between bush and cheney baker hey chris that aposs the kind of person he was you know wallace well i aposm glad i aposm glad baker let me say that aposs the kind of person george bush was there was a story early in his administration in 1989 to the effect generally that well the national security council is running foreign policy the state department aposs out of it they aposre not doing and i got a phone call from the president he said he said bake i want you and susan to come up to camp david with me this weekend we did so and there was never another story like that for the entire four years that aposs the kind of person he was wallace secretary baker george bush was not just your colleague not just your boss he was your dear friend for more than 60 years and we have learned in the last few hours that you were with him when he passed away on friday night to the degree you feel comfortable doing it can you share with us his last moments baker yes he had a very gentle and peaceful passing chris only one of his children was in living in houston neil bush neil and his wife maria were there my wife susan and i his rector from our church st martin aposs church in houston the doctors some of the wonderful aides that took care of him in his later years and it was a sweet it was a sweet situation they made arrangements for all of his children to call in to in effect tell him goodbye and his last words the last words george bush ever said were i love you and he said those words to 43 george bush president george bush 43 who had called in to save dad i love you i will see you on the other side and president bush said i love you and those were his last words another tender moment about that chris was that the irish tenor ronan tinan ph was in town he aposd come to town just to pay a courtesy call on president bush and he happened to be there and he saying a couple of songs for president bush on that last evening and he one of them was silent night and as he was singing president bush was mouthing the words of silent night he had a very gentle and easy passing the kind we ought to all hope we have wallace secretary baker mr vice president we want to thank you both so much thank you for joining us today cheney thank you chris baker thank you thanks chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the legacy of president bush oh how he hated that word and how much washington has changed since he was in office when we come back from the reagan presidential library in simi valley california commercial break begin video clip george h w bush former u s president i have no regrets in the sense of not being able to communicate better but i know if i aposd have had the skills of ronald reagan i probably would have had a fourth year another four years because he was so good end video clip wallace former president bush discussing one of the big disappointments in his life his failure to win re election as president in 1992 and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove incoming house republican conference chair liz cheney and columnist for the hill juan williams karl i think it aposs fair to say that president bush was a classic moderate republican he negotiated bipartisan compromises such as the americans with disabilities act in 1990 he negotiated a budget deal which may have cost him his presidency because in order to cut the deficit he broke his pledge no new taxes how different is the washington of george bush in terms of the idea of legislating compromising from the washington of today karl rove fox news contributor well i think it aposs somewhat different but it in that respect but i think it aposs really different in the tone that he set i mean he was of that greatest generation and there was a humility and a respect and a decency about him that sometimes is not seen frequently in washington today his best friend in congress was lett ph ashley ph a democrat from akron ohio and he had friendships across the aisle based on you know shared background shared experiences and the time that they were together and we don apost see that much in washington anymore wallace you know it aposs interesting liz when i asked your dad the question about iron ass i was a little nervous because about it but he gave such a great answer and it was so revealing about president bush because yes he expressed his opinion but on the other hand it wasn apost personal and he reached out and also made a show of sitting together with your dad at the alfalfa club dinner rep liz cheney r wy incoming republican conference chair well let me just say that i am a proud member of team iron ass chris and but it you know president bush i was struck both by that story but also by the piece were he was you know talking about the soldier in desert storm and i think that the emotion that he showed in terms of how proud he was and how moved he was of america and of our military and i think that aposs something that really helps when you aposre talking about bipartisanship is just getting back to remembering the fundamental goodness and greatness of somebody like george bush but also of our military of our men and women in uniform and that something we all should remember and be able to come around wallace i want to get back juan to the original question that i asked karl you and i had the great good fortune to cover presidents reagan and bush back in the apos80s and to me now it seems like a different world in terms of government aposs ability the leaders in government and the various different factions to come together to compromise and to solve our problems juan williams fox news political analyst no question chris we live in a polarized political age today so divided you know i the way i think of it chris is sort of optimism versus pessimism morning in america a kind kinder gentler america versus american carnage as a message coming from the leader to the american people so when i think of president bush i think of someone who crossed the aisle you know i was really taken by what karl just said about his best friend being a democrat and while he served those two terms in congress and of course he followed reagan aposs pronouncement 11th commandment speak no evil of another republican versus donald trump who has a polarizing relationship with democrats clearly fractured but also attacks other republicans who don apost agree or embrace him and again i think also of policy issues like guns you know after oklahoma city in apos95 president bush quit the nra quit his lifetime membership after what happened in parkland florida you see president trump not only saying that we should arm teachers but continue to do business with the nra wallace i aposm not sure liz that i would go along with the attack on president trump because frankly not to say that he doesn apost make mistakes and hasn apost done somethings wrong but i think there aposs culpability on all sides here and that aposs the question i have for you is is the perception that washington has become a zero sum game were all sides democrats republicans the white house feel i only win if the other side loses is that fair and is it fair to say that this polarization is preventing us from addressing our problems in dealing with it cheney well i really missed juan i forgot how much inaudible but look we we are very polarized i mean one thing that aposs true though is that and i can speak for you know on the floor of the house of representatives there isn apost venom all the time and and i aposve found that you can go sit down next to anybody from any party they aposve got an interesting story and there are good people there for the right reasons now it is the truth however that we have big issues you know we have a lot of democrats now coming in who are socialists that aposs not an you know i aposm not i aposm not exaggerating they are socialists and i think that it aposs very important that we actually do have very aggressive and clear policy debates we aposve got to make sure that we understand the grave national security threat that aposs out there as well as the threat that we aposre facing from the perspective of our debt and and the socialist set of agendas instead issues which i think leader pelosi is probably going to be compelled to have to push forward are ones that would be disastrous for the nation so i think we aposve got to fight and fight hard on those issues wallace i think that juan is going to say he missed you williams there aposs no question we aposve known each other quite a while wallace let aposs try to end this on a more personal note karl you and i before the show began you were saying that george h w bush changed the arc of your life i mean what what did this man mean to you rove great make me cry on national television will you i went to work for him when i was in my early 20s and he and the rest of my life is a result of being associated with him and you know he taught me what it was like to what the kind of person i would strive to be anybody who was around george bush came to love him and admire him and to try and emulate him he was a kind and gentle and decent person he was also strong and principled with great convictions and character and integrity and when you were around him you wanted to emulate those things you know look at what look at that incredible life that he had and jim baker put his finger on a big part of it the fearlessness of a kid who grows up in privilege in the east and his father aposs a bigwig in a wall street firm brown brothers harriman and he says like so many americans i aposm going to strike out for the west and i aposm going to learn the oil business from the bottom up and i aposm going to strike a new life if you go to midland texas to see the modest house it aposs not bigger than the stage that we aposre sitting on here that he lived in in midland and he and he jumps into politics as a republican when they hunted republicans in texas with dogs and then he served our country so well in so many great positions and he did so every you talked to people who had a chance to work with him whether it was the cia or in china or his vice president or wherever in the oil patch and they admired him because he was a he was not only a very great man he was a very good man wallace and and let me just quickly because we aposre running out of time liz any personal remembrance of this man any dealing that you had with him either directly or with through your dad cheney well i just remember election night in 2004 up in the residence of the white house when president bush 41 saw my daughter kate and walked over to her and he said you aposre the youngest person here and i aposm the oldest person and we need to sit together tonight and he sat there the two of them together in an armchair you know deep in conversation wallace and it must have meant a lot to him because that was the second term that he never got but his son did get cheney he was he was a great and good man and as karl said somebody whom we should all strive to inaudible wallace juan 30 seconds williams well you know i traveled with him especially in apos94 for the reagan re election and one of the things that struck me chris was he wrote notes every day to lots of people knew them as human beings had a relationship so if he aposs asking you for something it wasn apost that it was the first call he was asking because he knew you and you knew him and i aposve got to say to reassert what karl just said one of the kindest most loving people self effacing wallace thank thank you panel and we aposll see you all next week back in washington up next how visitors here at the reagan presidential library are getting the chance to meet the 40th president ronald reagan face to face as fox news sunday continues from simi valley
