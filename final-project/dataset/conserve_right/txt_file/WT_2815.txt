apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap for the house progressives a pair of impeachment articles against president donald trump for the vulnerable democratic freshmen charges that are narrowly focused on ukraine and for the whole house democratic majority and however backhandedly trump himself a sweeping new trade deal in the span of 90 minutes tuesday house speaker nancy pelosi unveiled historic legislation in back to back press conferences designed to keep her restive democratic caucus unified long enough to impeach the nation s 45th president the double shot reflected her two track strategy of legislating while investigating and the recognition that americans want democrats to deliver on pocketbook matters like trade and health care great the president tweeted of the trade accord even as he denounced the impeachment drive top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed but the approach also allowed pelosi in her second turn as speaker to undercut the president s claim that she is incapable of passing trade legislation because she s out to get him we ate their lunch oh excuse me she told democrats behind closed doors in some ways the moment was the bookend to pelosi s face to face clap and smirk at trump s state of the union speech feb 5 an address she only allowed because he had retreated in a funding fight and reopened the government this time too pelosi gave the president something he could see as validating the house s version of his u s mexico canada agreement updating the original north american free trade agreement meanwhile she delivered the smackdown of the charges putting trump on track to become only the third impeached president in history the day is young she observed during her second press conference it was 10 30 a m pelosi and other democratic leaders insisted the timing of the trade announcement was more about the looming holiday recess which tends to focus congress but there was no denying the effect of the move i hope it ll prove to the american people that we are doing the walking and chewing gum and flossing and doing it all at once said rep madeleine dean d pa there was more on the policy front the house is heading toward approving a defense bill with an expansion of paid leave for federal workers and they re making progress on legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs a goal trump also has prioritized yet there is much about tuesday s developments that hasn t gone pelosi s way until the ukraine scandal broke at the end of the summer pelosi insisted there would be no impeachment without bipartisan public support but she agreed to launch impeachment proceedings after trump s july 25 phone call with ukraine s president revealed he had asked for the favor of an investigation into joe biden more than two months later that overwhelming public sentiment still isn t there house republicans remain unified against trump s impeachment on a variety of grounds and polls show the public remains deeply split along partisan lines on whether to impeach him meanwhile the republican held senate remains virtually certain to acquit trump rather than summon the 67 votes required to convict and remove him from office nor will there will be quick action on the trade deal in the senate where the matter won t be considered until next year there was early evidence that pelosi s one two move didn t go down easily with some of her members i don t love it rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y a progressive said of pelosi s strategy she said she ll be voting for the articles of impeachment but wishes they covered more of trump s conduct i understand the caucus is where it s at and it took so long just for us to get to this point that i m glad that we have two rep elissa slotkin of michigan one of the freshmen democrats with national security backgrounds who backed an inquiry into ukraine wasn t saying tuesday whether she d take the next step and vote for the articles but she was thrilled about the trade deal in michigan we can t stand nafta usmca is markedly better she said every event that i went to especially in the business community they were pushing me on usmca trump weighed in later saying democrats were embarrassed by the very weak articles of impeachment that s why they brought up usmca an hour after he claimed to reporters before leaving the white house for a campaign rally in pennsylvania they wanted to muffle down impeachment democrats have widely said the investigation showed that trump pressured ukraine to investigate a political rival for his own gain all the while holding up military aid to the u s ally on the border of russia but there remained some sensitivity to ticking off voters in trump leaning districts asked whether democrats want to avoid having impeachment be the last vote before the holiday recess house majority leader steny hoyer replied that would be preferable
