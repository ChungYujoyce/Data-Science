chris wallace fox news anchor i aposm chris wallace tensions between the u s and iran keep rising how real is the threat of war begin videotape mike pompeo secretary of state the international community condemns iran aposs assault on the freedom of navigation and the targeting of innocent civilians wallace the trump administration calls iran a nation of terror placing the blame for those tanker attacks squarely on tehran and the president calls out u s intelligence agencies after a report kim jong un aposs murdered behalf brother was a source for the cia we aposll ask secretary of state mike pompeo about all this when he joins us live then who aposs up and who aposs down ahead of the first democratic debate of 2020 we will debut the latest fox news poll and sen bernie sanders i vt d presidential candidate we must recognize that in the 21st century economic rights are human rights wallace what is bernie sanders apos vision for democratic socialism we aposll ask him in our 2020 sit down only on fox news sunday plus we aposll ask our sunday panel about president trump saying he aposd take research on his political rivals from other countries and a special power player of the week jon stewart calling on congress to support 9 11 first responders jon stewart former host the daily show shameful it aposs an embarrassment to the country and it is a stain on this institution wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace hello again and happy father aposs day from fox news in washington the trump administration is once again turning up the pressure on iran blaming the islamic republic for attacks on two oil tankers the pentagon now considering sending thousands of more troops warships and planes for the region and iranian leader saying they have no interest in dealing with the u s in a moment we aposll talk with the secretary of state mike pompeo but first rich edson had the latest on the escalating tensions with iran and another mass protest in hong kong against chinese interference rich rich edson correspondent chris iran has released a crew of one of the oil tankers attacked last week in the gulf of oman the associated press reports the sailors arrived safely in dubai after spending two days in iran as the situation in the region deteriorates again begin videotape edson iranian forces remove an unexploded mine from one of two targeted ships that aposs according to u s central command attacks in the tankers happened near the strait of hormuz a crucial stripping passage where about 20 percent of the world aposs oil passes through pompeo iran is lashing out because the regime wants our successful maximum pressure campaign lifted edson germany aposs foreign minister says the u s is not enough to blame iran the british government says it is almost certain a branch of iran aposs islamic revolutionary guard corps is responsible for the attacks iran aposs leaders deny involvement president trump says he will negotiate when iran is ready and the president says he is in no rush meanwhile massive demonstrations in hong kong even though its beijing backed chief executive suspended a controversial bill it would allow those accused of crimes in hong kong to face trial in mainland china china assumed hong kong from the british in 1997 under a system allowing it to preserve its lifestyle for at least 50 years end videotape edson there have been substantial demonstrations over this bill and previously or other issues targeted at china aposs attempts to erode freedoms there chris wallace rich edson reporting from the state department rich thank you joining us now to discuss this and more secretary of state mike pompeo mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday pompeo chris it aposs great to be with you wallace president trump says flatly that iran was responsible for the attack on those two tankers and the pentagon has released this video which appears to show a revolutionary guard crew moving an unexploded mine from the haul of one of the boats but as rich reported germany aposs foreign minister says the videos not enough in the japanese owner of one of the ships that he believes from the crew that it was hit by a flying object not a mine two questions how certain are you that iran was responsible for these attacks and do you have more evidence that you can share with us pompeo well chris it aposs unmistakable what happened here these were attacks by the islamic republic of iran on commercial shipping on the freedom of navigation with the clear intent to deny transit through the strait this was on the gulf of oman side of the strait of hormuz there aposs no doubt the intelligence committee has lots of data lots of evidence the world will come to see much of it but the american people should rest assured we have high confidence with respect to who conducted these attacks as well as half a dozen other attacks throughout the world over the past 40 days wallace i want to talk to about that because last month after the first attack on four commercial ships president trump took a very hard line here he is begin video clip donald trump president we aposll see what happens with iran if they do anything it would be a very bad mistake if they do anything i aposm here in little stories about iran if they do anything they will suffer greatly we aposll see what happens with iran end video clip wallace but iran and its surrogates as you noted have responded to the maximum pressure campaign with more aggression not less attacking tankers firing missiles in iraq and into saudi arabia and targeting u s drones in yemen and the persian gulf question mr secretary what aposs the administration going to do about it pompeo well remember chris where we took over we took over from an administration that allowed iran to create enormous wealth build their missile program a clear pathway to a nuclear weapon system this is where the trump administration came in so we wisely withdrew from the jcpoa and put in place an economic pressure campaign one that continues we had a ban on a number of petrochemical companies just this past week president trump has done everything he can to avoid we don apost want a war we aposve done what we can to deter this the iranians should understand very clearly that we will continue to take actions that deter iran from engaging in this behind some kind of behavior i made a number of calls to my colleagues around the world yesterday i am confident we will have partners that understand this threat you have to remember chris too very little of our crude oil comes to the gulf these days china is relying for over 80 percent of its crude japan south korea indonesia these countries are very dependent on freedom of navigation throughout these straits and i aposm confident that when they see the risk the risk of their own economies and their own people and outrageous behavior of the islamic republic of iran they will join us in this wallace i want to pursue this question of you say perhaps more action and perhaps more international action the pentagon is reportedly considering sending as many as 6 000 more troops to the area along with warships warplanes submarines there aposs also been talk about an international coalition to escort commercial ships through the strait of hormuz are those on the table and i guess basically how far is president trump prepared to go pompeo chris president trump has been unambiguous iran will not get a nuclear weapon that aposs the goal that aposs the objective of our entire campaign with respect to iran and to create stability throughout the middle east as part of that effort i don apost want to talk about options that are out there options that are not there the president has made it very clear we aposre going to achieve this objective we continually update options for the president we aposve taken a handful of those actions to increase the opportunity to convince iran that these actions aren apost in their best interests and it appears to be iran that wants to continue to escalate this conflict wallace but should we assume that the u s is going to respond because clearly as i said despite the maximum pressure iran seems to be getting more aggressive not less pompeo chris what you should assume is we are going to guarantee freedom of navigation throughout the strait this is an international challenge this is important to the entire globe the united states is going to make sure that we take all the actions necessary diplomatic and otherwise that achieve that outcome wallace meanwhile congress and we aposre talking now both about republicans and democrats appears ready to block an emergency u s arms sale to saudi arabia which of course is one of the major enemies of iran if they go ahead and do that block the u s arms sale that the trump administration wants what message will that send to mullahs in tehran pompeo yes it would be most unfortunate i think the decision we made to move forward with these arm sales was the right decision was an important decision i think the events of this past week are another piece of that evidence i think we have 40 years of history but even these past 40 days demonstrate the malign activity that puts saudis at risk remember chris just this past week was an iranian backed houthi effort that flew a missile into an airport in saudi arabia saudi arabia has the right to defend itself the united states wants to support our important defense partner in the region and i think moving forward these arms sales made enormous sense and we are going to continue to push forward with them wallace let aposs turn to hong kong the chief executive in hong kong appointed by beijing has announced that she is suspending not killing but suspending a bill of extradition that would allow people in hong kong to be extradited to the chinese mainland the response for the people in hong kong and there was a massive protest again today is to protest the measure millions of citizens coming into the street they say the measure would allow china to crack down on critics you have spoken out against this measure but president trump has said nothing critical about it he simply commented about the size of the demonstrations is he more concerned about maintaining his relationship with president xi than he is in defending human rights pompeo the president has always been a vigorous defender of human rights he aposs going to get the opportunity i think to see president xi in just a couple weeks now in osaka japan at the g20 summit i aposm sure this will be among the issues that they discuss we have a wide range of very important issues in the way china and united states interact for an awfully long time under a republican democrat presidents we allow china to take advantage of us on trade and in other ways president trump has pushed back very strongly against them we see what aposs happening what aposs unfolding in hong kong we are watching the people of hong kong speak about the things they value and we aposll see what ceo lam aposs decision is in the coming days and weeks ahead wallace let aposs turn to another subject there were reports this week that the cia had turned the half brother of kim jong un the north korean dictator into a cia informant before he was murdered in february of 2017 president trump seemed to tell kim this week that that kind of thing wouldn apost happen on his watch take a look begin video clip trump i saw the information about the cia with respect to his brother or half brother and i would tell him that would not happen under my under my auspices that aposs for sure i wouldn apost let that happen under my auspices end video clip wallace as the former head of the cia before you took this job and some of these contacts with kim jong nam reportedly happened on your watch is there something wrong with the u s spying on north korea and even using a family member to do so pompeo i never comment on intelligence matters in any way chris i think you had me on what i was the cia director i aposm going to stay with that rule today the american people should rest assured the united states is taking all the actions that it needs to take to make sure we understand the risks and the threats that are posed by north korea and now in my current role i aposm working to achieve a diplomatic outcome that gets the nuclear weapons out of the hands of north korea wallace just at the risk of pressing this i understand you aposre not going to say what you aposre doing but the president seemed to imply that there were some kinds of spying on north korea as he said that would not happen under his auspices and i think a lot of people are asking why not pompeo we are taking all the efforts necessary to make sure we know what aposs going on all around the world that includes every country chris wallace well let aposs talk about another country russia the u s is reporting today that the u s has increased digital incursions into the electrical grid of russia in effect to send a warning you do cyber attacks on us we can respond and we can mess up your infrastructure president trump called this report in the new york times and i want to get his quote right a virtual act of treason what can you tell us about the new offensive and what you have to say about the new york times reporting this story pompeo i aposve had my moments with the new york times on issues related to protecting american secrets they called out by name and office of the work for me clandestine officer that worked for me it was outrageous it was deeply inconsistent with american values and it was unnecessary it was a throw away it didn apost add to the story line one iota and yet they chose to do that i aposve seen the story this morning i don apost have anything to say about the contents of that i don apost talk about intelligence matters but president trump has been crystal clear during my now two and a half years with the administration we are going to do everything we can prevent any country from interfering in any election in the united states of america we aposll continue to work hard of that i aposm proud of the work this administration does i only wish the previous administration had done the same wallace finally the president created quite a controversy this week when he said that he seemed to invite opposition research on his political rivals in the 2020 campaign from foreign governments here aposs what he had to say begin video clip trump somebody comes up and says hey i have information on your opponent you call the fbi i don apost think i tell you what george stephanopoulos abc news anchor if it aposs coming from russia you do trump i aposve seen a lot of things over my list i don apost think my whole life i aposve ever called the fbi in my whole life you don apost call the fbi life doesn apost work that way stephanopoulos the fbi director says that aposs what should happen trump the fbi director is wrong end video clip wallace is accepting oppo research from a foreign government right or wrong pompeo chris you asked me not to call any of your questions today ridiculous you can really close right there president trump has been very clear he clarified his remarks later he made it very clear even in his first comments he said i aposd do both he said he aposd call the fbi wallace he said maybe i aposd do both he said maybe i aposd do both pompeo president trump has been very clear that he will always make sure that he gets it right for the american people and i aposm confident he aposll do that here as well wallace well at the risk of getting your ire the president told fox and friends on friday and i agree he kind of walked it back pompeo no he didn apost walk it back chris wallace yes he did because he said maybe on thursday and then on friday on fox friends he said he aposd listen first and then if the information was bad that he would take it to the fbi or the attorney general but he also made it clear to george stephanopoulos that he did not see this as foreign interference i want to play a clip of the president aposs own words begin video clip trump i think you might want to listen i don apost there aposs nothing wrong with listening if somebody called from a country norway we have information on your opponent oh i think i aposd want to hear it stephanopoulos you want that kind of interference in our elections trump it aposs not an interference they have information i think i aposd take it end video clip wallace he says it aposs not interference its information the country sir and i don apost have to tell you has a long history dating back to george washington in saying that foreign interference in our elections is unacceptable pompeo chris president trump leaves that too i have nothing further to add i came on to talk about foreign policy and i think the third time you aposve asked me about a washington piece of silliness that chased down the story that is inconsistent with what i aposve seen president trump do every single day wallace i will leave it there i think i only asked you twice but that aposs all right mr secretary thank you thanks for your time and happy father aposs day sir pompeo thank you wallace up next 2020 democratic front runners bernie sanders and joe biden will share a debate stage we aposll debut our latest fox news poll plus senator sanders joins us live for a fox news sunday sit down all that when we come right back commercial break wallace the first democratic debate is now just 10 days away and the two front runners joe biden and bernie sanders will face off against each other with eight other candidates on the second night in a moment senator sanders joins us live but first we have brand new fox polls showing where the race stands right now begin videotape wallace joe biden goes into the first round of debates with a big lead thirty two percent of democratic primary voters support him with bernie sanders trailing at 13 percent and elizabeth warren pete buttigieg and kamala harris bunched in third place this may be the reason for biden aposs lead by almost 3 1 democrats say a steady reliable leadership is more important than a bold new agenda trump i aposd rather run against i think biden than anybody wallace in matchups with president trump biden and sanders have substantial leads among all registered voters while the edge for warren buttigieg and harris is within the poll aposs margin of error sen kamala harris d calif presidential candidate we need to begin impeachment proceedings wallace despite calls for impeachment on the campaign trail up by a margin of more than 2 1 voters say congress should spend less time investigating the president not more but voters have problems with the other end of pennsylvania avenue 54 percent say the white house should be more cooperative with congress only 11 percent want less cooperation end videotape wallace and senator sanders joins us now from burlington vermont for a fox news sunday sit down senator welcome back sanders thank you very much wallace we are going to start with a look at the state of the race at this point and let aposs take a look at the latest fox news poll and this is reflected in other polling as well you sir have dropped sharply from 23 percent support in march to 13 percent now question how do you explain it sanders well i aposll explain it in the sense that polls go up and polls go down but the other part of the poll if i heard you correctly chris is that i am beating president trump fairly decisively which is consistent with all of the polling that i have seen i think frankly i am the strongest candidate to defeat trump i think we can win in pennsylvania wisconsin and michigan and some of the other battleground states and that aposs a fight that i look forward to wallace you seem to be competing most directly perhaps on the left side of the democratic race with democratic senator elizabeth warren and in a new cbs news poll out today of 18 battleground states she actually leads you by one point in those 18 states obviously within the margin of error she says that she supports capitalism and she supports markets but she wants them more tightly regulated why do you think that you aposre a better choice for voters than senator warren with that approach sanders well senator warren is a friend of mine and she aposs a great senator but let me just give you my perspective chris according to federal reserve data the average worker in america today despite a huge increase in productivity and technology is earning exactly the same wages that he or she earned 45 years ago in the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen an increase in the wealth of 21 trillion while the bottom half of america has seen an actual decline in their wealth of some 800 billion in other words we have an economy today that is working phenomenally well for the top 1 percent while the working class of this country is being decimated meanwhile it seems to me that if we re going to bring about real change in this country that means health care to all people raising the minimum wage to a living wage making sure that all of our young people can afford to go to college dealing with climate change dealing with criminal justice reform we need a fundamental change we need a political revolution we need millions of people working class people whose lives have been decimated for the last 45 years to stand up to wall street to stand up to the insurance companies and the drug companies a political revolution that is what i believe in wallace you made a major speech this week to define what you believe in what aposs called democratic socialism here aposs a clip from that speech begin video clip sanders today in the second decade of the 21st century we must take up the unfinished business of the new deal and carry it to completion end video clip wallace but critics sir say that you re defining down democratic socialism to make it more palatable to voters they say that it isn apost just new social programs you listed some and you aposre going to get into them in the moment it aposs actually a dramatic change and a transfer of economic power to the people is that true sanders well it means to say that we have to break up the large financial institutions on wall street who have unbelievable economic power it means that we have to stand up to the drug companies who are or charging us twice as much for the medicine that we need compared to other countries it means that we have to stand up to the insurance companies and move to a medicare for all single payer system we have to stand up to the military industrial complex where there aposs enormous fraud and waste within the pentagon so it does mean chris i think you know what you said is basically true right now real power most people understand this rests with a handful of large corporations and very wealthy individuals and the time is now for us to say you know what we need an economy and a government that works for all of us not just the 1 percent and if people want to accuse me of believing in that i plead guilty yes that aposs what i believe i believe in a vibrant democracy where ordinary people get a fair shake rather than just the 1 percent getting it all wallace but sir let me drill down on that because here aposs what maria svart the executive director of the democratic socialist for america told the new york times last year our ultimate goal really is for working people to run our society and run our workplaces and our economies and back in the apos70s you seem to agree here aposs a quote from you i favor the public ownership of utilities banks and major industries senator do you still believe that in the public ownership of major industries sanders chris that was chris that was wallace and if not why sanders i live in a city that where i am right now we do a public ownership of our electric department and they do a pretty good a lot of electric departments all over this country are publicly owned do i believe that workers should have more say and be sitting on the boards of large corporations yes i do do i believe that we should break up some of the major banks on wall street and support credit unions and community banks yes i do so i think really one of the things we have to look at is the fact that power in this country rests with just a handful of people you aposve got six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 54 percent of the gdp six institutions control the flow of trillions of dollars when we talk about democracy it means not just voting every two years is giving working people more of a say in what goes on in the economy wallace all right let aposs take a look at perhaps your biggest proposal and you have a number of proposals medicare for all and let aposs put up some of the details half of americans 156 million people get their health insurance through their employer according to the kaiser family foundation 68 percent of them give their health plan a grade of a or b so i guess the question is why take away a system that millions of americans like sanders well first of all every single year tens of millions of people move from one plan to the other plan second of all what we are talking about despite a lot of misinformation coming from the insurance companies and the drug companies is allowing all of the american people to continue to go to the doctor that you want to go to go to the hospital that you want to go to and in fact under a medicare for all single payer system we expand medicare for seniors to include dental clear dental care hearing aids and vision care eyeglasses so we expand medicare but right now chris you have a dysfunctional health care system you aposve got 70 million americans who either have no health insurance or they are under insured with high deductibles and copayments we are paying twice as much as any other country on earth for the prescription drugs that we need we spend far more per capita on health care as do the people of any other country medicare as you know is the most popular health insurance program in the country right now but it only applies to people 65 or older what i want to do is over a four year period expand medicare to every man woman and child in this country it will save the average person significant sums of money and provide comprehensive care we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people and that has got to change wallace well i want to pick up on the price which you mentioned because the liberal urban institute assessed your plan back in 2016 and said the cost would be 32 trillion over 10 years and you talked about paying for that through a variety of taxes sanders but chris wallace let me if i may just finished sir sanders yes wallace a variety of taxes on individuals and companies look i fully understand and i accept the idea that you want to do something for the uninsured or even the under insured but isn apost it the essence of big government when you say we know better and even if you and there are as we pointed out tens of millions of people who like getting her insurance in their employer you say no that aposs not right we aposre going to decide what the plan is and you aposre going to do it the way we tell you to sanders well not quite that way first of all you use the number 32 trillion which is roughly probably right that sounds like a lot of money but do know what happens if we keep the current system which is the most wasteful and expensive system in the world over a 10 year period their estimates of the cost will be 50 trillion so the health care costs go up everybody shows that medicare for all will be less expensive than continuing the current dysfunctional health care system wallace but i aposve got about a minute left what about this main point which is you the government president sanders is going to tell people that like getting her insurance either from their union or from their employer no you aposre going to take the coverage we give you sanders look medicare itself is health insurance program it aposs far far more popular than our private insurance companies people don apost like insurance companies they like their doctors and they like their hospitals and we maintain that and right now chris as you know if you aposre in one plan it may cost you a fortune to go to the doctor you want if he or she is not in the same plan we do away with that we give people complete freedom of choice as to the doctor that they want to go to or the hospital they want to go to they will save money we will join every other major country on earth in guaranteeing health care to all we will cut prescription drug costs in half i think that aposs a pretty good deal wallace senator sanders thank you thanks for your time please come back and continue the conversation sir sanders thank you wallace four years ago today donald trump descended that escalator in trump tower to announce his first presidential run and in just two days he aposll launch his official bid for re election in 2020 up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the storm of criticism the president faces for saying he aposd accept dirt on his political rivals from foreign sources plus what would you like to ask the panel about that just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up former late night host jon stewart get serious on capitol hill begin video clip jon stewart former host of the daily show your indifference cost these men and women at their most valuable commodity time end video clip wallace we aposll ask him about his mission to get congress to extend the 9 11 victim compensation fund coming up commercial break begin video clip donald trump president you go and talk honestly to congressman they all do it they always have and that aposs the way it is it aposs called oppo research rep nancy pelosi d calif speaker of the house what the president said last night shows clearly once again over and over again that he does not know the difference between right and wrong end video clip wallace president trump creating quite a stir saying he aposd look at oppo research from a foreign government and house speaker nancy pelosi hammering him for it and it aposs time now for our sunday group rich lowry of the national review columnist for the hill juan williams guy benson of fox news radio and former dnc chair donna brazile well the new fox poll has some interesting numbers on this subject and let aposs put them up on the screen a record and this is pretty surprising 50 percent now think the trump campaign actually coordinated with the russians in 2016 that aposs higher than a year ago and it aposs higher than this march just before release of the mueller report cleared the president of collusion guy it was pretty clear to me that secretary pompeo was not especially appreciative of my asking him about its what it seems to me as an inescapably big story but the president aposs answer yes i aposd i aposd look at it it it doesn apost that only add to people aposs concerns about this guy benson contributor yes it was a bad answer he sort of went all over the place and touched all of the bases so he could go back and say well i did say maybe i aposd go to the fbi maybe you do both and he cleaned it up he mopped it up on fox friends the next day as for the poll that you just put on the screen with 50 percent of americans believing now that there was coordination between the trump campaign and russia i just want to read for the record from the mueller report the investigation did not establish that the trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government in its election interference activities wallace no i know i mean that that aposs that was why it was astonishing to me that that benson it aposs just just a matter of record yes donna brazile contributor yes but they accepted information and they should have known better that this information was was gained through illegitimate and criminal means chris what bothers me still as of today is that we aposre not doing enough to protect ourselves from the future elections every campaign every campaign official every campaign staff and candidates should receive an unclassified briefing on the intelligence community now so that we know going into 2020 what is going on with our elections wallace ok no no wait a minute i want to i want to go back to to donna because we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on twitter from lou sloan about the president saying he aposd accept information from a foreign government lou writes does the same question go for hillary rodham clinton and the steele dossier so the question donna is how do you answer lou and what aposs the difference between the president saying he aposd accept information or at least listen to it from the russians and hillary clinton paying for the steele dossier were christopher steele actually got information from the russians brazile well first of all i don apost like to conflate the two i think it aposs it aposs it aposs bad to conflate the two because i can go back to april 2016 and i can tell you what happened not with fusion gps because we did i did not hire them when i became chair of the party there were already working for the washington free beacon later fusion gps was wallace but democrats ended up paying for it the clinton campaign brazile the democrats ended up paying the indirectly the clinton campaign because the law firm perkins coie paid fusion gps you don apost conflate the two when you get opposition research from the russian government and the russian intelligence service you know that aposs about russian interests i don apost conflate the two the steele dossier you read the mueller report at least i did he barely mentions the steele dossier and if people want to if they want to conflate the two wallace well some people say that aposs the problem and that of course there aposs an inspector general brazile but even if you read go back and read the the house intelligence report that came out in march 2018 yes the steele dossier is part of that conversation but the fbi counterintelligence was onto carter page before the steele dossier rich lowry national review so a couple things one you aposre for the information that the trump campaign got being from from ill gotten sources but there was no information they had the meeting and it came to absolutely nothing and the dossier clearly missed cued the fbi and the media from the very beginning based on information from shadowy russian sources that there was some deep conspiracy here that there wasn apost now i think trump aposs answer was bad but the reason he gave it i believe is that he just doesn apost want to admit that don junior made a mistake in taking this meeting and the idea than anyone from the trump campaign after three years of investigation and criminal exposure for don junior supposedly is going to take a call from russia or china and say yes i aposm going to do that meeting is completely absurd wallace all right we aposre going to turn i know we could all continue talking about this to the escalating i think frankly a much more serious situation the escalating tension between the u s and iran japanese prime minister abe brought a message from president trump to iran aposs supreme leader the ayatollah khamenei this week here was the ayatollah aposs response begin video clip ayatollah ali khamenei iranian supreme leader through translator i have no response to trump aposs message i tell you some words but i aposm not giving him any message because i don apost consider him worthy of even exchanging messages end video clip wallace juan how serious do you think the risk of armed conflict is between the u s and iran is at this point juan williams political analyst i think it aposs pretty serious i don apost think we first let me just say i don apost think we aposd be in this precarious and dangerous global position if the president had not pulled out of the iran deal the iran deal gave us options in terms of ratcheting up or down those sanctions obviously we don apost have that now and we have less international support because the other countries the other six other five countries in the 2015 deal had remained loyal to it so the question isn apost about america aposs credibility it aposs word when we make an agreement the second thing to say is that wallace but that doesn apost excuse iran shooting down our drones firing missiles into saudi arabia that hurt 26 civilians williams no i but that aposs why wallace and and mining these two ships williams that aposs i don apost know that for a fact i mean there aposs lots of controversy about that intelligence but i will say this when you look at iran right now and you say what is the likelihood of them obtaining nuclear material or moving forward i think the u s pulling out of the deal made that more likely and you also have to consider that united arab emirates saudi arabia are involved in wars against iran with surrogates in places like syria lebanon yemen go on that aposs why this is so dangerous that aposs why this could blow up in a second the u s immediate options is to escort some of those commercial ships through the gulf but if you do that or put american flags on them again you increase the likelihood of real conflict wallace you were shaking your head guy benson well yes because first of all our unilateral sanctions are working they aposre strangling hezbollah which is the top terrorist proxy of the regime that was a washington post story about a week ago but to meet the headline today in the washington post trump pushes u s to bring with iran if we are approaching a brink and i hope that we aposre not iran is pushing the world to the brink by acting in this fashion i mean i think to push this off on the iran deal or donald trump is to almost take responsibility an agency away from a regime that has been for decades the number one outsourcer the number one funder of international terrorism williams well you can feel that way but the benson well it aposs a fact williams no i i benson it aposs a fact according to the state department for a decade williams i but but i aposm saying do you believe in regime change the president says no he this is not about regime change he aposs trying to change behavior to establish peace this is not making that more likely lowry but you know there are other options to available to iran besides blowing up ships in the strait of hormuz in reaction to this increased pressure you can sit down and say ok we aposre going to make more concessions destroy more of our nuclear program they don apost want to do that because they wanted they loved that deal because they could sit on the cusp of being a nuclear power while getting all sorts of economic benefits from the west wallace rich i want to pick up on this though i mean we talk about the brink and let aposs set aside whether who aposs pushing whom to the brink on the one hand there aposs talk about us being you know on the cusp of war on the other hand president trump has made it clear over and over since he was elected he has no interest in getting involved in another foreign engagement and i think we aposd all agree at this table war with iran would be ugly lowry yes so this is not his natural inclination last month when the department of defense was considering sending more troops to the region they ratcheted down the number because they were afraid that trump wouldn apost approve a bigger number but i just think you it aposs intolerable to have shipping in this immensely important commercial thoroughfare under threat from iranian forces and we aposre going to have to make some sort of make it clear to them that if it happens again we aposre going to hit them in some way wallace i have less than a minute left donna but i think rich is exactly right regardless of how we got here you can apost have iran in effect trying to block the flow of oil through the this vital waterway brazile i i don apost think there aposs any disagreement on that i think the disagreement really comes with the notion that the maximum pressure campaign is going to give the trump the trump administration the united states the best options moving forward i think congress this week during the defense appropriation and talks will have to weigh in because the maximum pressure campaign may not give us the results we want wallace i don apost know that maximum weakness is going to help though brazile well i don apost think the pressure is going to help either because the middle east is fragile and any day any moment something else can just blow up like that wallace all right thank you panel see you next sunday unfortunately we aposll probably still be talking about this when we come back our power player of the week jon stewart joins us live to discuss his emotional appeal to lawmakers to extend funding for 9 11 first responders commercial break begin video clip jon stewart former host of the daily show they did their jobs with courage grace tenacity humility eighteen years later do yours end video clip wallace well that was jon stewart this week on capitol hill in what became a viral moment demanding congress extend funding for the program that provides health care to first responders who became so ill after 9 11 jon joins us now from new york and jon welcome back to fox news sunday jon stewart former host of the daily show thanks a lot chris thanks for having me wallace how emotional was that appearance before the committee this week along with the first responders stewart i mean it aposs it aposs terribly emotional this community the 9 11 first responder community from you know the pentagon shanksville and and new york the trade center they aposve been through an incredible ordeal almost solely because of the heroism that they displayed on 9 11 and in the months following 9 11 and you know when you aposre with these men and women when you aposve worked with them for a long time when you aposve advocated with them for a long time you everybody becomes very close and we lose you know last week seven seven first responders died due to 9 11 related illness it aposs a very emotional issue i think this community is at the end of their rope i think there aposs a a feeling of disbelief that they can apost understand why they have to continually saddle up and ride down to washington and make these appeals for something that that should be simple but is somehow through politics made agonizingly difficult wallace all right let aposs let aposs you know it aposs tough in this kind of a situation to talk about money but money is a factor stewart sure wallace payouts from the fund have been capped at 7 4 billion 7 5 billion and the fund was the victims compensation fund ends at 2020 no more claims after 2020 stewart right wallace you want to extend the fund through 2090 basically through the lives of all the people who may have become sick stewart right wallace and and to keep it open ended through 2090 any idea how much that would cost stewart so the cbo is only going to score something over a 10 year period they haven apost gotten the score in and you know my guess and and most people are guessing 10 billion to 12 billion is going to be the figure that that comes through but remember that aposs over a 10 year period and then extending it past that the vcf part of this is going to get smaller and smaller because even for the first 11 the first responders of the 9 11 community the average age now is in the 50s where it was you know 36 37 on 9 11 so you know if you aposre looking for a sunset clause on this bill in terms of funding it aposs there the sunset clause is death and so many of these individuals are are sick and dying that you know when we talk about just extending it through 2090 to go along with the health care fund that aposs just to ensure that none of these men and women ever have to come down and hat in hand beg for this kind of thing again but realistically the money for these funds will slowly diminish not necessarily the health care portion but the vcf portion will get smaller wallace let aposs talk practical politics because that aposs of course in the end what this is all about it aposs very likely that the house is going to pass the full bill that you want extending the program through the lives of these people stewart sure wallace then you have to go to the senate and in your testimony you said stewart the senate wallace that a certain someone by which it appeared that you meant senate leader mitch mcconnell cannot be allowed to use this as a quote political football in negotiations on other spending bills have you had problems with senator mcconnell stewart ah yes i mean not me personally but in terms of getting the 9 11 bills past mitch mcconnell has been the white whale of this since 2010 in 2010 you know and this brings up something because i think it aposs it aposs the cynicism that aposs displayed by washington that also causes this situation to be so emotional they asked mitch mcconnell about the testimony after it was done and he said oh the gosh i think he used the word gosh gosh we haven apost looked at that in a while but we will look at it and i aposm sure we aposll deal with it as compassionately as we have in the past but i want to make it clear that this has never been dealt with compassionately by senator mcconnell he has always held out until the very last minute and only then under intense lobbying and public shaming has he even deigned to move on it this is not a republican democrat issue there are republicans on the bill we aposd obviously like to have more of them but senator mcconnell has seen fit to in 2010 he used it to make sure that the bush tax cuts would be permanent in 2015 he took it out of the transportation bill because he wanted to extract some promises on oil imports and so in in this bill right now in 2019 he aposs been aware of this we were told in august that this fund was running out of money and that people were going to have their awards slashed by 30 50 up to 70 percent wallace i i got less than three minutes i want to get two questions in stewart sure sure i aposm sorry wallace first of all some of the critics and mostly republican senators say one that the that the fund should not be open ended and two they say look this should be handled by the states not by the federal government briefly your response to that stewart ok it should be open ended because cancer doesn apost have an expiration date on it and the gestation period of different illnesses goes along different words the idea that this is a state issue 9 11 was you know it would be like after pearl harbor saying you know what we aposre not going to do anything for people in pearl harbor because that aposs a hawaii issue this was an attack on america as i said in the meeting they didn apost shout death to tribeca and to try and push this off as a new york issue and i think they do that because they believe new york is reliably liberal and democratic and it aposs not as important to them not all republicans oppose this but everyone who has opposed is a republican and it aposs unacceptable and they aposve done it now for years senator mcconnell lindsey graham is the one who aposs the head of judiciary he aposs the one who aposs going to be negotiating whether it aposs five ten years we cannot make these individuals continue to live in the agonizing uncertainty of not knowing that these programs will be extended and that they will be able to move on with their lives and it has to be done wallace a little a little bit more than a than a minute left you have spent years oftentimes in satire commenting about washington and politics stewart uh huh wallace what in a real way as opposed to you know commenting from the the anchor chair stewart right wallace what have you learned about our politics from this experience stewart you know it aposs interesting i aposve learned so i come from a world of show business and i think if you were to take all the arrogance and entitlement and elitism that people don apost like about hollywood and show business and you concentrated it in one city and gave those people actual power that aposs washington there aposs a tremendous amount of people down there doing great work with good will but there is a very small concentrated group of people at the top that have lost sight of what they aposre there for and how it looks to the outside world you know they criticized us for saying you aposre so upset that it aposs an empty congress but this is just a subcommittee we knew it was a subcommittee and they said 12 out of the 14 people were there the whole time but they weren apost you get marked as present on the subcommittee showing up for just a minute when lou alvarez was speaking when michael connell was speaking there was only six members out of 14 seven members out of 14 that aposs a failing grade and that shouldn apost happen wallace we got to leave it there jon thank you thanks for joining us stewart thank you wallace and we aposll stay on top of what happens to this
