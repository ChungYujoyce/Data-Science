national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions the bloomberg bernie battle is almost like a comic book come to life the two combatants cover almost every clich on the right wing scorecard the right couldn t have invented a better candidate than bernie sanders in 1971 he was kicked out of a commune for talking too much in 1987 he recorded a folk album the following year he got married and left the next day for a combination fact finding trip and honeymoon in the soviet union when he returned he sounded a bit like lincoln steffens the famous journalist who d said of the ussr i have seen the future and it works in steffens s defense he visited in 1919 two years after its founding and before most of the inconvenient mass murder and starvation sanders thought the soviet union was the future three years before it collapsed of course this isn t why most of sanders fans like him he was on the right side of the civil rights movement when it really mattered he s been a consistent advocate of what he calls democratic socialism here at home and he s an unreconstructed enemy of the economic elites particularly the hated billionaire class which brings us to michael bloomberg who sits atop the 1 percent of the 1 percent bloomberg is a perfect stand in for a completely different kind of liberalism one that doesn t even like to call itself liberal he headlined the launch of no labels an organization dedicated to getting ideology out of politics a lifelong democrat bloomberg switched labels to become a republican to run for mayor in 2001 by his third term he was an independent now he s a democrat because he s running for president as mayor of new york he was a poster boy for a kind of arrogant progressive post partisan technocratic government that prizes data over feelings the data showed that obesity cost the health care system money and since sugary sodas contributed to obesity bloomberg clamped down on them the data showed that young black men committed most of the gun homicides so bloomberg clamped down on them with stop and frisk ninety five percent of murders murderers and murder victims fit one m o you can just take a description xerox it and pass it out to all the cops bloomberg said in 2015 in a video from 2011 that s going around bloomberg offered a quasi endorsement of death panels if you show up with prostate cancer you re 95 years old we should say go and enjoy you ve lived a long life there s no cure we can t do anything bloomberg said if you re a young person we should do something about it society s not willing to do that yet this isn t why his fans like him for a long time he was an icon of the credentialed upper class who saw ideological culture war fights as so much boob bait more recently he s become the liberals chicago way response to trump if the right comes at you with a billionaire would be putin you come back with a bigger billionaire would be lee kuan yew both men represent strands of liberalism with very long pedigrees sanders can trace his lineage back to antiwar socialists and populists such as william jennings bryan and eugene debs as well as to reformers such as jane addams bloomberg s antecedents can be found in democracy skeptical disinterested progressive pragmatists such as walter lippmann oliver wendell holmes and the wisconsin school economists usually these two strands intertwine and overlap barack obama had a foot in both camps he was both the anointed leader of a mass movement and the overseer of the affordable care act with all of its data driven rationing but when stripped to their purest elements one camp is all about solidarity and people power and the other is about technocratic expertise like trump both men are beneficiaries of our hollowed out political parties which are incapable of performing the gatekeeper function of the nomination process and that raises the stakes of their contest trump has transformed much of the gop in his image too weak to protect their own brand the republicans have adopted his if either sanders or bloomberg wins the nomination it will be interesting to see if the same thing happens to democrats if it s sanders will they become a populist party of social democrats if it s bloomberg will the democrats become the party of bureaucratic authoritarianism again democratic politicians normally straddle these two tendencies there are of course other options for primary voters but the choice between these two is zero sum and if either man wins the democratic party could end up making a choice that will define it as much as trump has come to define the gop c 2020 tribune content agency llc get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
