on sunday the media mogul new york city s last three term mayor declared to supporters in a launch video and statement i m running for president to defeat donald trump and rebuild america we cannot afford four more years of president trump s reckless and unethical actions he represents an existential threat to our country and our values if he wins another term in office we may never recover from the damage the stakes could not be higher we must win this election and we must begin rebuilding america i believe my unique set of experiences in business government and philanthropy will enable me to win and lead said bloomberg who had ruled out a presidential run as recently as march he faces a tough fight to win the nomination over top tier democratic candidates like former vice president joe biden and sens elizabeth warren and bernie sanders who have been campaigning for months including five debates bloomberg will enter tied for fifth place polls show but biden s debate stumbles coupled with the unexpected strength of the twin far left candidacies of warren and sanders left bloomberg and his advisors worried democrats could select a nominee unable to beat president trump next fall

battleground states starting sunday is part of the three term new york mayor s 34 million initial ad campaign announcing his candidacy he could have just been the middle class kid who made good but mike bloomberg became the guy who did good said a tweet linking to the video with the logo mike bloomberg 2020 after building a business that created thousands of jobs he took charge of a city still

measures and efforts to fight climate change it said the 77 year old will restore faith in the dream that defines us where the wealthy will pay more in taxes and the middle class get their fair share everyone without health insurance can get it and everyone who likes theirs keep it the ad concludes jobs creator leader problem solver bloomberg s official declaration follows two stunning reversals and apologies from the famously stubborn politician as he plotted his entry into the race the first came when he apologized for sexist remarks he made while leading his eponymous midtown media empire through a spokesman his second made in person last sunday stunned the city reversing his decade of unquestioned public support for the nypd s controversial stop and frisk policy that was ruled unconstitutional and fueled a political backlash that elected his successor mayor de blasio political experts said bloomberg had to make the move to square his politics with the shifting debate across the country and in the democratic party over criminal justice and policing why did he do it bloomberg knows that to compete for the nomination he has to get a chunk of the african american vote university of virginia political science professor larry sabato told the post it s that simple if you can t compete for the black vote you might as well save your money he added you ve got to stop people from booing you he wants to say i apologize for that but this is what i did for the african american community that wasn t bloomberg s only political maneuvering in the run up to sunday s announcement he nabbed ballot spots in two states with early registration deadlines alabama and arkansas the online advertisements bloomberg is funding target four states expected to be hotly contested during the 2020 election arizona michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin on his campaign s website sunday the billionaire bloomberg highlighted an economy that is tilted against most americans a health care system that costs too much and doesn t cover everyone communities ravaged by gun violence and a global climate crisis that is growing worse by the day bloomberg also described a cruel and dysfunctional immigration system schools that are failing students in an increasingly high tech world and special interest groups that corrupt washington and block progress on all of these issues then addressing trump by name he said he challenged the president on gun violence and won stronger gun laws in states across the country and took on trump the climate denier i know what it takes to beat trump because i already have and i will do it again i ve never shied away from a tough fight he said on the campaign site defeating trump and rebuilding america is the most urgent and important fight of our lives and i m going all in bloomberg recounted how his father never earned more than 6 000 in a year and how his parents instilled in him and his sister the need for an education he also reflects on being laid off at 39 and coming up with an idea to start a company so i took a chance today our company employs 20 000 people and generates large profits almost all of which go to helping people across the country and around the world i ve always believed in investing in our employees and treating them well we pay employees very well and provide the best health care benefits money can buy and if someone has a baby they get six months of paid leave he said and noting how he was elected mayor of new york weeks after the sept 11 terror attacks he wrote it was a frightening time for our city and country but we rebuilt the economy with new jobs and opportunity for people on all rungs of the economic ladder bloomberg has said the sunday ad rollout will be part of a 100 million
