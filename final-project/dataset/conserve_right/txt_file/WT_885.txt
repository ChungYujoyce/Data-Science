socialist in recent days the vermont lawmaker has retooled that description telling national public radio that his version of democratic socialism simply means a vibrant democracy more importantly mr sanders currently enjoys lead status in the race multiple polls consistently put him in first place prompting some observers to explore the greater implications is he really a socialist or is he a communist what is socialist about what he wants isn t he more of a communist asked cnbc host jim cramer during an on air discussion it s a fine line and it s authoritarianism either way his fellow host joe kernen replied the bold discussion was not overlooked by republican analysts sanders wants a total government takeover of health care that not only eliminates private health insurance it will increase taxes on anyone making over 29 000 he wants to eliminate drug companies and he has proposed a government takeover of energy production he also wants a federal jobs guarantee and he supports the authoritarian green new deal furthermore sanders wants to use abortion to control population growth says steve guest rapid response director for the republican national committee he also honeymooned with communists in the soviet union and praised communist fidel castro who imprisoned and executed thousands for his revolution in terms of values and bernie defends socialist dictators
