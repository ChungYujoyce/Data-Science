early tuesday morning in a largely unexplained and unprecedented delay that has raised questions about the legitimacy of the contest and democraticcampaign officials are livid fox news has learned the trump campaign meanwhile suggested that the delaymeant that the caucuseswere being rigged and that the embarrassing night proved that the democratic party can apos t be trusted to run americans apos health care and implement sweeping new government programs even if a winner wereultimately announced the chaos and confusion has seemingly erased any hope for the major momentum boost that would normally result the first in the nation iowa caucuses account for only 41 of the total 3 979 pledged democratic delegates nationally but analysts have saidwhen momentum and media attention are factored in the caucuses are20 times more important than delegate totals would suggest we found inconsistencies in thereporting of three sets ofresults the idp said in a statement at 11 30 p m est in addition to the tech systemsbeing used to tabulate results we are also using photos ofresults and a paper trail tovalidate that all results matchand ensure that we haveconfidence and accuracy in thenumbers we report this is simply a reportingissue the app did not go down and thisis not a hack or an intrusion the underlying data and papertrail is sound and will simplytake time to further report theresults fox news is told that during an initial conferencecall with the campaigns an idp representative said the party would be getting photos of the paper results sent over but didn apos t answer any questions and then hung up on all the campaigns even as frustrated staffers pushed for answers a campaign staffer told fox news the idp apos s brief callwas crazy jeff lopez holds his son

contentious conference call early tuesday morning the idp reportedly informed campaigns they couldexpect results sometime later on tuesday but gave no information about how the results would be verified or when precisely they would be published the 2016 iowa caucus tallies were provided on the same day of voting with more than 90 percent of precincts reporting by 11 00p m et that year speaking on a brief call with reporters at approximately 1 10 a m et on tuesday that lasted a little over a minute the idp said the system to validate electoral results was taking longer than expected

late tuesday complaining about the considerable flaws in the caucus reporting process biden who arrived in new hampshire early tuesday appeared to be dramatically underperformingat severalprecincts in iowa throughout the night the app that was intended to relay caucus results to the party failed the party s back up telephonic reporting system likewise has failed the campaign wrote in a letter now we understand that caucus chairs are attempting to and in many cases failing to report results telephonically to the party these acute failures are occurring statewide we appreciate that you plan to brief the campaigns momentarily on these issues and we plan to participate however we believe that the campaigns deserve full explanations and relevant information regarding the methods of quality control you are employing and an opportunity to respond before any official results are released screenshots posted to social media seemingly showed crash screens from the caucus app that indicated poor programming as well as potential hacking vulnerabilities with every passing minute that there is a delay we worry that the process will lose credibility about an hour earlier idp spokesperson mandy mcclure said in a statement the integrity of the results is paramount we have experienced a delay in the results due to quality checks and the fact that the idp is reporting out three data sets for the first time what we know right now is that around 25 of precincts have reported and early data indicates turnout is on pace for 2016 however the turnout in the 2016 democratic caucuses in iowa was only 171 109 that was far below the nearly 240 000 that took part in the 2008 democratic caucuses when then sen barack obama won the contest indicating that democrats apos high hopes for

internal numbers showed he had pulled ahead seventy sevenpercentof our precinct captains have reported results from their caucuses a buttigieg aide told fox news noting that previous projections had the race at a virtual tie on state delegate equivalents but from the 77 percentof reported precincts we re performing 8 points better than our projections the aide added we believe we re on our way to winning the sde state delegate equivalent count in the 1 301 precincts our precinct captains have reported pete reached viability in 1 064 83 percent for additional context turnout returned to historical norms and we expect participation rates to wind up near 2016 levels we found that our support in rural parts of the state was 5 percentbetter than we expected coming in at 28 percentso far formerpresidiential candidate marianne williamsonremarked incredulously from the sidelines did pete buttigieg just claim victory in iowa when the results haven t been announced yet vermont sen bernie sanders went rogue and released internal data that his campaign said represented vote totals 40 percent of precincts the figures which indicated sanders was winning with a narrow lead over buttigieg were also unverified in a surreal moment shortly before minnesota sen amy klobuchar took the stage at her iowa headquarters to thank her supporters even as no voting results were available a precinct chief was being interviewed on cnn while he was on hold for more than an hour with the idp to report results the idp then hung up on the precinct chieflive on air after he took too long to respond once they took him off hold at least four precincts had to resolve ties in their vote results by flipping a coin during the evening fox news has learned speaking at 11 30 p m est biden said he felt good about the caucus thenremarked so it apos s on to new hampshire nevada south carolina and well beyond we apos re in this for the long haul i want to thank the iowans that are here biden said well

the huge crowds at gop caucuses in the state that showed up to vote for the president quality control rigged asked trump campaign manager brad parscale democrats are stewing in a caucus mess of their own creation with the sloppiest train wreck in history parscale said in a statement just after midnight it would be natural for people to doubt the fairness of the process and these are the people who want to run our entire health care system parscale added tonight president trump posted a record performance in the well run gop iowa caucuses with record turnout for an incumbent for his part with just hours to go until his state of the union address tuesday night trump tweeted only big win for us in iowa tonight thank you if the democrats can t run a caucus that they had four years to prepare for how the hell can anyone think they could actually run the country donald trump jr tweeted the drama began unfolding late monday as the night wound on without any official vote figures released in one precinct sanders reportedly won by 20 points but received only one delegate along with four other candidates sanders supporters called the situationa joke and stormed out according to the washington examiner apos s philip klein each candidate has to meet a threshold of 15 percent to be considered viable in each precinct that means the number of people backing a candidate has to be at least 15 percent of the total number of people in the room at the local caucus for example if there are 100 people in the room and 14 are backing a particular candidate that candidate is not considered viable if a candidate is determined to be not viable that contender s supporters would be given the opportunity to support another candidate in the next round caucus goers check in at a

bloomberg news monday night alluding to biden apos s ability to campaign in the state while warren and klobuchar stayed in washington d c for senate impeachment proceedings if he doesn apos t win big tonight i think that apos s very indicative of his campaign in an unexpected move almost all of thecaucus goers for the nonviable candidates at the drake university precinct in des moines teamed up for cory booker who has already dropped out of the presidential race the caucus goerstold fox news tactic wasdesignedto keep delegates always from the viable candidates there were 402 caucus goers after the first alignment and three reached viability warren with 120 buttigieg with 101 and sanders with 100 the nonviable were andrew yang with 33 biden with 17 klobuchar with 24 and tom steyer with 1 the precinct leaders for the nonviable candidatestold fox newsthe strategy was purely decided among the caucus goers at the drake university precinct and didnot represent a statewide strategy dictated by the campaigns precinct 55 in downtown des moines 1 080 people showed up far more than expected paul steinhauser fox news ultimately warren and buttigieg each received 2 delegates from the drake precinct and sanders and booker each received 1 a member of the buttigieg campaign meanwhile told fox news we re reaching into every demographic and across cities suburbs and rural areas and communities including barack obama counties that flipped to donald trump in 2016 that s a good sign for accumulating delegates but also makes the case that pete s uniquely positioned to take on donald trump the buttigieg advisor added the best data point in the entry polls is that pete s leading with new caucus goers late in the evening at 10 45 p m et the buttigieg team told fox news the idp wasn apos t in touch concerning the delay in posting the results supporters of democratic presidential candidate former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg stand at a caucus site at roosevelt hight school
