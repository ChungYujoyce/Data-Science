apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic a top obama administration official says u s authorities are watchingthe relationship between iran and north korea very carefully buthave so far had difficulty verifying reports of military missilenuclear engagement between two rogue powers the comments from deputy secretary of state antony blinken came duringa tense exchange with lawmakersthursdayon the question of whetherthe administration is doing enough to block potential weapons andtechnology transfers between pyongyang and tehran mr blinken told lawmakers they were right to raise the subject during a house foreign affairs committee hearing top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century but he appeared less than eager to respond when a key panel democrat suggested that iran may be eager to buy nuclear weapons from north korea in the wake of the nuclear accord that the iranians reached last summer with the u s and other world powers the accord which saw the iranians cut their own nuclear program inexchange for sanctions relief from the west is seen to have freed upsignificant financial resources for the government in tehran the north koreans need money and iran now has significant cash fromthe sanctions relief burning a hole in their pocket said rep bradsherman california democrat who noted that north korea previouslysold technology to syria for the al kibar syrian iranian nuclearweapons program that the israelis bombed in 2007 the big question according to mr sherman is whether u s officials are doing enough to prevent iranian airplanes from movingmaterials directly between north korea and iran without stops inbetween where such planes might be inspected by outside observers namely the chinese is the obama administration working towards an understanding withchina that an iranian plane will not be allowed to fly to north koreawithout stopping in china for fuel the california democrat asked with regard to iran and north korea this is something we re watchingvery carefully and you re right to raise the subject said mr blinken they ve had a history of political engagement some of thereports of military missile nuclear engagement have been much harderto verify the deputy secretary of state seemed poised to say more but mr sherman interrupted mr blinken are you denying the reports that the al kibar nuclearfacility was north korean technology he asked i m just saying that what we re looking at is concrete evidence ofrelationships across the board beyond the political responded mr blinken what we re focused on is exactly what you pointed to ithink you make a very important point mr sherman pressed further asking again whether the obamaadministration is working to get china to say that they won t allowthe plane to go across chinese airspace without stopping for fuelwhere it could be inspected all of the members of the united nations are bound by the securitycouncil resolutions that say that there is to be no military ballisticor nuclear cooperation with the north korea responded mr blinken as a result they have obligations the answer seemed only to agitate mr sherman so the iranian plane if it went to north korea would be violating au n resolution but if it flew nonstop over china no one would knowabout it the lawmaker said you re relying on iran s dedication toadhering to the u n resolutions we re looking to every country involved to make good on itsobligations said mr blinken mr sherman responded by continuing to push the matter i urge you to talk to beijing about making that plane land because ifyour sole defense for what i laid out is that the iranians wouldn twant to violate a u n resolution and they d feel bad about violatinginternational law that is insufficient defense he said if theiranian plane going to north korea does not stop in china then it maynot have a trade delegation on it it may have cash going one way andnuclear weapons going the other way and that is a very specificissue mr sherman said the exchange reflected what has recently become a growingconcern among some lawmakers intelligence officials and nationalsecurity analyst over the prospect that iran may outsource itsnuclear program to iran in the wake of last summer s nuclear accord in september cia director john brennan acknowledged that his agencywas monitoring whether iran may seek assistance from another roguestate such as north korea perhaps by colluding with pyongyang towardthe secret purchase and transfer of nuclear weapons to tehran michael pillsbury who heads the center for chinese strategy at thehudson institute in washington has expressed concern that china upon which the obama administration has heavily relied to helpcontain north korea s recent nuclear provocations isturning a blind eye to illicit collaboration between tehran andpyongyang my hope is china will denounce the north korean proliferation ofnuclear and missile technology to iran mr pillsbury told thewashington times in early april china should not permit suspiciousnorth korean flights over chinese territory to iran that would be atrue test of china s claims not to be
