tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap there ll be much talk of a rat hush money for onetime paramours and the 2016 presidential campaign but did president donald trump break the law that s the key question michael cohen will be expected to answer with documents on wednesday during a capitol hill drama that sounds more like a mobster movie every day trump s formal personal lawyer and fixer is set to go public before a democrat led house panel and talk about the decade in which he would take a bullet for his boss top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches i am no longer your fixer mr trump cohen is to say in prepared remarks cohen who reports to prison in may under a plea deal could do damage to trump s cherished reputation and brand he s expected to talk in detail about what he says is evidence of trump s misconduct perhaps even criminal behavior republicans say cohen can t be believed after all he s lied to congress before what s undisputable cohen has trump s attention half a world away at a summit in vietnam the drama unfolds at 10 a m est on broadcast networks and livestreams what to watch the witness singing cohen 52 is scheduled to raise his right hand and swear to tell the truth before the house oversight and reform committee chaired by rep elijah cummings d md ahead of his appearance copies of his prepared statement reached the associated press and other news media tuesday night and offered a preview of scathing remarks directed at trump trump knew ahead of time that wikileaks had emails damaging to his rival hillary clinton s presidential campaign cohen says in the prepared testimony cohen also suggests that trump implicitly told him to lie about a moscow real estate project the one cohen has pleaded guilty to lying to congress about in the prepared remarks cohen brands the president a racist a conman and a cheat he says that trump made racist comments about african americans and mused that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid other topics cohen claims trump inflated assets to make a list of the richest americans and deflated assets to pay lower taxes on his golf courses trump managed a hush money payment to adult film actress stormy daniels and former playboy playmate karen mcdougal just before the 2016 election cohen claims a key point is whether cohen has evidence that trump knew the payments might have violated campaign finance laws telling the truth is a big issue for cohen and much about the path forward for democrats rides on his credibility cohen is set to serve prison time for lying to the house and senate intelligence committees in 2017 leaving a closed hearing tuesday cohen said he wants to clear the record and tell the truth the former client watching from the moment the fbi raided cohen s office last april 9 trump has made clear he cares very much about what federal law enforcement including special counsel robert mueller might now know the president immediately raged about the disgrace of the raid and attacked the impartiality of mueller s probe after cohen struck his plea deals trump on dec 16 called cohen a rat underworld lingo for someone who secretly helps law enforcement investigations in the same tweet the president falsely repeated that the fbi broke into cohen s office trump denies the allegations and says cohen lied to get a lighter sentence on tuesday as cohen testified in the senate trump spokeswoman sarah sanders beamed in a distinctly trump like statement from vietnam she called the week s events laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like cohen at his word republicans not laughing they re aiming alternately to discredit cohen and suggest they don t give a care about his testimony i don t have any desire to go listen to a lying lawyer said sen john cornyn r texas but there s plenty of evidence republicans see cohen as enough of a threat to go after him rep matt gaetz r fla set the tone tuesday with a tweet that taunted cohen and suggested that the public appearance will expose damaging personal information gaetz tweeted without offering any evidence that the world is about to learn a lot about cohen and urged him to talk to his wife ahead of his testimony gaetz a trump ally is not a member of the committee questioning cohen still the tweet was extraordinary because his remarks appeared to be threatening or intimidating a witness on the eve of a highly anticipated public hearing house speaker nancy pelosi issued a statement that did not name gaetz but suggested that the ethics committee vigilantly monitor statements that don t reflect creditably on the house that standard can be a trigger for ethics complaints in response gaetz apologized and said he was deleting the tweet and should have chosen better words to show his intent the committee questioning look for whether the panel stays within its agreed upon topics what s ok to ask about according to cummings memo trump s finances and his compliance with campaign finance laws that s a reference to an unanswered question whether anyone else involved in arranging the payments to stormy daniels and karen mcdougal could face charges including trump organization executives who prosecutors say reimbursed cohen for the payoffs trump maintains the payments were a private matter not a campaign expense the committee also can ask about public efforts by the president and his attorney to intimidate mr cohen or others not to testify what s not ok asking about the multiple probes into whether russia tried to influence the u s election and what role if any trump and his associates may have played members also are not to ask about any financial or other compromise or leverage foreign actors may pose over donald trump his family his business interests or his associates cohen will be answering those types of questions about russia this week but only in closed door interviews with the two intelligence committees the democrats listening oversight responsibilities is the phrasing house democrats tend to use when they talk about investigating the trump administration they re not likely to use the word impeachment but cohen s testimony could be part of their decision making on any such proceedings at issue for them is whether the president broke campaign finance laws or obstructed the investigations when we get him we re going to ask him whether president trump you know asked him to lie directly asked him said rep joaquin castro d texas look for how famous democratic freshmen on the panel comport themselves when toward the end of what promises to be a long day they question cohen one newcomer on the panel already has blown through the leaders words of caution regarding the i word rep rashida tlaib d mich told supporters last month that the house is going to impeach the mother r and this week she signed a pledge to impeach trump no such effort is underway associated press writers eric
