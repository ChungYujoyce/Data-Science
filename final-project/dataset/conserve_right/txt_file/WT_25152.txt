tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington the house judiciary committee will interview former white house communications director hope hicks behind closed doors on wednesday the first time lawmakers will hear from a person linked to the president s inner circle since the release of special counsel robert mueller s report obtaining the testimony from hicks a close and trusted former aide to president donald trump is a significant victory for democrats as trump has broadly stonewalled their investigations the committee originally subpoenaed hicks to give public testimony but agreed to the closed door interview after negotiations a transcript of the session will be released in the days afterward still it is unclear how much new information hicks will provide she already cooperated extensively with mueller s probe and a white house lawyer who will be in the room for the interview is expected to try and block her from answering certain questions top

mueller the panel has also subpoenaed hicks for documents but she has only partially complied she agreed to provide some information from her work on trump s campaign according to the judiciary panel but none from her time at the white house testimony from witnesses like hicks is one step in house speaker nancy pelosi s methodical approach to investigating trump while more than 60 lawmakers in her caucus including almost a dozen on the judiciary panel have called for opening an impeachment inquiry she has said she wants committees to investigate first and come to a decision on impeachment later while trump has continued to block their requests democrats have made some minor gains in recent weeks with hicks appearance and the justice department agreeing to make some underlying evidence from mueller s report available to judiciary members as one of trump s closest aides hicks was present for many of the key moments reviewed in the mueller report and her name is one of the most frequently
