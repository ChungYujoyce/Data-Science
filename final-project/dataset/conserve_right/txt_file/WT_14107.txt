cheers for his statements adm zhang this week told the press that some of our scholars are trained by the americans they read american books accepted american ideals and they are now helping the u s to fool the chinese this line of argument by anti u s fanatics in the pla reached a fever pitch last summer in a lengthy article on the leading chinese military website leiting thunder published sept 14 the cia was cited as the main driver of a successful psychological warfare and disinformation campaign against china s civilian leaders from deng xiaoping to hu jintao to purge or suppress the pla

the supposed u s plot reagan administration defense policymaker michael pillsbury identified in the article as a senior official in charge of u s strategy toward china who closely monitors the pla was described as being pleasantly surprised by the downfall of one of such chinese strategic hawks britain snubbed over dalai lama british prime minister david cameron last month met privately with the dalai lama enraging china s communist leaders and contributing to what appears to be a deterioration of the two states normal relations after the announcement of mr cameron s decision to meet with the tibetan spiritual leader the chinese government promptly snubbed the british by canceling wu bangguo s visit to london mr wu is ranked no 2 in the communist party hierarchy and heads the national people s congress china then unilaterally suspended nearly all exchanges at the ministerial level with britain the british newspaper daily telegraph reported june 13 that british officials were snubbed by their chinese counterparts trade minister stephen green and foreign minister jeremy browne were denied meetings with their equivalents in beijing many meetings have been either canceled or pushed to junior bureaucrats this week the dalai lama is invited again to britain this time by the private investment association yorkshire international business convention to give a speech on
