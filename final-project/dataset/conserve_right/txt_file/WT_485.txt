apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap is he a wartime president or a backup point man president donald trump seems to go back and forth on that or both ways at once in responding to the coronavirus pandemic that takes more lives by the hour in his recent rhetoric the president who declared it s a war and invoked wartime powers enabling him to direct the production and shipment of critical medical supplies sought to avoid responsibility for persistent shortages the federal government he told new york s governor is merely a back up for state governments meantime the government changed its online description of the national stockpile to put state responsibility more front and center and after public health authorities warned that infection and death are spreading at a needlessly fast rate because americans are not respecting social distancing guidelines as they should trump incongruously asserted we should all be thrilled with how that s going separately he bragged inaccurately about his facebook followers top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches a look at how some statements over the past week compare with the facts the threat trump on a warning that had just been delivered by dr deborah birx of the coronavirus task force that more americans need to heed distancing steps ordered by many states and recommended by washington she wasn t referring to our country she was referring to one state briefing thursday the facts no she was talking about more americans overall needing to keep away from each other more specifically birx said the outbreak would not be spreading by now in areas with low infection rates if everyone were following the guidelines instead officials are now seeing cases of people who were infected after the guidelines took effect this should not be happening any longer in new places if people are doing the social distancing washing their hands not getting together in large groups more than 10 she said at the briefing where trump then tried to tamp down her warning out of his concern about the headlines tomorrow birx said we see spain we see italy we see france we see germany when we see others beginning to bend their curves we can bend ours but it means everybody has to take that same responsibility as americans bending the curve means flattening out the rate of increase in cases she added yes there are states that are dead flat but you know every what changes the curve is a new detroit a new chicago a new new orleans a new colorado trump four weeks ago we had the greatest economy in the history of the world the greatest in the world greatest in the history of the world briefing thursday the facts not true the economy was healthy back then but not the best in u s history much less world history economic gains largely followed along the lines of an expansion that started more than a decade ago under president barack obama and while posting great job and stock market numbers trump never managed to achieve the rates of economic growth he promised in the 2016 campaign the u s economy was not the world s best in history when this started trump going back to that period four weeks ago and then one day i get a call from deborah who s fantastic and from dr fauci and he said and she said we have a problem i said what s the problem and they said we may have to close it up i said close what up they said close up the country and i said what s that all about briefing thursday the facts you d think that trump was just learning about the outbreak from birx and dr anthony fauci of the national institutes of health in the phone call that s not the case trump knew the u s had a problem well before that timeline of roughly early march by then the u s had restricted travel from abroad experienced its first coronavirus infections and was told to expect the outbreak to spread in the country the world health organization declared a global health emergency jan 30 vice president mike pence i don t believe the president has ever belittled the threat of the coronavirus cnn interview wednesday mitch mcconnell senate majority leader the coronavirus crisis came up while we were tied down in the impeachment trial and i think it diverted the attention of the government because everything every day was all about impeachment interview tuesday with radio host hugh hewitt the facts while pence claims trump always treated the virus threat seriously mcconnell suggests trump may not have because he was distracted by impeachment neither claim is credible trump says he would not have done anything faster on the virus absent impeachment and he actually belittled the coronavirus threat repeatedly from january to mid march maintaining his position even after the senate acquitted him feb 5 in his impeachment trial he dismissed the threat as a small number of u s cases that were under control and would fall to zero by april on feb 10 he asserted we re in great shape we have 12 cases and told fox business it will be fine because in april supposedly it dies with the hotter weather and that s a beautiful date to look forward to when you have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero that s a pretty good job we ve done he said feb 26 a day later he said it s going to disappear one day it s like a miracle it will disappear it s got the world aflutter but it ll work out trump told the national association of counties on march 3 along the way he said democrats who were calling on him to do more were perpetuating a hoax on march 9 he tweeted the 546 cases and 22 deaths experienced by then in the u s were no reason to take drastic steps nothing is shut down life the economy go on trump now acknowledges the u s could see 100 000 to 240 000 deaths from the pandemic even if current distancing guidelines are maintained when asked tuesday if impeachment proceedings had distracted him from the u s coronavirus response he said i don t think i would have acted any differently or i don t think i would have acted any faster social media trump i have you know hundreds of millions of people number one on facebook did you know i was number one on facebook i mean i just found out i m number one on facebook i thought that was very nice for whatever it means news briefing wednesday the facts it doesn t mean anything because it s not true he s nowhere close to no 1 trump has 29 million followers on facebook far below former president barack obama who has 54 million cristiano ronaldo the portuguese soccer player has 126 million medical supplies trump we re a backup we re not an ordering clerk we re a backup briefing thursday the facts he s not been completely consistent on what he regards the federal responsibility and his own as president to be on one hand he s called himself in a sense a wartime president and maximizes every opportunity to take credit for silver linings in the crisis but he does not want to be blamed for things that go wrong he went to norfolk virginia to give a presidential send off to the comfort the navy hospital ship as it set sail for new york city where its main function is to house non covid 19 patients to relieve pressure on city hospitals he tapped the rarely invoked defense production act though so far he has used it more as a tool of persuasion than as a means to order the private sector to manufacture more of what the country needs but he has resisted calls to issue a national stay at home order and says primary responsibility for emergency supplies belongs to the states on friday the health and human services department revised its description of the strategic national stockpile to play down its utility in the pandemic the new wording showed up a day after jared kushner trump s son in law and adviser said the federal stockpile is supposed to be our stockpile meaning the federal government s it s not supposed to be states stockpiles that they then use travel restrictions trump i stopped some very very infected very very sick people thousands coming in from china long earlier than anybody thought including the experts nobody thought we should do it except me and i stopped everybody we stopped it cold interview monday with fox friends pence the president suspended all travel from china in january interview wednesday with cnn the facts trump didn t stop cold all the people infected with coronavirus from entering the u s with a ban of all travel from china there were gaps in containment and initial delays in testing leading to the u s rising to no 1 globally in the number of people infected by covid 19 nor did trump decide on his own to impose travel restrictions on china he followed a consensus recommendation by his public health advisers his order in late january temporarily barred entry by foreign nationals who had traveled in china within the previous 14 days with exceptions for the immediate family of u s citizens and permanent residents americans returning from china were allowed back for two more weeks they were given enhanced screenings but screenings can miss people who are carrying the virus but showing no symptoms mortality trump so we have more cases than anybody but we re doing really well and we also have a very low relative to other countries very low mortality rate and there are reasons for that interview monday with fox friends trump we ve been doing more test tests than any other country anywhere in the world it s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries because we ve been testing it s also one of the reasons that we re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate news briefing on march 29 the facts his suggestion that the u s response is better than other countries because its mortality rate is just about the lowest is unsupported and misleading it s too early to know the real death rate from covid 19 in any country look at a count kept by johns hopkins university and you can divide the number of reported cases by the number of recorded deaths but that math provides a completely unreliable measurement of death rates and the johns hopkins tally is not intended to be that first the count changes every day as new infections and deaths are recorded more important every country is testing differently knowing the real denominator the true number of people who become infected is key to determining what portion of them die some countries the u s among them have had trouble making enough tests available when there s a shortage of tests the sickest get tested first and even with a good supply of tests someone who s otherwise healthy and has mild symptoms may not be tested and thus go uncounted the result is a hodgepodge of numbers that get sorted out as the crisis diminishes indeed initial death rates were thought to be as high as 4 in parts of china but a report published monday in the lancet infectious diseases calculated that 1 38 actually is the best estimate of deaths among confirmed cases across china and that accounting for unconfirmed cases could drop that rate below 1 early on fauci estimated that the death rate in the u s might hit around 1 which would be 10 times higher than mortality from a typical flu season federal aid for states trump i get on calls and i get on a lot of the governor calls where we ll have all 50 governors plus where we have some territories also but we have 50 governors and i ll tell you what if you could listen to those calls you d never hear a complaint interview with fox friends the facts that s false by his own accounting he s complained about the complaints of governors and the associated press has heard governors complaining to trump privately on the phone some of these governors take take take and then they complain trump groused in an interview thursday on fox news channel s hannity of democratic gov gretchen whitmer of michigan he said all she does is sit there and blame the federal government and he said washington gov jay inslee also a democrat should be doing more adding he s always complaining you know trump said from the white house we don t like to see the complaints on a private conference call thursday with governors inslee urged trump to use his full authority to spur production of necessary medical equipment according to an audio recording of the call obtained by the ap trump replied that the federal government is merely the backup i don t want you to be the backup quarterback we need you to be tom brady here inslee replied invoking the football star the nation s governors have been pressing the president to do more to bolster supplies despite the perceived risks of speaking out they have pleaded with him to use the defense production act to force companies to manufacture critical equipment and begged for help in obtaining supplies like masks and testing agents later in the week trump revised his complaint about the attitude of governors he said some say nice things when he talks to them directly and get negative when they re on tv trump on why he thinks south korea does more covid 19 testing per capita than the u s i know south korea better than anybody it s a very tight do you know how many people are in seoul do you know how big the city of seoul is thirty eight million people news briefing monday the facts that s wrong the city of seoul has a population of 10 million seoul s greater metropolitan area is home to 25 million people still far from trump s assertion of 38 million south korea s population is 51 million associated press writers lauran neergaard and matthew perrone in washington alan suderman in richmond va and amanda seitz in chicago contributed to this report editor s note a
