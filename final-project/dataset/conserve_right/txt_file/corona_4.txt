aristocrat found a possible cure in the highly decentralized system of jackson era american government political life he wrote was overwhelmingly concentrated at the local level where town meetings still decided most matters of significance counties were administrative divisions that mostly existed on paper state governors were kept on an extremely tight leash and the federal government was
