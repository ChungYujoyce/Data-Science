apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion donald trump s presidency has brought its fair share of partisan and ideological inversions the democrats are now the party of russia hawkishness free trade and rhetorically at least fiscal probity republicans meanwhile now back conditions free confabs with stalinist dictators like kim jong un and pass federal budgets whose deficits top 1 trillion and this was before the coronavirus crisis brought the economy to its knees a lot of this is simply politics of course partisan flip floppery is hardly a novel concept but the shifts at play during the trump era go deeper and far beyond the occasional inconsistency on a specific policy issue during the trump presidency there has been a profound shift in sensibility among many of those who call themselves conservative the coronavirus catastrophe and the trump administration s inept response to it has betrayed a mindset that while not strictly speaking liberal can hardly be considered conservative top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots conservatism has been associated with a hard headed realism if not outright dourness and pessimism there was a reason that john derbyshire the erstwhile national review writer titled his treatise on conservatism we are doomed yet when it came to the coronavirus the president and his defenders embraced the kind of fact free optimism that voltaire satirized in candide with the declaration by parody enlightenment philosopher pangloss that we live in the best of all possible worlds on jan 24 as china locked down 60 million people to stop the spread of the newly emerging virus mr trump tweeted it will all work out well on feb 10 he said looks like by april you know in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away later that month while taking minimal action to prepare the country for the scourge he promised it s going to disappear one day it s like a miracle it will disappear pangloss would have been proud promising miracles of course has been a hallmark of mr trump s approach to covid 19 now that april s warmth has arrived and coronavirus cases and fatalities continue to multiply he has moved onto promoting a miracle cure in the form of a drug used to treat lupus and malaria called hydroxychloroquine at a white house briefing saturday mr trump not only touted hydroxychloroquine as a possible cure but even suggested taking it as prophylactic against the virus what do you have to lose he asked take it mr trump s own fda says there is no proof of hydroxychloroquine s efficacy and has further reported a shortage of the drug for lupus and arthritis sufferers a shortage mr trump s exhortation is certain only to intensify and by the way what do you have to lose has seldom been a hallmark of conservative sensibility reverence for tradition and those who embody it the elderly has been on the other hand but then covid 19 came along and all of a sudden society s elders were treated as so much detritus as italy suffered heather mac donald the once perspicacious manhattan institute scholar sniffed that approximately 89 of italy s coronavirus deaths had been over the age of 70 those victims were already nearing the end of their life spans they might have soon died from another illness candace owens a political activist who calls herself conservative saw good news in the numbers coming out of italy downplaying the pandemic threat because it has the oldest population in europe texas s republican lieutenant governor dan patrick went so far as to suggest avoiding social distancing altogether and getting back to work those of us who are 70 plus we ll take care of ourselves mr patrick said i can t remember was it edmund burke or russell kirk who suggested that the moral imperative to stock shelves at best buy outweighed the lives of the old but perhaps the greatest betrayal of the ideology they profess to embody has been mr trump and his administration s utopian notion that they can simply will an end to the coronavirus crisis vladimir lenin thought he could transform an industrial society along radically egalitarian lines through the sheer force of will mao zedong thought he could destroy traditional chinese culture the same way even moderate liberals like america s own lyndon baines johnson thought they could eradicate poverty a universal and persistent scourge throughout human history through the sheer force of the federal government s will now mr trump promises he can reopen the country and restart the economy simply because he wants it to be so he d love to see nfl stadiums packed this fall so would i but opening up depends on the eradication of the virus the virus will not respond simply to the president s commands conservatism has been a force for restraint and prudence throughout much of human history maybe one day it will reemerge in the united states that would truly be the best of all possible worlds ethan epstein is editorial editor of the washington times contact him at emailprotected or on twitter ethane
