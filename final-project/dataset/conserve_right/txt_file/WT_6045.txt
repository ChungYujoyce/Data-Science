apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion president trump assures americans regularly that he has a great relationship with an array of world figures among them xi jinping of china and kim jong un of north korea it s comforting to hear it would be more gratifying though to see these relationships bear fruit try as he might the president has been stymied in his efforts to seal crucial deals with his asian counterparts americans may be subject to creeping doubts but there is no substitute for persistence mr trump s rapport with the two far east rainmakers has evidently ebbed from chummy to chilly whether the president s double trouble is attributable to coincidence or coordination it s clear that even a policy juggler of his capacity only has two hands something unlikely to escape the notice of cagey comrades looking for leverage mr xi s smiling visage has lost none of its warmth during a series of media appearances with an equally affable mr trump over the past two and a half years the two men have parried over china s campaign to use any means possible including theft of intellectual property estimated to be worth between 225 billion and 600 billion annually to surpass the u s as the world s top economic power behind his kindly countenance though mr xi has sharpened his own resolve to resist any u s definition of fair trade top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state accustomed to special treatment from washington on issues of trade mr xi couldn t have foreseen mr trump s dogged adherence to an america first economic policy when the united states ended the status quo by announcing 25 percent tariffs on chinese goods worth 50 billion in june 2018 china s president naturally retaliated with a similar penalty on 34 billion worth of u s imports continuing failure this year to reach accommodation has resulted in additional u s tariffs on new chinese products worth 200 billion and beijing has returned the disfavor with duties on another 60 billion worth of american exports then mr trump announced that 10 percent tariffs on a remaining 300 billion worth of chinese goods which he had suspended during the g 20 meeting in june would take effect on sept 1 unless a deal was reached surprisingly the president this week put off the levies on about half of those goods until dec 15 unsurprisingly mr xi has not reciprocated by honoring his pledge to purchase a tremendous amount of american farm products global markets have shuddered under the impact of the world s two largest economies facing off for the mother of all trade wars adding to international anxiety hong kong is on tenterhooks as the chinese military dragon is poised to thunder into the city to quell two months of anti authoritarian protests furthermore the u s intends to deploy intermediate range missiles in the asia pacific region on behalf of china s nervous neighbors and in disregard of beijing s wishes trouble begets trouble it is said and north korea s dictator has chosen just such a time to resume his nuclear missile program with a series of short range flights more than tests mr kim said the launches signified an occasion to send an adequate warning to the joint military drill now underway by the u s and south korean authorities according to north korean state media it was hardly more than a month ago when mr trump shared grins with his north korean counterpart as the two met at the korea demilitarized zone the first sitting u s president to step foot across the border he prevailed upon mr kim to restart flagging negotiations over denuclearization of the korean peninsula the stepped up missile launches may not drive a stake through the heart of hope but they necessarily temper expectations for success when china speaks north korea listens after remaining cloistered within the confines of his hermit kingdom for the first seven years of his reign mr kim has traveled to china four times since 2018 for talks with mr xi as his presidency wears on and the 2020 presidential election drifts closer it is undeniable that mr trump is encountering stiffening headwinds blowing out of the far east should americans be worried that the president might come up empty handed in his dealings with the asian axis they should be more concerned that were he to lose the white house to a yet to be determined democratic challenger his efforts to induce china to engage in honest trade would be wasted some dealing can be unappealing but the president has no choice but to plow ahead neither do americans looking for a fair
