if you ve read my work for any length of time you know by now how much i love movies see here here and here and how much they tend to make their way into my illustrations so unsurprisingly i want you to think about another scene from yet another movie it s hook where the late great robin williams plays peter banning a workaholic businessman who discovers that he s actually peter pan all grown up republican presidential candidate donald trump during a campaign rally at the american airlines center on september 14 2015 in dallas texas he makes it back to neverland except the lost boys have since gotten a new leader the much younger stronger decidedly fiercer rufio rufio rufio ru fi ooooooo the lost boys cheer as rufio soars down to challenge the old pan oh that is so dangerous says banning as rufio pulls a couple of acrobatic tricks on the way down that s enough banning shouts rufio lands and pulls out his sword ok mister alright show s over now you put that thing away now put it down before you poke somebody s eye out says banning googletag cmd push function googletag display div gpt ad in content 300x250 102 they all laugh banning continues you re not even old enough to shave what are you doing flying around this is an insurance nightmare what is this some kind of lord of the flies preschool where are your parents who s in charge here the laughing stops and they all point instantly to rufio before long the boys are running back and forth in a hilarious huddle between sides as tinker bell and rufio each try to convince them who they re supposed to follow it s that back and forth scene in i ve had running through my head lately why because i don t know what the heck i m going to do when i walk into that ballot box this november i m having a heart and gut wrenching conscience battle with myself right now over what s least worst i think democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton is an immense danger to this country and if his record and his campaign show us anything presumptive republican nominee donald trump looks to be just as bad do i end this ridiculous cycle of voting for the lesser of two evils by writing in a candidate or not voting at all or since i know exactly what kind of damage clinton will cause do i risk it on the slim slim chance that i m wrong about trump i heard someone say once that this election has become about debating the merits of donkey poo versus horse poo that sounds about right and it sucks which is why the rhetoric i m hearing from both sides bothers me so much i m not alone i m one of countless conservatives trying desperately to make a decision i can live with without sacrificing principle and without feeling like i ve harmed the country with my vote or no vote i know i m not alone when i say i feel exactly like the huddle of boys going back and forth between pan and rufio after all both nevertrump and neverhillary have solid arguments the nevertrump crowd has a solid argument when they point to alexander hamilton s wise words as their guide then again the neverhillary crowd has an equally solid argument when they point to the fact that whoever wins this election will nominate the next several supreme court justices and we all know for an undeniable irrefutable unquestionable incontestable fact what kind of country wrecking constitution shredding justices clinton would choose whereas there s a sliver of unknown with trump can you picture the mental back and forth now as if this decision isn t hard enough we re taking in on the chin from both sides the neverhillary crowds tells the nevertrump crowd they re sitting on a high horse the nevertrump crowd tells the neverhillary crowd they re sellouts listen neverhillary ers and frankly the pro trump crowd you have to understand something about the nevertrump crowd they re not the proverbial snotty child who didn t get his way and so he takes his ball and goes home they re not just ticked that their guy didn t get the nod they re not pitching a hissy fit just like you re genuinely and rightfully concerned at the thought of a clinton presidency they are genuinely and rightfully concerned about a trump presidency because everything about trump s past and present screams progressive kena betancur afp getty images and if you think they re wrong that s ok so convince them otherwise don t treat them like traitors because that s the last thing they re trying to do and let s get one thing straight while not voting for trump does yes inadvertently help clinton can we please stop treating these people like they re actively checking the box for her they ve made a decision based on their own consciences they re no longer going to play the lesser of two evils game that s all your turn nevertrump ers you ve got to understand something about the never hillary crowd those who have decided that they ll vote against hillary by voting for trump are people who are trying desperately to do what s right for their country too they re not fakes they re trying to do what s least worst they re hardly beltway establishment rinos who bend with the wind they haven t sold out their principles they re trying to preserve them in their own way while we re at it just as egregious as bashing these people as faux conservatives let s cut it out with the real christian talk too i get it i really do there are many nevertrump christians genuinely trying to understand how any christian could vote for a guy so clearly devoid of moral character so you claim they re not really christians here s the thing i know incredible people of great faith some of them are pastors who ve made the difficult decision to vote against clinton by voting for trump their faith is just fine so let s stop pretending we have eyes into everyone s soul shall we i know i m not the only one in this position i also know that we are not sellouts we aren t faux conservatives for crying out loud i write for theblaze i m only a little committed to preserving freedom just a little let me be very clear i m not talking about the as brittany pounders rightly puts it men who were former governors sitting senators and now struggling to stay relevant saw themselves in important and comfortable cabinet positons who decided to support trump for reasons of personal gain and political prominance and i m definitely not talking about the die hard trump supporters blinded by epic showmanship and candor that is selling out but i ve digressed i love this line from nevertrump er brad thor s epic facebook post we are stewards of our republic and as such our greatest responsibility is not to ourselves or any political party but to the next generation of americans that s all any red blooded constitutional conservative like me wants to be a good steward of this republic period we re at each other s throats and enough s enough look nevertrump neverhillary you want to help me finally decide one way or another start by acknowledging that nobody here is making this decision because they like trump or they want hillary to win and you know what else just be civil leave the digs jabs and name calling at home just bring your cogent arguments to the battlefield of ideas follow the example of people like chris salcedo or brittany pounders both staunch neverhillary er always willing to have a productive fact based spirited debate or glenn beck a staunch nevertrump er whose modus operandi is equally as constructive you never know you might just help me and quite a few others decide once and for all
