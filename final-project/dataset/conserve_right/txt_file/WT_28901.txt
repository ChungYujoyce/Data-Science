a professor of public service at new york university and president barack obama was accused of making a political play just months before the 2012 election when he took executive action to create new protections for so called dreamer immigrants brought to the country illegally as children while the white house has pushed back on the notion trump made clear in the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections that he was willing to use his office as a campaign asset as he tried to help republicans hang on to the senate and minimize losses in the house trump turned to his go to issue immigration

dwindling then trump mobilized the u s military deploying thousands of troops to the southern border while the white house said trump was responding to a legitimate humanitarian and national security
