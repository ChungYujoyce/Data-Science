apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap just last week solid economic numbers appeared to be helping president donald trump s reelection prospects the united states had achieved its longest economic expansion stock prices were climbing job gains were steady consumers had scaled up spending growth was sturdy enough to presage a second term for a conventional president according to election forecasts based on the economy but trump was not content to play it safe top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens he chose to magnify the trade war with china and almost instantly destabilized the economy in ways that could hurt his 2020 chances if the conflict persists stocks tanked in response to his planned 10 tax on 300 billion of chinese imports retailers warned of price hikes the value of the chinese currency fell and the spillovers from that could weaken u s growth for the first time after six days of sell offs investors on tuesday were catching their breath to consider the uncertain path ahead from an inflamed trade war between the world s two largest economies part of the challenge is that the president s penchant for uncertainty the opposite of what investors seek makes it difficult to know just how much risk trump is taking with an election 16 months from now but what is clear is that the range of possible outcomes for the economy is greater than they were a week ago the more that you deepen or broaden this conflict the greater the risk of misunderstandings miscalculations and unintended consequences said mike ryan chief investment officer at americas for ubs global wealth management among the many possibilities trump might be able to strong arm china into a trade agreement that favors the united states he might suffer politically if the tariffs hurt u s farmers manufacturers and consumers he might agree to a cursory deal and hope to ride a stock market rally to reelection or he could be setting up a global recession that could eventually engulf the united states larry kudlow director of the white house national economic council provided little clarity tuesday about the new tariffs that are to be implemented sept 1 the trump administration already has a 25 tax on 250 billion worth of chinese imports in addition to the upcoming tariffs kudlow told cnbc the tariffs might get worse if the trade talks scheduled for next month flounder or they might be delayed if progress is achieved the president s chief economic adviser acknowledged that china might simply try to endure the tariffs on the hopes that trump loses in 2020 and the taxes are lifted by his democratic successor china can wait that s up to them kudlow said but i think they will continue to do great damage to their economy the american economy is very strong theirs is not increasingly the administration s actions on china are driven by the president himself with trump taking more control of the direction of the negotiations and retaliations trump aides and advisers said is caught between a desire to maintain the appearance of toughness toward china and the political and economic realities of an elongated trade war while the president says that the chinese economy is paying a steeper price than the united states he is acutely aware of the political risks of a downturn in recent weeks trump has adopted a two pronged message he is insisting that china badly wants a deal but he also is the one holding out for more on behalf of the american people and he is claiming china is looking to wait out his administration so he ll keep increasing pressure white house aides suggested that the diametrically opposite arguments reflected the twin audiences of the president s public statements namely chinese negotiators and his political base the reality they said is somewhere in the middle with the president looking to find the quickest off ramp from the trade war that doesn t allow him to be portrayed as weak competing priorities that may not be reconcilable in the short term nor is the situation under trump s control because china could easily retaliate and apply direct pressure on u s companies beijing has already responded by increasing import duties on 110 billion of u s goods but regulators can delay customs clearances and delay government required licensing as well as create an unreliable entities blacklist of u s businesses nearly half of americans 47 approve of how trump has handled the economy according to a june survey by the associated press norc center for public affairs research but tariffs in particular are a weakness for the president only 15 of those surveyed said the import taxes launched by trump would personally help them just 19 believed tariffs would help their local community and 26 said the tariffs would aid the entire u s economy down from 40 in august 2018 the survey shows that republicans are becoming skeptical that the president s tariffs will improve the economy farmers have especially felt the brunt from the tariffs as china has targeted u s agricultural exports as retaliation dave daniels a dairy farmer in wisconsin who voted for the president in 2016 said the trump administration has helped by offsetting the cost of lost exports to china but he said it was a little disappointing that the president chose to escalate as long as they can keep talking i guess i am i m happy about that but we ll see what happens in the next few months he said election models based on the economy are bullish on trump s reelection these models do not necessarily account for the president s personality or his willingness to campaign on divisive cultural issues such as immigration abortion and race yale university professor ray fair found that democrats would only get 46 2 of the presidential vote based primarily on current economic conditions down from the 48 2 that democrat hillary clinton received in 2016 an economic model developed by investor donald luskin suggests that trump would receive 340 electoral votes significantly more than the 270 needed to win the presidency but he cautioned that the new tariffs presented an unlikely but credible nightmare scenario in which china spiraled into a recession that could then lead to a downturn in the united states and erode the president s relative strength on the economy it s not that we can t take china down luskin said it
