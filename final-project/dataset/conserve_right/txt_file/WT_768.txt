trump a sweeping effort focused on eight battleground states and voters of color who typically don t vote the investment marks the largest voter engagement and turnout operation in the history of the service employees international union which claims nearly 2 million members the scope of the campaign which quietly launched last month and will run through november s general election reflects the urgency of what union president mary kay henry calls a make or break moment for working people in america under trump s leadership he s systematically unwinding and attacking unions federal workers

virginia and wisconsin according to details of the plan shared with the associated press the union and its local members will pay particular attention to two key urban battlegrounds they believe will

targeting minority men and women who typically don t vote few groups of voters will be more important in the 2020 general election trump won the presidency four years ago largely because of his popularity with working class whites and a drop off in turnout from minority voters the union s political director maria peralta noted that trump s campaign has been working effectively in recent

peralta said data shows people care about wages and they care about health care across the board the union also determined that it s particularly effective to highlight trump s work to weaken labor unions and conditions for working class americans after campaigning for a higher minimum wage trump has done little to raise the federal minimum wage which has been stuck at 7 25 for more than a
