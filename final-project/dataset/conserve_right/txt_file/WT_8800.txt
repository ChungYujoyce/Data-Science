wondered if his kidneys would fail and was convinced tylox had changed the color of his eyes my nerves are a mess my bones are misplaced and i have become lazy irritable extreme he said experts say that if you take this medicine because of pain it s not addictive this is rubbish just chew it in early 2016 a doctor told wu the cancer had come back he signed an organ donation form and posted it on

he kept taking oxycontin once you take that drug i ve said it it s just like going home he said there s a sense of belonging and safety but the longer wu took the pills the less effective they were he said wu started taking oxycontin with a half bottle of strong chinese liquor which he had delivered secretly to his house he also noticed the package insert for oxycontin says not to chew it which releases the active ingredient oxycodone all at once rather than over time chewing the pills made them hit with more intensity as long as you try chewing it once there s no way for you not to chew it the next time he said more terrible than ghosts yin had vowed dozens of times to quit tylox he tried ice baths saunas and russian vodka he took a fistful of an antipsychotic that made him feel like

most pharmacies on september 18 yin hao posted an elegy to tylox on wechat the world without tylox he wrote is an abyss he said he was taking more than 100 tylox pills a day which added up to over 500 mg of oxycodone and 32 500 mg of acetaminophen the u s centers for disease control says a dose of just 33 mg of oxycodone a day doubles the risk of overdose taking more than 4 000 mg of acetaminophen

ap identified five pharmacies selling tylox without a prescription in addition three of six online pharmacies that said they had tylox in stock sold it without a prescription ap found a month after

better shape to prepare for hip replacement surgery which he hopes to have next year he flashed a smile and said he d earn enough from singing to pay for the operation but so far he s barely making rent around 1 a m early one friday wu strapped a bottle of water onto the wheeled cart he uses to haul his amplifier around grabbed his crutch and thumped down the stairs he yanked his gear into the dark december chill and headed over to a strip of restaurants to see if he could sell any songs at 1 15 a m it started to rain bad luck there was hardly anyone around a friendly restaurant manager let him sit under a bright blue awning until the rain stopped wu picked up his crutch and hauled his amplifier down a block and up a block and down a block again peering into each small restaurant for stragglers who might pay him 30 yuan 4 to sing at 2 45 a m people at a table laden with empty beers took wu s menu of songs mostly cantonese hits from the eighties and nineties and after long deliberation picked one wu sat in the cold near a hunk of glistening meat on display and waited for the people at the table to go to the bathroom and buy more cigarettes finally wu began to sing a song called my good brothers thank you he said when he was done no one clapped associated press researcher chen si contributed to this report associated press researcher yu bing contributed fr
