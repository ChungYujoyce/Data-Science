apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap the senate s top democrat on sunday called on the department of veterans affairs to explain why it allowed the use of an unproven drug on veterans for the coronavirus saying patients may have been put at unnecessary risk sen charles schumer of new york said the va needs to provide congress more information about a recent bulk order for 208 000 worth of hydroxychloroquine president donald trump has heavily promoted the malaria drug without evidence as a treatment for covid 19 schumer s request comes after a whistleblower complaint filed this past week by former health and human services official rick bright alleged that the trump administration eager for a quick fix to the onslaught of the coronavirus wanted to flood hot spots in new york and new jersey with the drug major veterans organizations have urged va to explain under what circumstances va doctors initiate discussion of hydroxychloroquine with veterans as a treatment option top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed there are concerns that they are using this drug when the medical evidence says it doesn t help and could hurt schumer said in an interview with the associated press he said given the fact the malaria drug despite being untested had been repeatedly pushed publicly by trump va secretary robert wilkie must address whether anyone at the department was pressured by the white house or the administration to use hydroxychloroquine for covid 19 schumer said wilkie also should answer questions about a recent analysis of va hospital data that showed there were more deaths among patients given hydroxychloroquine versus standard care including how much patients knew about the drug s risks before taking it in a statement sunday va spokeswoman christina noel called it preposterous for anyone to suggest that va would make treatment decisions based on anything other than the best medical interests of patients va only permits use of the drug after ensuring veterans and caretakers are aware of potential risks associated with it as we do with any other drug or treatment she said wilkie in recent weeks has denied that veterans were used as test subjects for the drug and that it was instead administered at government run va hospitals only when medically appropriate with mutual consent between doctor and patient still wilkie and the department have repeatedly declined to say how widely the drug was being used for covid 19 including how many veterans were given the drug and whether va doctors were given guidance by va headquarters on specific scenarios when it should be used in a weekly call with veterans groups this past week wilkie continued to defend va s use of hydroxychloroquine he dismissed the recent analysis of va hospital data showing no benefits to patients suggesting the poor outcomes were because the cases involved older very sick veterans use of this medication for treatment of covid 19 is considered off label perfectly legal and not rare he wrote in an april 29 letter to veterans groups the analysis of hospital data done by independent researchers at two universities with va approval was not a rigorous experiment researchers analyzed medical records of 368 older male veterans hospitalized with confirmed coronavirus infection at va medical centers who died or were discharged by april 11 about 28 of veterans who were given hydroxychloroquine plus usual care died versus 11 of those getting routine care alone the va recently said most of its recent bulk order for hydroxychloroquine was being used for approved uses such as treating lupus and rheumatoid arthritis but it didn t provide breakdowns wilkie in recent weeks took advocacy of the drug even further than trump by claiming without evidence that it has been effective for young and middle aged veterans in particular in fact there is no published evidence showing that veterans are very concerned that we still do not have clarity on the va s past and present use of hydroxychloroquine in treating veterans with covid 19 jeremy butler chief executive officer of iraq and afghanistan veterans of america told the ap now that the federal government issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir to treat covid 19 we need answers to these questions as well as the va s plans for administering or not administering remdesivir he said that action by the food and drug administration came after preliminary results from a government sponsored study showed that remdesivir shortened the time to recovery by 31 or about four days on average for hospitalized covid 19 patients in a tweet sunday former va secretary david shulkin urged the department to immediately curtail use of hydroxychloroquine for covid 19 with studies showing no benefit va should restrict use exclusively to clinical trials he wrote shulkin was fired by trump in march 2018 and wilkie replaced him schumer said his main concern is determining whether the va had conducted any clandestine studies to determine whether hydroxychloroquine was effective without their permission he said there s also concern that the department won t address specifically where the drug was sent these are people who risked their lives for us schumer said they should be treated only with the utmost dignity respect and high standards of care the drug has long been used to treat malaria and other ailments a few very small preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent the coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner but the fda last month warned doctors against prescribing the drug for covid 19 outside ho
