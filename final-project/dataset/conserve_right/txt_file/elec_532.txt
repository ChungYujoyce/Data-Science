national review way back in 1996 a little known high school teacher named victor morales won the texas demo cratic senate primary he beat two better known and better funded members of congress john bryant and jim chapman jr and morales was the first non white candidate for senate to win the nomination of either party in state history the media were enraptured with the tale of a humble teacher who put 60 000 miles onto the odometer of his dented white pickup crisscrossing texas taking on incumbent gop senator phil gramm richard estrada of the dallas morning news wrote that morales fairly oozes sincerity he is the consummate outsider in truth morales is not just a viable candidate the enthusiastic re sponse he is receiving signals that he is a political phenomenon the new york times declared that morales could energize hispanic democrats to turn out for him this november maybe even providing major help for president clinton here or for other democrats texas monthly tracked how morales had become a media phenomenon morales has been profiled in the new york times the washington post the los angeles times usa today and the miami herald and on the today show dateline and cnn perhaps most important he has sat for the obligatory underdog championing portrait in people despite all the hype about morales the race was never all that competitive gramm went on to win by eleven points one of the early chapters of a long painful stretch for texas democrats no democrat has received more than 45 percent of the vote in a race for senator or governor since 1994 democrats both inside and out of the lone star state desperately want a candidate who could win texas because a democrat who could win the state s 38 electoral votes in a presidential race would end the competition before it began in past cycles the yearning to be lieve in texas democratic candidates got national reporters to breathlessly hype the chances and potential of figures such as former houston mayor bill white state legislator wendy davis and former san antonio mayor julian castro and to tout the formation in 2014 of the progressive grassroots organizing group battleground texas there s no doubt the group has put a scare into the long dominant texas gop declared msnbc a few months before republicans had one of their best election days ever this is how the stage was set when democratic congressman beto o rourke decided to run against first term incumbent senator ted cruz the national media started sending correspondents to hang out with o rourke and just about all of them fell in love with him vanity fair town and country spin gq twice buzzfeed yahoo news the new york times rolling stone time the washington post twice the guardian the los angeles times bloomberg news the bbc correspondents seemed oddly fixated on his sweat politico swooned sweat pours off his lean 6 foot 4 inch frame in vanity fair peter hamby described him sweating through a button down shirt at one of his jam packed town halls the bbc wrote his toes are well over the edge of the boards of the stage and his suede shoes are soaking up dark splashes of sweat from his brow it s texas it s summer it s hot everybody sweats at outdoor events beyond their not so hidden partisan preference many reporters want to discover the southern democrat with national potential bill clinton 2 0 and write the first glossy profile piece of a future president the piece will double as a book proposal and the book will allow its author to spend the latter half of his or her career as a quasi historian expert on a particular president reading through all of these profiles as they emphasize the same points over and over again he was in a punk rock band he skateboards he s handsome he s kennedyesque he speaks fluent spanish one keeps waiting for the section that describes what makes o rourke actually unique among democratic candidates and that section never arrives there is no hardscrabble climb out of poverty no tale of military heroism no running into a burning building to save orphans not even an occasion of helping get an old lady s cat out of a tree o rourke s father was a well connected judge and entrepreneur and his mother ran a furniture store he went to columbia and formed a punk rock band he spent his initial post college years holding down a series of entry level and temp jobs as texas monthly put it unhappy with life in new york city he moved back to el paso and eventually formed a company that managed websites o rourke ran for city council and depending on your point of view either spearheaded an exciting revitalization of the city or encouraged gentrification to help his career supporting the use of eminent domain to drive out poor residents he married into the family of his region s most influential businessmen all of those glowing profiles had missed or glossed over the one really dramatic event in o rourke s early life until at the end of august the houston chronicle uncovered new details about the candidate s serious dui car accident on his 26th birthday o rourke lost control and hit a truck sending his car careening across the center median into oncoming lanes he recorded 0 136 and 0 134 on police breathalyzers well above a blood alcohol level of 0 10 the state legal limit at the time a witness who stopped at the scene later told police that o rourke had tried to drive away an accusation he denies for perspective texas monthly wrote an 8 500 word profile of o rourke and mentioned the dui once in congress o rourke was little known until his senate bid he s been the primary sponsor of just three bills that became law one of them renamed a federal building in el paso the media looked at o rourke s fairly mundane life and standard issue national democratic positions and convinced themselves they had found a transformational political talent in some cases by simply asserting that the democratic nominee was something he wasn t he s not latino beto is a childhood nickname but headlines keep leaving the impression that he is as with msnbc s in texas beto o rourke s rise fuels hope for latino democrats he gets labeled an outsider despite having been in elected office since 2005 and in congress since 2013 the associated press eventually noticed that he s got an everyman image but a net worth of about 9 million o rourke has some strengths he s handsome he s good on the stump and he uses social media in creative ways he won his past democratic primaries by out hustling comfortable incumbents and o rourke is indisputably unusual for a texas demo cratic candidate in that he s running on a stridently liberal platform banning ar 15s for example and abolishing ice it s hard to tell whether the media pushed the liberal grassroots to love o rourke or the liberal grassroots pushed the media to love o rourke or is all of this beto mania symbiotic clearly liberal donors fell head over heels for a texas statewide candidate who sounds like an msnbc talking head o rourke raised 38 million in the third quarter by far the largest amount raised in a quarter by a senate candidate ever top tier presidential candidates envy that kind of fundraising and endangered democratic senate incumbents such as heidi heitkamp claire mccaskill and joe donnelly would feel a lot more secure if they had half of it this overwhelming media love and avalanche of donations are going to a candidate who hasn t led a realclearpolitics average of polls even once this year whatever his flaws ted cruz has led every reliable survey by anywhere from one to nine points with an o rourke victory looking less and less likely the goalposts are moving again to turn his expected defeat into a moral victory cnn s james moore declared that against the odds win or lose he s already changing texas alex shephard wrote in the new republic that o rourke has shown democrats how to run brave uncompromised campaigns in the trump era and hamby gushed that he s offered an antidote to the entire stupid artifice of american politics in the trump era maybe they re right maybe even a defeated o rourke campaign would herald a permanent change in the state s politics then again everybody eventually forgot about victor morales too get insight and analysis on the most important political issues from the best conservative
