ama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic not only did michael r bloomberg upend the democratic presidential primary with his candidacy but he also created a media hullabaloo by further smudging the line between politics and journalism shortly after the billionaire jumped sunday into the 2020 race bloomberg news editor in chief john micklethwait said in a staff memo that the news division would refrain from investigating mr bloomberg his finances and his family describing that policy as part of its journalism tradition in addition he said bloomberg news will refrain from conducting investigations into mr bloomberg s democratic rivals but will continue to investigate president trump and his administration and that several bloomberg editors and editorial board members will jump temporarily to the campaign top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed not since william randolph hearst s unsuccessful bid for the 1904 democratic presidential nomination has a major media mogul made a run for the presidency and mr micklethwait made it clear that the bloomberg candidacy would be an unparalleled challenge there is no point in trying to claim that covering this presidential campaign will be easy for a newsroom that has built up its reputation for independence in part by not writing about ourselves and very rarely about our direct competitors mr micklethwait said no previous presidential candidate has owned a journalistic organization of this size tim graham director of media analysis for the conservative media research center said the journalism industry has long struggled with the specter of a political figure like mr bloomberg who also has served as mayor of new york city also owning one of the world s largest media companies at a time when newspapers are struggling to stay afloat mr bloomberg s media empire employs about 2 700 journalists and analysts over its print radio magazine and television platforms according to the bloomberg lp website this sort of underlines the weirdness of bloomberg news ever since he became mayor mr graham said when your news service is owned by an elected official how on earth do you do that the outcry from the journalism class was swift former bloomberg businessweek editor megan murphy tweeted t his is not journalism adding that she received a near identical memo in 2016 and made it clear she would quit the second it ever saw the light of day patricia gallagher newberry president of the society for professional journalists agreed that mr bloomberg s candidacy placed bloomberg news in a difficult position but that the decision to stop investigating all democratic candidates wasn t the right answer my opinion here is they haven t hit exactly on the right recipe yet she said so yes we re going to cover michael bloomberg vis a vis the other 20 people in the race but we re not going to do any investigations so what does that mean how do they define investigations does that mean we re not going to pull anyone s fec reports and look at who spent what on ads kevin z smith executive director of the kiplinger program in public affairs journalism at ohio state university called it outlandish this is so outlandish it has to be recognized as a historical collapse of ethical standards tweeted mr smith this isn t just worthy of a future textbook case study it needs immediate condemnation by the profession david martosko u s political editor of the u k daily mail described the policy as completely unsustainable he predicted that mr trump would use the specter of a news empire owned by a political rival to his advantage i predict trump rallies will include this is there a bloomberg reporter back there in the fake news section they fly on air force one every day and chase me around but little mike won t let them investigate any democrats it s crooked as hell mr martosko tweeted then there was the reaction from conservatives such as the media research center s brent bozell who described the entire plan as not only unethical but also possibly illegal bloomberg news declares it will not investigate bloomberg or his fellow democrats but will investigate trump if that isn t a massively illegal in kind campaign contribution what is tweeted mr bozell he called on any real journalist still working at bloomberg to resign and then noted that several bloomberg editorial board members have already left not out of principle but to work on the candidate s primary campaign they include senior executive editor david shipley and tim o brien executive editor of bloomberg opinion author of the 2005 book trump nation the art of being the donald who will also reportedly stop making appearances on msnbc and nbc the place where michael has had the most contact with editorial is bloomberg opinion our editorials have reflected his views said the micklethwait memo david shipley tim o brien and some members of the board responsible for those editorials will take a leave of absence to join mike s campaign in an online post bloomberg opinion said the department would suspend writing unsigned editorials as long as mr bloomberg who controls 89 of bloomberg lp which owns the media company is a candidate members of the editorial board will write and edit in other capacities within bloomberg opinion said the post because our columnists have always spoken for themselves they will continue as before though columnists will still refrain from endorsing candidates a policy we have had in place since we started in 2011 finally we will not publish op ed articles that relate to or are affiliated with any candidate or any presidential campaign including mike s as many commentators pointed out however he only way to avoid such a conflict of interest and the hit to bloomberg news reputation would be to sell the company which mr graham said would never happen he s never going to do that mr graham said that s like ask
