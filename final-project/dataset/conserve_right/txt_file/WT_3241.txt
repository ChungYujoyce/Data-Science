ed for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion depending on the polls you read and how you read them nearly half of those surveyed want the house impeachment inquiry of president trump to continue that is not the same as wanting him impeached much less convicted by the senate and removed from office but it represents a momentum the president needs to address and soon the president is correct that he is being treated unfairly and has been since before the election which the left still resents his having won still would the president be in such deep water if he displayed a different personality or at least was kinder to his political opponents last week at a rally in minnesota the president said barack obama chose joe biden as his running mate in 2008 because biden understood how to kiss barack obama s ass that gets his mostly white rally goers energized but what effect does it have on the rest of the country top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ellen degeneres recently demonstrated a different model for relating to political opposites she was seen at a football game sitting in a box and smiling with former president george w bush whose father was criticized by some on the right for speaking of the need for a kinder and gentler nation ms degeneres said people should be more kind to each other even if they have different political beliefs the new york post noted degeneres 61 has banned numerous celebrities from appearing on her show when they have expressed views that contradict her own including those who have vocalized their anti gay marriage views ms degeneres is gay and married to a woman inconsistency is not unique to ms degeneres but she has a point worth considering in their biography of the late jack kemp the former congressman 1996 vice presidential candidate and later hud secretary fred barnes and morton kondracke write kemp embodied a spirit sorely missing in today s politics in both parties kemp was positive optimistic idealistic energetic growth and opportunity oriented he was incapable of personal attack and negative campaigning even when it cost him the purpose of politics he said is not to defeat your opponent as much as it is to provide superior leadership and better ideas than the opposition one of my favorite kemp lines was that you don t beat a thesis with an anti thesis you beat it with a better thesis president trump has a better thesis like mr kemp s promotion of supply side economics in the 1970s which ronald reagan came to embrace leading to an economic boom mr trump s policies are working he should spend less time calling his opponents names and more time dissecting policies that have failed the country in the past democrats have nothing to offer but free stuff and impeachment they are trying to make the president s personality central to what some have called a coup he is helping them it is one thing to be combative but quite another to be mean the president is pushing back against his critics in ways no other recent republican president has done and good for him for doing so but there is a way to do it that wins votes and prevails in the next election and another way that detracts from the president s multiple achievements and could lead to political disaster the old testament prophet jeremiah rhetorically asks can a leopard change his spots at his age president trump may not be able to change his spots but he can tone down the invective against opponents which is only giving them and everyone else who hates him permission to fire back in a similar manner cal thomas a nationally syndicated columnist is the author of america s expiration date the fall of empires superpowers and the united states harpercollins zondervan jan
