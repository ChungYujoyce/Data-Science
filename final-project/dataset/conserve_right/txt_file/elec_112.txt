President Donald Trump tweeted Easter Sunday morning fire at his critics of a flip on China, which he once called its "currency manipulation one of our nation's greatest sovereign threats."

Trump's message was: He would not bite a helping hand . . . but he added a possible caveat, "we will see."

He declined to do so this week — "they're not currency manipulators," Trump said — because the manipulation has subsided and China is an important partner amid the escalating military tensions on the Korean peninsula.
