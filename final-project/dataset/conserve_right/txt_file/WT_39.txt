symbolic endorsement among the many veteran black lawmakers who back his candidacy we need his voice the 80 year old lewis told reporters ahead of the campaign s tuesday announcement he described the 77 year old biden as a man of courage a man of great conscience a man of faith and said the former vice president would help us regain our way as a nation a 17 term atlanta congressman lewis is battling pancreatic cancer but said he d travel around america for biden if social distancing guidelines are eased amid the coronavirus pandemic top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk lewis tailored a message to younger black voters who ve not backed biden with the same enthusiasm as older african americans i would tell young people the story of selma and montgomery and mississippi lewis said remembering being beaten nearly to death by alabama state troopers as he marched for voting rights in 1965 if we fail to vote we don t count the vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in society and we must use it lewis did not name president donald trump but said pointedly we have a choice black voters have anchored biden s primary coalition starting with overwhelming support in south carolina a feb 29 victory there propelled biden through victories that yielded an insurmountable delegate lead over bernie sanders before the covid 19 virus prompted more than a dozen states including lewis georgia to delay their primaries biden s team once viewed georgia s march 24 contest as a likely knockout blow for sanders georgia is now set to vote may 19 so lewis blessing at this point is more about his national profile than any heavyweight status at home perhaps the most visible living representatives of black americans civil rights struggle lewis was one of the original freedom riders the group rode buses through the segregated south in the early 1960s to challenge jim crow laws they were beaten at multiple bus stations along the way in march 1965

said monday in 1963 he was a lead organizer of the march on washington where martin luther king jr delivered his best known address lewis was in indianapolis in april 1968 campaigning for presidential candidate robert f kennedy the night king was assassinated in memphis kennedy would be assassinated eight weeks later biden was a young law school student at the time and now frequently cites king and kennedy as his two political heroes biden credits the civil rights movement decades before he d become vice president to barack obama the nation s first black president as the inspiration for his political career still biden sometimes overplays his social action in that era as a first term u s senator from delaware biden pushed for the extension of the voting rights act of 1965 which had been adopted after lewis marches biden fought against redlining banking standards that made it difficult if not impossible for black families to secure mortgages in white neighborhoods but biden also was a leading critic of court ordered busing to force integration of public schools he notes that many black parents joined whites in opposing busing and he points to redlining as the real structural impediment to school integration early in his 2020 campaign biden recalled the civility of that 1970s senate despite its roster of several avowed racists elected during the jim crow era he clarified that he d fought his older colleagues on matters like voting rights but found common ground on issues unrelated to race young african american commentators excoriated biden as anachronistic and unfit

administration would look like the country he s committed to nominate a black woman to the supreme court upon his first vacancy he s pledged to name a woman as his running mate it would be good to have a woman of color as vice president lewis said stopping short of saying he expects such a move though lewis avoided explicit criticisms of trump during his remarks he alluded to biden s campaign theme that is directed squarely at the republican incumbent biden s election lewis said would redeem the soul of america lewis memorably tangled with trump days before the president s inauguration in 2017 lewis said he did not see trump as a legitimate president prompting trump to blast lewis as all talk and denigrate his majority black district as crime infested and falling apart among other
