ican senator from utah suggested a replacement director who could get democratic support in the senate this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday may 14 2017 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news anchor i m chris wallace today the comey controversy inside the president aposs decision to fire his fbi chief begin videotape reporter why did you fire director comey donald trump president of the united states because he wasn apost doing a good job very simply he was not doing a good job sen chuck schumer d ny minority leader mr president with all due respect you aposre making a big mistake first question the administration has to answer is why now wallace we ll drill down into james comey aposs dismissal how and why the president made the decision and what aposs next for the russian investigation this hour we are joined by two key senators first mark warner a top democrat on the senate intelligence committee that s investigating possible collusion between the trump campaign and the kremlin sen mark warner d virginia president trump aposs actions this week cost us an opportunity to get at the truth at least for today wallace then republican senator mike lee who has suggested a new director he thinks will get broad support from democrats sen mike lee d utah one name that i think the white house really ought to consider is merrick garland i think this would be an exciting pick wallace plus president trump tweets a warning to comey their conversations may have been taped jeanine pirro justice host what about the idea that in a tweet you said that there might be tape recordings trump well that i can apost talk about i won apost talk about that wallace we ll ask our sunday panel including bob woodward about mr trump s refusal to deny he aposs got a recording device in the oval office all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace hello again and happy mother aposs day from fox news in washington we want to begin by telling you who you are not going to hear from today the white house since the president fired james comey on tuesday we aposve been asking for a guest to explain the president aposs reasoning and discuss the fallout saturday morning white house officials that they would not put anyone out to discuss that but they did offer senior officials to talk about the president aposs foreign trip this week when we said we were going to focus on comey for at least the first half hour of this program they put those officials on other shows in a few minutes we ll talk with senator mark warner co chair of the senate intelligence committee into russian and possible links to the trump campaign and republican senator mike lee a member of the judiciary committee but first let aposs bring in fox news correspondent kevin corke at the white house with the latest kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris the list of individuals being interviewed of the director of the federal bureau of investigation is both weighty and expensive with many cases individuals with enormous institutional and critical mission experience as well on saturday you heard a great deal about the ongoing interviews and there have been many of them the vetting process obviously continues we expect the president to make a determination by weeks end just ahead of his first foreign trip one name drawing a great deal of interest that of former representative mike rogers of michigan endorsed by a group of former and current fbi agents he is a former special agent another bill evanina who s not only a former fbi agent he aposs also been a counterespionage chief at the cia as well for his part president trump spent saturday delivering his first commencement address before tens of thousands at liberty university encouraging students there to shake up conventional wisdom and embrace being outside the mainstream begin video clip trump embrace that label being an outsider is fine embrace the label because if the outsiders who change the world and to make a real and lasting difference end video clip corke that is obviously a sentiment that he has not only championed as a candidate but also as the commander in chief and something he was asked about by fox news judge jeanine pirro in an interview that as well as the alleged request by then director comey for his loyalty begin video clip pirro did you ask that question trump no no i didn t but i don apost think it would be a bad question to ask i think loyalty to the country loyalty to the united states is important you know i mean it depends on how you define loyalty number one number two i don apost know how that got there because i didn apost ask that question end video clip corke very interesting critics have suggested chris that if he asked the question it would have applied or at least implied pressure on comey who was conducting the investigation into alleged russian meddling into the 2016 campaign chris wallace kevin corke reporting for the white house kevin thanks for that joining me now to discuss the fallout over the president aposs decision to fire james comey the top democrat in the senate intelligence committee mark warner and senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen mark warner d va ranking member intel committee thank you chris wallace president trump says that he fired comey because he was quote a showboat and because the fbi is in turmoil but then he said this begin video clip trump when i decided to just do it i said to myself i said you know this russia thing with trump and russia is a made up story it aposs an excuse by the democrats for having lost an election that they should have won end video clip wallace so what does that tell you about the president aposs motivation warner well to me that aposs very troubling chris i mean earlier in the week the president has said he fired comey because of the deputy attorney general s memo that i the memo that frankly didn t pass any smell test that somehow implied that he was upset that they hadn apost treated hillary clinton fairly last fall i find it very disturbing that the president would fire the head of the fbi who was leading an investigation into the president or his affiliates and associates having ties and connections with russia during the campaign and afterwards to me it aposs absolutely unacceptable the president aposs actions wallace well i want to pick up on that because here is the statement that you made this week at the senate intelligence committee hearing here it is begin video clip warner it aposs hard to avoid the conclusion that the president aposs decision to remove director comey was related to this investigation and that s that is truly unacceptable end video clip wallace senator i have a straight question for you do you believe the president fired comey to interfere with the fbi investigation into russian interference in the election and a possible link to the trump campaign warner the president aposs actions and his statement lends to that appearance now i don apost know what was in the presence of mind but i do know this that this senate intelligence committee is going to pursue this investigation to wherever the intel and facts lead us and i was reassured of a bit when i heard that acting director mccabe said not only does he have enough resources but that he will also pursue the investigation wherever it leads wallace you say it lends itself to that do you believe that he was trying to interfere and do you believe there is the potential here for an obstruction of justice and how do you square that with what acting director andrew mccabe said at your hearing and let aposs just play that begin video clip andrew mccabe acting fbi director you cannot stop the men and women of the fbi from doing the right thing protecting the american people and upholding the constitution end video clip warner that statement from director mccabe reassures me and i also said if you see any influence from the administration to try to squash your investigation he committed to getting back to the committee but again the president and this administration who said there s no there there continues through their actions to indicate that they are afraid of where this investigation i had let aposs again step back for a brief moment this week we saw sally yates testify that wallace the acting attorney general warner the acting attorney general who was fired that the administration did not appropriately react to her concerns about general flynn we saw the director of the fbi fired literally two days before he was supposed to testify before my committee we then have the president changing his reasoning for why he fired him from saying this was a recommendation of the acting attorney general or deputy attorney general to the fact that he was going to fire him anyway because of comey aposs investigation into russia and then we had this again outrageous potential claims that the president may be secretly taping his conversations which again means we want to make sure those tapes if they exist are preserved and at some point whether our committee or another committee needs to get on crosstalk wallace i m going to get to the taping in the second but you put a couple of things out there connect the dots where does that lead you in terms of what the president aposs motivation is warner the dots seem to be fairly obviously connected that there aposs a lot more than smoke here but i m trying to give the president the benefit of the doubt until we finish this investigation and reach conclusions wallace ok on friday as you mentioned after the president and comey associates disagreed about what was and wasn apost discussed at the dinner they held one week after the inauguration mr trump sent out this tweet james comey better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press and that led to this exchange in the white house briefing room begin video clip jeff mason reuters did president trump record his conversations with former fbi director comey sean spicer white house press secretary i assume you are referring to the tweet and i ve talked to the president and the president has nothing further to add on that mason are there recording devices in the oval office spicer i say jeff for the third time there is nothing further to add on that wallace well let me ask you what aposs your reaction to what clearly is a possibility certainly not denied by this white house that the president has installed recording devices in the white house warner i am by no means a legal expert but this sure seems to have reverberations of past history when we aposve seen presidents who secretly tape that usually does not end up being a good outcome for a president wallace how does the senate find out whether he aposs just trolling you and if there are indeed tapes how do you get them warner well first of listen to what you just said how do we know find out if the president is simply trolling us the whole notion that he can throw out these kinds of claims and not either confirm or deny them is outrageous in my mind if there is the existence of tapes i want to make sure one they are preserved are not mysteriously destroyed in the coming days and then two one way or the other congress will have to get a look at those tapes wallace how do you make sure they are preserved warner well i know i called for the preservation the ranking member of the judiciary committee senator feinstein has called for those preservations members of the house have and to me it aposs remarkable what the white house spokesman would not confirm or deny the accuracy of the president aposs tweet and statement on friday morning wallace did comey ever tell you as he apparently told senators grassley and feinstein as they revealed it today in a public session that the president in fact is not target of the investigation warner i m not going to get into the specifics of what director comey has talked with me about what he had said and it was reinforced by acting director mccabe that the fbi is taking this investigation very seriously they think it is a priority they re going to put all the resources wallace if i may interrupt sir we are talking about the president of the united states we aposre talking about a cloud that is over his presidency if you have been told that he is not a target of the investigation for the good of the country shouldn apost you tell us that warner chris i believe for the good of the country it aposs also important i keep classified information classified what i will say is that there are clearly ongoing investigations on a number of individuals they are affiliated with the trump campaign and trump operations that this investigation is extraordinary serious that we believe on the senate intelligence committee i said repeatedly this is the most important thing i ve ever taken on in my public life and we re going to get to the bottom of it and what is disturbing to me is that you have an administration that it appears anyone affiliated with this administration and affiliated with the russians they don t have a very good career path sally yates as we mentioned earlier fired because she her indications along with general flynn general flynn fired because of failing to disclose his ties to the russian attorney general sessions had to recuse himself because of his ties to the russians and now you ve got director comey who even the president has acknowledged was being fired because of affiliations and investigations into the russians for an administration that says there aposs no smoke there boy oh boy they are creating more of the smoke wallace at various points top officials including former director of national intelligence clapper have said that at that point they had seen no evidence of collusion between the kremlin and what i will call trump world have you seen any evidence of collusion warner we are still relatively early in our investigation but we are we aposve issued a subpoena to general flynn because he s unwilling to cooperate we ve got a series of individuals that were affiliated with the trump campaign that very serious allegations have been made about we re going to follow that intelligence wherever it leads there are so many individuals that have had some level of contact with the russians and this is again an administration that earlier on said there were no contacts at all now we had the national security advisor get fired we had the attorney general recused himself and we have got a cast of characters that we intend to interview that it appears at least on surface that they aposve had many ties with the russians wallace the president says that the real story here that aposs not being talked enough is the unmasking of people american citizens people involved with his campaign associates who was swept up in electronic surveillance and that those names were subsequently leaked to the media illegally one are you investigating that aggressively and have you discovered how those names became public warner if there are individuals that were inappropriately unmasked we will find that out as well but the president s earlier wallace that aposs part of your investigation warner the president aposs earlier claim that he was the subject of massive in effect wiretapping by the obama administration has been totally dismissed by director comey wallace but i m talking about something else which is unmasking of individuals we know flynn aposs name was masked and leaked are you aggressively investigating that warner let me assure you chairman burr and i if there are inappropriate leakings and inappropriate unmaskings we will get to the bottom of that as well wallace in the time we have left and it aposs only a couple of minutes i want to do a lightning round quick questions quick answers comey turned an invitation this week to testify in private before your committee but there are reports that he would be willing to testify in public will you invite them to do so warner we would love to have him invite come in public the american people need to hear his side of the story after he has been so sullied in his reputation which is i think a great reputation particularly amongst the fbi agents has been so sullied by this president wallace is it true they have indicated he would testify in public warner my expectation is that we will get a chance to hear from him in public wallace how soon sir warner i don apost know wallace the white house released a letter this week from the president s lawyers saying that there has been minimal financial dealings with the russians does that letter satisfy you warner that letter strangely enough released this week dated in march to me seems full of legalese and basically begs more questions than it answers we are not as interested in whether trump invested in russia we re interested and i m at least interested how much russians invested in trump or his organization wallace so as far as you aposre concerned the question of his financial connection to russia is still open warner in my mind that is a very open question and one of the reasons why we aposve asked the department of treasury they re so called fincen division to give us and provide as all their documents as well wallace a couple of final questions i ve got about a minute left the attorney general had met yesterday with eight candidates for fbi director including senator cornyn and acting director mccabe anyone on that list who you would like to see anyone you would rule out and just generally what are you going to need to see so that you can vote for president trump aposs nominee warner two quick points one is i think it aposs inappropriate that the attorney general who was supposed to recuse himself for anything dealing with the russian investigation and clearly the russian investigation is tied into who the next fbi director is going to be because the president fired comey because of his ties to the russian investigation that aposs very concerning to me i would hope wallace you don t believe he could be part of this warren i don apost believe he should be part of this review process if he can have a true recusal and as well i think whoever the future fbi director ought to be it should be a law enforcement professional this position has never been politicized and i hope the president won t choose a political nominee wallace finally will this continuing cloud over the president and it s going to be there for some time you say you re just in the early stages of this investigation will it hamper will it slow down will it stop the president aposs legislative agenda warner well i my belief is the president and administration if there is no there there they actually ought to work with us and to try to come to a conclusion rather than the kind of actions we saw this week where you actually saw the opposite where you had the president fired the fbi director because who was actively leading an investigation into the president aposs russia ties wallace senator warner thank you thanks for coming in and we will of course be following your investigation sir warner thank you chris wallace up next we ll get reaction from republican senator mike lee and discuss his intriguing idea for who should replace james comey as fbi director commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway at lynchburg virginia home to liberty university where president trump delivered the commencement address this weekend joining me now from salt lake city utah senator mike lee who has thrown at an intriguing name to replace comey president obama aposs pick for the supreme court judge merrick garland he aposs also the author of the new book written out of history which will be released to the end of this month senator lee welcome back to fox news sunday sen mike lee r utah judiciary committee thank you chris wallace let aposs start with the president aposs attitude toward the russia investigation about possible interference in the 2016 election and possible links to the trump world as i will put it here aposs what the president said this week begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i will tell you this if russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections i think it aposs a horrible thing and i want to get to the bottom of it end video clip wallace but the president has sent several tweets this week the russia trump collusion story is a hoax he said in one when will this taxpayer funded charade end senator as a former federal prosecutor does not raise questions in your mind about this president aposs interest in getting to the truth lee well i don apost think it aposs necessarily inconsistent to say he doesn apost think there aposs anything there and to be willing on the other hand to allow the investigation to move forward as far as i m aware he is fully cooperating and he is willing and eager to see this investigation follow itself all the way through to wherever the facts may lead he himself sounds confident that it aposs not going to lead anywhere that it would be incriminating toward the campaign or toward himself but i don apost think that aposs inconsistent with allowing the investigation to do what is there to do wallace even though he has already prejudged the entire investigation as a hoax and a charade lee look that might not be the best approach to take in any given moment but again it reflects the way he feels about the investigation that said it aposs important to remember that deputy fbi director andrew mccabe said under oath this week there aposs been no effort to impede our investigation to date i take him at his word and i think that indicates that this investigation is moving forward wallace part of the problem it seems to me senator with what aposs happened this week is that originally the president and his team including the vice president said that this was all following the recommendation of the attorney general and then he the president undercut that until the very different story let aposs take a look begin video clip mike pence vice president of the united states accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general to ask for the termination accepting the recommendation of the deputy attorney general trump i was going to fire comey my decision it was not lester holt nbc news anchor you made the decision before they came in the room trump i was going to fire comey end video clip wallace senator does that raise any questions any doubts in your mind about what was really going on here lee well i always want to be very careful to point out that i can apost speak for another person i especially don apost purport to speak for the president of the united states i think it aposs entirely possible that the president could have had an inclination to take that action beforehand and also have that recommendation given to them by the deputy attorney general rob rosenstein i think that aposs what happened here i think that aposs exactly what happened the president probably had the inclination and he had the recommendation that perhaps gave him added confidence in taking that action wallace what do you think of the suggestion this week the possibility that the president may have set up a recording system inside the white house certainly not denied by the white house spokesman or by the president and if that aposs true do you think that the president the white house should turn over any relevant tapes to this investigation to the congress lee i think is probably inevitable at this point if in fact there are such recordings i think those recordings will be subpoenaed and i think they will probably have to turn them over wallace what do you think of the fact that he may have set up a taping system lee i don apost know you know we know that there have been instances in the past in which other presidents have made recordings of conversations that have taken place at the white house and as was made clear earlier in the show it doesn apost always turn out well it aposs not necessarily the best idea wallace as i discussed with senator warner fbi the justice department attorney general sessions met with eight candidates for fbi director yesterday your reaction to that list and i d also like to ask you about your reaction to senator warner who said he didn apost think that given his recusal from investigation attorney general sessions should be participating in those interviews lee look it looks like a good list i agree that it needs to be someone who has a lot of credibility in law enforcement it s one of the reasons why i suggested merrick garland the other day merrick garland in addition to people who are on that list are all good candidates and i think the president ought to look for someone who can bring to the job a whole lot of credibility as for senator warner aposs statement about jeff sessions meeting with these candidates i will completely disagree with the suggestion that he has to detach himself from the process of finding an fbi director as attorney general he ll be working with the fbi director in a whole lot of cases involving a whole lot of matters that have nothing to do with anything as to which attorney general sessions has recused himself so i completely disagree i couldn apost disagree more with that suggestion wallace all right let aposs go back to the garland suggestion i mean for folks who may not be following this as closely as we are judge merrick garland is a member of the d c circuit court of appeals he was the man that barack obama last year a little over a year ago nominated to be a supreme court justice republicans in the senate blocked it said they wanted to wait until the election are you really serious about the idea that donald trump would appoint merrick garland to investigate and what aposs the reaction you aposve gotten if any from the white house lee you know first of all yes i think it aposs a great suggestion i m absolutely serious about it this is a very different post and putting them on the supreme court of the united states if president trump were to nominate merrick garland as fbi director i think his nomination would be welcomed by people on both sides of the aisle in the senate the reason i say that is because this is a man who has a lot of prosecutorial experience high profile prosecutorial experience he went after the unabomber he played a key role in the prosecution of oklahoma city bomber timothy mcveigh and he s got a strong reputation within the fbi within the law enforcement community in general generally i think this is someone who would be confirmed to that post with a very high degree of bipartisan support wallace yes i want to get to that because it seems to me that the suggestion while you like garland is also a statement perhaps that you really don apost want to see whoever the replacement for comey is to be confirmed in a straight party line vote 52 48 that you really would like to see somebody that at least some democrats can buy into why do you think that aposs important lee well i think in this instance it could be important because as we move forward the outcome of investigations ought not carry any take or potential for take with respect to partisan affiliation and i think in this instance there are whole lot of options available i think merrick garland will be a particularly good option given that he could have so much support from both sides of the aisle wallace do did you get any reaction at all from the white house lee every indication i received so far is they are considering it i really don apost know how far they are in the process or who they will end up choosing judge garland certainly isn apost the only one who they could look at he certainly isn t the only person who could be a good choice in this circumstance wallace finally i want i want to turn to what your day job is and that is legislation the house just passed obamacare repeal and replace you are one of the senate working group that is going to try to tackle obamacare reform the white house was talking about pushing out tax reform pushing out infrastructure question whether it should or not realistically doesn apost that furor over the comey firing and the raised profile for the russia investigation doesn apost that interfere with the president being able to push realistically his legislative agenda lee there were always distractions in any presidential administration with respect to obamacare and our efforts to repeal it you know unless you are a spinal tap you can apost turn up the volume on your opposition from 10 to 11 the democrats are already opposing this effort as much as they possibly can and that part of it is going to change what we are trying to do as republicans is to try to bring about real health care reform reform of the sort that will reintroduce federalism and free market forces in a way that will bring down the cost of health care to america aposs middle class who have suffered badly ever since obamacare took effect wallace but that doesn t this and i understand your point about it aposs not like you aposre getting cooperation from the democrats at this point but doesn apost it give democrats something else they can focus on they can talk about that sets up all the oxygen in washington instead of it being focused on the legislative agenda lee sure anytime you have something else come along when you aposre debating legislation while you re trying to iron out something it can it take some of the momentum away in this instance i don apost think it aposs going to make a difference because there aposs so much momentum behind the obamacare repeal effort we re going to get it done one way or another wallace senator lee thank you thanks for your time it aposs always good to talk with you sir lee thank you wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss the comey controversy and what happens next plus what would you like to ask the panel about president trump aposs decision to fire james comey just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up president trump says james comey told him he was not under investigation then warns he may have recorded their conversations begin video clip trump all i want is for comey to be honest and i hope he will be and i m sure he will be i hope end video clip wallace we ll ask our panel about the state of the trump white house coming up on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip trump i actually asked him yes i said if it aposs possible would you let me know am i under investigation he said you are not under investigation end video clip wallace president trump talking but a surprising conversation where james comey supposedly cleared him in the fbi investigation of possible links between the trump campaign and russian interference in the 2016 election and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove bob woodward from the washington post julie pace who covers the white house for the associated press and josh holmes mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff and a gop strategist well bob there aposs obviously been a lot of talk this week about parallels between this and watergate the president firing a man who was leading the investigation that could potentially take him down shifting stories now the suggestion about a possible taping system inside the white house obviously there s there are big differences and and the biggest is that we knew early on of a crime having been committed in watergate we don apost know that so far but as someone who was on the front lines of watergate what are the similarities you see this week and what are the big differences bob woodward the washington post well there are a lot of questions i was fascinated with what senator warner had to say i think he adopted this position of we re going to give the president the benefit of the doubt but he then raised about ten questions which i think need to be answered but this is not yet watergate not a clear crime on the russian issue senator warner and others have said there are there are you know a thousand questions and they should be answered but there s no evidence that president trump at this point was somehow involved in collusion here that s an important wallace what about what about his actions though woodward well his his actions are strange and unpredictable and impulsive as always but in the case of nixon he had his former white house counsel john dean for four days testifying that the president corruptly and illegally led the obstruction of justice and you have nothing comparable now that doesn apost mean you know we don apost know where this is going to go there is an immense amount of smoke the other problem here is senator warner was saying if there are tapes he would like to get the tapes the senate get the tapes in the case of nixon back in 1974 the supreme court ruled that a special prosecutor or a prosecutor can get tapes if there if it aposs demonstrated that they re admissible and relevant but not a senate committee so they re we re you know and and the white house posture on this we re not answering did he tape trump has a history of this i think one of the lessons of watergate is don apost tape wallace and and also destroy them if somebody asks for them we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this from joe ranger on facebook given the poor optics and potential for further strife within the republican party will president trump regret how this was handled karl as someone who worked very closely in the oval office for years what do you make of president trump aposs actions and statements this week karl rove fox news contributor look he had the authority to do what he did and he had reason to buy what comey had done in july and what comey had done in october and then the fact that he showed no sentiment in his testimony and no regret about having done what he did last year but having said that this was done in done anyway if you could figure out how to do something good and do it right and then figure out how to do it exactly the opposite they chose exactly the opposite they made him look petty he he he fires comey while comey is on the west coast they don apost even know that comey is in los angeles when they send the beefy ex security chief to the for the former for the current president over to with a manila folder containing the documents they don apost have a communications strategy they don apost have their act together with regard to what they aposre going to say and and then after they finally start saying on tuesday night late and on wednesday we did it because the deputy attorney general gave us a good explanation of why we should on thursday the president undercuts his own spokesman by saying well it didn t matter i was going to fire him anyway and and virtually in the next sentence says and it was because i m upset about the russia investigation and this is only going to provoke greater controversy and it aposs only going to provoke people to question the president s trustworthiness his credibility and the reasons for his actions and it is going to guarantee that there s going to be a very serious investigation by the fbi and that the next fbi director will only be approved after congress grills them and pins them to the fire on will you conduct an independent investigation that gets to the bottom of all these issues wallace and then as if that weren apost enough there was the astonishing suggestion on friday both by the president and then in a non denial by sean spicer that he may the president may have set up a recording system in the white house on fox news judge jeanine asked the president about this begin video clip pirro what about the idea that in a tweet you said that there might be tape recordings trump you know that i can t talk about i won apost talk about that end video clip wallace julie i i i was i have to say i took my breath away when when when i heard that what you make of that do you think the president is just trolling the media and his critics do you think there s a real possibility that he has set up a taping system julie pace the associated press well i think it aposs important to note that with president trump when he was in business and when he was a candidate people who work for him largely assumed that his their conversations with him were being taped in his new york offices people generally worked under that assumption so the idea that he would be taping conversations is not out of the realm of possibility of course it s much different when you re talking about conversations in the oval office particularly if they re being recorded secretly but the mere fact that we aposre having this conversation is really extraordinary and you have to put it again in some context this is a president who was extremely frustrated with the way that the rollout of comey aposs firing was handled he felt like he needed to step in there he needed to be his own spokesperson but in doing so both in the interviews that he did and in his tweets he only created more headaches and potentially legal headaches for his white house wallace yes that aposs one of the astonishing things is it it seemed to me and we re told that he had no legal counsel before he went out and talked and there are all kinds of potential issues legal issues he raised i want to talk about the other central figure in all this and that s james comey it aposs been reported that his testimony before congress the week before last upset the president here aposs a taste of that testimony begin video clip james comey former fbi director it makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election i started at speak and conceal speak would be really bad there s an election in 11 days lordy that would be really bad concealing in my view would be catastrophic end video clip wallace josh there are two competing narratives about james comey one is that he is an incorruptible straight shooter the other as the president said is that he is a showboat and a grandstander from your point of view you re a gop strategist did comey overstepped his situation as fbi director his role and did he need to go josh holmes founder cavalry yes i think there s no question about it chris i think that you d be hard pressed to find anyone in public office where there aposs more bipartisan consensus about whether or not they were the best person to lead the department we aposve got everybody from democrats across the board ideologically wallace yes however a lot of them pulled that back this week holmes sure and that sort of gives you whiplash too but i think that the important part is was he the best person to lead the department and i think there was broad bipartisan consensus that he was not and so it the decision in and of itself to have to remove him as director of fbi i don apost think should be all that controversial it s the timing of course which gives people pause but also the rollout and i think what s happened here is that the administration has created a lot more smoke for itself that is necessary the investigation that director comey and the fbi are taking goes on the idea that in 2017 you could somehow bury an fbi investigation by firing the director is laughable at best and there aposs two other separate congressional investigations that hare happening simultaneously so we re going to get to the bottom of this regardless of whether director comey is at the fbi or not wallace if you wonder what we talk about during the commercials josh holmes is really very close to mitch mcconnell he was his chief of staff he was the person who helped get him re elected this last time and you said you spoke to the senator this morning holmes i did he was he was watching mike lee aposs interview and the suggestion that merrick garland be the next director of the fbi and i think the senate majority leader thinks that aposs a fantastic idea it s somebody who obviously democrats have significant trust and respect for they aposve articulated that over the last year and someone who could do the job impartially and i think he aposs going to be prepared to make that suggestion wallace to the president holmes yes wallace so that aposs his choice mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader aposs choice for the replacement is judge merrick garland holmes he certainly think that he would be qualified he certainly thinks that he would be somebody that he could support wallace that aposs the kind of thing that happens here during the commercials panel we have to take a break here but when we come back mr trump aposs actions this week shook his white house what does it say about the state of his presidency going forward commercial break begin video clip sarah huckabee sanders deputy white house press secretary i know everybody in this room and probably most of the media around the world would like to think that s the fbi aposs sole responsibility but that aposs a probably one of the smallest things that they aposve got going on the plate unidentified male is this a small investigation in relation to all to all the other work that you aposre doing andrew mccabe acting fbi director sir we consider it to be a highly significant investigation end video clip wallace acting fbi director mccabe this week contradicting deputy press secretary sarah huckabee sanders on the investigation into russian interference and possible links to the trump campaign and we re back now with the panel well julie part of the story this week beyond this investigation was what it said about the trump white house and the disarray there you had the communications people like huckabee sanders like spicer sent out to defend the president with very little advanced notice apparently about an hour the cover story that it was all as a result of the recommendation of the attorney general deputy attorney general it fell apart within 48 hours and now there are these continuing stories that the president is considering a major shakeup in the white house folks i aposve got to tell you there is a story this morning that the president is considering firing priebus bannon spicer everybody in the white house and basically turning things over ivanka jared i aposm not kidding here and their associates question how bad is it over there right now pace they re in a pretty untenable situation right now because you have a president who frankly does not trust people on his own staff he is furious about all of the leaks that have come out since he took office he is trying to keep information away from people on his staff the fact that the communication staff didn apost find out about this decision until an hour before it was announced they were set up for failure in that situation by the president if he can apost trust people on his staff to implement his decisions it aposs going to have ripple effects across his entire agenda not just dealing with this comey situation i will say though the president goes through these phases where he will start asking people who do you think would be a better chief of staff who do you think would be better at the podium often he gets talks himself out of those decisions so he might be in one of those moods right now where he s ready to clean house by monday morning we could wake up and we could be talking about a completely different landscape wallace i want to pick up on your comment about the president s agenda josh because i as i discussed with the two senators the president aposs agenda seemed to be finally gaining some momentum with house passage of repeal and replace senate working on that talk about tax reform other issues how much concern is there in republican ranks that the continuing furor over this and and more importantly the disarray inside the white house the impact it may have on the president s agenda and is there concern in republican ranks that he about him possibly being a drag on the party and the 2018 midterms holmes well look i think in terms of his agenda it s the one piece that almost every republican from you know in the senate from susan collins to rand paul think we ought to be focused like a laser on and as long as the the president and his administration stays focused on it it all of the republicans on capitol hill seem very content for that the question is whether or not all this distraction actually weighs it down and there aposs no question in my mind that it does i mean we every president hands members of its own party in congress a knapsack the question is how many rocks you put in it and how much they have to haul it around and there s been an awful lot of rocks in the first 120 days loaded into that knapsack and so you know i think that they re still making progress on health care reform repeal and replace and the tax reform proposals and they obviously confirmed justice gorsuch which for many republicans is sort of the biggest thing you can accomplish in an administration so the agenda i they re still focused like a laser but there aposs no question that the political distractions are a problem wallace bob a big part of the story of watergate particularly as you reported it was not political it was psychological and what led president nixon to do things that in the end only ended up hurting himself and that were totally self inflicted and and totally unnecessary and i guess the question i have is when you see what aposs happening now with reports that the president was furious about comey aposs testimony on tv that he aposs watching hearings and going through tivo on them do you see any similarities woodward we don apost know yet i mean the the great question in washington the country and the world is what aposs inside of trump what aposs driving him as we look at that comey firing it was karl rove aposs declaration to me many years ago you always have to look at consequence and outcome and the consequence and outcome of the comey firing some people are saying oh it aposs part of the obstruction of justice it actually may be the opposite the acceleration of justice now people are not going to back off on this so the inside of trump is one of the mysteries that just doesn apost go away and wallace but how do you explain what seems to be this his his consuming emotions about the legitimacy of his presidency and whether it s comey whether it aposs the russia investigation that anything that seems to question whether or not he s the legitimate president instead of being able to kind of brush that off he is consumed by it woodward well look at the campaign there were these emotional outbursts all the time that aposs the way he operates the the question here really is as we look back on this week from historical perspective the big issue may not be the comey firing it may be the massive cyberattack worldwide that really jeopardizes every communication that anyone engages in at the second issue the north korean missile firing you see the trajectory on that landed 60 miles off the coast of russia can you imagine in this country if a north korean missile landed 60 miles away from los angeles those are giant issues so you know taking the the doing the psychiatric examination of the president is something we are certainly i immensely unqualified to do wallace we need charles krauthammer here karl but i i i am fascinated by it you worked in in the the bush white house how much of a pressure cooker is it inside that oval office as things come at you and how important is it to be steady rove there are so many things that come flying across and the transom and the pressure is enormous and like any organization the guy at the top the gal at the top sets the tone and the guy at the top in this administration is displaying an absence of confidence he aposs not confident in his own victory he s not confident in the fact that he aposs president he s not confident that the russia investigation is going to turn up nothing and it shows really problematic in these articles is the sense that the president s saying the system failed me all of these people are not doing their jobs he failed them this is a moment of crisis he needs to say you know what we re all in the foxhole together and i aposve made mistakes and i m i m we re going to do better he needs to set the tone otherwise not only is he going to lose people he aposs going to find it hard to recruit good people to replace them but think about every one of these things it was his decision to fire the right decision in my opinion but the method of firing was his decision as well the communications well absence of a communications strategy was the result of his decisions his his people went out and said thanks i aposm confident they went in and said mr president we re going to say that the rod rosenstein memo was the reason you did this and he undercuts them two days later he aposs the guy who puts out this unnecessary controversy about the about the with the tweet about the tapes now this is a huge issue because if i were them i d start cleaning this mess up by getting out there now and saying either there are tapes and will make them available or the president was trolling and there are no tapes get this controversy behind us and step back for a minute and realize what damage the president has done to his own cause and the cause of his agenda by doing the things that he aposs done inaudible wallace i ve got less than a minute left i want to pick up on this one thing because if there was anybody whose election was questioned it was george w bush aposs we had the hanging chads we had all of the recount what was his attitude about that you know when people said we are not the legitimate president and how did it affect them in those first days in the white house rove well look look he knew he was president he he he won the electoral college he was took the oath of office he knew he was president he also knew he had a special burden to unite the country the people were worried about about that there were very strong emotions on both sides that a lot of people thought he was illegitimate to this day paul begala will not admit he s the legitimate president of the united states dan rather who i saw you make your comment about earlier i suspect he doesn apost think he s legitimate either but bush aposs attitude was i am the president and i have to show i aposm the president by wo
