with china the european union and other countries around the world mr trump tweeted after markets closed sharply down the president said mr powell is at least ending quantitative tightening which shouldn t have started in the first place no inflation we are winning anyway but i am certainly not getting much help from the federal reserve mr powell said the president had no impact on the decisions we never take into account political considerations he told reporters there s no place in our discussions for that we also don t conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence
