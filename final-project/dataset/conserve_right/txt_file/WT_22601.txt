apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic national security adviser john bolton tried to tamp down speculation about prospect of north korea test launching a missile after recent commercial satellite imagery appearing to show cranes rebuilding a key launch site that pyongyang had vowed to destroy there s a lot of activity all the time in north korea but i m not going to speculate on what that particular commercial satellite picture shows said mr bolton who asserted that u s intelligence is watching activity inside north korea constantly we see exactly what they re doing now mr bolton said on abc s this week we see it unblinkingly and we don t have any illusions about what their capabilities are see also ex u s ambassador no question now hanoi summit outcome was bad news for kim jong un mr bolton who has advocated for regime change in pyongyang and is known as the administration official with perhaps the most hard line views on north korea stuck broadly to a message president trump himself has pushed in recent days mr trump responded cautiously wednesday to reports that north korea has been restoring its long range tongchang ri rocket launch site which it had promised to dismantle following the president s first summit with north korean leader kim jong un in june the president told reporters in the oval office he would be disappointed if new rocket activity is occurring in north korea but he also questioned the veracity of very early reports on the matter which emerged as the administration scrambled to assess the fallout from the breakdown of mr trump s more recent summit with mr kim in vietnam an article from 38 north a website specializing in north korea security issues cited the commercial satellite imagery as appearing to show that efforts to rebuild some structures at tongchang ri started sometime between feb 16 and march 2 suggesting the activity may have been occurring while mr kim and mr trump were meeting in hanoi on feb 28 and 29 a high level source familiar with the u s north korea negotiations suggested the reports were overblown telling the washington times last week the activity at tongchang ri was likely nothing more than routine maintenance but the stakes around the latest developments are high mr bolton stressed that mr trump still believes it is a positive sign that north korea has not carried out a nuclear detonation or ballistic missile test since the trump administration s diplomatic push with pyongyang began in earnest last year the national security advisor said he would rather not speculate on whether a sudden missile or rocket launch by the north koreans at this time would scuttle the prospect of future talks with pyongyang the president s confident in his personal relationship with kim jong un he s invested a lot of time in trying to develop that relationship he said mr trump said he s open to a third summit none has been scheduled and some time may have to go by but he s prepared to engage again but mr bolton stressed that mr trump is determined to avoid the mistakes prior presidents have made one mistake that prior administrations made repeatedly was assuming that the north koreans would automatically comply when they undertake obligations he said the north koreans for example have pledged to give up their nuclear weapons program at least five separate times beginning in 1992 with the joint north south denuclearization agreement they never seem to get around to it though so that s one reason why we pay particular attention to what north
