donald trump is embroiled in another media controversy this time over his reaction when asked about the emotional speech at the democratic national convention by the bereaved parents of capt humayun khan an immigrant soldier who died in iraq in 2004 as noted here at breitbart news the speech was a powerful rebuke though factually incorrect the constitution does not bar religious tests for immigrants for example now the media has dutifully weaponized the speech to attack him in aninterview with maureen down of thenewyork times and again with former clinton adviser george stephanopoulosof abc news trump was asked to respond to the speech which khan s father gave while his mother stood silently he told dowd i d like to hear his wife say something referring to the subordinate status of women in islam trump said the same to stephanopoulos addingthat khan s father khizr khan looked like a nice guy to me and defending his own sacrifices foramerica he suggested that the clinton campaign had scripted khan s remarks a charge the family later denied on msnbc and returned to hisbasic policy argument we ve had a lot of problems with radical islamic terrorism that s what i d say in response the usual freakout ezra klein of vox com for example wrote an article headlined donald trump s slander of captain humayun khan s family is horrifying even for trump but when bereaved benghazi mother patricia smith spoke at the republican convention the week before one vox com writercalled it an example of a longstanding republican tendency of extreme overreach another said it was a scary appeal to the gop base a new crossing of a line and an ugly degradation of a norm in american politics another rushed to reassure vox com readers that no official inquest into benghazi and there have been many has found evidence that clinton is personally responsible for the events of that night another cited smith s speech and the audience s reaction lock her up really disturbing and anotherarguedthat spotlighting smith felt a bit exploitive and at the same time irrelevant talk about horrifying other media outlets reacted the same way politifact rushed to fact check smith s claims though her story has been corroborated by other bereaved benghazi parents could trump have been more gracious of course but clinton whose negligence contributed to sean smith s death essentially called patricia smith a liar on national tv andfew in the media objected some in fact joined clinton s attack the double standardis glaring and tiresome stephanopoulos asked trump what sacrifices he had made for the country following up on khan s rebuke to trump you have sacrificed nothing and no one bill clinton notoriously avoided the vietnam draft a subject that came up in his 1992presidential campaign as stephanopoulos surely remembers update making the circuit of the sunday morning shows khan s father said terror has nothing to do with islam meanwhile trump has issued the following statements via twitter and his campaign website captain khan killed 12 years ago was a hero but this is about radical islamic terror and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 31 2016 captain humayun khan was a hero to our country and we should honor all who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our country safe the real problem here are the radical islamic terrorists who killed him and the efforts of these radicals to enter our country to do us further harm given the state of the world today we have to know everything about those looking to enter our country and given the state of chaos in some of these countries that is impossible while i feel deeply for the loss of his son mr khan who has never met me has no right to stand in front of millions of people and claim i have never read the constitution which is false and say many other inaccurate things if i become president i will make america safe again further hillary clinton should be held accountable for her central role in destabilizing the middle east she voted to send the united states to war against iraq helped lead the disastrous withdrawal of american troops years later that created the vacuum allowing the rise of isis and has never met a regime change she didn t like which have all been disasters not to mention her invasion of libya and her abandonment of american personnel in benghazi the loss of these lives in libya is directly traceable to clinton but their families testimonials were rejected by the media clinton s actions have been reckless and have directly led to the loss of american lives and her extreme immigration policies as also laid out by american victims in cleveland will cause the preventable deaths of countless more while putting all residents from all places at greater risk of terrorism as bernie sanders said on numerous occasions hillary clinton suffers from bad judgement she is not qualified to serve as commander in chief
