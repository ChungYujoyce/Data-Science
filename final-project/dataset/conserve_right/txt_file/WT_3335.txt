it was a solemn day as she launched two articles of impeachment against president trump actually this makes the fourth solemn day that mrs pelosi and the democratic party have treated themselves to so far she failed to note that democrats have had at least three other solemn days over the past two years the louisiana republican says reminding the accusers that they ve repeatedly tried to impeach mr trump for speaking out against nfl players who did not stand for the national anthem again after the president used an unflattering epithet to describe certain nations and a third time for his criticism of the squad of four democratic congresswomen and while democrats have based their most recent impeachment effort entirely on president trump s july 25th phone call with ukrainian president
