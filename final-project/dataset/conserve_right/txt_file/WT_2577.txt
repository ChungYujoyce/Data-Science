istration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion health care has been the number one topic in the democratic debates president trump should take heed rising health care costs and candidate fitness for leadership will dominate the 2020 campaign medicare for all as sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren propose it would cost 3 trillion a year that s more than double what the federal government currently raises through personal and corporate taxes new levies on the wealthy would hardly raise that and like ordinary europeans working americans would get saddled with a national sales tax or much higher payroll taxes and be poorer in the bargain americans want to keep private health insurance but want costs brought under control ms warren has come up with plan b resurrecting the public option as a politically palatable transition to socialized medicine top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century ms warren would enroll all folks with incomes below 200 percent of the poverty line 51 000 for a family of four in the public plan with opt out provisions for those with employer paid insurance folks over 50 without private insurance would automatically be enrolled in medicare the rest of us could buy into the public option using what our employers currently spend on private insurance competition with private insurance has merit if ms warren believes a federal agency like the folks who designed the affordable care act website or the postal service can outperform carefirst caremark and the rest i ve got my popcorn ready for a rerun of the hapless new york giants taking on the dallas cowboys medicare as currently structured is heavily reliant on private insurers most folks purchase add on policies for physician hospitals and other expenses part d prescription drug premiums are collected and benefits administered through private managers as well still ms warren s
