aftermath of the deadly coronavirus pandemic authorities announced in a brief statement this week that ren zhiqiang a property tycoon who is close to vice president wang qishan is under investigation for unspecified serious violations of law and discipline until this year mr ren a party member and princeling as the offspring of the communist elite are called was a rare public critic of mr xi one who has since 2016 avoided imprisonment or worse analysts attributed his survival to support for his views among some senior party leaders top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state in february however mr ren apparently sealed his fate by writing a letter harshly critical of mr xi s handling of the coronavirus outbreak part of a widespread albeit quiet condemnation of the president s response health researchers say china covered up early indications of the disease silenced doctors who tried to warn the public and allowed millions of people in wuhan the center of the outbreak to leave the city for the lunar new year thus spreading the disease mr ren s feb 18 letter said the crisis validated his 2016 charges that the lack of an independent press had given the government unchecked power when there is no media to represent the people and report the real situation we are only left with people losing their lives from the virus and the collective harm from the seriously ill political system as the result mr ren wrote comparing mr xi s rule to the personality cult of mao zedong and ridiculing his feb 3 speech to party leaders on the crisis standing there was not some emperor showing us his new clothes but a clown with no clothes on who was still determined to play emperor the letter read in part mr ren disappeared from public view march 12 and has not surfaced since the charge of violating the law indicates he will face some type of trial in the future analysts say mr ren speaks for xi opponents in the chinese communist party wu guoguang a former chinese official said the circulation of mr ren s letter indicates the rise of discontent among ccp elites against xi the variety of crises the xi regime has experienced and actually created especially the

challenge mr xi through institutional channels mr wu said the investigation revealed this week appears to be an effort by mr xi to suppress any voices of discontent and to deter further criticism but mr xi faces opposition from party elites who are seeking a return to the reforms of former leader deng xiaoping deng blocked radicals in the party after mao s death and put china on the path of economic reform while retaining the communist system andrew nathan a china expert at columbia university said domestic opposition to mr xi is present but there are no signs of high level dissension against him lots of people at lower levels in the party are disgruntled but as far as i can tell xi has surrounded himself with loyalists at the higher levels he said mr nathan compared the situation to the limited opposition to president trump within the republican party xi is delivering for the ccp like trump is delivering for the republicans mr xi has ruled since 2012 with an iron fist and used a nationwide anti corruption campaign to crack down on perceived rivals hundreds of party officials including several in the most senior ranks of the party and the people s liberation army were felled

who has been marginalized in recent months by mr xi back in 2016 mr wang s discipline inspection commission issued a statement supporting mr ren pointedly noting that mr xi himself once suggested that it was better for a single man to challenge conventional wisdom by speaking out than for a thousand people to nod their head
