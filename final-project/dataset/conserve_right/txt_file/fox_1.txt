after militants set off an explosion in the mosque then gunned down worshipers as they fled no group has claimed responsibility meanwhile here in washington president trump meets with congressional leaders tuesday to push for tax reform and try to avoid a government shutdown in less than two weeks but the big story is a series of sexual harassment claims rocking capitol hill and beyond chief congressional correspondent mike emanuel starts us off begin videotape mike emanuel fox news chief congressional correspondent after four woman came forward accusing minnesota senator al franken of sexual misconduct including the grabbing the bottoms of several of them franken came up with an apology on thanksgiving night quote i ve made some women feel badly and for that i am so sorry and i want to make sure that never happens again the longest serving member of congress michigan democrat john conyers has been accused of rubbing and touching former staffers and he admitted 27 000 settlement to one staffer an attorney for conyers said quote congressman conyers has no plans to resign but a female house democrat and the detroit free press said it is time for him to go rep kathleen rice d new york enough is enough at this point what i am voicing publicly is what every single private citizen is saying across america emanuel then there is the case of alabama republican senate candidate roy moore who has been accused of inappropriate behavior with teenage girls president trump defended moore noting his denial trump let me just tell you roy moore denies it that aposs all i can say he denies it and by the way he totally denies it emanuel charlie rose a powerful newsman who has covered his share of politics lost both his cbs and pbs positions quickly after revelations of inappropriate behavior with young staffers norah o donnell cbs news let me be very clear there is no excuse for this alleged behavior it is systematic and pervasive emanuel texas congressman joe barton had a scandal of his own this week when a former female lover released a naked photo of him on social media barton says he has asked the u s capitol police to investigate chris end videotape wallace mike thank you joining me now former ceo of hewlett packard carly fiorina who ran for president last year carly welcome back to fox news sunday carly fiorina former hewlett packard ceo thanks good to be with you wallace let aposs start with roy moore and the presidents evolving position on the allegations against the judge here they are begin video clip sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary the president said in his statement earlier this week that if the allegations are true then that roy moore should step aside kellyanne conway counselor to the president the incontrovertible principle is that there is no senate seat that is worth more than a child donald trump president of the united states i can tell you one thing for sure we don apost need a liberal person in there a democrat end video clip wallace what do you make of the president now siding with moore because one he says the judge denies the allegations and two because he says the judge has an opponent who s a liberal fiorina well that aposs politics isn apost it chris this is all about politics and that aposs why when politicians talk about this it doesn apost have a lot of credibility this has been going on in politics for a very long time democrats try and defend their own republicans try and defend their own it aposs a little bit like george washington warned us 200 years ago the problem with politics and political parties is they care about winning above all else donald trump cares about a vote in the senate no more no less wallace and what you think should happen to moore and what you think should happen to the democrats because as mike emanuel pointed out in this piece we got to senior democrats now senator franken and congressman conyers who were also facing their own allegations what you think should happen to these people fiorina well first of all this behavior goes on all the time it has for a long time unfortunately in politics in the workplace in athletics and when we politicize it it aposs not my team versus your team republicans and democrats alike are guilty of it i tell you the most helpful thing would be for congress to change its own process and procedures if someone wants to come forward and allege harassment or abuse in congress they must go through a mandatory 30 days of counseling mandatory mediation led by a lawyer whose express purpose is to protect the institution and then maybe if they are lucky they get a secret settlement paid for by taxpayers from the treasury that whole process is designed to protect politicians democrats and republicans alike to protect the institution and to make it next to impossible for a woman or in some cases a young boy page to come forward that ought to change that would actually help wallace what you think about these politicians to think that there aposs an allegation against somebody now in some of these cases franken has acknowledged them at some of the others have denied them including judge moore and congressman conyers do you think that should just be it they should just their career should be over fiorina you know i think in virtually all of these cases there has been corroboration of the women stories and virtually every cases not one woman who comes forward it aposs three four five six and i think what s most i think what we all need to think about but frankly particularly men need to think about and in virtually all these cases people knew people knew this was going on you can apost tell me that no one knew what was going on with roy moore and john conyers or al franken or charlie rose or roger ailes or howard weinstein people knew men knew and women knew and so while we all express outrage now and people say should they step down or should they not i think the question going forward is when are we going to stop tolerating this behavior and respecting the men who do it because all of these men have been respected despite the fact that people knew wallace yes i want to pick up i want to pick up on that because you made a comment this week that may surprise people i want to put it up on the screen you said it will only be a watershed moment if men decide to step forward you weren apost talking about the men who commit the harassment you were talking about the buddies the other people in the office why are they the key fiorina well you see women continue to step forward women continue to fight this you know we re all shocked for example by the scandal of the doctor who was abusing young gymnasts but 25 years ago there was a scandal about a coach abusing young swimmers and it all sort of disappeared and he went on to become famous in other words you go through these waves because it s gone along a long time men not most but enough abuse their positions of power in return for sex and what happens is women step up but men continue unfortunately into many instances to respect the men who were behaving this way every single one of the men who has been exposed in the last several weeks was been respected and so i think men need to decide i m not going to respect a man who disrespects women i m going to withhold my respect from him unless he respects others that will a watershed moment wallace i want to turn to your story because you wrote a troubling essay this week and i should point out that we have a link to the essay on our web page foxnewssunday com you tell your story starting almost 40 years ago as a secretary working your way up the corporate ladder were you a victim of sexual harassment what was your personal experience fiorina of course i was every woman i know was i don apost mean i ve been raped or assaulted in some of the ways these women have but what was i groped by a friend of my family of course was i propositioned of course was i introduced as a bimbo of course did i have on occasion men banging on my hotel room door and then lying about it the next morning of course this is common occurrence unfortunately and that is my point my point is not that most men are bad most men are good and respectful and many many men have helped many women myself included and all women are not victims but the perennial abuse of power by men over women has been with us for a long time and everyone knows it women know it and men know it wallace as you are working your way up the corporate ladder you talked before about men using their power to try in exchange for sex was not something that was done with you where men were in effect saying you can do better you can move faster professionally if you play ball fiorina absolutely i remember having an argument with one of my bosses i had a very attractive female colleague and he told her that she should do whatever was necessary to get the sale she confessed this to me and i went and confronted this boss not every woman feels she can confront a man but i have most often confronted men and i said you cannot give your subordinate this career advice it is unacceptable he was shocked he was shocked wallace well i want to ask you about that because most people think of you and as you present yourself here now and during the campaign head of hewlett packard strong woman take care of yourself but we re talking about at an earlier stage when you were a more vulnerable woman did these did these moments threaten you shake you i mean what was the emotional impact on you fiorina well i will tell you one story i remember sitting at a dinner with a set of colleagues we were talking about a very large contract fts2000 right here in washington d c and all of my colleagues were men that was frequently the case and i remember one particular man saying to me well you know when you get to they were an examination of contractors he said when it comes time for us to present our credentials we better hope you re not having your period you won t be able to present wow and i remember getting up and walking into the parking lot and crying in rage i felt humiliated and embarrassed and i came back to the table and didn apost say another word for the rest of the night but that night i went home and i thought no one is ever going to make me feel like that again so yes women go through all of these emotions and unfortunately many of the women who have come forward recently didn apost feel they were in a position to confront because the men had power over them the power of their career the power of their future these women when you watch them come forward they obviously feel humiliated they are embarrassed it aposs not easy women have been coming forward for decades the point of my post was to say it is men aposs turn now wallace we ve had these moments before that seem fiorina yes wallace to grab the nation aposs attention people talk about changing it you think of anita hill confronting clarence thomas during his supreme court nomination bill clinton and monica lewinsky and people say we aposve got to stop this and as you know the outrage fiorina it doesn apost stop wallace wears off it doesn t stop and the moment passes fiorina that s right wallace is this going to be any different fiorina well that was the point of my post the only way it is going to be different in my opinion is if men change their opinion about these kinds of men women have known this is going on and deal with it men have known this is going on and unfortunately too often look the other way not all men but too many men and i think the problem is that men still can respect men despite this behavior when men decide you know what i can apost respect this behavior anymore and power in and of itself is not what earns respect what earns respect his behavior and leadership and decency and respect for others wallace finally i want to ask you i want to go back to president trump because you have your own moment with him during the presidential campaign when he said this look about you look at that face would anyone vote for that here aposs how you responded in the next debate and i also want to play what president trump said this week about the harassers being exposed here it is begin video clip fiorina i think women all over this country heard very clearly what mr trump said applause trump i think she aposs got a beautiful face and i think she aposs a beautiful woman i think it aposs very very good for women and i m very happy a lot of these things are coming out i m very happy i m very happy it aposs being exposed end video clip wallace which one is the real donald trump fiorina oh you know we could endlessly analyze donald trump what i focus on always is someone aposs behavior how do they behave are they leading or are they not leading wallace and president trump fiorina well i think leaders understand that how you do things is as important as what you do leaders understand that they need to build support leaders focus on solving problems leaders serve others wallace and you seem to be saying you don apost think this president meets that test fiorina well i don apost think he has yet often enough he won apost be the first president to fail the test of leadership and he won apost be the last unfortunately politics is too rarely about leadership politics is too rarely about problem solving problem is too rarely about serving others politics is to often about my team versus your team it s become like sports and we all know how emotional and irrational sports is wallace carly thank you thanks for coming in on this holiday weekend and it aposs always good to talk with you fiorina thanks wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss the pressure to unmask the harassers on capitol hill plus what would you like to ask the panel about what should happen to congressman conyers and senator franken just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states he gives a total denial and i do have to say 40 years is a long time he aposs run eight races and this has never come up end video clip wallace president trump defending alabama senate candidate judge roy moore against allegations of sexual harassment after the president previously said moore should step aside if the allegations are true and it aposs time now for our sunday group former press secretary to vice president pence marc lotter marie harf a state department official in the obama administration catherine lucey who covers the white house for the associated press and guy benson of townhall com well catherine what can you tell us about the president aposs change of position and decision to side with moore after originally saying that if the allegations were true he should step down now saying he is denied it and besides his opponent is a liberal why did he change catherine lucey white house reporter the associated press well there aposs a couple things here and as you heard from the previous guest politics plays a role the president is concerned about his agenda should republicans lose the seat in alabama and that aposs definitely part of it he also does appear to be stressing the idea that these are old allegations and you know questioning whether they are true or not he aposs really suggesting that that might be an issue it s also interesting though that we aposve seen sort of changing responses to the president and also the president and his daughter are saying two different things ivanka trump came out with a very strong statement saying that there aposs a special place in hell for people who prey on children but the president seems to be saying that you know that he is comfortable with he does not endorse but he seems comfortable with moore wallace this week leigh corfman who said she was 14 years old when roy moore touched her inappropriately she told her story on television here aposs a clip begin video clip leigh corfman roy moore accuser he basically laid out some blankets on the floor of his living room and proceeded to seduce me end video clip wallace marc you are still close to this white house as we said you are the former press secretary for vice president pence why do you think the president changed his mind and decided to side with moore and what do you think are the chances that you know they got december 12th this special election that he ll go down and actually campaign with judge moore marc lotter former vp pence press secretary i ve seen no information and i honestly don apost think he will go down to alabama and that aposs not what i m hearing from my former colleagues inside the white house still but really what this is going to come down to the same thing that most elections do when voters go into the polls in alabama in a couple of weeks they re going to weigh these allegations they re also going to take a look at doug jones record and whether they can whether they want someone representing them in the united states senate who was pro abortion going to be an ally of chuck schumer and nancy pelosi and trying to block the president aposs agenda they will weigh those competing interests and they will cast their votes and they ll make a decision wallace but i guess my question is it seemed that they had the white house a pretty good position which is if it aposs true he should step down and stay out of it and then the president changed that and decided to get into it to the extent of saying we don apost want a liberal in the senate and these are decade old allegations lotter i think it aposs pretty clear that judge moore is not going to step down he has said that he aposs not going to end his name is going to be on the ballot whether this was a week or two ago or now so at this point it aposs in the hands of the voters of alabama and what i think you heard the president say was was that there are while these are very disturbing allegations but you also have to take a look at doug jones apos record this cannot be i know the democrats and some of the media just want to make this a referendum on roy moore but you also have another candidate in this race that you have to take a look at his record as they go into the voting booth wallace marie let aposs talk about the larger moment here because it isn apost just judge roy moore by any stretch of the imagination as we pointed out democrats al franken john conyers also stand accused news man charlie rose aposs 50 year career blew up in less than 24 hours what aposs going on here in terms of this wave of allegations of harassment and how far how sweeping do you think it will be marie harf former state department spokesperson well i think this is probably just the beginning especially here in washington we talk a lot about congress this is clearly an issue that spans industries from media to politics to sports to comedy it aposs not democratic it aposs not republican i think this is just the beginning of a cultural moment where women feel comfortable speaking out there is safety in numbers here but the question and carly fiorina brought this up i think it aposs a really important question what is the long term change in behavior here and how do we as a culture look at the different allegations they re not all the same they re all different in their own ways how do we have standards for what the appropriate response should be should they all have to resign we would probably all say no but where aposs the line these are issues that we as a culture are going to be dealing with for months to come and i really don apost want this political tribalism to get in the way of that conversation because it truly does cross i think all partisan boundaries wallace well let me pick up on this with you because as i talked about with carly we ve had these moments before i mean folks who weren apost paying attention back then and were too young when anita hill challenged clarence thomas in that hearing in the early apos90s when he was had been nominated for the supreme court it was just stopped every dinner every party and people were taking sides and everybody thought well this is it this is the tipping point it wasn apost obviously we re 25 years later it still goes on why do we think this will be any different that the outrage won apost be there and then it will dissipate harf i think we hope it will be different because in part of the breadth of the accusations you know men across the political spectrum across different industries but there are a lot of women today even republicans who say sitting in the oval office is a man who was accused by over a dozen women of sexual harassment or assault so clearly i think for a lot of women this moment feels empowering but for a lot of us it also feels like the problem is bigger than we thought the fact that it crosses so many different genres we have hoped that things will change but we have no guarantee of that and that is very frustrating to a lot of us wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and a lot of folks are upset to find out something i have to say i didn apost know which is that members of congress can settle cases with members of their staff on sex harassment in secret and at taxpayer s expense and we got something on that from donald cooley who tweeted this should their names the members of congress who have settled sex harassment cases should their names be released should they pay back the money immediately and should they be suspended dismissed like corporate america guy how do you answer him guy benson townhall com i think when people talk about during this warm it aposs hard to imagine something more swamp like than this where our elected representatives can abuse their power abuse subordinates and then secretly use a slush fund of our money to pay them off without any of the details ever being released the fact that that is the current status quo is jaw dropping i think to most taxpayers and it aposs completely unacceptable on its face that cannot continue wallace do you think you know again i guess having been in washington a long time i m always skeptical yes they re going to take a vote this week and mandatory sex harassment training for members and their staffers do you think it will go further do you think that congress will really clean up its act that aposs not a rhetorical question benson no because it aposs a self protection racket that s the whole point of this both parties know that there are people in their ranks being shielded by the status quo and it s a numbers game it aposs all about politics so they aren apost necessarily keen on this so the only way that it will happen is if the american people are angry enough in a sustained way to make sure that a bill comes to the floor and is voted on and is passed and people who vote against it are shamed because there aren apost good reasons to vote no i would view at least on the transparency minded bill wallace all right we have to take a break here we ll see you panel a little bit later when we come back the push to get tax reform done by the end of the year senator john thune joins us to discuss that and the effort to avoid a government shutdown commercial break wallace coming up senate republicans take up tax reform begin video clip sen john thune r south dakota we think that it helps to deliver meaningful assistance to the majority of americans mainly those in the middle class middle income categories who desperately need a tax cut end video clip wallace we ll ask gop senator john thune about prospects for passing it next on fox news sunday commercial break wallace president trump has promised the american people a big beautiful christmas present in the form of major tax cuts can the gop deliver or will the bill get stuck in the chimney joining us from south dakota to discuss that and much more the number three republican in the senate john thune senator you said recently you thought that president trump could be influential your word in getting roy moore to step down but as we have discussed today the president is now siding with judge moore and in fact i want to put up a tweet that the president sent this morning the last thing we need in alabama and the u s senate is a schumer pelosi puppet who is weak on crime weak on the border bad for our military and her great vets bad for our second amendment and wants to raise taxes to the sky doug jones the democratic candidate doug jones would be a disaster senator does that disappoint you where the president is now sen john thune r s d republican conference chairman well i would like to see the president chris come out and support what many of us have said and that is that roy moore it needs to step aside allow somebody else to be a write in candidate we can win that seat he is right if a democrat wins it aposs going to be a vote for the pelosi schumer agenda which is going to be against tax reform against constitutional judges against smart borders but the other alternative is if roy moore wins and he comes into the senate in january there aposs going to immediately be an ethics investigation which is going to be a cloud that he aposll be operating in and it aposs going to be a distraction for us and for our agenda so you know ultimately the decision aposs up to the people of alabama but it strikes me at least that it would be on their best interest and in the country aposs best interest and certainly the best interest of our agenda if the president would use his influence to try to get roy moore to step aside wallace so do you think the president has made a mistake in splitting with senate leaders like yourself and senator mcconnell and going with judge moore thune well i can apost you know the president obviously can speak for himself but and i think he sees the specter of a democrat holding that seat and what that might mean for his agenda but the alternative as i said isn apost good either chris and so as far as i aposm concerned the president to the degree that he wants to use his influence in this race could i think help everybody out by doing what he can to try and get roy moore to step aside which is what we believe is in the best interest again certainly of the country certainly the president aposs agenda and i would argue for the people of alabama although i like i said that aposs a decision that they they make and they don apost care a lot what washington d c thinks wallace let aposs talk about the big or a couple of big issues that are you aposre going to face on the senate floor in the next week or two the first is tax reform that should get to the full senate floor this week but it aposs in some trouble there aposs one republican senator ron johnson of wisconsin who has already said that he aposs a no vote and at least five others are on the fence is tax reform in real jeopardy in the senate thune i believe it will pass chris i think that in the end we have members who are expressing what are legitimate concerns who are have ideas about how to make the bill stronger and better and we aposre certainly open to those and we aposre going to have an open process on the floor of the united states senate where people can offer amendments those amendments can get debated and voted upon so it will be a plenty of opportunities to change the bill in the direction that some of our our senators want to see but on the other hand we need to get this accomplishment this is a goal that we aposve had for a long time the tax code in this country needs to be changed if we aposre going to be competitive in the global marketplace our businesses are not competitive today if we want to get the economy growing at a faster rate creating better paying jobs raising wages in this country we need to get this tax bill across the finish line and it also our important goal in this is to deliver tax relief to middle income families and the bill that we reported out of the senate finance committee last week and that will be on the floor this week does that and so these are all things that our members are for i think in the end we aposll get the votes but it aposs a process and a legislative process it takes time to move it across the finish line but i think we aposll get a bill to the president wallace i want to talk about one of the concerns that have several of those senators that we just showed of the half dozen senators are concerned about and that is that the official estimate is that the senate tax bill as it now stands will add 1 4 trillion to the debt over the next decade it would be even more but as a budget gimmick some personal tax cuts expire in 2025 you aposve made it clear you want to see those cuts made permanent but if they are that means the debt will go up even more more than 2 trillion price tag for these tax cuts as a fiscal conservative senator are you ok with that a tax cut that adds 2 trillion to the national debt thune well look chris the thing that you have to remember about this and our members all know this all the senators voted for the budget that allowed us to move this tax bill through the senate finance committee and we believe that with a reasonable amount a small modest amount of economic growth that number gets completely wiped out all you have to do is get four tenths of 1 percent of additional gdp and remember you know the congressional budget office the official scorekeeper says that we aposre only going to grow the economy at about 1 8 to 1 9 percent for the course over the course of the next ten years we think we can do much better than that that should not be the status quo we should not settle for 2 percent growth in this economy smart tax policy we think can unleash this economy generate much higher economic growth consistent with historical standards which have been the 3 to 3 5 percent range but even if we get up to 2 2 or 2 3 we cover the cost of this bill so our senators as they look at this are going to be saying ok what does this due to growth in the economy is this a pro growth tax bill will these policies generate faster growth and higher paying jobs and more government revenue and in the end we believe that it will wallace one of the other things that congress has to do is you aposve got to fund the government which runs out of money on december 8th will you avoid a shutdown and before december 8th are you going to pass a long term spending bill that keeps the government solvent all the way to the end of the fiscal year next september or do you think you aposre going to end up just passing one or two week extension to kick the can down the road again thune well we need to pass a long term spending bill obviously and the legislative process the negotiator that will go on between the white house and democrats in congress and our leadership in congress sometimes you need to do a short term extension but ultimately we need to do a bill that funds the government through the end of the next fiscal year and that addresses the important priorities that we need to address we aposve got some disaster assistance for some of these areas of the country that have been affected by the weather this last year the hurricanes and also some other things that need to be done in the year end bill but we shouldn apost have a there shouldn apost be any discussion about shutting down the government we can make this thing work we just need to get people at the table negotiate it i think the president aposs bringing the leadership in the house and the senate to his office later this week to do that wallace well let aposs talk about one key issue because the democrats are saying if you want and you need their votes you can apost do this through a budget reconciliation with just 51 votes so you aposre going to need the democrats onboard and they aposre saying the price is that you aposve got to have a daca fix that you have to find a way to protect the so called dreamers as part of this spending compromise is that something that republicans like yourself are willing to accept thune i don apost i don apost think that ought to be in this bill this bill ought to be about funding the government daca is a big issue immigration is a big issue there aposs a lot of sympathy for assisting those you know young men and women who were in this country through no fault of their own who are here illegally through no fault of their own at the same time doing something about border security we think those issues need to be coupled but that aposs a big issue that is a consequential legislative issue that needs to be dealt with but it shouldn apost be dealt within in the context of a year end spending bill and the democrats using it trying to use leverage to as a you know to shut down the government that aposs not how this ought to be resolved let aposs do the spending issue we aposll negotiate that with the democrats the daca issue and border security need to be negotiated separately hopefully sometime next year wallace all right i want to deal finally with an only in washington situation is that we now have an agency here in the nation aposs capital with two dueling directors and folks may not have been following this over the holiday weekend the consumer financial protection bureau was created as part of dodd frank to oversee companies that lend to consumers but republicans have opposed it from the start the director quit on friday and named his chief of staff this is a democratic director holdover from the obama administration leandra english to be the acting director but the president named budget chief mick mulvaney to run cfpb question when the agency returns to work tomorrow who aposs in charge thune i think mick mulvaney will be in charge and i think very much it sounds like now the justice department has come out in support of the president aposs position on this ultimately this may end up in court but the cfpb was created as an agency chris in the first place that had very little accountability very little transparency really no oversight to congress and it aposs an agency that needs to be reformed so i expect that mick mulvaney will be on the job and he aposll be calling the shots over there wallace but you know there is as you well know there are competing interest here because yes you aposre right the justice department says the president has the right to put mulvaney in the job on the other hand under dodd frank the way the law is written is the deputy director in terms of the vacancy becomes an acting director until the president nominates somebody who aposs confirmed by the senate is this something that you think that congress may have to get involved with to try to sort out because if we aposre talking about a court case this could take a long time thune well it could and the best thing congress can do is the president make a permanent nomination and we aposll process it as quickly as we can in the senate and get somebody installed as soon as possible that ultimately is the best way to resolve this but in the meantime the president has made this appointment i suspect maybe that it gets litigated that it ends up in court but i think for the foreseeable future at least my expectation is that mick mulvaney will be in that job but i hope in the end it results in in the reform to that agency which has essentially very little accountability to the congress or anybody else wallace senator thune thank you thanks for your time and we aposll be following all the action in the senate this week thank you sir thune thanks chris great to be with you wallace up next we aposll bring back our sunday panel to weigh in on robert mueller aposs investigation as former national security advisor mike flynn cuts ties with the president aposs lawyers does that mean flynn is now cooperating with the special counsel commercial break begin video clip trump this man has served for many years he aposs a general he aposs a in my opinion a very good person end video clip wallace president trump praising his former national security advisor general michael flynn even though he fired flynn after just 24 days on the job and we aposre back now with the panel well marc the president aposs lawyers say they aposre not worried about flynn apparently dealing with the special counsel because they say he has no information no evidence that would incriminate the president are your former colleagues in the white house really that confident marc lotter former vp pence press secretary i think they are i mean what we aposre looking at now is most likely according to what the president aposs lawyer says another example like with manafort and gates where any kind of special counsel action might be related to outside business dealings that would be separate from the campaign and not necessarily tied to anything that was directly involved with the campaign wallace but what about the possibility that these guys are in trouble flynn and manafort i mean they face federal indictments and they flip lotter well there has to be information to flip on and as the president has said on multiple occasions and there aposs still been no credible evidence showing any kind of collusion with the russians and the trump campaign so these are probably just issues relating to general flynn and his outside business dealings and not directly related to the campaign wallace catherine from your very different vantage point in the white house press room what aposs your sense of the white house are they really that unconcerned about the developments this week involving general flynn catherine lucey associated press well from some of the folks inside that i aposve talked to i have heard some of what marc is saying that people feel like this isn apost raising anxiety levels that there is a sense that flynn has to make a make make his own choices that it doesn apost necessarily blow back on the president but there aposs also a reality that this white house is dealing with the cloud of an investigation that it aposs been there you know for months there aposs no sense that it aposs ending anytime soon and it aposs not clear you know if and when another shoe drops and whether flynn plays a part in that wallace guy your thoughts about the developments this week guy benson fox news correspondent well i think the point is the only reason there would be blood pressure rising or indigestion at 1600 pennsylvania avenue as if they know flynn has something to give mueller if this is flynn trying to save himself or his son or from certain charges the only way that this becomes a real political problem for the president is if he aposs got the goods on someone very high up in the administration if he doesn apost then i don apost think this becomes this doesn apost metastasize as far as it might if he if he does have that stuff then obviously it aposs you know it aposs a four alarm fire wallace i want to turn to north korea because we saw a remarkable video this week that shows just how brutal the kim regime is let aposs put it up a north korean soldier tries to escape by jeep over the border into south korea as you aposll see his vehicle gets stuck and he starts running that aposs him starting to run and north korean soldiers fire dozens of shots at him he was hit apparently five times this is infrared video that shows a south korean soldier grabbing him and pulling him to safety away from the dmz that soldier now recovering all of this as president trump put north korea back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism but secretary of state tillerson admitted that there are questions as to how much that will actually accomplish here he is begin video clip rex tillerson secretary of state the practical effects may be limited but we hope that we aposre closing off a few loopholes with this end video clip wallace marie your reaction to the video and your reaction to what the president did this week in putting north korea back on the state sponsor of terrorism marie harf fox news contributor well i think the video is a reminder of the length people are going to to escape north korea and the brutality of this regime we know that but seeing it on video i think is stunning for all of us in watching this video secretary tillerson is right the state sponsor of terrorism designation is mostly at this point symbolic because we have so many sanctions on north korea already what i aposm really looking for are tangible results coming out of the president aposs long trip to asia that he went on recently north korea was at the top of the agenda with china with japan with south korea those conversations could bear more fruit than just this designation that probably won apost do anything in practice we haven apost seen a lot coming out from that trip yet in terms of more pressure on north korea we may but we haven apost yet china still holds many of the cards and russia has stepped up where china has pulled back russia has stepped up to help north koreans and i hope the administration is also raising this issue with moscow too wallace i want to ask you a question that president trump asked which is why didn apost president obama why didn apost the state department that you worked for even if it was only symbolic put north korea back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism years ago harf well we had a variety of ways to put pressure on north korea with sanctions both our sanctions and u n sanctions we got incredibly tough u n sanctions passed on north korea the state sponsor of terrorism list really doesn apost do us whole lot it may send a signal that you aposre trying to be tough but unless you back that up with sanctions which we haven apost actually seen a lot of since the designation this week we haven apost seen them use it to do anything more they just talk about it then really the proof is in the pudding so this designation is not going to fundamentally or at all change north korea aposs calculation probably we should focus on action not on putting people on lists and i want to see more action from his administration and some other countries like china wallace do you like being lectured by the obama administration on taking action on north korea harf no we don apost lecture each other lotter we don apost lecture each other but i mean this is a this is a very important step it aposs hard for the united states government to ask its allies to do more when we don apost take a very simple step of putting them back on the terror list and we have seen concrete examples there was a report this week that in october china did not import any coal or key minerals from north korea and exported zero diesel and gasoline to north korea so we aposre seeing our partners step up this is a very simple step the president said he was going to name our enemies and go after them and so what you aposre seeing is the president saying that the era of apology tours and hugging our enemies is over wallace marie harf i didn apost hug any enemies i don apost know what you aposre talking about no look i think the rhetoric is fine the question is will it have any practical impact and all of these things we aposve seen from the administration from other countries since president trump took office north korea hasn apost changed its behavior so what will finally get it to is it china cracking down is it other countries there aposs no magic solution right but the fundamental truth is north korea hasn apost changed yet and we need them to wallace let me ask a different aspect of this guy and that is the fact that the kim regime has not tested a missile we haven apost really noticed it because we don apost notice silence since september why poke the bear right now benson well i think the trump administration is trying to delineate their approach versus or from what the obama administration pursued with the strategic patients i would also point out that the bush administration george w bush administration took north korea off this list in 2008 as a carrot in negotiations over denuclearization harf yes benson that has not gone well why keep that concession on the table take it back they haven apost earned it they don apost deserve it it aposs the right move to re impose this because their conduct has not approved it all it aposs gotten worse wallace fifteen seconds catherine lucey i think also the president really wanted to show sort of momentum coming off of his trip so even if this is something of a symbolic gesture he really wants to show that he is continuing to do things as he comes out of this lengthy asia tour wallace thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week once again i dance with the turkeys commercial break wallace here aposs a holiday riddle we ask every thanksgiving who founded a huge tech company created a successful cosmetic business and now raises turkeys like the native americans did once again here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape sandy lerner ayrshire farm farm with the land farm with the seasons know your soil know your rainfall know your know your weather know your animals wallace voice over sandy lerner is talking about sustainable farming raising livestock and growing vegetables without the chemicals that are so common in what she calls factory farming just days before thanksgiving she took me out to see and yes to dance with her 1 300 turkeys heritage breeds that trace back to the indians lerner come on raise your arms gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble wallace lerner is mistress of ayrshire farm 800 acres in upperville virginia but as interesting as her business is how she got her she grew up on a farm in california making enough from raising cattle to send herself to college lerner what i learned was to love work i aposm really happiest when i aposm engaged and working and thinking and striving wallace she got into computers in 1984 she and her then husband started cisco systems that found a way to link networks of computers the foundation of the internet but six years later venture capital people were running cisco wallace on camera how do you get fired from a company that you started lerner we just basically got taken to the cleaners and part of that was if you don apost have an employment contract i got fired by the same guy who fired steve jobs wallace voice over lerner had a second act she started a cosmetics company called urban decay with eddy colors for women like her and in 1996 she bought ayrshire farm lerner it aposs historically been people who had disposable income will make strides in farming look at george washington or look at thomas jefferson you aposre such a pretty girl pretty is as pretty does wallace she raises shires war horses that go back centuries scotch island cattle and those turkeys which she says taste better because of the lives they lead wallace on camera how much is an ayrshire turkey cost as compared to what i get in a grocery store lerner well our turkeys are expensive they aposre between i think they aposre running this year about 160 200 wallace voice over at those prices there are questions about how to make this kind of farming profitable but while lerner is determined to run a sound business it aposs not just about the bottom line there aposs a 40 room mansion on the farm wallace on camera what aposs it like living there lerner i don apost know wallace what do you mean lerner i live in the log cabin and i love it wallace do you think you aposre a bit eccentric lerner i am now that i aposm rich i used to just be weird wallace and so just days before thanksgiving sandy lerner and i danced with the turkeys she grew up on a family farm and she wants to see those values live on lerner i aposm a cowgirl i can tell what cows are thinking it aposs
