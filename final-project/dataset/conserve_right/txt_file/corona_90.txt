the globe the domestic case count of covid 19 neared 1 million monday and the death toll exceeded 55 000 though the white house says the broad picture is beginning to improve things are moving along really a horrible situation that we ve been confronted with but they re moving along mr trump said mr trump pointed to corporate efforts as a sign of progress in the fight to expand testing so that states aren t flying blind as they tell residents it s ok to go back to work get a haircut or see a movie for instance cvs president and ceo larry merlo said it is expanding its testing operation which checks 35 000 per week at the start of may the company will start testing operations in up to 1 000 pharmacies using its drive thrus and parking lots adm brett giroir the u s testing czar said

this includes a 122 testing increase in michigan 124 increase in maryland and many other locations are right in that vicinity the administration touted its efforts and goals as it faces criticism for early stumbles in developing a covid 19 diagnostic tests and its failure to meet prior benchmarks for expanded testing vice president mike pence said the gap between promises and results was due in part to the gulf between having the tests and being able to process them the u s has performed 5 4 million tests or far more than any other nation mr trump boasted monday mr trump s coronavirus task force outlined its ambitions as governors continued to roll out their plans for gradually getting life back to normal texas gov greg abbott said he will let his stay at home order expire friday without restrictions that means restaurants retailers libraries and movie theaters are allowed to operate at 25 capacity as of may 1 places that host non contact sports like tennis can also resume operations salons bars and gyms were not among the businesses told they can reopen ohio gov mike dewine said manufacturing distribution construction companies and general business offices can reopen starting may 4 with retailers to follow may 12 the reopening businesses will have to practice social distancing measures such as ensuring at least six feet of distance between people and installing barriers if that s not possible employees must wear face coverings while they re working we ve gotten this far we ve got a ways to go these are first steps said mr dewine a republican a lot of moving parts a lot of things going on this is the beginning in louisiana however gov john bel edwards said monday he had no choice but to extend his stay at home order until may 15 when he promised a phased re opening would begin mr edwards a democrat said he decided to continue the state s economic shutdown after speaking with the white house he left open the possibility of extending shelter in place orders that are shattering the state s economy past may 15 while this is not the announcement i want to make i am hopeful and all of louisiana should be hopeful that we will enter into the next phase of reopening soon in mid may mr edwards said i am anxious to get all areas of our economy reopened but if we accelerate too quickly we may have to slam on the brakes that will be bad for public health and for businesses bad for our people and bad for our state new jersey gov phil murphy said his stay at home order will remain in place until further notice though he s coloring in the lines of a plan to reopen it s unclear when the state can return to normal yet the announcement in one of the country s hardest hit states is notable we will move as quickly as we can but as safely as we must mr murphy said the governor reported positive trends in terms of hospitalizations but said the curve needs to stay down before moving further along in the process over 6 000 people have died of covid 19 in new jersey the nation s second worst toll after new york where the virus has killed over 22 000 new york gov andrew cuomo on monday said 337 people in the state had died in the previous 24 hours his stay at home restrictions last until at least may 15 on monday he said he would likely extend them for at least some parts of new york beyond that date while new york city has an incredibly high number of cases higher than some countries globally upstate new york is a very different reality the governor said in some parts of the state some regions you could make the case we should un pause on may 15 mr cuomo said but you have to be smart about it likewise florida gov ron desantis said it might make more sense to approach things region by region since areas like miami dade county are significantly harder hit than other parts of the state for florida it really is a different ballgame when you compare southeast florida to the rest he said i think pretty much the rest of the state has really handled this very well there s never been even close to a stress on capacity of health care resources mr desantis a key trump ally vowed to be methodical and data driven moving forward i think that people want to have confidence that things are going in a good direction he said out west nevada and colorado said they are joining a west coast pact with california oregon and washington that seeks to coordinate plans on opening the region s economies alaska colorado georgia minnesota mississippi montana oklahoma south carolina and tennessee have announced a partial reopening of some kind while a handful of states particularly rural ones never really shut down their economies at all according to a new york times analysis economist stephen moore who is advising the white house on reopening plans on monday described the coronavirus as an urban disease that s not anything that s a big surprise every pandemic hits urban areas mr moore said on fox business network so you have about half of the counties in the united states that were hardly affected at all in some cases no cases whatsoever mr moore said moving forward on reopening plans now should get the u s to recovery by the end of the summer while a vaccine probably won t be widely available until 2021 federal and state leaders hope to see effective drug treatment for the virus later this year there are myriad clinical trials of different therapies across the country while the administration does not comment on specific products an existing antiviral drug from gilead sciences known as remdesivir is widely considered a contender i think remdesivir is still a leading candidate said dr michael mina assistant professor of epidemiology at harvard t h chan school of public health it s a true anti viral versus something like hydroxychloroquine hydroxychloroquine is typically used to treat malaria it was pushed hard by mr trump earlier this month though hasn t touted it much of late as studies raise questions about its effectiveness and possible side effects on the heart dr mina said monoclonal antibodies lab produced molecules that can enhance the body s immune system might be another promising path i personally think monoclonals are a good way to go he said our bodies know how to handle them james varney contributed to this report copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for
