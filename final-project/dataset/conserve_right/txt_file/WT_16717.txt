apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington s trade war threats to china have only strengthened beijing s high tech ambitions but a culture of bureaucracy could easily smother efforts to become the world s innovation hub according to a leading china opinion maker on saturday and sunday in beijing secretary of commerce wilbur ross gathered with chinese vice premier liu he for trade talks that resulted in china warning the u s that anything negotiated will be void if washington sets up new sanctions sunday s lead op ed in the south china morning post scmp hong kong s leading english language newspaper notes that beijing reacted cooly to what it views as president trump s brinkmanship negotiation tactics driven by short term political considerations to get tough on china by threatening hefty steel tariffs in the name of u s national security top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots but wang xiangwei the scmp s former editor in chief now based in beijing argues a deeper and more specific game is actually playing out in short curbing china s technological advances seems to have become washington s top priority he writes mr xiangwei noted that president xi jinping last week delivered a keynote speech to china s top scientists and implored them to lead the world in science and tech development implicit in the message that beijing would be the focal point in planning financing and promoting the effort mr xi it was pointed out enjoys citing momentous projects like china s first atomic bomb h bomb and its satellites which were developed in very difficult circumstances in the 1960s and early 1970s all with heavy government oversight but china s more recent tech successes including leading internet and telecom firms like baidu huawei and alibaba worked because the government basically left them alone mr xiangwei suggests that washington s trade war threats are also efforts to wean china s massive state funding and subsidies off its hi tech ambitions but these could backfire in the short term and actually embolden beijing to double down on its pursuit of hi tech developments which appears to be happening in the long term however china s desire to intervene its rigid education and its compartmentalized management of tech research are stunning blocks to innovation there is also the matter of dedicating precious public funds to risky innovation projects many of which fail in the past few years china has consistently made the most patent applications in the world mr xiangwei writes but china s path to becoming a world leader in innovation is still an uphill battle china s manufacturing sector as a whole would need 30 years
