apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia is emerging as a new strategic nuclear threat to the united states a senior member of the house committee on armed services revealed on wednesday on the nuclear deterrence front we likely have more cause for concern today than at any point since the soviet union collapsed with a swift kick from the policies of ronald reagan said rep mike rogers alabama republican and chairman of the subcommittee on strategic forces unlike germany and japan which were converted from enemies to friends after world war ii russia has not followed a similar model see also u s cedes arctic to russia we re not even in the same league says coast guard chief instead it gave us russian president vladimir putin and his soviet style regime mr rogers said in a speech to an air force association breakfast the result according to the subcommittee chairman has been a series of threatening russian actions including overt and direct nuclear threats to neighbors and nato states see also thailand nears 1 billion submarine deal with china despite exclusive u s military training illegal seizure and annexation of ukraine s crimea and continued aggression in eastern ukraine violation of the 1987 intermediate range nuclear forces inf treaty and eight other arms control treaties and agreement breaches open discussion in moscow of a new military doctrine that views nato as a military threat and the use nuclear weapons early in any conflict involving nato or the united states mr rogers said the emergence of a threatening russia took place despite or perhaps as a result of the obama administration s conciliatory reset policy some of us have been saying the reset was flawed from the beginning because it failed to recognize the reality of putin s russia he said now this blindness has become dangerous the failed reset is a main legacy of former secretary of state hillary rodham clinton who will likely face criticism for it during her democratic campaign for the presidency the russia threat has led to a more united nato which is reviewing defense postures and policies to deal with moscow including bolstering nuclear deterrence in the region mr rogers said the administration so far has not responded to russia s violation of the inf treaty identified as a new cruise missile the chairman revealed however that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has conducted an assessment of potential u s military responses to the inf violation he did not elaborate on what those responses include and said they seem to be tied up in the white house u s nuclear capabilities have been kept at 1990s levels and need to be modernized mr rogers said as other nations russia china pakistan north korea continue to research and deploy new nuclear capabilities i ask will our 1990 nuclear deterrent still be credible in 2040 mr rogers said mr rogers also called for extending u s missile defenses to space something opposed by the administration as a weaponization of space so while we sat back and tried to show leadership on this issue russia and china weaponized it for us he said for less than our current systems we could deploy a missile defense system in space that s more capable than what we have in today s ground based missile defense system dempsey iran killed 500 u s troops as the obama administration seeks to normalize relations with iran by concluding a nuclear deal with tehran it was revealed this week that the islamic republic has killed about 500 american soldiers via armor piercing bombs during testimony tuesday before the senate committee on armed services army gen martin e dempsey chairman of the joint chiefs of staff revealed the u s deaths at the hands of iranians under questioning from sen tom cotton i think the islamic state is a grave and throwing threat but until they develop their own ballistic missile program and until they have thousands of centrifuges and tons of uranium i believe the islamic republic will be a graver threat than the islamic state that is the islamic republic of iran said mr cotton arkansas republican the senator said iran remains an anti american state sponsor of international terrorism that has killed hundreds of americans from lebanon to iraq to afghanistan hundreds of americans died and probably thousands were wounded or suspected of being wounded mr cotton said what should we say to their families the families who lost soldiers at the hands of iranian militias or iranian roadside bombs once we reach a deal that s going to give iran tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief and international legitimacy without them changing their behavior gen dempsey said the estimated number of soldiers killed by the iranians is about 500 he then voiced concern about the iranian threat that exists despite the push by the administration for a nuclear deal in vienna in response to mr cotton s question gen dempsey said he has told the families of the soldiers who were casualties of iranian attacks that solving the nuclear issue diplomatically is a positive outcome but make no mistake about it there are at least five other malign activities in which iran is engaged that cause me grave security concerns and won t take our eye off those five and you know what they are ballistic missiles sea based mines cyber activities arms trafficking and surrogates and proxies china meltdown continues as socialist ruled greece moves toward bankruptcy and european states seek to figure out what to do an even greater economic crisis appears to be brewing in china reports from asia indicate the chinese stock market is continuing to plummet losing an estimated 3 2 trillion in the past three weeks and there s no signs the crash is ending the vaunted socialist with chinese characteristics economy so far has not responded to government intervention efforts to stem the slide that s included an investment of 19 3 billion into the economy from the large state run enterprises treasury secretary jack lew on wednesday commented on china s economic woes at the brookings institution the united states has little to fear from the meltdown because china s markets are still pretty much separated from u s and world markets he said i think the concern it is a real one is what does it mean about long term growth in china mr lew asked the treasury chief said there are two pieces to the potential impact of the stock market decline one is how chinese communist leaders respond and the second is what impact will the crash have on the core condition of the chinese economy i think the first is quite critical he said adding that over the past two years the chinese have shown a quite determined commitment move toward allowing more market forces to work the question isn t their commitment to the goal the question is the pace at which they implemented it and do they do it fast enough for it to be effective mr lew said i hope this is not something that slows down the pace of reform china is moving from a heavily centralized industrial economy to a more market and consumer oriented system he said if the reaction is to put the brakes on reforms that will slow that process mr lew said wang feng ceo and founder of hedge fund firm alpha squared capital co and a former wall street trader told reuters that unlike other stock markets china s market is dominated by retail investors who make up 85 percent of china trade and that is making the volatility worse it s a stampede and the problem of the market is that all the players move in the same direction and are too emotional mr wang said contact bill g
