 it s finally over obama hasn t gotten any bump yet but i ve expected that to change now i m not so sure for reasons discussed below either way team romney is ready to carpet bomb battleground states with ads starting friday the last two hours of tonight s proceedings were the biden and obama show so let s dig in vice president biden like bill clinton biden went too long he veered back and forth from near whispering to stentorian shouting after offering a loving tribute to his family and accepting the vice presidential nomination biden praised his running mate and attacked mitt romney in similarly exaggerated terms he said the obama biden ticket is on a mission to move america from doubt and downturn to promise and prosperity whether he realized it or not this was a tacit admission that we re still in the former stage of that equation after four years of this administration s stewardship things were really bad so give us more time he essentially pleaded a recurring theme of the convention but he also made this stark pronouncement about the us economy america has turned the corner this line was greeted with tepid applause he said obama has created 4 5 million jobs over 29 months a paltry figure that still isn t even quite correct he thundered that america is not in decline but many americans are beginning to fear he s wrong about that connecting with the folks biden recycled a debunked anecdote about the battle barack obama s mother waged with her insurance company as she battled cancer the word literally did not appear in biden s prepared remarks but he literally ad libbed it eight times often using it incorrectly he er literally lied about medicare but that s par for the course he regurgitated tired misleading equal pay rhetoric and he went to his favorite line about bin laden being dead and gm being alive under president obama gm still owes us tens of billions of dollars but those statements are both true do they justify four more years of everything else president obama i m genuinely surprised obama s speech was remarkably almost shockingly flat and mediocre we ve heard iterations of that speech many times before but this one felt phoned in from start to finish the audience was ready to explode but they never really had the chance i kept waiting for it to pick up but it never did this hall was much louder and more engaged during president clinton s address last night the president again talked about hope and how times have changed he essentially urged voters to stay the course even as a large majority of voters believe our current course is badly awry he served up a series of warmed over promises even as scores of already issued ones lie unfulfilled we were told he d discuss entitlement reform with some specificity he did not he took a few shots at republicans but most of those seemed dialed back he battled against the same straw men he s been knocking down for years to little effect one of the only new passages i heard was his discussion of scapegoating in which he equated people frustrated with federal mismanagement and waste with rank bigots we don t think government can solve all our problems but we don t think that government is the source of all our problems any more than are welfare recipients or corporations or unions or immigrants or gays or any other group we re told to blame for our troubles because we understand that this democracy is ours this was bitter clingers redux offered in defense of sprawling government almost entirely absent from the speech was significant mention of the jobs crisis voters top concern he also mostly ignored obamacare and the stimulus his two signature first term agenda items where was his plan for another term more teachers increased energy independence and green jobs that s it i eagerly anticipate the inevitable rnc video comparing this speech with obama s refrains from 2008 it ll underscore the more of the sameness that filled this building tonight and dropped with a thud the most memorable line for me was i m no longer just a candidate i m the president you could have fooled many of us mr president given your constant campaigning and fundraising honestly i don t even have the vigor to rebut some of obama s more egregious distortions because i ve done it before ahem literally press row is morose reporters are trying to reassure each other that the speech wasn t that bad msnbc is subdued on cnn james carville allows that this wasn t obama s best speech on fox charles krauthammer calls the speech the emptiest in recent memory a woman in the concourse half shouts fired up no one replies this election will be hard fought and close no doubt obama could very well win but tonight was a major swing and a miss for a guy known for his homerun speeches does anyone who watched that speech have a clear idea of what s next or what his plan is to achieve this mysterious forward vision meanwhile 23 million americans are out of work or underemployed the debt is at 16 trillion and counting poverty and food stamp usage are at all time highs middle class incomes are down obama wants four more years but why this now looms even larger cardinal dolan the catholic archbishop spoke truth to power in more ways than one in his closing benediciton he lifted up the unborn and urged respect for religious liberty he emphasized the lines in god we trust and god bless america before a crowd that objected to his inclusion in their platform just yesterday he was essentially repudiating democrats policies at their own convention putting a surreal cap on a surreal evening parting thought was biden s the more effective speech tonight alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall
