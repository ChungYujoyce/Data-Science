el flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic china s entry into the world trade organization ratified 10 years ago this week was supposed to make the world s emerging economic superpower a better international corporate citizen but beijing has proven to be less than an ideal team player during the past decade u s officials and trade experts say china has engaged in a consistent pattern of avoiding delaying and directly violating its wto commitments said alan h price partner and chairman of the international trade practice at wiley rein llp said at a congressional hearing this week looking at china s post wto record china s systematic failure to comply with its wto obligations has adversely impacted the u s and global economies and undermines the legitimacy of the international rules based trading system he said top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots critics say china has taken advantage of its wto membership to expand exports while keeping its own markets less than fully open in the past decade china has become the worlds largest exporter and the second largest importer after the united states two way trade for goods surged to nearly 3 trillion last year chinese officials have hailed the 10 year anniversary as a major success story the government owned china daily noted that over the past decade china has become the world s top investment destination and 54 chinese companies are in the global fortune 500 up from 12 in 2001 i have to say that exceeds far more what we expected at that time especially the size of china s economy the size of china s exports and imports and the market expansion of some of the industries like cars from 2 million to 18 million within 10 years long yongtu chief negotiator of chinas accession to the wto told the newspaper ten years is a long minute in china s millennia long history noted pascal lamy the frenchman who serves as wto director general and yet these 10 years have witnessed an unprecedented transformation of china s economy and society despite many predictions made at the time angry trade battles over beijing s currency policies its subsidies for favored export sectors and its enforcement of intellectual property rights have not gone away china remains the biggest target for complaints within the wto regarding dumping and other trade distorting practices sen sherrod brown ohio democrat said chinese officials have effectively gamed the system he accused the country of intellectual property theft subsidies for chinese exports and hoarding u s debt these violations not only show chinas lack of respect for the rule of law he said they cost dearly in lost american jobs and a stalled economic recovery in the 2001 debate over china s wto application backers said membership would force china s economy large swaths of which remain under the direct control of the government to adopt international norms and practices they said the move would also help level the playing field as u s markets were far more open to chinese imports china at the time agreed to binding obligations to reduce trade barriers including provisions on government subsidies treatment of state owned enterprises various import and export restrictions and nondiscrimination against foreign entities but mr price said performance has fallen short of the promises while china has made some progress toward achieving some of its wto commitments many of its obligations remain unfulfilled and in a number of respects the chinese government is moving further away from compliance mr price said in fact china is increasingly manipulating the wto system exploiting loopholes and working around existing rules in violation of the spirit if not the letter of the wto agreements china fooled everyone he said including former president bill clinton who at the time claimed the deal creates a win win for both countries many expected that china s wto entry would lead to the opening of chinese markets to foreign products and investment mr price said unfortunately because china has substantially failed to comply with many of the commitments it made upon acceding to the wto most of these anticipated benefits for the united states have not been realized the steel industry which is eight times larger in china than in the u s is a prime example as of 2009 95 percent of steel producers in china were subject to some government ownership he said mr price pointed to 52 billion in subsidies that were granted to steel producers including 17 3 billion in preferential loans and directed credit 18 6 billion in equity infusions and debt to equity swaps 5 1 billion in land use discounts 1 3 billion in government mandated mergers and 258 6 million in direct cash grants these massive government subsidies have helped to create the worlds largest steel industry and explain why chinas steel exports particularly exports to the united states have increased significantly during the past decade mr price said over the past decade chinese steel production has increased 350 percent while it has decreased 10 percent in the rest of the world mr price added the growth of the chinese steel industry cannot be explained by market forces he said rather its tremendous growth has been a result of massive government support for and intervention in its steel producing state enterprises con
