capital of pierre keep her out of national politics or off president donald trump s radar the 48 year old republican had a tv studio with live hookup capability installed in the governor s office she

now noem s pursuit of the spotlight comes with much higher stakes while many other governors have broken from trump on the need for stay at home orders to curb the spread of coronavirus and on when to restart the economy noem has tracked close to the president she declined to impose broad restrictions on business and public activity resisting calls from doctors and when trump touted a malaria drug as a potential remedy for the disease she was among the first to launch a trial of the drug despite no proof of its effectiveness that s earned her praise from conservative activists and the attention of the president who last week announced plans to visit the state for an independence day celebration at mount rushmore complete with once banned fireworks the white house sees her as someone trying to push back against the grain said charlie kirk a conservative activist and close trump ally that s hero status in the conservative movement but it s also drawn criticism even from republicans in her solidly red state who say she s been slow to lead the response and seems focused on climbing the political ladder they worry along with health experts that the fallout from her decisions hasn t yet been felt the state s virus caseload isn t expected to peak until june no governor has faced this enormous a test before but this is the kind of challenge they will be judged on said gail gitcho a republican strategist and former communications director for the republican governors association for noem s national profile gitcho added it becomes her leadership resume for future office throughout the coronavirus pandemic noem has stuck to a hands off approach refusing to order businesses to close and rejecting calls for sweeping stay at home orders she s held her ground even as mayors and doctors including the state s largest medical association called for stricter measures noem argued that would only delay the peak of infections and extend disruption of daily life she invoked the state ethos of individualism and said she trusted south dakotans to be responsible our states are very diverse very different noem said tuesday comparing her approach to governors in populous east

county that includes sioux falls the state s largest city has a per capita infection rate 15 lower than manhattan s although the rate of deaths is much lower according to data compiled by johns hopkins university i did get kind of ridiculed by the media for telling people in my press conferences if you re scared and you re fearful to stay home noem told kirk during a podcast recorded last week it s not just the media who have questioned her approach fellow republican paul tenhaken the mayor of sioux falls said she was not doing enough to stop a spike in infections after an outbreak at a smithfield pork processing plant eventually sickened 853 employees including two who died noem ultimately joined tenhaken in asking smithfield to temporarily close the plant despite that noem tends to dig in when challenged most famously she stood by her anti drug campaign tagline meth we re on it after it became the butt of jokes after facing criticism for hiring her daughter as a policy adviser noem gave her a bigger job and a hefty raise noem has largely praised the trump administration throughout the crisis even in march when the state health lab ran out of supplies and had to halt tests for several days that has resulted in access to trump and his advisers during a call with trump last week she pressed for flexibility in using her state s 1 25 billion in relief funding to offset sharp state revenue declines trump invited treasury secretary steven mnuchin onto the call to discuss the possibility noem later told reporters noem s increased contact with the white house

annual deep sea fishing trip last summer off british columbia hosted and paid for by wyoming gop donor foster friess lewandowski has since opened doors for noem to conservative leaders and audiences according to two south dakota republicans with direct knowledge of lewandowski s role who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren t authorized to discuss the private conversations and noem

maggie seidel said it s unequivocally false that noem is looking for an administration job seidel said noem received an offer to interview for a cabinet position before being elected governor but turned it down a rancher s daughter noem left college midway through her studies to take over the business when her father died a moment she describes as the first step toward a political path seeking lower taxes and personal freedom after serving in the state legislature noem swept into the house with the tea party wave in 2010 and served eight years she won the governor s office with just 51 percent of the vote in 2018 an appearance with trump at mount rushmore could boost noem s popularity she suggested this week that she ll be there to meet him but her standing may depend more on whether south dakotans feel safe coming out to watch the show of the new scrutiny noem told fox it s an important time that will show us what kind of leadership
