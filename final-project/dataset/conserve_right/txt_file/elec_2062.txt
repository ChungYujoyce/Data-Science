though recently denied presidential candidacy last week in his native habitat of south by southwest while he was promoting an hbo documentary about his stirring failure to unseat one of the most reviled incumbents in american politics but then the former el paso congressman whose occasionally moody gen x uplift has almost completely overshadowed his unusual political path and heterodox policy beliefs probably knew he was about to get the full vanity fair annie leibovitz cover treatment wednesday evening the inevitable was confirmed he s running i m really proud of what el paso did and what el paso represents o rourke said in a text to ktsm com it s a big part of why i m running this city is the best example of this country at its best an official announcement came this morning because america is still a great country there is already a robust savebetosdog hashtag and a sky full of mirth opening up over the head of the toothsome texan including this bizarre pre emptive shot across the bow by the club for growth in which the fiscally conservative group goes after the new democrat coalition member for taking advantage of his white male privilege and being a pale imitation of barack obama no really the attack ad points to several of o rourke s vulnerable points in the crowded democratic primary he clearly wants to tap into the obama vein of american politics without as a white man who married into wealth having endured or accomplished as much he supported as el paso city councilman an eminent domain deal that would have but never did bulldoze the homes of barrio latinos to the benefit of his own father in law he was arrested for drunk driving in 1998 after hitting a truck at a high rate of speed and according to one witness trying to drive away from the scene though the charges were ultimately dismissed after he completed a court supervised diversion program and dear god is he ripe for the mocking pic twitter com swkvfyrgtt comfortably smug comfortablysmug march 13 2019 there is more to the mystical skateboarder and lackluster air drummer though than merely the inevitable memes in the words of an intercept headline wednesday night beto o rourke is running for president and it all started with weed the el pasoan was a lonely democratic voice in questioning the drug war a decade ago and made that a key issue in successfully primarying the eight term incumbent congressman hack silvestre reyes back in 2012 living as he does across the fortified border with ciudad juarez and speaking pretty good spanish o rourke has also prioritized an immigration reform that includes fewer border patrol agents freer trade and most recently some torn down walls read his immigration related interviews with reason from 2013 2015 and 2018 his highest profile pre campaign public appearance this season was an el paso immigration counter rally last month at which he reportedly outdrew a same day same city event by president donald trump in a democratic field comparatively heavy on women but light on latinos you can bet that o rourke will make immigration enforcement and reform a central issue anything else of interest to libertarians well o rourke has been known to consort in a friendly way with the rep justin amash r mich like amash he has been a persistent critic of u s interventionism abroad a member of the house armed services committee o rourke is a withering critic of both the iraq and libya interventions two incredibly ill conceived regime change wars opposed bombing syria and has consistently called on congress to end the open ended post 9 11 authorization for use of military force blank check for endless war and reassert its war declaration powers troubling unconstitutional to be at war in iraq syria libya yemen somalia in addition to afghanistan w out informed authorization he tweeted in 2017 why do we have such a hard time admitting the west s role and culpability in the problems in the middle east he wrote in 2016 he also greeted the entrance of sen bernie sanders i vt into the race by declaring that i m a capitalist though this was only days after gushing over the green new deal and as i wrote earlier this month l ike vanishingly few politicians from either major party o rourke speaks as if there are budgetary constraints on the federal level we are 21 trillion in debt he lamented at a town hall in december commenting further that we are projected to add 1 trillion in deficit spending to that debt just in this next fiscal year he s also a comparatively lonely pro trade voice in the democratic field chances are that not much of o rourke s policy priors will be discussed in the coming days if ever not when the commanding heights of the conde nast empire are disgorging gen x hagiography like this i n the o rourke living room a floor to ceiling bookshelf contains a section for rock memoirs bob dylan s chronicles a favorite and a stack of lps the clash nina simone but also a sizable collection of presidential biographies including robert caro s work on lyndon b johnson arranged in historical order the biographies suggest there s been some reflection on the gravity of the presidency but there s also some political poetry to it a sense that o rourke might be destined for this shelf he has an aura conservative trolls will have a field day at this and other unintentional embarrassments but one also can smell just a whiff of fear if somehow o rourke can recapture the history making fundraising and liberal knee weakening prowess that he exhibited in 2018 if his up with people shtick can mask his comparative centrism enough to win a democratic primary in a socialist year then republicans might face a tough challenge in reelecting a persistently unpopular president beto o rourke is a target rich environment for mockery yes and mockery may also be the best weapon for taking out what could be a formidable candidate next sex testing in elite sport matt welch is an

political positions are what makes the mick who larps as a spic a formidable candidate it s that he s the equivalent of what professional wrestling promoters used to call blowjobs pretty boy types that were pushed to increase female attendance at the events the dude s the embodiment of a tiger beat cover for democrats bill clinton and obama were pushed for the same shallow reasons he s young he s fresh he s hip but at least they had some concrete policy ideas robert o rourke can t even be asked to do that which makes him by default an appealing democratic candidate in the current year i earned 9000 last month by working online just for 7 to 8 hours on my laptop and this was so easy that i myself could not believe before working on this site gbd if you too want to earn such a big money then come 2019 news try it you won t regret it see here http www theprocoin com in this article he clearly wants to tap into the obama vein of american politics without as a white man who married into wealth having endured or accomplished as much what did obama actually accomplish before running for president he did win his senate race o rourke didn t even manage that beto o rourke s single accomplishment is getting away with fleeing a crime scene like teddy k his inspiration no doubt yikes actually it sounds like he even failed at that start working at home with google it s by far the best job i ve had last wednesday i got a brand new bmw since getting a check for 6474 this 4 weeks past i began this 8 months ago and immediately was bringing home at least 77 per hour i work through this link go to tech tab for work detail http www payshd com he s more irish than a kennedy more mexican the pancho villa and more shallow than the rio grande on a hot day it s irish bobby its definitely a great accomplishment to not even win your home state in a political race preceding your run for president holy crap this guy is a joke and so are his wikipedia fluffers the couple and their three children live in el paso s sunset heights area in a henry trost designed mission style house where general hugh scott and pancho villa reportedly met in 1915 he clearly wants to tap into the obama vein of american politics without as a white man who married into wealth having endured or accomplished as much what exactly did obama have to endure they ran short of caviar once finding out that he couldn t actually walk on water and accomplish the quality and value of his accomplishments are questionable but it s hard to say he didn t accomplish much not really he didn t accomplish much that was easy see accomplish means complete successfully he did successfully get elected twice and successfully passed some shitty health care legislation and successfully got us into some more stupid wars wow getting elected that s not much like we said face it you were wrong get over it in obama s defense as much as i hate to defend him he did at least win his senate race so by that very low benchmark beto still comes up short and he did more or less not have any real parents his dad was a complete deadbeat and his mother was hardly better the guy ended up dumped on his white grandparents i would not have wanted to have obama s life growing up o rourke in contrast is the picture of privilege his dad was a judge whose connections and wealth allowed him to live a totally irresponsible and wasted youth and still land on his feet and avoid the long prison sentence that anyone whose father wasn t a judge would have gotten for causing a serious accident and trying to flee the scene while driving drunk i would not have wanted to have obama s life growing up yeah that must have been really hard first living among the privileged class in indonesia then going to an elite private prep school having shadowy benefactors pay your way through columbia and harvard being groomed for success it makes me tear up just thinking about it it would be really hard to have two naracistic deadbeat parents who didn t give a shit about you and dumped you on your grandparents or drug you to indonesia there is a lot more to life than money there is a lot more to life than money yeah but it helps take the sting away from the squalor many grand parents are far better to be raised by than their own parents so i don t consider that being a bad thing that has to be endured it is hard on the grandparents though sure but that doesn t mean that being dumped by your parents isn t still a significant negative in ones life don t forget all the partying he did this beto is basically george w bush without the accomplishments i m guessing he s hoping for a vp assignment at best his rich white parents that sent him to the costliest of private schools obama had a tough life lol it was his rich white grandparents who did that obama was dumped by both of his parents as a kid no amount of money makes that any better is his parents were unstable narcissists yes it does make it better obama had a better life growing yo than 90 of americans boohoo no he didn t i would rather be poor and have two parents who gave a shit about me than be rich and have deadbeat parents who dumped me on my grandparents what the hell is wrong with you people shitty parents have shitty kid who becomes shitty potus sorry being poor sucks worse than not having parents the point is that he didn t have a rags to riches story having grown up in a tough neighborhood where everyone was poor or working class at best i can say many of us would have leapt at the chance to have rich grandparents with money to help out john is right loss of parents in any way fucks people royally this has been well documented usually in regards to criminality but the other side of the coin is hyper ambition having to narcissistically suck up the world s love to fill a black hole is there any evidence his grandparents were rich he sold furniture she became vice president of a small local bank they seem to have always lived in apartments and according to wiki obama was enrolled at the punahou school a prestigious preparatory school where his tuition fees were paid with the aid of scholarships well he won his senate race because his opponent was gone having had his sealed court records paraded across the media but let s not talk about jack ryan s kinky sex life with 7 of 9 resistance was futile i sure wouldn t have resisted that delicious rack and she has pouty dsls too yes jack ryan was accused of wanting to have sex with his own wife a major scandal at the time and not just any chick if i were married to 36 of dd i would be banging her constantly obummy s teleprompter went out a couple of times he looked like a babbling idiot without it quite shameful for a supposed harvard law professor he supported as el paso city councilman an eminent domain deal that would have but never did bulldoze the homes of barrio latinos to the benefit of his own father in law do you know who else supported an eminent domain deal that never happened moses fuck off hihn hitler s lebensraum i don t know if it s relevant to this topic but el paso seems to have high property taxes such that a person could pay as much as the house is worth in 30 years of being taxed breyer ginsburg kennedy souter and stevens the clickbait candidate who is on a mission to find himself he couldn t find himself in the senate so now he s hoping to find himself in the white house or maybe he found a decent living and enough attention being a perennial cadidate and he s just happy scraping along either way i think i ll pass he s like most people in politics trying to avoid having to get a real job personally i would just enjoy the wealth left to me by my family and have fun until i die but i guess i m weird that way i know from experience there s nothing phony about betomania i don t live anywhere near texas and a few months ago i was seeing his lawn signs and bumper stickers everywhere there s no stronger indicator of genuine grassroots support and as we know nothing trumps a vanity fair cover vanity being the key word the entire field of democrats is one big batshit crazy fucking joke and yet democrat donors will give millions and trump will be reelected in 2020 by even more ec votes than in 2016 omg will 2020 be an even bigger red wave than 2018 lol the blue wave 2018 didn t materialize 115th congress 241 r 194 d house 52 r 46 d senate 116th congress 235 d 199 r house 53 r 45 d senate rofl andrew yang has some interesting things to say about ubi he was on joe rogan a while back and hickenlooper is very moderate even conservative on some issues but i guess if you re viewing things from the rightest of right wings everyone looks like a leftist hickenlooper is an absolute maniac gun grabber i think wanting to disarm the public by force makes you a batshit crazy leftist no matter how much lip service you give to loving the private sector and wanting to be reasonable he signed a large magazine capacity bill as well as a background check bill those kinds of laws don t make the 2a crowd happy but they are very moderate in comparison to your disarmed by force histerics yes let s ban and grab standard magazines an essential part of modern firearms while accusing the dissenters of hysterics no one wants to ban or confiscate guns ever it s a crazy and paranoid idea hawaii which registers guns and medical marijuana users starts disarming patients quote hawaii is one of 29 states that allow medical use of marijuana but it is the only state that requires registration of all firearms you can probably surmise what this means for patients who use cannabis as a medicine which hawaii allows them to do only if they register with the state this month many of them received a letter from honolulu police chief susan ballard instructing them to turn in their guns your medical marijuana use disqualifies you from ownership of firearms and ammunition ballard says in the november 13 letter which leafly obtained this week after russ belville noted it in his marijuana agenda podcast if you currently own or have any firearms you have 30 days upon receipt of this letter to voluntarily surrender your firearms permit and ammunition to the honolulu police department hpd you can still buy standard magazine in co and you can still buy high capacity rebuild kits that are fully assembled too and i compare the co law which was signed after the aurora theater shooting to trump s bump stock ban which was in response to las vegas bullshit a fixed or detachable magazine box drum feed strip or similar device capable of accepting or that is designed to be readily converted to accept more than 15 rounds of ammunition http lawcenter giffords org colorado note the designed to be readily converted language that includes damn near anything i have purchased four 30 round rebuild kits and live in co and my firearms aren t illegal either and the cops at the gun range have the same so back to your books looking for boogeymen john no magazines clips are illegal every gun control law is unconstitutional what kevin p said are you dishonest or do you really not have any idea how guns work let me give you a hint declaring standard magazines illegal makes the guns illegal and if they are illegal you have to either sell them to someone out of state or turn them in if you don t want to be a criminal there is nothing moderate about that and fuck you and anyone who claims otherwise fuck you and the horse you road in on lol you have no fucking clue what you are talking about yes i do read the language above any magazine that can be converted is banned that is pretty much any magazine again go fuck yourself you are not getting mine or anyone else s guns no matter how much you lie and pretend you are being reasonable there is nothing reasonable about it and you will never be satisfied even if it were today s reasonable compromise is tomorrow s loophole that must be closed there is absolutely no reason to compromise with people like you and hickenlooper have you ever even seen an ar the standard magazine for one is 30 rounds standard is whatever you purchase to go with your ar i ve only built one so i wouldn t know if they are packaged with a magazine best consult with your books and websites to find the answers to counter my real world experience yes off the shelf ars are sold with 30 round magazines standard and just because you haven t been arrested yet doesn t mean you aren t technically breaking the law basically colorado isn t really enforcing the law because it is unenforceable there s been tons of stories on that when i was sighting it for the first time at the range i brought the 10 round but noticed that everyone was openly using 30s i asked the range master and he laughed and showed me the rebuild kits they sold a cop who was in the shop confirmed what you re saying pussy 100 round drums for the ar series or gtfo lol i could just walk over and take your ar while you re trying to clear the jammed drum because only a moron has one weapon on them i would just rifle butt your stupid face to save a bullet not so fast lc because you see i know your weakness before i get to you to take your jammed rifle i would throw a copy of the art of the deal up in the air knowing that you d never allow the orange visage of his holiness to be desecrated by touching the ground you d leap to catch it while you re in the air i would then throw a copy of the constitution in the other direction allowing it to hit the ground which of course would cause you to wail and rend your operator chic garments as you cry and gnashed your teeth impotently i could disarm you as needed and walk away leaving a broken husk poor eric so unaware what makes libertarians tick i get what you re saying but the co law is on the books as described and your standard 30 round mag is still illegal as is modifying a legal magazine they just aren t enforcing it because it s not worth all the trouble of tackling people like yourself wherever they show up you just have to get them out of state or through black market and go through the trouble and be willing to be a law breaker even in australia the best estimates for compliance with the mandatory confiscation is only around 20 it s like building your own suppressor using aluminum cups and a fuel filter no one may be kicking the door down but it s still a felony if not registered and paid for 200 but don t get caught with it because they ll throw the book at you those kinds of laws don t make the 2a crowd happy but they are very moderate in comparison to your disarmed by force histerics and now they re pushing a red flag bill that essentially strips people of any due process it never ends with these people because there s no law they can pass short of outright confiscation that would drop firearm deaths close to zero today s moderate regulation is tomorrow s loophole agreed but hickenlooper is no longer gov how bout rainbow music hall white privilege there s a certain ring to it nah i m still leaning towards ludlow celebration white privilege a fine day in co history right up there with sand creek commies were killed so it certainly was as well as their wives and children nits make lice who is andrew yang another libertarian who lives the endlessly expanding welfare state yes when eric views everythin from the leftest of left wings everything looks like a conservative democrats are a bunch of sick delusional fuckers i seriously liked the vf piece it s uncanny how closely beto followed in his father s footsteps i suppose you ve seen that the leibovitz vf cover looks exactly like the leibovitz vf cover for the same story on john edwards written by the same writer he s dreamy he s a regular joe only better he s a saint we re not worthy holy shit you weren t kidding he needs a job which provides a car and driver since he can t safely operate anything more powerful than a skateboard so he figures being president is the perfect fit roflmao i saw a picture of beto with his surly steamroller singlespeed bicycle i wanted to cry i owned and rode a steamroller daily for 15 years until it died a sad death at my own hands yes the surly steamroller has a reputation as a hipster bike but i actually used it for its intended purposes and i for sure am not a hipster in any way shape or form except for my singlespeed bike use just for the record i can t stand starbucks craft brew hard liquor man buns beto and any other hipster crap but i did like my surly steamroller it is not just a bike but an attitude surly i can only agree with beto on his choice of bikes just sayin welch is getting a beto boner will matthews get another tingle up his leg yeah he ll probably wet himself again have you seen the twitters this morning the vf piece is written by the same guy who wrote vf s story on john edwards when he was running way back when and both their cover pics of edwards and o rourke are similar casual dress a truck and a dog it s hilarious i wonder if beto is having an extra marital affair that he is trying to cover up while his wife dies of cancer he s more like lurch who also married an heiress i think he s smarter than that the man is a nobody whose never done anything but get married to a billionaire s daughter beto s father was a nobody who never did anything but get married to a millionaire s daughter chip off the ol block having endured or accomplished as much present i wonder what his butler calls him master beto hefe chuckle he s tall and semi attractive in that kennedy douchbag kind of way and has the d behind his name and he s self absorbed so it doesn t really matter what he says women will vote for him which will make him tough to beat given his primary competition or rather lack thereof kamela is probably strongest competition but has her own issues to deal with i think joe creepy hands biden is going to sink fast he has zero youth appeal bernie can t beat trump and the dems know it so he s out i can see why someone of a certain bent would like o rourke but i can t see how anyone could say he is interesting he doesn t have a single interesting or original position or thought he is the perfect example of the gentry white liberal love that or hate that whatever you think it is not interesting or unique he really embodies everything that s wrong with politics since the boomers became a political force the hyper earnestness the parroting of college campus shibboleths the delusions of grandeur man i m just born to be in it the puerile pandering to pop culture and youth tropes and the slick pseudo kennedy sales packaging by the media albo s comparison of him to john edwards is apt and it wasn t an accident that the media went full bore to try and run the same propaganda playbook with o rourke that they did with obama in 2004 in fairness to edwards he was a trial lawyer of some repute i am not going to defend the morality of being a sleezy plantiff s attorney but it is something that takes a considerable amount of skill and moxy to do at the level edwards did it edwards had an actual successful carreer outside politics beto has never been anything but the idiot son of a well connected judge beto has never been anything kind of like our last president blank slate spouting platitudes in fairness to obama at least he won his senate race albeit in the shadiest manner possible o rourke can t even make that claim he s just a cotton candy brained rich boy from el paso that happens to have the correct political alignment to be honest i don t even care that a new politician has a political resume trump lost two presidential runs and had zero political office experience he is the best president in over 80 years beto does not have any appeal for me because he wont reign in government and texans dont like him because he cannot even win his own state he did well in texas among a certain class of voter simply because he wasn t ted cruz a yaller dawg probably could have come close to winning too he did well in texas among a certain class of voter well sure his whole campaign was designed to appeal to white suburban women with college degrees it s the same reason wendy davis was nominated to run for governor in texas too if julian castro had run for senate instead of o rourke cruz would have cleaned his clock because there s nothing about castro that gets white girl panties moist and no one outside the san antonio media gives a shit about him yes the treason incinlined love subversives like beto o rourke i honestly thought for sure he was going to be reason s candidate of choice given he cusses in front of his kids was in a band is pro pot and is the emptiest suit ever wait they also love pete buttplug because he s gay and there s a lot of gay boys working at resson these days but i suspect they know deep inside that buttplug doesn t have nearly enough name recognition at this time to do anything what ever happened to old buttplug any way haven t seen him or hihn or rev wait he has been a persistent critic of u s interventionism abroad and he hasn t received the tulsi treatment yet guessing it s coming i can t even get excited enough about beto to critique him it s obvious we re being presented with a slick packaged corporate product beto 2 0 now with more multi culturalism in every bite he s edgy he s hip he s beto get one for election day are you a mad man sure sound like it good someone to fill in the young white male progressive box on the office which democratic candidate will drop out first pool austin calling a for continuing with the clash motif he s being promoted so that the eventual geriatric dem candidate can choose a bright younger face to run with now my sneaking suspicion is that old wrinkled mug still might be hillary she still has the assets money staff diehards and networks galore to overpower probably anybody but biden plus 1 she can give the illusion of being a centrist with loads of experience 2 her dem opponents can t viciously attack her on the things that matter without exposing their party s complicity in all of it her nasty history is their history they can t walk or even inch away from it 3 like it or not she is a symbol of defiant strong womanhood she certainly never admits weakness or says she is sorry sincerely 4 biden will have his own problems research hunter biden and burisma think about helsinki germany and russian natural gas think about the brazen international smoke and mirrors con games that can be run when our mainstream media is only a dem propaganda outlet and our cia and doj were politicized by obama bureaucrats to completely ignore what was being done in plain sight to try and keep both angela merkel and vlad putin jolly and pretending to like us douchebag lefties like beto fail upwards she is a symbol of defiant strong womanhood she certainly never admits weakness or says she is sorry sincerely there are much better descriptions for those character faults than strong womanhood the first that comes to my mind is cunt hes running on doing things better he doesn t have specifics hes not an idea guy hes a theme guy he will be better betterbeto perfectly moldable by the dnc these comments indicate this candidate is never going to gain traction with america s vestigial bigoted right wing malcontents he is forced to hope that disaffected rural superstitious faux libertarians have not become the winners of america s culture war carry on clingers i think the comments are spot on about beto pretty boy empty suit with no accomplishments trump would have a field day mocking his pseudo latinoness and the fact that he lost to trump s favorite whipping boy ted cruz where we you yesterday clingin kirkland i don t know if your handlers let you watch the news or not but there was a big story about our betters having to pay bribes to get into the schools you approve of too bad those elite s children aren t re so fucking stupid and lazy i do not regard them as betters lori loughlin for example has no college degree and pandered to superstitious yahoos with white bread dramas on one of the wholesome heartland channels i do not regard them as betters lori loughlin for example has no college degree and pandered to superstitious yahoos with white bread dramas on one of the wholesome heartland channels arthur l hicklib tries to disavow his fellow leftists hey asshole sevo s looking for you sevo is too busy looking for a handful of street pills to get him through another miserable day in our deplorable backwaters to be looking for anything else you re a funny fucker arty acting superior when i have easily forty iq points probably more than twice your physical strength superior education and a resume of intellectual professional and physical accomplishments that you certainly lack relative to you i m a superbeing that must drive your little dull mind into a blind rage being such an envy centric progtard dont you have some fraudulent elite colleges to defend or maybe some minorities to talk down to like liberals do people who think trump makes a great president don t get to have an opinion on the democratic candidates and probably should just stay in their rooms and attempt to eat their soup people who will vote for whomeever the democrats run no matter how bad incompetent or corrupt opinion on the democratic candidate is irrelevent you are a drone tony you will do as you are told think what you are told and your thoughts on such things matter to no one least of all the democratic party so you think there s ever going to be a good reason to vote for trump over any one of the dem candidates shut up and gargle your soup since trump has done pretty much everything he has promised to do no why would i even though he has no chance at the nomination i wish he would be nominated so you could have the pleasure of voting for a rich white guy who escaped a long prison sentence that would have befell any poor person and certainly any minority because of his family connections beto more than anyone is who people like you are forever claiming that you don t want the game to be rigged but always doing everything you can to keep it rigged for you benefit it even funnier that after all the feminist and anti white rhetoric coming from the propagandist wing of the democratic party that multiple white men are running for president even with obama as president they still needed a white guy as vp to win in 2016 the good reason to vote for trump was hillary expect the same in 2020 the best reason to vote for trump will be the dem candidate trump s only merit is not being hillary or whichever of the current litter of scumbags competing for the d candidacy wins out his sole positive is the vast negatives of his competition get over the idea that people vote for by and large they vote against trump is a definite vote not an anti vote trump has done more libertarian ish things than any lp candidate put up in 2020 lc sez trump has done more libertarian ish things than any lp candidate put up in 2020 exactly what lp candidates have been put up in 2020 so far i haven t seen any last time they put up gayjay still less libertarin ish accomplishments as nm gov and weld a lefty hiding as a lino rino policy wise the hate hurled against trump is hyperbole i don t see what s been so bad to elicit such unhinged retardedness people focus on the periphery shit the other day someone sent me the story of kushner sr trying to black mail his brother a story christie explained on mad dog sports and that somehow the company you keep matters of course he never sent me articles about the company the clintons and the obamas kept that s what reveals our desperate reality even with all of trump s fundamental flaws and heinous misfit with our highest office almost of the the annouced democratic candidates still make people ponder if trump could be better i m sure that makes you feel very superior but at some point the democratic nominee is going to have to try and win some of those people over it can be done but not that way keep shitting all over them and they ll vote against you just for spite people who think trump makes a great president don t get to have an opinion on the democratic candidates says who eat your mushy peas you miserable bearded ugly ass old fuck poor tony i plan on sabotaging democrats running in the democrat primary i voted for bernie in georgia to fuck over hillary since i knew that gayjay was on the ballot and trump would beat either bernie or hillary worked great the dnc was so threatened that they rigged the primary against bernie gayjay got 3 of the votes in georgia trump kicked hillary s ass tony you don t decide what we get to have we decide if you get to continue breathing if you live to see another sunrise it is only because we allow it don t get to have an opinion on the democratic candidates i ll have an opinion on anything i damned well please that you very much as for the dem candidates they are frighteningly collectivistic and anti freedom my buddy s mother in law makes 72 hr on the she has been without a job for ten months but last month her paycheck was 21863 just working on the for a few hours read more on this site why are democrats such wannabe hipster insufferable whack jobs the gop are a mosh pit of cool next to these clowns the democrat party does not have a fixed morality associated with it the republican party despite it s failings does have a tradition of aspiring to basic new testament values which are anathema to the kind of people who are attracted to the democrats this is also why the democrats are a magnet for sociopaths psychopaths and narcissists why look at tony he fits right in get paid over 120 per hour working from home with 2 kids at home i never thought i d be able to do it but my best friend earns over 10k a month doing this and she convinced me to try the potential with this is endless heres what i ve been doing and good luck here http www home jobs89 com i can always spot a matt welch headline nice clash reference i ll miss this reference from a song by the clash when beto actually disappears he was manic in iowa this morning and his arm flapping is worse than bernie s so it s official reason is all in for fido for 2020 it is true you once get your brat into harvard law by hook or crook they really don t have to really study or even pay attention in class except to their colleagues who will one day help them rule america joins the 2020 presidential scrum ha i read that as scum both are true in my humble opinion best comment of the day he s on a visionquest communing with native spirit guides smoking peyote this motherfucker is so gen x it huuuurrrrts he s looking forward to the tai chi scene beta can choke on a dick legitimately interesting welch can choke on a dick too he s bobby newport that s what i m calling him from here on out empty suits run well in the dnc and o rourke is pretty
