national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions the most rational response to the news that new york city mayor bill de blasio wants to be president is to ask of what when informed that he wants to be president of the united states and not of say the local organic hemp co op perhaps the next best response would be to take a page from the south and say bless his heart one of the more charming things about de blasio is his amiable lack of self awareness he seems to have no idea that he doesn t impress anybody the obliviousness is somewhat understandable he did get elected twice but his victories have more to do with the dysfunction of new york city politics than with any strength on his part in 2013 he won the democratic primary which assured victory in the fall in the lowest election turnout in decades after 3 percent of new yorkers voted for him he saw a landslide he must bring a similar perspective to his poll numbers according to a quinnipiac survey released this month 76 percent of new yorkers don t think de blasio should run for president and it s not because they re desperate to keep him on the job it was famously said of george h w bush that he was the kind of guy who was born on third base and thought he d hit a triple this was always more than a little unfair to the elder president bush given that at 17 he signed up to become one of the youngest combat pilots in the pacific during world war ii and went on to work harder at politics and public service than arguably any president since with the possible exception of jimmy carter but the barb drew blood because it sounded clever and exploited the always reliable american resentment against affluent political dynasties the same dynamic isn t at work with de blasio he didn t grow up poor but he didn t grow up rich either politically he is the consummate example of someone born or in this case elected on home plate who can t understand why no one in the stands is cheering his home run when he was poised to win reelection he was asked by new york magazine why he wasn t more popular he admitted that he was somewhat mystified given the strength of the economy and the low crime rate you d assume they d be having parades out in the streets in his honor he said jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist https cdn jwplayer com

front of a parade and acts like he s leading it de blasio inherited the successes of rudolph giuliani and michael bloomberg two mayors who wrestled the city back from the brink of social and economic collapse de blasio s record as mayor doesn t have a policy theme writes nicole gelinas in city state new york it s just a mishmash of half executed ideas that add up to a city little different than it was before he got here even his biggest accomplishments rather than striking out in a bold new direction are building on existing trends worse de blasio takes credit for the successes of his predecessors on crime poverty and the economy but refuses to take responsibility for the growing problems on his watch from abysmal mass transit to an exploding homeless population and that points to the real problem with de blasio he s lazy he s famous for being asleep on the job literally he often oversleeps arriving late for important events such as funerals or in one case an event in his own residence some voters have a perception that he has an up at the crack of noon attitude political strategist gerry o brien told the new york post this laziness isn t just physical but intellectual like the president of a college chapter of the young socialists de blasio is the sort of politician who thinks rolling out of bed and announcing something is the same thing as doing something that boldness in rhetoric is a substitute for boldness of action new yorkers even very liberal new yorkers see that still it makes sense that de blasio is running because in a field of 24 and counting contenders and with no future political prospects in his home state he s got little to lose he can raise money from rubes who haven t been burned already get on a bunch of tv shows and who knows he lucked out before maybe he ll stumble to the front of another parade 2019 tribune content agency llc get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters
