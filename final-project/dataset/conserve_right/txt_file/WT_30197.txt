tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap special counsel robert mueller spent 22 months examining whether donald trump s campaign conspired with russia to sway the 2016 election his conclusion no collusion but the question of whether trump obstructed justice wasn t so clear cut in laying out mueller s findings attorney general william barr said the special counsel didn t weigh in on the question instead barr ultimately made the call that trump didn t violate the law a move that quickly drew criticism from house democrats who say the president is hardly

vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid some key takeaways from mueller s findings no collusion between the trump campaign and russia mueller made that clear barr quotes mueller s confidential report as saying the investigation did not establish that members of the trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government in its election interference activities that finding was a win for trump who has turned no collusion into a daily refrain the letter is short on detail though and barr says he will have to consult with mueller and other justice department officials before he can release more of mueller s confidential report or any other information he gathered during the investigation barr s letter didn t say what mueller learned that fell short of a crime about a broad range of trump associates who had russia related contacts it also didn t answer why several of those people lied to federal investigators or congress during the russia probe since there wasn t any direct coordination going on no smoking gun on obstruction but no exoneration either mueller punted on whether trump obstructed justice deciding not to make a judgment one way or the other while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him mueller wrote in his report instead the special counsel laid out the evidence on both sides of the question according to barr mueller left unresolved what he viewed as the difficult issues of law and fact concerning whether the president s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction barr made the call on prosecuting obstruction absent a recommendation from mueller barr said he stepped in barr who was appointed by trump says he and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein decided there wasn t sufficient evidence to establish that the president obstructed justice that conclusion was based on mueller s investigation barr said it was not a reflection of the justice department s view that a sitting president can t be indicted barr said he determined that none of trump s actions amounted to obstruction and that there was not sufficient evidence to show he acted with a corrupt intent he also noted there wasn t an underlying crime involving trump the bar for collusion prosecution was high the letter sheds some light on how mueller approached the collusion question in assessing whether americans committed crimes related to russia s election interference mueller was looking for a specific agreement tacit or express between the trump campaign and the russian government barr said investigators didn t find that but his letter does contain a nod to some of the trump campaign s contacts with russia noting that mueller uncovered multiple offers from russian affiliated individuals to assist the trump campaign grand jury witnesses have shown that mueller scrutinized a june 2016 meeting at trump tower involving a russian lawyer the president s eldest son donald trump jr took the meeting even though it was described as a russian government effort to help his father trump jr expected the meeting to produce derogatory information on hillary clinton court papers also show that mueller uncovered that a maltese professor told a trump campaign foreign policy adviser that the russians had dirt on clinton in the form of emails a message passed along weeks before it became public that democratic groups had been hacked trump was also trying to cut a business deal in russia during the campaign an effort that included his personal lawyer discussing the proposal with a kremlin official but according to mueller the americans involved didn t violate the law is trump out of the woods no trump also plays a central role in a separate case in new york where prosecutors have implicated him in a crime they say trump directed his personal lawyer michael cohen to arrange illegal hush money payments as a way to quash potential sex scandals during the campaign new york prosecutors also are looking into trump s inaugural fund congressional investigations also are swirling around the president democrats have launched a sweeping probe of trump that threatens to shadow the president through the 2020 election season and they re now demanding that barr turn over mueller s confidential report and the underlying evidence he gathered so they can draw their own conclu
