seeking comment eucom on russia threat russia is engaged in a wide ranging effort to undermine the west the commander of the european command told congress on tuesday if you look at their forces from what we know as hybrid or asymmetric means to conventional to nuclear the russians are modernizing this force in every one of those categories army gen curtis scaparrotti told the house armed services committee the hybrid warfare category includes the extensive use of cyber attacks along with disinformation and what moscow calls information confrontation the eucom commander said in recent months they announced new elements within their force that focus on information confrontation information operations he testified the operations are conducted below the threshold of traditional military conflict employing such tactics as political provocation information operations disinformation and cyber attacks the use of these new warfare methods is now part of russia s doctrine conventional force improvements by the russian military includes upgrading warships and warplanes along with new weapons for the future older aircraft also have been refitted to use newer munitions that can be fired from land based aerial and naval platforms so it s a multi functional system gen scaparrotti said it gives them long reach and precision nuclear weapons and delivery systems also are being modernized across all the areas the general said the russians have been increasing their capability really refining their capability from the old systems adding that more weapons are dual capable nuclear and conventionally armed the dual capability makes it difficult for us to clearly understand what they ve employed he said as for nuclear use doctrine moscow also has adopted a new policy that will permit escalating the use of nuclear weapons more easily during conventional conflicts they ve made the statement openly that they see a use for nuclear tactical capabilities within what we would consider a conventional conflict which is very alarming gen scaparrotti said in prepared remarks gen scaparrotti said moscow is attempting to reemerge as a global power and regards the international order based on rule of law democracy and human rights as part of a system aimed at suppressing russia the russians under president vladimir putin are working to undermine the international system and

harassment of the usns impeccable is still unclear at least one pla vessel was on the scene the report said however the fact that the fishing vessels involved were part of the maritime military would necessitate pla awareness of the operation the report said china s military guided maritime militia operations in several other cases including the 1974 seizure of the western paracels from vietnam reconnaissance and sovereignty patrols during the february 2014 blockade of second thomas shoal and the 2014 repulsion of vietnamese vessels from disputed waters surrounding a mobile chinese oil
