countries outside china that have big caseloads such as japan france and the u s have relatively ample resources for isolating and treating patients lower income countries like nepal sri lanka and cambodia have reported one case each at a meeting of the world health organization in geneva last week delegates from various countries including sudan and bangladesh sought reassurances of support for their overburdened public health networks a representative from sudan said it had managed to create an isolation ward using local resources but since the country is already battling six other major disease outbreaks and also facing international sanctions it s short about 2 million of the funds it needs scott pendergast the who s director for health emergencies strategy said the estimated cost for beefing up the capacity of public health systems to respond to the virus could amount to 675 million in february april not including research or the economic impacts of travel restrictions and other measures the extra cost of handling just 10 imported cases was estimated at 1 5 million he said it s an estimated response cost that will have to be augmented by bottom up planning at the

more facilities into hospitals for emergency treatment and examinations state television reported two new hospitals one with 1 000 beds and the other with 1 500 were also quickly built the people s liberation army deployed 1 400 doctors nurses and other personnel to help staff the hospitals in the industrial hub whose hospitals have been inundated while the city s transport links were cut off to contain the spread of the disease even within china communities have vastly varying capacities to cope with pandemics overall china s spending on health care is relatively high for a developing country at 400 per person according to who data that compares with 78 in cambodia and 34 in bangladesh access to basic public health care in china is also relatively high at least as measured by who statistics with 76 of people able to get the care they need without financial hardship in most wealthy countries that measure is equal to or more than 80 wealthy chinese especially those with connections often can access vip departments in public and military hospitals or expensive international style clinics that cater to foreigners but most people have to take their chances by lining up often for hours at a time even in normal times at overcrowded public hospitals that s typical for many developing countries around asia and elsewhere indonesia whose annual per capita spending on health care is only one sixth of china s and about half that of thailand is considering building a facility on a deserted island dedicated to monitoring and quarantining coronavirus patients and in
