threat to his reelection a cbs news poll on thursday showed that 43 of respondents say mr trump is doing a good job 5 points lower than three weeks ago and 10 points lower than in march nearly 3 million americans applied for unemployment benefits last week the bureau of labor statistics reported thursday bringing the number to 36 million over the two months since states began closing their economies rick bright a top coronavirus vaccine researcher at the national institutes of health testified in congress thursday that the administration ignored his warnings earlier this year to prepare for the pandemic mr bright said he faced hostility and marginalization from officials at the department of health and human services who ignored his warnings to start work on a vaccine at the beginning of the outbreak and increase production of personal protective equipment the president dismissed mr bright as nothing more than a really unhappy disgruntled person i never met him i don t want to meet him mr trump said but i watched him on tv and he looks like an angry disgruntled employee who frankly according to some people didn t do a very good job but faced with such criticism of the administration s response the president and his advisers are making an increasingly robust defense of their handling of the crisis on thursday they again took aim at the obama administration s actions reaching back more than a decade the president said his predecessor never replenished the strategic national stockpile after his administration distributed about 85 million n 95 masks in 2009 in response to an outbreak of the h1n1 swine flu mr trump said the effort was not well handled under the previous administration the stockpile was depleted and never fully refilled mr trump said he also poked fun at sleepy joe for incorrectly calling the swine flu n1h1 reversing the letters during the trip the president signed an executive order delegating authority under the defense production act to the u s international development finance corporation to make loans to american companies to produce needed supplies such as n 95 masks and surgical gloves for the federal stockpile the president said the usidfc normally invests in foreign countries adding it will now also invest in our country instead of one to three weeks worth of supplies which we had less than that the u s government will now stockpile three whole months much of it made in the u s a the president said as our country begins a safe and gradual reopening we re launching a monumental effor to replenish and rebult the strategic national stockpile he noted that his administration has signed contracts with companies to manufacture 200 000 ventilators and has ordered 800 million n 95 respirators and face masks mr biden said in a statement that the president has failed to provide enough testing and to provide guidance for workplace safety as governors wrestle with the decision of how quickly to let their states go back to work the issue isn t whether or not to reopen we all want to reopen it s how to reopen safely and effectively mr biden said and the trump administration simply hasn t done the work to make that happen except to take care of themselves at the white house mr trump pointed to the administration s achievement in delivering its 10 millionth test this week although he said the milestone tends to make the u s look bad when you test you find something is wrong with people mr trump said if we didn t do any testing we would have very few cases more than 1 4 million covid 19 cases have been reported in the u s with more than 85 000 deaths in a population of about 330 million critics have noted that the trump administration had three years to replenish the stockpile of masks before the coronavirus pandemic hit they also have criticized the white house for largely disbanding a pandemic response team at the national security council in 2018 white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany said thursday that the obama biden pandemic plan was insufficient it wasn t going to work so what our administration did under the leadership of president trump is do an entire 2018 pandemic preparedness report she also said the administration conducted a pandemic preparedness exercise in august 2019 and completed an after action report the obama biden paper packet was superseded by a president trump style pandemic preparedness response plan she told reporters mr trump said his plan was much better was much more complete and which was a lot tougher we were given very little when we came into this administration he said the president also reiterated his prediction that a coronavirus vaccine will be available by the end of this year i think distribution will take place almost simultaneously because we ve geared up the military he said promising more details friday mr biden the presumptive democratic nominee who is leading the president in polls in pennsylvania by an average of 4 5 percentage points said mr trump s words and actions are deepening the nation s political divide over the nation s coronavirus response at a time when we should be uniting our country president trump is trying to split pennsylvanians into dueling camps casting democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep america grounded and republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy mr biden said this is a false choice and it s just his latest tactic in his mission of dividing americans the strategic national stockpile was created in 1999 to prepare for chemical radiological biological or nuclear attacks its role was expanded later to respond to terrorism attacks natural disasters the h1n1 flu and ebola the location of the stockpiles warehouses are secret senior administration officials said the effort of manufacturing more supplies and moving more of the medical supply chain back to the u s is aimed partly at enabling more people to keep working if there s a surge of new cases after the summer a big part of this effort is to make sure that people can go back to work in the fall an official said not only will we be prepared if something comes up the more that we stimulate the domestic supply and bring the supply into america the more that industry and people will have the masks and protective equipment they need to safely return to work one official said the administration is aiming to stockpile one billion masks we re not going to have all of those for the fall but we do anticipate having 300 million the official said the administration didn t provide an estimated cost of the effort but they said the u s is building about 200 000 ventilators enough of a surplus that mr trump has been offering the machines to other countries last year they said the u s made about 30 000 ventilators seth mclaughlin and gabriella mu o
