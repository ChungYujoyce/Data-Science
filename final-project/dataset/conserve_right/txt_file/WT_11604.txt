the concubine who launched modern china ms chang argues that cixi was a reformer who helped introduce western style commerce taxation and technology the author makes a strong case for cixi as a strategic thinker who knew which battles were worth fighting she shows her as astute about people generous to friends and often magnanimous to opponents her rise to power and her hold on it evidenced her remarkable talents in a fascinating account of chinese customs jung chang explains that as the daughter of a wealthy manchu family cixi was one of hundreds of girls sent for inspection by xianfeng as potential concubines though she was chosen she won no special favor until four years later when she gave birth to his first born son and then rose rapidly through the harem hierarchy until she was second only to the empress zhen in 1861 xianfeng died having unsuccessfully battled both the taiping rebellion and the british and french who wanted him to open ports to their ships xianfeng appointed regents for his young son but since all were proponents of his disastrous policies cixi hatched a coup to replace them with herself and the empress as joint empress dowagers protocol insisted that

concubine shoved into a well for example though she does not condone cixi s support of the boxers she is an apologist for it ms chang ends with descriptions of cixi s final years when she welcomed western women into her court and issued progressive edicts including plans for voting rights in the epilogue the author describes cixi s legacy as towering and says she brought medieval china into the modern age praising her as a consensus seeker she says that her rule was benign at least compared with her predecessors regimes ms chang s new broom sweeps briskly throughout her book and she clears a lot of ground much of cixi s history remains murky including how she engineered her initial coup and some matters would be clearer if the spotlight moved from the court to the country more often nonetheless the demon cixi painted by other commentators fades as ms chang clears the dust to reveal a fresher more nuanced picture she was a giant but not a saint she writes and that seems to have
