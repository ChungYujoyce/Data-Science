apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap president donald trump asked a foreign country to investigate a political rival as he enters his reelection campaign that has been established almost beyond doubt but republicans and democrats agree on little else as they engage in on only the fourth impeachment inquiry in the nation s history here are key takeaways from two weeks of hearings this for that top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk in the most anticipated testimony gordon sondland the european union ambassador repeatedly described the administration s dealings with ukraine as a quid pro quo one thing in return for another i know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question was there a quid pro quo as i testified previously with regard to the requested white house call and white house meeting the answer is yes sondland said the deal he said involved arranging a white house visit for ukraine s new president volodymyr zelenskiy in return for zelenskiy s announcing investigations of burisma a ukrainian gas company and a discredited conspiracy theory that ukraine had interfered in the 2016 u s presidential election democrat joe biden s son hunter was a burisma board member that proposed arrangement was pushed by rudy giuliani trump s personal lawyer who conveyed trump s wishes to multiple administration officials but in testimony that republicans sought to exploit sondland said no one ever told him military aid to ukraine was contingent on the country announcing investigations though he said he came to presume that was the case everyone was in the loop sondland was central to trump s efforts to secure investigations by ukraine but he insisted that this was no rogue effort and he would not be a fall guy he testified how officials across the government were aware of trump s demand that ukraine commit to the investigations those officials he said included secretary of state mike pompeo and the white house s acting chief of staff mick mulvaney everyone sondland said repeatedly was in the loop it was no secret that also included vice president mike pence he said marc short pence s chief of staff disputed that account and said that pence never spoke with sondland about investigating the bidens burisma or the conditional release of financial aid to ukraine based upon potential investigations in brussels pompeo dismissed sondland s testimony but didn t comment on specifics domestic political errand fiona hill a former white house adviser and russia expert recounted a tense relationship with sondland if other people were supportive of the ambassador s efforts hill very certainly was not among them her testimony vividly outlined the diverging objectives of trump s official staff and parallel effort led by giuliani that also involved sondland he was being involved in a domestic political errand hill said of sondland and we were being involved in national security foreign policy in one june blowup when hill confronted sondland over his assertion that he was in charge of ukraine policy he replied that trump had given him authority she was angry and irritated over the lack of coordination and warned him that this is all going to blow up and she pointedly added here we are what did ukraine know and when did it know it sondland s appearance dominated the day but a defense department official named laura cooper provided her own subtly tantalizing testimony she revealed that ukrainian embassy officials had asked about military aid on july 25 earlier than previously known that could undercut a republican argument that there couldn t have been a quid pro quo involving military aid because the ukrainians didn t know that the aid was being held up she said she also has been recently informed that a ukrainian embassy contact had asked a member of her staff that same day what was going on with the aid the july 25 date is significant it s the same day trump spoke by phone with zelenskiy and pressed for an investigation of joe biden cooper told lawmakers she cannot say for certain that ukraine knew the money was being withheld but she said it s the recollection of my staff that they likely knew it s lieutenant colonel vindman please with those words alexander vindman an army officer and purple heart recipient sought to shut down republican attacks on his credibility republicans went after him nonetheless republican rep chris stewart called vindman s uniform a good reminder of his military service but also questioned why vindman felt it necessary to wear it rather than a suit he wanted to know too if vindman always insisted on being referred to by military rank rather than mr as he did in an exchange earlier with rep devin nunes the committee s top republican in that moment he corrected nunes and asked to be called lt col vindman please the committee attacks mirrored the combative approach of the white house which used its official twitter account to retweet attacks on vindman who continues to work at the white house some republican attacks struggled to land after rep jim jordan suggested that vindman s peers questioned his judgment vindman read from a glowing performance review that called him brilliant and unflappable other attacks including from the white house s director of social media sought to imply that vindman a naturalized american citizen who was a toddler when his family fled ukraine may have dual loyalties under questioning from gop impeachment counsel steve castor vindman revealed that he was offered three times the post of ukraine s defense minister while attending zelenskiy s inauguration but immediately dismissed these offers he says he notified his chain of command and counterintelligence officials upon returning to the u s castor questioned whether that created the impression of a conflict to which vindman replied it s more important what my american chain of command thinks very intimidating the testimony of marie yovanovitch the former u s ambassador to ukraine who last spring was abruptly recalled from kyiv and directed to return home on the next possible flight was barely underway when trump ridiculed her on twitter saying without evidence that things turned bad wherever she went during her decades long career yovanovitch left no doubt that she interpreted some of the trump s cryptic comments about her she s going to go through some things he told ukraine s president in the july phone call in the most chilling way it didn t sound good she said it sounded like a threat she said the effect of the president s comments is very intimidating not just for her but for others who might be similarly inclined root out corruption rep adam schiff the democratic chairman of the house intelligence committee read trump s tweet to yovanovitch and suggested it was part of a campaign of witness intimidation well i want to let you know ambassador that some of us here take witness intimidation very very seriously trump asked about it later said i have the right to speak i have freedom of speech the big stuff the july 26 lunch on an outdoor terrace in a kyiv restaurant started out social enough there was a bottle of wine and affable chatter about marketing strategies for sondland s hotel business then according to david holmes a counselor at the u s embassy in kyiv sondland said he was going to call trump to give him an update the conversation holmes overheard was loud and memorable at one point holmes said he heard sondland tell trump that zelenskiy loves your ass i then heard president trump ask so he s gonna do the investigation ambassador sondland replied that he s gonna do it he said sondland told trump that zelenskiy will do anything you ask him to when the call ended holmes said he asked sondland if it was true that trump did not give a s t about ukraine sondland said that it was indeed the case i noted that there was big stuff going on in ukraine like a war with russia and ambassador sondland replied that he meant big stuff that benefits the president like the biden investigation that mr giuliani was pushing fictional narrative the british born hill is a russia expert who s written extensively on the kremlin and she made that clear from the outset when she scolded republican lawmakers for propagating what she said was a fictional narrative that somehow ukraine not russia interfered in the 2016 u s presidential election those discredited theories have been advanced by trump himself who in a july 25 phone call at the center of the impeachment inquiry asked ukraine s leader to investigate the possibility hill said the unwillingness by some to accept russia s role has profound consequences at a time when russia s security services have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election putin she said deploys millions of dollars to weaponize our own political opposition research and false narratives when we are consumed by partisan rancor we cannot combat these external forces as they seek to divide us against each another degrade our institutions and destroy the faith of the american people in our democracy hill said at another point she implored impeachment investigators and the country at large to stop advancing fictions that she said distract from the attention needed to fight russian interference in the course of this investigation i would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance russian interests hill said it was crazy on the first day of hearings democrats called on bill taylor a west point graduate vietnam veteran and career diplomat who was recruited out of retirement to serve as a top diplomat in ukraine taylor was unsparing and colorful in his characterization of making military aid to ukraine contingent on the country announcing investigations into the 2016 u s election he was presented with oversized images of a september text message exchange with two other envoys in which he said it would be crazy to withhold military assistance to ukraine in exchange for that nation investigating trump s political rival those text messages were the among the first documentary pieces of evidence to become public as part of the house impeachment inquiry and established not only the possible contours of a quid pro quo but also laid bare diplomatic concerns about the trump administration s dealings with ukraine it was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do taylo
