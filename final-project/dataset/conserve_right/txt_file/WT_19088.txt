productive saying it shed light on the russia probe but offered up scant details i can say on a number of topics he testified about yesterday we were able to go into great detail but we ve also

based development company was the go between for the trump tower project that project has drawn scrutiny from democrats who see it as evidence of mr trump s connections to russia it has also dogged

statements to financial institutions as bank fraud in his plea agreement cohen did plead guilty to making false statements to a financial institution but not specifically bank fraud thursday s revelations followed a bombshell public hearing wednesday while cohen failed to deliver democrats the connection between mr trump and russia they sought he did tell lawmakers his ex boss praise of
