difficulties that s not a good feeling trump said as he departed the white house for new jersey adding i knew the speech very well so i was able to do it without a teleprompter in his speech trump avoided diversions into his agenda or reelection campaign but in one exception he vowed very soon we will plant the american flag on mars actually a distant goal not likely to be achieved until late in the 2020s if even then a late afternoon downpour drenched the capital s independence day crowds and trump s speech unfolded in occasional rain the warplanes and presidential aircraft he had summoned conducted their flyovers as planned capped by the navy blue angels aerobatics team by adding his own one hour salute to america production to capital festivities that typically draw hundreds of thousands of people anyway trump became the first president in nearly seven decades to address a crowd at the national mall on the fourth of july protesters objecting to what they saw as his co opting of the holiday inflated a roly poly balloon depicting trump as an angry diaper clad baby trump set aside a historic piece of real estate a stretch of the mall from the lincoln monument to the midpoint of the reflecting pool for a mix of invited military members republican and trump campaign donors and other bigwigs it s where martin luther king jr gave his i have a dream speech barack obama and trump held inaugural concerts and protesters swarmed into the water when supporters of richard nixon put on a july 4 1970 celebration with the president sending taped remarks from california aides to the crowd obsessed trump fretted about the prospect of empty seats at his event said a person familiar with the planning who was not authorized to be identified aides scrambled in recent days to distribute tickets and mobilize the trump and republican social media accounts to encourage participation for an event hastily arranged and surrounded with confusion back at the white house trump tweeted an aerial photo showing an audience that filled both sides of the memorial s reflecting pool and stretched to the washington monument a great crowd of tremendous patriots this evening all the way back to the washington monument he said many who filed into the sprawling vip section said they got their free tickets from members of congress or from friends or neighbors who couldn t use theirs outside that zone a diverse mix of visitors locals veterans tour groups immigrant families and more milled about some drawn by trump some by curiosity some by the holiday s regular activities along the mall protesters earlier made their voices heard in sweltering heat by the washington monument along the traditional parade route and elsewhere while the vip section at the reflecting pool served as something of a buffer for trump s event in the shadow of the washington monument hours before trump s speech the anti war organization codepink erected a 20 foot tall 6 meter tall trump baby balloon to protest what activists saw as his intrusion in independence day and a focus on military might that they associate with martial regimes we think that he is making this about himself and it s really a campaign rally said medea benjamin the organization s co director we think that he s a big baby he s erratic he s prone to tantrums he doesn t understand the consequences of his actions and so this is a great symbol of how we feel about our president the balloon remained tied down at the mall because park officials restricted the group s permission to move it or fill it with helium benjamin said protesters also handed out small trump baby balloons on sticks molly king of la porte indiana a 13 year old trump supporter in sunglasses and a make america great again hat happily came away with one they re making a big stink about it but it s actually pretty cute she said i mean why not love your president as you d love a baby a small crowd gathered to take pictures with the big balloon which drew trump supporters and detractors even though everybody has different opinions said kevin malton a trump supporter from middlesboro kentucky everybody s getting along but daniela guray a 19 year old from chicago who held a dump trump sign said she was subjected to a racial epithet while walking along the constitution avenue parade route and told to go home she said she did not go to the mall to protest but ended up doing so i started seeing all the tanks with all the protests and that s when i said wait this is not an actual fourth of july she said trump is making it his day rather than the fourth of july trump had sounded a defensive note wednesday tweeting that the cost will be very little compared to what it is worth but he glossed over a host of expenses associated with the display of military might including flying in planes and tanks and other vehicles to washington by rail not since 1951 when president harry truman spoke before a large gathering on the washington monument grounds to mark the 175th anniversary of the signing of the declaration of independence has a commander in chief made an independence day speech to a sizable crowd on the mall pete buttigieg one of the democrats running for president said this business of diverting money and military assets to use them as a kind of prop to prop up a presidential ego is not reflecting well on our country buttigieg the mayor of south bend indiana is a navy reserve veteran who served in afghanistan in 2014 two groups the national parks conservation foundation and democracy forward want the interior department s internal watchdog to investigate what they say may be a potentially unlawful decision to divert national parks money to trump s spectacle trump has longed for a public

celebration for decades featuring a parade along constitution avenue a concert on the capitol lawn with music by the national symphony orchestra and fireworks beginning at dusk near the washington monument trump altered the lineup by adding his speech moving the fireworks closer to the lincoln memorial and summoning the tanks and warplanes amid all the theatrics trump did pay tribute to the
