apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic phnom penh cambodia ap norodom sihanouk the revered and often mercurial former king and independence hero who helped navigate cambodia through a half century of war genocide and upheaval died monday in beijing he was 89 throughout a life of shifting loyalties and sometimes exile sihanouk saw his southeast asian nation transformed from colony to kingdom from u s backed regime to u s bombing zone from khmer rouge killing field to what it remains today a fragile experiment in democracy first crowned king by the french in 1941 at the age of 18 sihanouk ruled as a feudal style absolute monarch but called himself a democrat he was a cunning political survivor and a colorfully eccentric playboy with a passion for film directing a man who sang love songs at elaborate state dinners brought his french poodle to peace talks and charmed such foreign dignitaries as jacqueline kennedy top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time when the murderous khmer rouge seized power in the 1970s he was reviled as a collaborator yet he himself ended up as their prisoner and lost five of his children to the regime later in the 1990s after a u n brokered deal to end cambodia s long civil war he recast himself as a peacemaker and constitutional monarch sihanouk had had been in china since january to receive medical treatment for a variety of illnesses he had suffered in recent years including colon cancer diabetes and hypertension prince sisowath thomico a royal family member who also was sihanouk s assistant and nephew said the former king suffered a heart attack at a beijing hospital and died before dawn monday his death was a great loss to cambodia prince thomico said adding that sihanouk had dedicated his life for the sake of his entire nation country and for the cambodian people sihanouk had abdicated the throne in 2004 citing his poor health the move paved the way for his son norodom sihamoni to take his place on monday sihamoni flew to china with prime minister hun sen to retrieve sihanouk s body state flags flew at half staff and cambodian government spokesman khieu kanharith said an official funeral would be held once the former king s body is repatriated no date has been set while officials said they expected as many as 100 000 to line the route from the airport to the royal palace for the return of sihanouk s body the immediate reaction in the capital seemed muted partly because it was a holiday which took many people out of town one of those mourning was 67 year old yos sekchantha who said she offered prayers that his soul would rest in peace i don t know much about politics but the king father was really a good leader and cared about his county and people she said as tears welled in her eyes but many cambodians are too young to have emotional ties to a man who in the past two decades has been overshadowed by hun sen the country s current political strongman in january sihanouk requested he be cremated in the cambodian and buddhist tradition he asked that his ashes be put in an urn preferably made of gold and placed in a stupa at the royal palace born oct 31 1922 sihanouk enjoyed a pampered childhood in french colonial indochina in 1941 the french crowned him king instead of other relatives closer in line to the throne because they thought the pudgy giggling prince would be easy to control they were the first of many to underestimate him and by 1953 the french were out in 1955 sihanouk stepped down from the throne organized a mass political party and went on to hold various positions as head of state through those years he steered cambodia toward uneasy neutrality at the height of the cold war and was founder of the non aligned movement in 1965 he broke off relations with washington as u s involvement in the vietnam war shifted into high gear but by 1969 worried about increasing vietnamese communist use of cambodian soil he made new overtures to america and turned against china sihanouk s top priority was to keep cambodia out of the war but he could not u s aircraft bombed vietnamese communist sanctuaries in cambodia with increasing regularity and his protests were ignored internally cambodia was a one man show sihanouk s sharpest critics accused him of running a medieval state as an ancient khmer ruler reincarnated in western dress i am sihanouk he once said and all cambodians are my children sihanouk was a ruthless politician talented dilettante and tireless playboy caught up in endless almost childlike enthusiasms he made movies painted composed music fielded a palace soccer team and led his own jazz band his large appetite extended to fast cars food and women he married at least five times some say six and fathered 14 children nonetheless many adored sihanouk as a near deity in 1970 sihanouk was overthrown in a u s backed coup that came while he was abroad on a trip that included a stay at a french weight loss clinic he spent years of lonely if lavish exile in beijing seeking to regain the throne he joined the khmer rouge dominated rebels after his overthrow they had numbered only a few hundred until then but his presence gave them a legitimacy they had never before enjoyed the alliance left sihanouk open to subsequent criticism that he opened the way for the khmer rouge holocaust but his relations with the rebels were always strained the khmer rouge do not like me at all and i know that ooh la la it is clear to me he said in a 1973 interview when they no longer need me they will spit me out like a cherry pit when the khmer rouge seized power in 1975 sihanouk returned home but he was detained and the former rebels ordered his execution only the personal intervention of chinese leader zhou enlai saved him with sihanouk under house arrest in the royal palace the khmer rouge ran an ultraradical maoist regime from 1975 to 1979 emptying the cities to create a vast forced labor camp an estimated 1 7 million cambodians were executed or died of disease and hunger under their rule vietnam invaded in 1978 and toppled the khmer rouge freed as the vietnamese advanced on phnom penh sihanouk found exile in beijing and north korea from there he headed an unlikely coalition of three guerrilla groups fighting the vietnamese installed puppet government the war lasted a decade sihanouk remained a unifying figure though going on to lead the u n supported interim structure that ran cambodia until 1993 elections the same year sihanouk reascended the throne in a traditional khmer coronation restored to his palace and traveling the countryside with personal bodyguards on loan from north korea he assumed a new role as beloved father of the country even though many adoring older cambodians expressed hope for a return of his previous direct rule but the bright promise of the elections soon faded four years after the polls hun sen launched a violent coup and he remains in power to this day in the last years of his life sihanouk s profile and influence receded while older people in the countryside still held him in reverence the young generation regarded him as a figure of the past and one partly responsible for cambodia s tragedy rarely at a loss for words he became for a time a prolific blogger posting his musings on current affairs and past controversies most of his writing was literally in his own hand his site featured images of letters usually in french in a cramped cursive script along with handwritten marginalia to news clippings that caught his interest his production tailed off however as he retreated further from the public eye spending more and more time under doctor s care in beijing the hard living sihanouk had suffered ill health since the early 1990s he endured cancer a brain lesion and arterial heart lung liver and eye ailments in late 2011 on his return from another extended stay in china sihanouk dramatically declared that he never intended to leave his homeland again but true to his mercurial reputation he flew off to beijing just a few months later for medical care associated press writers kay
