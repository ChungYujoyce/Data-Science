tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn palm beach fla ap threatening drastic action against mexico president donald trump declared friday he is likely to shut down america s southern border next week unless mexican authorities immediately halt all illegal immigration such a severe move could hit the economies of both countries but the president emphasized i am not kidding around it could mean all trade with mexico trump said when questioned by reporters in florida we will close it for a long time trump has been promising for more than two years to build a long impenetrable wall along the border to stop illegal immigration though congress has been reluctant to provide the money he needs in the meantime he has repeatedly threatened to close the border but this time with a new surge of migrants heading north he gave a definite timetable top stories trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots a substantial closure could have an especially heavy impact on cross border communities from san diego to south texas as well as supermarkets that sell mexican produce factories that rely on imported parts and other businesses across the u s the u s and mexico trade about 1 7 billion in goods daily according to the u s chamber of commerce which said closing the border would be an unmitigated economic debacle that would threaten 5 million american jobs trump tweeted friday morning if mexico doesn t immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states through our southern border i will be closing the border or large sections of the border next week in florida he didn t qualify his threat with or large sections stating there is a very good likelihood i ll be closing the border next week and that is just fine with me he said several times that it would be so easy for mexican authorities to stop immigrants passing through their country and trying to enter the u s illegally but they just take our money and talk homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen suggested trump was referring to the ongoing surge of mostly central american families heading north through mexico many people who cross the border illegally ultimately request asylum under u s law which does not require asylum seekers to enter at an official crossing short of a widespread shutdown nielsen said the u s might close designated ports of entry to re deploy staff to help process parents and children ports of entry are official crossing points that are used by residents and commercial vehicles if we have to close ports to take care of all of the numbers who are coming we will do that nielsen said so it s on the table but what we re doing is a very structured process based on operational needs the white house did not immediately respond to questions about whether trump s possible action would apply to air travel trump s latest declaration came after mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador said his country was doing its part to fight migrant smuggling criminal networks charge thousands of dollars a person to move migrants through mexico increasingly in large groups toward remote sections of the border we want to have a good relationship with the government of the united states lopez obrador said friday he added we are going to continue helping so that the migratory flow those who pass through our country do so according to the law in an orderly way marcelo ebrard mexico s foreign relations secretary tweeted that his country doesn t act based on threats and is the best neighbor the u s could have customs and border protection commissioner kevin mcaleenan said wednesday that 750 border inspectors would be reassigned to deal with the growing number of migrant families and the dhs official said friday that the department was seeking volunteers from other agencies to help in florida trump was also asked about the two migrant children who died in u s custody in december is the administration equipped to handle sick children who are detained i think that it has been very well stated that we have done a fantastic job he said defending border patrol efforts to help the children trump said that in one of the cases the father gave the child no water for a long period of time although an autopsy released friday made no mention of dehydration it was a very tough situation and that trek up that s a long hard trek he said it s a horrible situation but mexico could stop it democratic and republican lawmakers have fought over trump s contention that there is a crisis at the border particularly amid his push for a border wall which he claims will solve immigration problems though a wall wouldn t keep out families who cross at official points so they can surrender and be detained the president called on congress to immediately change what he said were weak u s immigration laws which he blamed on democrats the department of homeland security wants the authority to detain families for longer and more quickly deport children from central america who arrive at the border on their own the department argues those policy changes would stop families from trying to enter the u s alejandra mier y teran executive director of the otay mesa chamber of commerce in san diego said the mere threat of border closures sends the wrong message to businesses in mexico and may eventually scare companies into turning to asia for their supply chains i think the impact would be absolutely devastating on so many fronts said mier y teran whose members rely on the otay mesa crossing to bring televisions medical devices and a wide range of products to the u s in terms of a long term effect it s basically shooting yourself in your foot it s sending out a message to other countries that don t come because our borders may not work at any time that is extremely scary and dangerous nomaan merchant reported from houston associated press writers peter orsi in mexico city elliot spagat in san diego jill colvin in grand
