a police siege of the campus entered its third day police played a waiting game after 10 days of some of the most intense protests the city has seen in more than five months of often violent unrest the government has stood firm rejecting most of the protesters demands even as they shut down major roads and trains during rush hour every day last week turned several university campuses into fortresses and blocked a major road tunnel which remained shut tuesday top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free

in hong kong for striking down a ban on wearing face masks at the protests china has taken a tough line on the protests and said that restoring order is the city s highest priority protesters have left all the universities except hong kong polytechnic where several hundred barricaded themselves in and fought back police barrages of tear gas and water cannons with gasoline bombs some launched from rooftop by catapult and bows and arrows those still at polytechnic are the last holdouts surrounded they now face arrest several groups have tried to escape including one that slid down hoses from an overpass to waiting motorcycles but it didn t appear that many evaded arrest about 600 had left by tuesday morning city leader carrie lam said leaving an estimated 100 still inside they milled about in small groups they still had boxes of homemade gasoline bombs but the mood was grim in the trash strewn plazas in contrast to the excitement as they prepared to take on police just a few days earlier one protester said he had no plan and was waiting for someone to come to help another said he wants to leave safely but without being charged they would not give their full names out of fear of arrest we will use whatever means to continue to persuade and arrange for these remaining protesters to leave the campus as soon as possible so that this whole operation could end in a peaceful manner lam told reporters after a weekly meeting with advisers even as the latest bout of violence winds down a fundamental divide suggests the protests are far from over city leaders say the violence must stop before meaningful dialogue can begin the protesters say they need to keep escalating the violence to get the government to accept their demands the protests took off in june over a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland china for trial activists saw the legislation as part of a continuing erosion of rights and freedoms that hong kong was

demonstrations and fully democratic elections among other demands about 200 of the 600 people who have left polytechnic were under 18 years old the city agreed not to arrest them immediately but lam said they could face charges later family members and teachers arrived sporadically tuesday to pick up a few remaining protesters under 18 hugging their children before walking back to a police checkpoint where officers recorded names and other information before letting them go an ambulance team was allowed in to treat injured protesters wrapping them in emergency blankets to keep them warm some left with the team but others stayed saying they didn t want to be arrested other parents holding a news conference said their children dare not surrender because the government has labelled them as rioters even though some had just gotten trapped by the police siege they wore masks and refused to give their names a sign of the fear that has developed in what has become a highly polarized city

from the national people s congress legislative affairs commission said the decision doesn t conform with territory s constitution known as the basic law or decisions by the congress we are currently studying opinions and suggestions raised by some npc deputies the statement said monday s ruling said the ban infringes on fundamental rights more than is reasonably necessary the ban has been widely
