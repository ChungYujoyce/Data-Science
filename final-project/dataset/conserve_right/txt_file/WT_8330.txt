apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic face masks have become a hot commodity selling out at numerous pharmacies and medical supply stores including in the washington area because of fears of china s coronavirus that is spreading rapidly across asia and worldwide chinese officials have reported more than 31 000 cases since the outbreak began in december about two dozen countries have confirmed more than 260 infections including 12 cases in the u s officials say the virus risk to americans is low and that many people don t use face masks correctly but pharmacies and other stores say they can t keep up with demand top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk in northeast washington the reliance pharmacy on minnesota avenue ran out of face masks last week because it didn t have any backups at its warehouses a cvs store on bladensburg road hasn t had face masks in stock for two weeks we re working with our suppliers to meet customer demand for face masks said mary owens a company spokeswoman for cvs this demand may cause shortages at some store locations and we are resupplying those stores as quickly as possible an employee at medical supply superstore in alexandria virginia who asked to remain anonymous said the store ran out of supplies because all of its face masks are made in china the country at the epicenter of the outbreak they re not making any masks because they re keeping people away from work and not exporting them because people need them he said it s going to be awhile until we get them he said he has seen a higher demand for face masks since the coronavirus outbreak and gets about seven or eight calls a day from people who want to buy them soaring demand reflects the global panic over the coronavirus which can cause acute respiratory distress and organ failure it has killed at least 633 in mainland china one person in hong kong and one person in the philippines who was a resident of wuhan the chinese city in hubei province where the outbreak began chinese doctor li wenliang a whistleblower credited with raising the alarm about a sars like virus in wuhan in december only to face resistance from police was infected by the coronavirus and died early friday local time although the coronavirus panic has turned face masks into trending accessories health professionals say they do little to protect against respiratory illnesses face masks have marginal value in preventing infection they are loose fitting and people often stick their hands underneath them to scratch their mouth or their noses said amesh adalja a senior scholar at the johns hopkins university center for health security dr william schaffner an infectious disease specialist at vanderbilt university said the science supporting the idea that wearing face masks protects against respiratory illnesses is very scanty he said face masks aren t made to stop the transmission of respiratory illnesses but to prevent surgeons from spreading bacteria from their noses and mouths to patients they re not designed to protect us dr schaffner said the masks themselves are relatively speaking thin and the fit is not all that tight around the edges so we breathe around the edges the best way to avoid infection is to wash hands avoid touching the face and get a flu shot he said lawrence gostin a professor of global health law at georgetown university noted that the centers for disease control and prevention hasn t encouraged americans to strap on masks the risk is too low in the u s to justify their use and people are indeed hoarding he said d c medical supply and uniforms along georgia avenue was one of the stores that still had face masks on its shelves thursday but they were selling out quickly the store sold about 700 masks in two days said rakhmel rafi the chief operations officer he added that sales demand and prices of face masks have risen because of overbuying a box of 50 masks used to cost about 10 to 15 he said but now sells for 25 because of limited supply higher demand and additional expenses from suppliers to ship the products to the store mr rafi said he has been able to stock up but the masks sell out quickly he estimates that five people a day visit his store to buy face masks up from a couple of customers a week before the coronavirus outbreak on tuesday his store had 1 000 face masks in stock but a steady string of customers and a large company that buys masks for export have reduced the supply to 300 u s and global health officials said they are working to make sure labs and front line workers don t have shortfalls in the tools they need to identify and combat the coronavirus the cdc said thursday that it is sending 200 kits to u s and international labs that want to test for the coronavirus the kits can detect the virus from upper and lower respiratory specimens saliva and mucus basically within four hours within just weeks of the outbreak s beginning cdc scientists were able to develop a test that is now being distributed to state and local health departments so they can confirm cases of the virus here in the united states health and human services secretary alex azar said thursday in a state of the department address each kit can test 700 to 800 specimens from patients according to the cdc which plans to prepare additional kits the world health organization meanwhile has requested 675 million to combat the virus especially in places that have weak health care systems and may be unprepared to respond to cases officials also want to make sure doctors and nurses are well equipped to face patients the last thing we need at this point is the front line workers becoming victims themselves of this disease said mike ryan executive director of who s emergencies program who said scientists and public health agencies will gather for two days in geneva next week to discuss the source of the virus and its genetic sequence they will share biological samples and explore ways to fast track diagnostic tests vaccines and medicines who director general tedros ghebreyesus said scientists still don t know the virus natural reservoir where it typically lives and reproduces and no vaccine or effective therapeutic is available for it yet to put it bluntly we re shadow boxing he said we need to bring this virus out into the light so we can attack it properly dr li the wuhan doctor who reportedly died as a result of the virus received an outpouring of praise for being one of the first people to shine a spotlight on the danger he told his former medical school classmates online about patients suffering from a mysterious pneumonia condition brought to wuhan central hospital which issued a statement confirming his death critics of china s response to the outbreak say the authorities decision to detain dr li in january for rumormongering held back the response dr li wenliang s courage and professionalism make him a champion of the
