tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion nancy pelosi could be living out her golden years in peace and comfort but she chose to run for speaker of the house again and now she has a full blown political challenge that is rapidly worsening it would be truly ironic if mrs pelosi ends up preventing president trump from being impeached by the house top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century until now she has poured cold water on the prospect nearly every time she has been asked about it i have zero doubt that she desperately wants mr trump removed from office but she s savvy to look at the choice in a dispassionate way as of now 56 democratic members of the house wish to begin an impeachment inquiry they are deeply frustrated that their committees have made no real progress in their investigations of the president witnesses have refused to appear because of the claim of executive privilege the committees have not received mr trump s tax documents and now special counsel robert mueller will not be voluntarily appearing before congress and if he does appear under subpoena he has pledged to read from his report rather than answer questions extemporaneously mrs pelosi s statements about the president that he has overseen a cover up have no basis in reality there was nothing to cover up as the mueller report clearly states the president did not fire mr mueller he was well within his authority to fire fbi director james comey either step would meet the obstruction threshold only if a corrupt intent could be proven which has not happened mrs pelosi s central dilemma is the following she wants to give the congressional investigations time but the longer she waits to begin the impeachment inquiry the worse it will be for the democrats politically roughly 40 democrats won seats in swing districts exactly 31 of them are representing seats that mr trump won in 2016 these members do not benefit from an impeachment inquiry their vote on impeachment is guaranteed to harm them politically in 2020 mrs pelosi appears most interested in letting committee investigations continue until public opinion moves in their direction but the inconvenient truth is that a clear majority of the country opposes impeachment apart from the politics it s a fundamentally pointless endeavor as a senate trial would require 20 republicans joining all of the democrats to remove the president from office this is an impossibly high bar especially in light of the mueller report exonerating the president on conspiracy if mrs pelosi wants to minimize the political downside of impeachment for her vulnerable incumbents she should begin the inquiry yesterday every day that passes brings the issue closer to the 2020 election even though it is only early june congress has fewer than 30 legislative days remaining before we know it 2020 will be here and the political calculation for the speaker will become even more perilous on the merits the argument for impeaching the president is stunningly weak additionally mrs pelosi has said she will not begin an impeachment inquiry until there is bipartisan support but there will never be bipartisan support for impeaching the president every week more democratic house members will join the impeachment chorus how much longer can she hold them back how much longer can she resist her rabid base how much longer can she improbably shield the president from the fate she desperately wants for him an impeachment inquiry will begin at some point she will be unable to prevent it she will relent the longer she waits the worse it is for the democratic party matt mackowiak is president of austin texas and washington d c based potomac strategy group he s a republican consultant a bush administration and bush cheney reelection campaign veteran and former press secretary to two u s
