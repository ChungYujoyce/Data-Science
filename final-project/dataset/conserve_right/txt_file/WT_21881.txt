apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump is responsible for the most anti lgbtq administration in modern history according to the center for american progress winnie stachelberg whose assertion astounds openly gay conservative activist charles moran are you kidding me said mr moran national spokesman for the log cabin republicans when president bill clinton signed don t ask don t tell and the defense of marriage act when donald trump is the first president ever elected who supports marriage equality are you kidding in fact he said mr trump is arguably the most pro gay republican the most pro gay president ever elected to office providing the parameters on the chasm between the left and the right when it comes to the president s record on lgbtq issues top stories cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century that tension erupted last week after the log cabin republicans endorsed mr trump s reelection touching off a liberal outcry jon cooper chair of the democratic coalition against trump called the move despicable and log cabin board member jennifer horn resigned monday in protest he doesn t care if he has to divide on racial lines on ethnic lines on education lines he will divide and damage and destroy this country in any manner he thinks he needs to to advance his own political power ms horn said on msnbc she said she did not vote for mr trump in 2016 meanwhile the president told reporters tuesday at the white house that he was very honored to receive the log cabin endorsement he touted his support from prominent gay conservatives such as billionaire tech investor peter thiel some of my biggest supporters are of that community and i talk to them a lot about it mr trump said i think i ve done really very well with that community as you know peter thiel and so many others they re with me all the way and they like the job i m doing and i just got a big endorsement from the log cabin group gay conservatives based their support on more than the r after mr trump s name log cabin did not endorse mr trump in 2016 but did so this year after what mr moran described as near unanimous support from the group s 50 chapters the group cited the administration s goal of ending the nation s hiv aids epidemic in 10 years which mr trump announced during his state of the union address in february and his initiative to decriminalize homosexuality globally led by u s ambassador to germany richard grenell who is openly gay mr trump has installed a second openly gay diplomat u s ambassador to nepal randy berry mr trump has nominated two openly lgbtq people for the federal bench one of them mary m rowland was confirmed this month for a seat on the u s district court for the northern district of illinois the second patrick j bumatay has a nomination pending before the senate liberal lgbtq advocates argue that those judiciary bright spots are outweighed by nominees deemed anti gay such as u s circuit judge kyle duncan a former general counsel for the becket fund for religious liberty and u s district judge matthew j kacsmaryk who served as deputy general counsel of the first liberty institute most of the outrage however has been directed at the administration s push to reverse the obama administration s addition of gender identity to federal anti discrimination rules in areas including housing health care and contracting often in the interest of protecting religious freedom in a case before the supreme court the justice department has argued that title vii of the civil rights act does not prohibit discrimination based on transgender status pitting the department against the equal employment opportunity commission the national center for transgender equality maintains a list of anti transgender and anti lgbtq actions taken by what it calls the discrimination administration the tally includes more than 40 decisions so far t his administration straight up doesn t think the lgbtq community should have rights and they re deploying every strategy to ensure that that doesn t happen ms stachelberg said on a press call and we need to fight back at every turn the log cabin republicans don t agree with everything mr trump does they have urged him to change his mind on banning transgender troops but they also believe he has benefited the lgbtq community in ways that go beyond policy by building bridges with conservatives as the first president to back same sex marriage before he was elected mr trump all but took the issue off the table for republicans even though the party platform supports traditional marriage at the height of the transgender bathroom debate he gave caitlyn jenner carte blanche at trump tower donald trump went to several gay weddings he supported marriage equality when he was elected and even on issues like transgender bathrooms donald trump said caitlyn jenner can use whatever bathroom she wants to said mr moran and he shut that debate down critics were quick to point out that the trump administration also rescinded in 2017 an obama era guidance on transgender bathroom access for students and moved the issue to the states in october ms jenner penned an op ed saying she was wrong about her previous support for mr trump the reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president she wrote moving in the opposite direction was brandon straka the openly gay new york hairstylist who founded walkaway campaign an effort to persuade democrats to leave the party he said the catalyst was mr trump s 2016 election victory which started him on a political journey that led him to sever his democratic allegiance in 2017 since then mr straka has held numerous town halls including three for the lgbtq community one issue that resonates with gay voters is illegal immigration he said given that an unknown number of those crossing the southern border hail from nations where homosexuality remains a crime that s a factor for a lot of people too mr straka said they recognize we re very lucky to be lgbtq people in america and if we open up our borders then america might not be america anymore and we won t be safe he made a bit of history this month when he appeared as a warm up speaker at a trump rally in cincinnati not long ago he said he would have been terrified to discuss lgbtq issues before a make america great again crowd but he was met with cheers and chants of walk away i almost started crying because i ended it by saying i had a message directly for president trump which was if you hadn t been elected president i never would have changed i would still be a liberal mr straka recalled he also had a message for lgbtq americans i told them i m asking you to do something that may be the hardest thing you ll ever have to do let go of the past forgive and learn to have faith in your fellow man again and everyone erupted
