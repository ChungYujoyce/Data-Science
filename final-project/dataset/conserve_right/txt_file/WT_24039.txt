apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap assailed by his ex lawyer at every turn president donald trump nevertheless claimed a measure of vindication from michael cohen s statement that he possessed no direct evidence of collusion with russia from his time serving the boss but contrary to trump s words cohen did not exonerate him on the matter in his testimony to lawmakers trump also put the best face on his summit with north korean leader kim jong un claiming he had a really productive time in hanoi vietnam despite the collapse of talks and cancellation of a planned signing agreement more substantively he claimed the talks broke down because north korea insisted on the lifting of all sanctions an assertion contradicted by the state department as well as by the north koreans on other recent rhetorical fronts the president credited his daughter with creating jobs that don t exist and democrats persisted in their distorted accusation that the trump administration confined migrant children in cages top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender a review cohen testimony trump he said no collusion and i was you know a little impressed by that frankly could ve he could ve gone all out he only went about 95 percent instead of 100 percent hanoi news conference thursday the facts he takes cohen s comment too far cohen did not clear his former boss on the question of whether his campaign colluded with russia to influence the 2016 election in the course of implicating trump in other alleged criminal activity cohen said he did not witness or know directly of collusion but i have my suspicions he didn t say no collusion cohen told lawmakers so as i stated in my testimony i wouldn t use the word colluding was there something odd about the back and forth praise with president putin yes but i m not really sure that i can answer that question in terms of collusion i was not part of the campaign i don t know the other conversations that mr trump had with other individuals there is just so many dots that all seem to lead to the same direction and the questions have been raised about whether i know of direct evidence that mr trump or his campaign colluded with russia i do not and i want to be clear but i have my suspicions rep jim jordan top republican on the house oversight and reform committee remember how all this started the clinton campaign hired perkins coie law firm who hired glenn simpson who hired a foreigner christopher steele who put together the fake dossier that the fbi used to go get a warrant to spy on the trump campaign remarks wednesday at hearing with cohen the facts he s repeating a false claim by trump that special counsel robert mueller s russia probe is based on a fake dossier the fbi s investigation actually began months before it received a dossier of anti trump research financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign the fbi probe s origins were based on other evidence not the existence of the dossier which has not been discredited last year the republican controlled house intelligence committee found the russia probe was initiated after the fbi received information related to trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos not the dossier the committee s final report was praised by trump north korea trump on his summit we had a really i think a very productive time post summit hanoi news conference the facts the talks fell apart lunch was canceled a signing ceremony scrapped and trump said another meeting with kim may not be for a long time before he left to come home two hours early moreover they came away disagreeing about what they had disagreed about trump basically they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn t do that hanoi news conference the facts a senior state department official said north korea demanded trump s support for the lifting of u n security council sanctions imposed since march 2016 not other sanctions the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the private negotiations although north korea wants all sanctions erased the official said kim was pressing for relief from ones that impede the civilian economy and was not demanding an end to sanctions on armaments altogether kim was seeking substantial relief insisting bans be lifted on trade in goods and commodities such as metals raw materials luxury items seafood coal exports refined petroleum imports and raw petroleum imports but he did not insist that sanctions be lifted in their entirety as trump asserted migrant children rep elijah cummings democratic chairman of house oversight and reform committee on trump i want him when he goes out there and he does things i want him to think about children i want him to think about the children that he separated from their parents i want him to think about the fact that we had children in cages remarks wednesday to reporters the facts he s echoing a democratic talking point that seizes on a visceral image of kids in cages as evidence of trump administration cruelty but the claim lacks context the cages are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them for migrant children too children are held behind the fences inside border patrol facilities obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children in such a manner in 2014 during a surge of migrant children at the border images that circulated online of children in chain link pens during the height of trump s family separations controversy and blamed on him were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are generally held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol they then go into the custody of the health and human services department and are housed in shelters until they are placed with sponsors in the u s usually parents or close relatives some children who are with their families will go into family detention or will be released with their family into the country as their immigration cases play out the homeland security department s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found the facilities appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children have been immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally border drugs ninety percent of the drugs don t come through the port of entry ninety percent of the drugs and the big stuff goes out to the desert makes a left and goes where you don t have any wall remarks to governors monday the facts not true according to federal findings that trump repeatedly ignores the majority of drugs crossing the southern border comes in at land ports of entry not territory between them the drug enforcement administration customs and border protection and other agencies rely on vast surveillance capabilities intelligence from informants and other sources seizure data and other evidence to reach that conclusion on seizures alone fully 90 percent of heroin crossing u s borders was intercepted at entry ports not territory between them and similar percentages of other drugs methamphetamines cocaine and fentanyl were also seized at these checkpoints u s officials say marijuana is an exception primarily smuggled between entry ports trump justifies his declaration of an emergency at the border in part by citing a need to stop drug shipments most of which in fact would not be impeded by any wall in trump s telling vehicles full of drugs invariably make a left after crossing some remote stretch of the border customs and border protection deploys about 23 000 personnel at airports land crossings and seaports and close to 20 000 between entry ports ivanka trump trump my daughter has created millions of jobs i don t know if anyone knows that but she s created millions of jobs last year my administration created the council for american worker and launched the pledge of america s workers where we ve gained commitments from private sector leaders to hire and train more than 6 5 million americans think of it 6 5 million and these are jobs that for the most part would not have happened remarks to governors monday the facts actually trump s daughter ivanka a white house adviser did not create millions of jobs nor did the white house council for the american worker which she helps lead create 6 5 million jobs as trump suggests trump established the council by executive order in july it is aimed in part at getting companies to sign onto a pledge to give students and workers more job training and skills development opportunities in the face of impending automation two hundred companies have since agreed to the pledge offering training opportunities that total more than 6 5 million according to the white house but the training opportunities are neither actual job openings nor are they being immediately provided the white house describes the programs as opportunities over the next five years including apprenticeships and work based learning continuing education on the job training and reskilling fentanyl dangers trump on the dangers of fentanyl a little tiny spoonful can wipe out a state it s hard to believe it can wipe out an entire state a spoonful of this stuff remarks to governors monday the facts it can t fentanyl can be extraordinarily lethal as well as addictive the drug enforcement administration cited evidence in a case last year that 1 gram of fentanyl can kill 300 people to 500 people the case involved a belleville illinois man convicted in texas of trafficking nearly 12 kilograms 26 pounds of the drug which the agency says is enough to kill up to 5 8 million people a teaspoon generally holds 4 grams to 6 grams depending on the dry substance equating to a theoretical death toll from fentanyl of 1 200 to 3 000 far from trump s claim that an amount that small can wipe out an entire state that s because the state with the smallest population wyoming has about 578 000 people it would take close to 200 teaspoons to kill a population of that size nato trump we ve picked up over a 100 billion just in nato over the last two years a hundred billion dollars more has come in hanoi news conference the facts his numbers are off and the notion that more money has come in is misleading the nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said on feb 15 that nato allies in europe and canada had spent an additional 41 billion on their own defense since 2016 and that by the end of 2020 that figure would rise to 100 billion so the 100 billion refers to additional military spending over a four year period not over the past two years trump typically frames the issue as one of money being paid to the u s or to nato itself in reality it s a matter of how much each country in the alliance spends on its own military capabilities their increased spending is meant to lessen dependence on the u s for the defense of member countries in 2014 during the obama administration nato members agreed to move toward spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on their own defense by 2024 trump s pressure may have spurred some countries to increase their spending faster than they planned or to become more serious about moving to the 2 percent goal harry reid trump former senator harry reid he got thrown out is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career tweet monday the facts reid wasn t thrown out of office by voters fellow democrats or anyone he retired the longtime senate democratic leader announced in march 2015 that he would not seek another term and would retire after five terms citing in part health concerns after falling while exercising and suffering serious bruises and a lasting injury to his right eye reid who was 75 at the time said he would serve out the rest of his term in the senate which he in fact did retiring in january 2017 now he s been dealing with pancreatic cancer voter fraud senate majority leader mitch mcconnell now for years and years every republican who dared to call for commonsense safeguards for americans ballots was demonized by democrats and their allies we were hit with left wing talking points insisting that voter fraud wasn t real that fraud just didn t happen that modest efforts to ensure that voters are who they say they are and are voting in the proper place were really some sinister right wing plot as you might expect now that an incident of very real voter fraud has become national news and the republican candidate seems to have benefited these long standing democrat talking points have quieted i ve been focused for decades on protecting the integrity of our elections remarks in the senate on tuesday the facts mcconnell suggested the election debacle in north carolina could have been prevented by republican efforts including his own to fight voter fraud with voter id laws and he blamed democrats for inaction on the issue but the republican drive to require people to show identification when they show up to vote is not on point to what happened in north carolina the case of malfeasance involving republican mark harris congressional campaign in november focused on absentee mail in ballot fraud not voter impersonation at the ballot box voter ids are powerless to stop mail in ballot fraud the north carolina state board of elections last month ordered a new election in the district citing the voting improprieties according to testimony during a state elections board hearing harris hired political operative leslie mccrae dowless jr who collected absentee ballots from voters by offering to put them in the mail some of dowless associates testified they collected blank or incomplete ballots then forged signatures and filled in votes for local candidates dowless was arrested wednesday on criminal charges over his collection of absentee ballots mcconnell is correct that republicans and democrats in congress have debated election security for years the republican efforts in congress have centered on voter id laws including an amendment mcconnell offered in 2007 to require id to help prevent noncitizens from voting at the ballot box democrats have opposed voter id laws as unnecessarily restrictive for nonwhites the poor and young people who tend to vote democratic the actual number of election fraud cases is very small and the type that voter ids is designed to prevent voter impersonation at the ballot box is virtually nonexistent a 2012 report by news21 a reporting project affiliated with arizona state university found 2 068 cases of election fraud in the united states since 2000 ten of those cases involved voter impersonation or 1 out of every 15 million prospective voters mail in absentee fraud was more common with 491 cases none of those instances affected the outcome of an election associated press writers robert burns catherine lucey josh boak and lauran neergaard in washington adam beam in frankfort kentucky
