country wallace we aposll discuss what the showdown means for allegations of sexual assault with fatima goss graves president of the national women aposs law center and then we aposll ask our sunday panel where the burden of proof lies these days and our power player of the week a hollywood titan on the rewards of giving back unidentified male you never see u haul behind a hearse what are you going to do with what you have while you aposre here wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington tomorrow the supreme court opens its new term with eight justices on the bench judge brett kavanaugh aposs nomination facing another week of uncertainty after president trump under pressure ordered a new fbi background check into allegations of sexual misconduct by his nominee and all this just five weeks before the 2018 midterm elections in a moment we aposll speak with white house press secretary sarah sanders but first fox news white house correspondent kevin corke has the latest from capitol hill kevin kevin corke fox news white house correspondent chris the fate of the president aposs supreme court nominee and the rest of the hands of a few fence sitting republican senators but it is now clearly in those of the fbi which has opened up a supplemental background investigation into judge brett kavanaugh begin videotape unidentified male i would suggest that we corke the probe comes in the wake of a series of sexual misconduct allegations dating back to judge kavanaugh aposs high school and college years saturday the attorney for deborah ramirez confirmed that agents have contacted his client an indication that the probe will look beyond the allegations of christine blasey ford the scope of the fbi investigation had been a question saturday nbc accused the white house of limiting the probe something the president quickly denied tweeting actually i want to interview whoever they deem appropriate at their discretion white house spokesman raj shah noted that the senate sets the scope and duration of the fbi probe and that the white house is letting the fbi agents do what they aposre trained to do saturday night at a rally in west virginia the president reiterated his support for his embattled nominee trump a vote for judge kavanaugh is also about to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the democrat party mean obstructionists mean resistance for the last 18 months democrats have spent every minute trying to overturn the results of the last election end videotape corke michael avenatti who is the attorney for a third accuser julie swetnick says he has yet to hear from the feds chris the investigation is expected to wrap up by the end of this week wallace kevin corke reporting from capitol hill thanks for that joining me now white house press secretary sarah sanders and sarah welcome back to fox news sunday sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary it aposs great to be with you chris thanks for having me wallace let aposs pick up on this report overnight has the white house limited in any way who the fbi may talk to and specifically has the fbi been given a list of potential people to talk to but does not include julie swetnick the woman the third accuser who talked about gang rapes and also college friends who may contradict judge kavanaugh on the issue of heavy drinking sanders no the white house is not micromanaging this process this is the senate is dictating the terms they laid out the request and we aposve opened it up and as you heard the president say do what you need to do the fbi this is what they do and we are out of the way and letting them do exactly that wallace but to be specific did the white house counsel give the fbi a list sanders not that i aposm aware of the white house counsel has allowed the senate to dictate what these terms look like and what the scope of the investigation is again the white house isn apost intervening we aposre not micromanaging this process this is something it aposs a senate process it has been from the beginning and we aposre letting the senate continue to dictate what the terms look like wallace so do you know if either the senate or the white house is saying don apost interview julie swetnick sanders that aposs a question you aposd have to ask the senate that aposs not something that again the white house is engaging in wallace but the white house is in charge of telling the fbi sanders that we aposre open to the investigation and we aposve asked that they do that look at the end of the day the fbi is going to go through this process they aposre going to do interviews they don apost come to the conclusion that still something the senate has to do they aposre going to go and they aposre going to provide information and the senate is going to have to make a determination to either vote for brett kavanaugh or not this can apost become a fishing expedition like the democrats would like to see it be look i think you have to go back to the very beginning of day one of when president trump nominated judge brett kavanaugh from that very first moment before any of these allegations were brought up democrats said they were not going to support him they weren apost going to vote for him and they were going to do everything within their power to fight him we aposve seen that play out over the last couple of months they aposve been absolutely disgraceful in the way they aposve handled this process in the way they aposve exploited both brett kavanaugh and dr ford i think we cannot allow the people that have acted in bad faith to determine and allow this to become a total fishing expedition by the fbi the senate is going to lay out senate republicans are going to lay out and dictate those terms and we look forward to this wrapping up so we can see what was seen in the last six investigations that judge kavanaugh has been a part of wallace i want to pick up on this question because president trump said yesterday as he was leaving the white house the fbi investigation his words could be a blessing in disguise but here was the tweet that he put out on thursday after the hearing democrats search and destroy strategy is disgraceful in this process has been a total sham and effort to delay obstruct and resist the senate must vote does the president think the democrats apos demand for this extended fbi probe is part of what he has called a big fat con job and that republican senators like flake like collins like murkowski fell for the democratic sham sanders i don apost know that he think he aposs individual spell for the sham he knows those people want to see this process play out i think of people that have been bad actors in this as the president laid out in his tweet are the democrats look dianne feinstein and her staff knew about these accusations they could have done all of this in a private way to protect dr ford instead for the people that claim to champion women democrats have exploited dr ford they have exploited this process and i think it aposs been totally disgraceful and i don apost think anyone has hit the nail on the head better than lindsey graham did in thursday aposs hearing wallace so why did jeff flake go along with it sanders that aposs a question you aposd have to ask jeff flake but at the end of the day we want this process to be completed and we want brett kavanaugh to be able to take the bench and to be a supreme court justice without the cloud over his head and if that allows us to do that then by all means let aposs get this done this week but the senate has to make a decision and a determination and they have to vote based on the information that they have wallace here aposs what the president said after the hearing about christine blasey ford aposs appearance before the senate judiciary committee take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i thought her testimony was very compelling and she looked like a very fine woman to me very fine woman certainly she was a very credible witness she was very good in many respects end video clip wallace what did the president find compelling and credible about dr ford aposs testimony sanders well i think certainly anybody who watch that can ignore the fact that it evoked some emotion that this isn apost about emotion it aposs about facts and the facts all in on brett kavanaugh side certainly all of the information that came through that hearing there was no corroboration that nobody could deny that her testimony wasn apost compelling that it wasn apost impactful and certainly it appears something happened to this woman and i don apost think there aposs anybody in america who would condone that or be ok with that i do think the big question is was that brett kavanaugh and i think based on his testimony and the information he provided you can easily come away and say it wasn apost wallace well i want to pick up on that you aposre not only the white house press secretary i don apost have to tell you you aposre a woman how did her testimony affect you personally and how do you explain it that she could be that compelling that believable and that you think she aposs that wrong sanders well again i think her testimony was compelling but there was no fact based information that supported the accusation equally compelling if not more so was brett kavanaugh and i you pointed out i aposm a woman i aposm also a mom i have a daughter and i have two sons and i think it aposs a very very dangerous place in a very dangerous road for america to go down to simply take an accusation and make it facts we have to look at the information provided based on what we know i think brett kavanaugh was very compelling very credible that he had a lot of corroboration to backup his side of the story and i think that aposs equally as important that you have to take that into account as well wallace let aposs take a look at some of christine blasey ford aposs testimony this week begin video clip christine blasey ford kavanaugh accuser i believe he was going to rape me i tried to yell for help when i did brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from yelling sen patrick leahy d vt senate judiciary committee what is the strongest memory you have the strongest memory of the incident ford indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter the uproarious laughter between the two and they aposre having fun at my expense end video clip wallace how does the president who has called her not only compelling but credible how does he explain that she could be so credible and so specific in putting kavanaugh and his best one of his best friends mark judge in that room and be wrong about it you say you think something happened not necessarily with kavanaugh i mean is it just mistaken how does he explain it sanders look i don apost think anyone of us can know 100 percent but i think we have to look at the information that aposs provided there aposs no doubt that her story is heartbreaking and it aposs heart wrenching to watch it i aposve watched it a number of times again i think you have to look at brett kavanaugh aposs testimony as well equally heartbreaking look at the destruction of his family look at how this is played out the biggest thing that i think is so disgraceful and so disgusting is the way that the democrats have allowed this process to play out and allowed both of these individuals to be so beaten down so destroyed by frankly the media who have played a big role in this not to say they shouldn apost report it but they aposre putting so much information and so much pressure on these two individuals that i think this all could have been avoided had dianne feinstein and her team done this behind closed doors not done this in such a public setting that was what dr ford asked for she wanted this to be done in a private way and it wasn apost and it could have been and a lot of this could have been avoided and the pain and the suffering that she aposs had to relive and that judge kavanaugh is having to experience all could have been avoided wallace before the hearing the day before the hearing president trump said that his mind was open and if he heard information that in fact kavanaugh had committed sexual assault he was open to withdrawing his nomination does he stand by that if the fbi were to find something over the course of this week that contradicts kavanaugh aposs testimony will he pull the nomination sanders i aposm not going to get ahead of what the fbi may or may not find i can totally with the information that we have up until this point and look back at the president aposs comments that he made last night judge kavanaugh is an incredible individual of great intellect great temperament and i think you can apost just erase everything about what happened over the last week this is a person who has had peers and colleagues from the time he was a small kid until today come out and talk about who he is the type of character he has he aposs been through six different fbi investigations look i aposve been through one of those they are very thorough it aposs not like they sit down with one person and call it a day wallace no but i aposm just asking specifically he said on wednesday before the hearing he has an open mind and he would listen to the facts will he listen to the facts of the fbi investigation sanders i think he certainly will listen to the facts but again remember six of them have been done we aposll see wallace but they weren apost about this sanders we aposll see if anything new but they are about everything they don apost look at one thing they look at everything a standard fbi investigation goes into the depths of all parts of crosstalk wallace but you were saying if something new come comes out sanders certainly we don apost expect that to happen at all i think we aposre pretty confident given that we aposve been through this process a number of times but we would assess that at that point wallace ok there aposs other news in washington and i want to get to it briefly let aposs do my version of a lightning round when will the president and deputy attorney general rosenstein sit down this week and is the only issue on the table whether or not rosenstein did in fact talk about wanting to wire himself to the president or invoke the 25th amendment is that the only issue will he keep his job if the president is satisfied that that aposs not true sanders i wouldn apost be surprise if other topics come up i aposm not going to get ahead of the president aposs conversation with the deputy attorney general a date for that hasn apost been set it could be this week i could see it pushing back another week given all of the things that are going on with the supreme court but we aposll see and certainly always like to give the press updated on those wallace thank you the president signed a spending bill on friday that funds the department of homeland security only until december 7th after the midterms and it provides no new money for building the wall if the congress does not pass by december 7th when that funding runs out at least 5 billion more for the wall which is what the house wants will the president shut down the government sanders we aposll have to wait and see what happens but the president is committed to making sure we build a wall and getting the funding for it and if i know anything about donald trump he ultimately will get what he aposs fighting for and that will be the wall wallace finally this takes me back to my days in the white house briefing back in apos80s with larry speaks sanders you aposre welcome back anytime laughter wallace no six years was enough i still get ptsd about it we are happy to have you here but you have not had a formal white house press room briefing since september 10th which will be three weeks ago tomorrow are you thinking there have been reports are you thinking of ending the formal briefings or perhaps taking them off camera because you believe the white house reporters especially white house tv reporters grandstand sanders certainly i won apost disagree with the fact that they grandstand but that aposs not why wallace i aposm not saying it laughter sanders i think i don apost think you have to i think it aposs pretty widely known that it happens look we talked to the press and a number of different ways the day that the briefing was initially created the atmosphere was incredibly different and you didn apost have the same access and ways to communicate with the american public look the president does more short q a sessions than any president has prior to him we looked at those numbers wallace so we aposre running out of time are you saying that the white house briefing the formal white house press briefing on camera is sanders we aposre going to continue to do that but i always think if you can hear directly from the president and the press has a chance to ask the president of the united states questions directly that aposs infinitely better than talking to me we try to do that a lot and you aposve seen us do that a lot over the last three weeks and that aposs going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the united states wallace well you know that since he aposs become president he hasn apost talked to me sanders we aposll work on that i aposll put in a good word for you and i aposll see if we can make that happen wallace despite this interview sanders despite this interview wallace sarah thank you thanks for coming in today and we will try to stay on top of all the fast moving developments this week thank you sanders absolutely thanks chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the surprising one week fbi investigation and how big a threat it poses to judge brett kavanaugh getting on the supreme court commercial break begin video clip sen jeff flake r arizona i think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to but not more than one week in order to let the fbi continue to do an investigation limited in time and scope end video clip wallace republican senator jeff flake with his stunning demand friday forcing president trump to reopen brett kavanaugh aposs background check and its time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and kimberley strassel of the wall street journal well brit let me start with you what did you think of jeff flake aposs decision supported by two other moderate senate republicans to go along with the democratic demand for an investigation in this case a one week fbi investigation of brett kavanaugh brit hume fox news senior political analyst well i aposve heard it described as a compromise i don apost think it was a compromise because when a compromise occurs both sides give something it aposs not clear to me at all what the democrats gave for this this is exactly what they wanted and all of what they wanted now maybe they would have liked it to go on in perpetuity but i don apost think mr flake got much for his so called compromise and i think that you have to remember this everyone knows on the committee what an fbi background check is like it is not a criminal investigation it is not an in depth investigation like the kind we associate with this it is simply a background check and which will go and interview people about a nominee or candidate and they are going to look into some of these charges and it aposs worth remembering that in all these instances no one has corroborated the charges and it aposs a little hard to imagine that when the fbi finishes this they will find corroboration that no one else has been able to discover from witnesses who have so far pretty well deny that they saw this or even that it happened wallace congresswoman edwards i want to pick up on that because i think we all agree that christine blasey ford was an extremely compelling witness and nobody could watch her obvious pain in recounting this story without your heart going out to her on the other hand she did not offer any evidence except her own recollection and everybody else she puts in that house that day says they don apost remember this happening donna edwards d md former u s congresswoman well they wouldn apost remember it happening because they weren apost in the room and the one person who was in the room the additional person who was in the room mark judge hasn apost been talked to hasn apost been talked by the wallace wait a minute he has edwards he aposs written a letter that is not wallace he aposs written a letter under penalty of perjury edwards but that is not the same thing as an fbi agent showing up at your door and asking you very specific questions and i think that that has to be done and the fact is that in most instances of sexual assault there is not another witness so i think that it was appropriate for jeff flake to do this and let aposs keep in mind the votes were not there because clearly senator collins and senator murkowski were not on the same train without this fbi investigation and so if republicans really want to move this investigation move this nomination forward then they aposve got to finish this investigation they aposve got a week to do it wallace are you willing to say that at the end of this week i know you aposre not going to like judge kavanaugh anyway you don apost agree with his judicial philosophy but are you willing to say if the fbi comes back and says we have no evidence this guy did anything wrong are you willing to say on that front case closed edwards well i think there are a lot of people who won apost be voting for judge kavanaugh anyway on wallace i know but on this issue edwards on that point and i think i think look democrats agreed with jeff flake that the investigation would be open for this week we will see with the fbi comes up with and then i guess the nomination will go forward or not but it aposs really important to do what can be done in this week and i look at dr ford and i aposm going to tell you something i aposve worked with over the years 20 years a lot of victims of domestic violence and sexual assault she was incredibly credible the things that she could remember where as she said indelible to the hippocampus and i think that the fbi is going to get to some truth and the scope of the investigation should not be limited and you got to look at his drinking you got to look at his companions during this time period and there will be people to interview i bet that house is going to be identified and we are going to get to the truth here wallace kim kimberley strassel the wall street journal no you have lots of people who go into lots of confrontations on a daily basis in courtrooms outside of court rooms employment disputes they both present their sides as credible credibility is not the question here it has to be evidence based and this is what the fbi is now attempting to do but it remains the case that before these hearings and after these hearings there is not a single piece of evidence beyond christine blasey aposs word in this that this happen if we are willing to overthrow all of due process in the country and just say ok that won apost be the standard anymore one accusation is enough to lose you your job your life your home we aposve got some really big problems so the fbi is going to go out that you already democrats undermining the very fbi probe they called for saying it aposs not long enough it aposs not wide enough it aposs not going to go on long enough i can promise you this probe is going to change one person one democrats vote at the end of the day this was about more delay and jeff flake and the others need to understand that wallace mo let aposs be honest about this the democrats don apost want this nomination and one of the things they aposve been trying to do is delay it to what degree does this call for an fbi investigation just playing out time and hopes with all due respect to congresswoman edwards she aposs already said well we need to go maybe a week isn apost enough and try to push this past the midterms in the hope that democrats take over and that donald trump never gets another supreme court justice mo elleithee georgetown institue of politics public service i think unfortunately there are some democrats where that is true i don apost think that is where a majority of democrats are i think there are some democratic activists out there who are saying let aposs just let aposs delay this and then we aposll find something else to delay and then we aposll find something to delay after that and ride this through 2020 and i think they aposre doing the democratic party of which i aposm a proud member a disservice but i think to the fact these are democrats out there who believe that when there aposs a credible allegation like dr ford aposs against someone who is seeking a lifetime appointment to the supreme court that is worth pumping the brakes and doing a real investigation i don apost believe i personally do not believe that she was treated with the respect and the credibility that many people are patting themselves on the back and saying they gave her i think when democrats are oftentimes criticized for saying you know they came out against him before all of this started right they said that they were right republicans were saying before the hearing started that they were going to vote for him afterwards i don apost think her allegations were treated as credibly as a lot of people say they were and i think that aposs what this investigation is so important wallace kim i aposve got about strassel do you think brett kavanaugh was treated well elleithee i think this whole mess has just been disgusting hume if i respond to the question about how christine blasey ford was treated you have to remember how the origin of this she wrote a letter anonymously requesting anonymity to democratic congressman from california who passed it down to dianne feinstein who did absolutely nothing with it now elleithee at her request at dr ford aposs request hume she did not say to do nothing with it crosstalk edwards she said she wanted to remain anonymous i am not going to argue i aposm not going to argue that crosstalk hume let me finish may i finish please this what then happened was the matter was not looked into by the committee confidentially at all weeks months passed right and then it was leaked she was forced into the public eye and manipulated into the testimony which he gave under such obvious emotional duress the other day it is not fair to say that she was treated well by the democrats she was not wallace you have 15 seconds congresswoman edwards dr ford said that she was not a pawn she said that she was engaged in politics she felt very strongly once her name was leaked that she had an obligation wallace by the democrats edwards i don apost know who leaked it crosstalk edwards what i aposm saying is i don apost know who leaked it i don apost know where it came from dianne feinstein said it didn apost come from her office and i take her on her word the point is we would rather argue politics and process than the fact that the substance of these allegations and requirement for the highest court in the land that we get this right wallace well i aposm glad we settled this folks all right panel we have to take a break here we aposll see you a little later up next a senate confirmation battle in the age of metoo we aposll discuss what it means for the movement with the head of the national women aposs law center fatima goss graves plus oscar winning actor denzel washington on giving kids the tools to deal with life aposs ups and downs commercial break wallace coming up a supreme court confirmation battle in the age of me too begin video clip unidentified female inaudible crowd inaudible end video clip wallace we aposll ask the head of the national women aposs law center about the kavanaugh hearing in the fbi investigation next on fox news sunday commercial break wallace opposition to brett kavanaugh aposs nomination centered at first on what kind of a justice he would be but this week amid allegations of sexual assault the focus turned to what kind of a man he is especially in the age of me too we aposve reached out to all ten senate judiciary committee democrats to join us today and for the third week in a row none of them accepted but we aposre happy to have with us fatima goss graves president of the national women aposs law center which opposes judge kavanaugh aposs nomination you support the decision to reopen the background fbi investigation into judge kavanaugh but you oppose the idea of limiting it to one week why fatima gross graves national women aposs law center president ceo there aposs no question about that to begin with they should have done an fbi investigation prior to the hearing and this sort of sham process that we saw during the hearing reflected the problem of not having a wallace but wait but wait a minute the fact that they didn apost have this before the hearing is because the democrats didn apost ever release it to the fbi graves well they had they had time they had more time between they when they first learned of dr blasey ford and when they had the hearing they had almost ten days when they are now allowing her now wallace but they had six weeks between when the senator got the letter graves but now they have now they have five days there aposs real concern that they aposre limiting it in scope and the real question is when you aposre talking about an issue like sexual assault are you treating it with the seriousness that it deserves are we really going to have a situation when where we will allow the sort of doubt to be held with a lifetime appointment to the supreme court wallace you were in the room graves i was wallace for thursday aposs hearing and you say that you believe christine blasey ford here was senator lindsey graham who was also in the room begin video clip lindsey graham r sc senate judiciary committee there is no house there is no location i have been a prosecutor defense attorney and a judge there is no way to investigate something that happened 35 years ago when you can apost tell them the month the location end video clip wallace and in addition to that everyone that christine blasey ford puts in the house that night that she aposs named none of them back up her story graves you know i have to say lindsey graham aposs conduct during hearing was sort of shocking and was reflective of the real concern you have this woman who has come forward and given such credible testimony and around i actually think the country whether you were in the room or not people really believe this woman and so then the question is what do you do with that what you should do in that situation when you have such credible testimony is treat it seriously investigate it thoroughly not have sort of the process where you have doubted her out of the box as lindsey graham has wallace but but forgive forgive me he aposs saying other people are saying look you don apost know where the houses you don apost know how you got there you don apost know how you left the house you aposve you aposve mentioned what four names kavanaugh judge pj and leland keyser her friend and none of them back up your story graves the irony is that dr blasey ford actually had to both testify about her personal experience and she actually ended up being the expert there in how trauma works so she it was sort of a powerful teaching moment i think for the country that around why people don apost tell in the first place and how memory works when you aposve had such a traumatic experience especially when you aposre young so it is perfectly typical to remember quite vividly things in the room the sound of laughter right and not remember the address or even a specific date right it aposs the the laughter that is haunting her and actually hunting many survivors around this country wallace ok but let aposs take a look at the accused judge brett kavanaugh here was some of his testimony begin video clip judge brett kavanaugh supreme court nominee this has destroyed my family and my good name a good name built up through decades of very hard work in public service at the highest levels of the american government end video clip wallace you believe that judge kavanaugh was guilty of criminal mistreatment of at least this one woman on what basis graves you know i believe it because i believe her testimony and i actually think that judge kavanaugh did not do himself a service at either in that hearing or before the thing is when you had sort of mistruth about some of the small things the way he was trying to minimize the drinking in high school and in college the way that even when people asking him questions about you know what does it mean these statements from your yearbook coming up with things that actually didn apost sound logical i aposm not sure why he wasn apost being clear about the small things but it raises real questions about inaudible wallace but but but would you agree that and i understand this isn apost a court of law this is a job interview for one of the most powerful jobs in the country graves that aposs right wallace but in a situation where she says he did it and he says he didn apost and she can provide a single corroborating fact i mean graves ok wallace i mean let aposs take an example leland keyser her friend her friend not not one of his friends she says i don apost think i ever met judge kavanaugh graves well one of the that aposs one of the reasons people wanted an fbi investigation in the first place so that they could interview people who knew them both at the time who may have been there rather than people writing cursory statement saying i don apost want to talk to the committee and i i don apost plan to go forward but i i want to just push back a little bit on the idea that she didn apost have any corroboration so she took a lie detector test and there was it wasn apost admitted and we didn apost have testimony from the person who administered it but that is actually important she also has evidence that she told people about this when it didn apost matter to him she told her husband many years ago in therapy and at other times wallace but again graves she told her friends when it didn apost matter wallace i but again i mean that aposs her testimony that aposs not graves right but those are the sorts of things when you aposre talking about something when it actually doesn apost matter but in and out of a court a law people would consider but that actually isn apost a court of law and i think that aposs what aposs important the question is does he have the right temperament is does he have the right credibility to sit on the supreme court and after the performance i saw thursday i worried about whether he has the right credibility and temperament to be in his current job wallace you wrote an article this week in which you said the following i am grateful to dr blasey ford for her bravery and i am grateful to debbie ramirez and julie swetnick for risking everything to speak their truths as well let aposs talk about julie swetnick the third accuser in this case she claims that she attended several parties in the early apos80s where she saw brett kavanaugh spike the punch so girls could be gang raped and of all the people in the world all the lawyers in the world she chose michael avenatti who is stormy daniels lawyer to represent her do you believe her story that apos it aposs let me just finished that at 16 or 17 brett kavanaugh was involved in serial gang rapes and that the fbi did six background checks and never got a whiff of this graves so here aposs the thing her account is horrific and startling but unfortunately what i know from the work we do at the law center is that one in three girls have experienced sexual assault before the age of 18 and oftentimes alcohol and drugs is involved so although in a totally horrific account it aposs actually not totally extraordinary and i aposm not sure why her choice of counsel matters at all frankly it aposs a serious wallace because he aposs a because there aposs great doubt about how legitimate a a lawyer he is graves but i wallace and and about his his political graves but i i i hear i hear that wallace motives graves i hear the concerns about counsel but what i aposm concerned about is her and whether or not her story is just an opportunity ph wallace and you so you believe that she you believe her when she says that michael avenatti that that michael avenatti freudian slip that brett kavanaugh graves right that aposs the problem right yes wallace that that brett kavanaugh participated in serial gang rapes graves i believe it aposs a serious enough allegation that someone has to look into it in a serious say and it aposs my understanding that her counsel is saying that they haven apost yet been contacted by the fbi and i so i aposm not sure if that is the case but it aposs if it is not it they should be they should take this seriously because sexual violence itself is an issue that is serious wallace ms gross graves thank you thank you for your time graves thanks so much for having me wallace next up we aposll bring back our sunday panel to discuss that showdown between senator jeff flake and two sexual assault survivors and who bears the burden of proof these days commercial break commercial break donald trump president of the united states always i heard you aposre innocent until proven guilty i aposve heard this for so long and it aposs such a beautiful phrase in this case you aposre guilty until proven innocent i think that is a very very dangerous standard for our country end video clip wallace president trump raising questions about the burden of proof and standards of evidence in the wake of accusations against his supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh and we aposre back now with the panel i hope for the next seven minutes that we can all take off our washington pundits hats our former congresswoman hats and act like real people and discuss some of these issues kim the me too movement says accusers must be heard what should the standards be on when they should be believed kimberly strassel the wall street journal well look i think one of the problems with this case is it aposs undercut to a certain degree the me too movement because what made some of those initial cases so compelling and why did we decide that we absolutely had to listen to these women we could not ignore them is because this woman said evidence and could tell you when it happened how it happened who else was there the time period they gave contemporaneous accounts of it to other people and patterns as well it wasn apost just one woman or six seven in the case of harvey weinstein a lot of people come out that aposs what gave heft to it and made people step back and go ok there aposs a problem here but when you begin to now have a standard in which one person no evidence no pattern no details you really threaten to to change the standards and then make it less believable whenever a woman comes forward wallace when senator flake was in the capitol on friday he was confronted in an elevator by two women who said that they have been victims of sexual assault here aposs a bit of that begin video clip unidentified female look at me when i aposm talking to you you aposre telling me that my assault doesn apost matter that what happened to me doesn apost matter and that you aposre going to let people who do these things into power that aposs what you aposre telling me when you vote for him end video clip wallace but congresswoman edwards is that fair don apost we at least need to hold open the possibility that someone is unjustly accused donna edwards former u s congresswoman d md so burden of proof applies when there is a criminal case where you have the potential to lose your life and your liberty this is a job interview this is you know a circumstance where i think that accusers are speaking up and if you talk if men began to have a conversation with their wives and their girlfriends and their friends they are going to find out a lot about what they aposve experienced and i think that aposs the moment that we aposre in and so when you aposre talking about standard of proof burden of proof i think if we were in the middle of a court proceeding absolutely it aposs the highest standard possible because of what aposs lost but we aposre not and the standard for a judicial nomination always has to be the truth the whole truth and the nothing but the truth wallace let me let me just finished because there was a moment in the hearing that seemed to come straight out of the movies and i want to play this and then i will bring in brit begin video clip brett kavanaugh supreme court nominee i welcome whatever the committee wants to do because i aposm telling the truth dick durbin d ill senate judiciary committee i want to know what you want to do kavanaugh i i aposm telling the truth durbin i want to know what you wanted to do judge kavanaugh i aposm innocent i aposm innocent of this charge end video clip wallace brit have we reached the point at which for all practical purposes that the that the burden of proof has shifted from the woman who accuses to the man who aposs accused brit hume fox news senior political analyst well that aposs what aposs essentially being argued here and i heard it echoed in what congresswoman edwards just said this idea that it is only in a court of law in a criminal case of some kind or a legal case that you are innocent until proven guilty is far more deeply embedded in our nation and our culture as an ordinary sense of fairness and to have another standard would mean that someone out of the blue with an accusation under certain circumstances you are guilty until proven innocent that is manifestly unfair it means that unverified allegations can be used to ruin your reputation and damage your life forever without verification it is absolutely impossible to think that we as a nation are going to go there and yet remember three members of the committee the judiciary committee and minority leader schumer all said there aposs no presumption of innocence it that is where we are that is where we seem to be going and i don apost i i don apost think i hope and trust the public won apost stand for it wallace mo put aside the politics put aside the specifics of this case can you imagine anything more frightening than being unjustly unfairly accused of doing something you didn apost do mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public service other than being the victim of something like this which would probably be more more frightening look i am i i am going to try to take off take this out of the politics because this question is playing itself out in corporate board rooms in newsrooms in all sorts of other venues outside of politics across our country and it is complicated and it is hard i aposm a guy and i aposm a dad of a son and i don apost want to be accused and i don apost want my son to be falsely accused i also have a daughter and if god forbid she was ever in this situation i want her to be heard and i want her to be believed and so this is really a cultural battle that is emerging in a way that i have not brit and i were talking about it in the green room earlier this is probably one of the most divisive cultural issues we have faced and that has polarized us as a nation as far as i can remember i believe that the women ought to be heard and when these charges come up and these accusations come up and these questions come up in corporate board rooms in newsrooms in other venues whether it aposs political or not i think they need to be looked at they need to be investigated the women need to be treated absolutely seriously and the accused needs to be treated fairly wallace but does inaudible but does the point is does every do we have to be fair to both the accuser and the accused edwards of course we do inaudible information strassel in any situation wallace you aposve got you aposre got 30 seconds edwards of course strassel in any situation this is not about like just a courtroom ok due process is at the center of our entire civil society if you don apost have it and in any of those the standard is beyond a reasonable doubt or at least a preponderance of evidence we are talking about evidence free claims whether this is a case of an employment dispute it doesn apost have to be in the courtroom if we lose that everyone aposs son out there is at risk wallace all right we could go on we will go on thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week denzel washington on the club that made him the man he is today commercial break wallace for many kids the hours between three and eight are when their futures are decided and for more than 100 years one
