apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap for once republicans and democrats in congress were in the same place out of the loop when it came to president donald trump s abrupt announcement that u s forces would no longer protect syrian kurds from a turkish invasion his supporters knew as little as his critics all the effort by republicans to assuage and court the mercurial president meant little in terms of their ability to dissuade him from a decision that most of them vehemently opposed they found out about it like democrats late at night and on twitter top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of

even as turkish bombs fell wednesday on northern syria sen lindsey graham a frequent trump golf club buddy and a presidential educator on foreign policy talked to the president through television appearances and twitter he warned on fox friends a program that trump is known to make part of his morning routine that he s making the biggest mistake of his presidency it is never wise to abandon an ally who has sacrificed on your behalf tweeted graham a south carolina republican he was referring to u s backed kurdish forces fighting isis but that advice might also apply to trump s relationship with his gop allies most of whom lined up in rare agreement with democrats against the president s syria policy house minority leader kevin mccarthy whom trump has referred to as my kevin said on fox that he would have to call the president on wednesday the california republican tweeted that the turkish attack threatens to halt momentum against isis directly assaults partners in the syrian

reporters on a conference call that he heard about trump s shift of u s forces from the media the republicans appeared to be as in the dark as a bipartisan delegation with several first term house democrats who heard about trump s pullback in syria while on a flight home from an official trip to turkey afghanistan and jordan they quickly cobbled together a joint statement as they waited in customs at dulles international airport some sat on a bench at baggage claim to write it signing on was delegation member elise stefanik a republican congresswoman from new york who also tweeted the condemnation of trump s policy two lawmakers on the trip said that even trump appointees they met overseas did not indicate that they knew about the president s plans quite the opposite said

decisions with little warning often in the form of a tweet longtime u s allies are often the last to know the stupid endless wars for us are ending trump tweeted pledging to punish turkey economically if it goes too far in its assault trump s habit of abrupt u turns and embellishment is part of his operating style predicting what trump will do begins with accepting that he strives for surprise said
