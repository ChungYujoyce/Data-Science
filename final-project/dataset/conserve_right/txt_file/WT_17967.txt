the chinese navy s action in a close encounter with a u s destroyer in the south china sea saying america s warships are on the offensive near chinese territory the u s pacific fleet said a chinese destroyer came aggressively close to a u s navy ship in the incident late last month forcing it to maneuver to prevent a collision ambassador cui tiankai said on fox news sunday that the confrontation took place on china s doorstep it s not chinese warships that are going to the coast of california or to the gulf of mexico it s so close to the chinese islands and it s so close to the chinese coast

serve there visited hanoi in january three months later an u s navy aircraft carrier the uss carl vinson made a port call at da nang it was the first such visit since the war and a reminder to china that the u s is intent on strengthening partnerships in the region as a counterweight to china s growing military might the trump administration has sharply criticized china for deploying surface to air missiles and other weapons on some of its island outposts in june mattis said the placement of these weapons is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion the mattis trip originally was to include a visit to beijing but that stop was canceled amid rising tensions over trade and defense issues china recently rejected a request for a hong kong port visit by an american warship and over the summer mattis disinvited china from a major maritime exercise in the pacific china in september withdrew its navy chief from a pentagon visit and demanded that washington cancel an arms sale to taiwan philippines vietnam discuss maritime borders the philippine president and vietnam s prime minister have discussed delineating their countries maritime boundaries in the south china sea in what beijing will likely perceive as another challenge to its claim to virtually the entire strategic waterway president rodrigo duterte said friday that he told prime minister nguyen xuan phuc in a meeting in indonesia that such boundary talks may take longer because the philippines is still establishing its continental shelf limit the country s outermost boundary vietnam initiated the on and off talks several years ago vietnam is our asean brother and they have been supporting us in many ways and we have been supporting them philippine foreign
