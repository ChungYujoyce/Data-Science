apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis the defense framework signed with india this week during defense secretary ashton carter s trip to the pacific is the most recent step in u s efforts to put together a coalition to counter china s growing influence including its aggression in the south china sea mr carter and indian defense minister manohar parrikar signed a 10 year agreement wednesday in new delhi to promote cooperation under the agreement the u s and india will develop a mobile solar energy power source as well as a lightweight suit to protect against chemical and biological weapons and will build jet engines and an aircraft carrier for india top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore the pentagon said in an official statement that mr carter s trip to india was part of a broader u s rebalance to the asia pacific region mr carter suggested that an increased u s role along with the rising economic prowess of india vietnam singapore and other allies in the region would help counter chinese aggression these two things come together when it comes to maritime security maritime domain awareness mr carter said china in recent months has tried to increase its power by expanding artificial islands in the hotly contested waters of the south china sea the islands are believed to house military weapons and a runway long enough for china s largest aircraft the chinese also have taken an aggressive posture by attempting to deny travel through these waters to navy ships and others i think what the u s is doing if you look carefully with the defense guidelines with japan vietnam and elsewhere is we re putting together a loose coalition of allies and security partners that includes india singapore philippines indonesia and so on said robert manning a senior fellow at the atlantic council what we re doing in india is kind of a piece of that counterbalancing strategy although india has its own interests in the south china sea for navigation and oil exploration its overall strategy has been to remain independent on the world stage the u s agreement with india represents a step forward in the bilateral partnership but walter lohman director of the asian studies center at the heritage foundation said india will continue to protect its independent posture while the indian government buys some defense equipment from the u s mr lohman said it also buys equipment from russia to prevent the country from becoming too dependent on any single partner they re not on their way to becoming a plank in our strategy toward china because they re too leery of falling into someone else s strategy he said but the u s and india may have common interests in the south china sea beijing told india this week that it couldn t explore for oil in disputed areas of the south china sea an issue mr carter may have looked to leverage in his talks with mr parrikar china has claimed almost the entire sea which is a major shipping route and is believed to have large oil and gas reserves countries including vietnam the philippines and brunei have disputed beijing s claims on the sea the pentagon on thursday declined to comment on mr carter s objectives during the trip but the defense secretary said during a stay in singapore that he expected countries such as vietnam and india to play growing roles in regional security that s what the united states believes in and is championing a vibrant vietnam it s eager to do more and we re doing more with them and india an india that s not only rising economically and militarily but is also a regional security provider now and in the future he said douglas paal vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace said cooperation in the south china sea may be a long term goal of a better relationship with india but nothing in wednesday s agreement specifically mentioned the tension filled international waterway there s really nothing explicitly in the agreement about the south china sea he said carter s visit is about bilateral india relations and setting up a framework for 10 years of strategic discussions in those i m sure the south china sea will be a topic but what it will mean practically is very unclear from what we know so far mr carter left may 27 for his second trip to asia since taking office in february he spent 10 days in singapore vietnam and india to reaffirm the u s rebalance to the asia pacific pentagon spokesman col steve warren said at the beginning of the trip during the trip mr carter spoke at the shangri la dialogue in singapore on saturday and rebuked china for building artificial islands in the south china sea that have increased tensions in the region several nations including the philippines and vietnam have developed outposts in the contested waterway but china has claimed more than 2 000 acres of land more than all the other countries combined in the past 18 months mr carter said the pentagon has said that china placed weapons on some of the artificial islands we ve all benefited from free and open access to the south china sea and the strait of malacca we all have a fundamental stake in the security of the south china sea mr carter said during the singapore speech that s why we all have deep concerns about any party that attempts to undermine the status quo and generate instability there mr lohman said the emphasis on building relationships with india which began during the george w bush administration is partly to increase the number of partners in the region to protect u s and international interests but there is more to it it s getting friends and allies to protect the current order basically he said what we have established in the western pacific after 70 years it s to preserve that and the indians can be a part of that but it s a long process the south china sea is just part of our reason for getting closer to india he said even where it s about china it s going to be about more than just the south china sea it s about india s border their long standing rivalry with
