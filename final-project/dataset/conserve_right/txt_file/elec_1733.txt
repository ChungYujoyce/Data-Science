it depicts an unlikely but credible scenario in which gary johnson wins his home state of new mexico and neither donald trump nor hillary clinton get the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election outright silver stresses that plausible is a long way from likely but also skylarks that it s not far fetched to think the electoral college would be close enough that new mexico would make the difference and it s not totally crazy to think that johnson could win his home state silver points to a new albuquerque journal poll that has clinton at 35 percent trump at 31 percent johnson at 24 percent and green party nom jill stein at 2 percent exactly how that ends up with johnson winning new mexico is a stretch armstrong style reach but let s play with this a bit trump is either in full panic mode after blowing the first debate or getting there between the miss universe story and continuining questions about his taxes in any case his lack of direct experience and volatility will likely make him less appealing to non committed independents who otherwise want change clinton is not anyone s true favorite and perhaps her comments about sanders supporters being history s losers and living in their parents basements starts some bleeding on the part of her lukewarm supporters maybe wikileaks which promised a while ago to leak some really bad stuff about clinton this wednesday and then cancelled the event actually has the goods on her in a way that causes her to crater and let s assume johnson takes matt welch and other critics seriously ups his game and wins over the folks who know him best new mexicans to eke out a victory in his home state the guy is pulling down newspaper endorsements after all and angering bill maher who recently called johnson a fucking idiot maher grants that johnson is a good guy but he s afraid that apart from being against dumb wars the surveillance state and the war on drugs johnson will cost hillary clinton the election that sort of articulation can only help johnson with voters who are indeed socially liberal and fiscally conservative a group that maher and many others essentially says doesn t exist seeing self consciously edgy avant garde types slag johnson for believing too strongly in free markets global trade and technological innovation will help erase doubts raised by the governor s spaced out answers on aleppo and world leaders as the albuquerque journal notes johnson is pulling more support from clinton than from trump in new mexico we live in a country where americans think the country is headed in the wrong direction by a two to one margin and large majorities or pluralities hate the major parties dislike clinton and trump and think the government is trying to do too much that should be left to individuals and businesses to such people clinton isn t any kind of solution to what ails us and neither is trump if nothing else both are talking about spending more money than our currently historically high levels during peacetime each of them is part of the problem and a figure like johnson may come to be seen as a true alternative an experienced non professional politician who promises a smaller but more effective government the idea of johnson winning new mexico and the two major party candidates stalling out short of 270 is of course incredibly unlikely but it is worth thinking about especially for those of us who stubbornly refuse to buy into the false binary choice narrative being pushed by both republicans and democrats change needs to be seen as possible before it takes place right sometimes change comes in big revolutionary waves other times it comes from a small but steady rivulet of water that hollows out seemingly impregnable structures however awful the 21st century has been so far to many of us it is far worse for established ideologies and political parties who are really taking it on the chin the question is what s the smallest victory it will take to show just how weak and foundering our political duopoly really is advertisement next donald trump s billion dollar tax loss is a diversion from more serious matters nick gillespieisan editor

to happen and for the election to be thrown to the house where i would hope it would devolve into a never ending series of fistfights if it goes to the house johnson wins republicans control 30 of 50 state delegations and the vote is per state not per district no way they vote for trump muh fistfights maybe but more likely they would vote for hillary who is one of them btw there is no way that johnson winning one or two states new mexico utah new hampshire could result in the johnson weld team assuming office if there is no electoral college majority the house does vote by states from among the top three electoral vote getters for president but the senate then votes for vice president from the top two electoral vote getters for vice president only could johnson work with pence or kaine as his veep oh well the chances that he will need to answer that are infinitesimal but it s an interesting question to ask anyway no most republicans would vote for trump and most democrats would vote for clinton whatever else happens party affiliation would be the strongest predictor this isn t like the 1824 election where everybody was part of the same party the only remaining question would be if clinton has the most popular votes would enough republicans pull a john roberts and vote for her such that she would win don t worry obama can always issue an executive order crowning hillary the winner i would like that bitch to try i mean obama green party nom jill stein candidates aren t food we re only supposed to eat lowercase greens somebody s eaten her artist s conception http www hercampus com sites 1 27 image 4 jpg itok 7wxhl5oz http www gannett cdn com mm 0a 1 0 jpg ot of course there s no truth to the old stereotype of immigrants bringing in diseases you xenophobe haha breitbart some of my conservative friends have such a distorted view of reality they think germany has devolved into a hieronymus bosch painting he is living in germany how is he handling the crisis what crisis blank stare you know the refugee crisis confused look um i don t think he is living in that city crisis what crisis i thought you were talking about a supertramp album stupid wikipedia perhaps this cover photo will show what i meant haha person who didn t read the article and just looked at the url here it is in the original german if you prefer or does breitbart reporting on an article from the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung automatically discredit the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung only part of that wound is green and it s a very small percentage of my total body nothing to worry about tb is simple skin test all people from places where it s endemic should be screened people in places where tb is common get tb vaccinations when little this causes the tb skin test to come out positive even though they have no tb thus the tb skin test is useless for people that have had the tb vaccination ot of course there s no truth to the old stereotype of immigrants bringing in diseases you xenophobe should citizens who visit tropical countries where disease is endemic be allowed back should they be allowed to travel there why or why not westerners who visit third world countries are much less likely to catch diseases there than the native populations that seems like half an answer i m sure you can see what i m getting at many arguments against immigrants seem to apply equally to temporary visitors to the us or us citizens who leave and then return you seem to focus very strongly on their application only to immigrants i understand that we are under no obligation to non countrymen but it seems odd how much you focus on the threat proposed by immigrants as if they are unique to them i seem to have hit a rich seam of seeming shrug sunday also it s one thing to deal with risks introduced by citizens and quite another when dealing with risks introduced by foreigners one could say it s like saying you shouldn t lock your business at night because your employees might steal from you it s one thing to deal with risks introduced by citizens and quite another when dealing with risks introduced by foreigners foreigners here again seems to gloss over immigrants vs other visitors such as tourists as far as i know almost no one is calling for disallowing visits entirely from the countries in question why do we seemingly not care about the risks posed by tourists from country x but do care about immigrants or refugees from same prolonged exposure to diseases such as tb significantly increase probability of contracting carrying the disease by definition temporary visitors would not have prolonged expoure and it is extremely unlikely that most vacation oriented travelers would have exposure given typical lodging travel patterns thank you raheinlein as for tourists from country x i want them at least screened at their expense if they come from regions that have a high level of communicable diseases but again the time factor is important somebody who comes here for two weeks is obviously less of a disease risk than someone who moves here permanently sorry guys still not getting it feel like you re waving your hands to justify a position you already hold i don t have a strong counter position but i feel like it s incumbent upon you to come up with some actual metrics that help draw a bright line between someone who is a permanent resident and someone who on their b2 tourist visa can stay up to 6 months otherwise fearing one and not the other parses like illogically unfairly applied double standards i find it bizarre that when it comes to risk you think it should be applied equally to citizens and foreigners yes it is a risk that a citizen allowed to own guns might do something bad but the 2nd amendment applies so therefore is it an unfairly applied double standard that we don t allow foreigners to bring guns into the country i don t think so of course there is no bright line of actual metrics between a permanent resident and a six month tourist we re talking about the odds and about common sense common sense should tell you that someone carrying a disease into the us for 6 months is less likely to spread it here than someone here for 7 months or 7 years or 70 years so in other words we should restrict tourists from those countries as well and not allow them in our country for 6 months or do i understand you properly that the risk is acceptable on a 6 month tourist visa but not acceptable on a 6 months and one day permanent resident visa i note for the record that you personally call for screening of those coming from regions with high rates of disease which i guess is the entire third world or something the idea generally seems impracticable given the current state of medical science why does almost everyone who talks about this issue seem to object not at all to tourists from countries where there s disease but does object to permanent resident immigrants you just conceded that there is no bright line between them if that s the case why don t i hear calls for restricting tourists from those countries or naturalized citizens of country x who were born and lived in y until recently both of these classes seem just as capable of spreading communicable disease per unit of time as permanent residents no truth at all http shoebat com 2013 11 04 lim syria you d think they d cook the brains first uhm it looks to me like if that map ends up being accurate even with johnson taking nm clinton wins by one point you know what the difference between 266 and 267 electoral votes is losing the election but you need 270 votes to win you need 270 to keep congress from getting involved 267 will get the nod if not you can bet it ll end up at the sc and they ll give clinton the nod after the uproar from 2004 you need an absolute majority of electoral votes to win or else congress decides absolute majority in 270 in spite of all the never trump ism i have to assume that if this election somehow got kicked to the house in the end they d vote for him though conceivably there d be proposals to name a neutral compromise candidate that would gary johnson unless they convince six gop electors to vote for some other candidate only the top 3 can be voted on in the house also you mean the uproar from 2000 and that involved a disputed election of a state i don t care who has the lead if it throws to the house every republican delegation that throws a vote for clinton should be immediately recalled i don t get it what happens when the electoral college can t decide is pretty clear in the constitution what s the supreme court going to do change the law like they always do in hot button issues clinton will be declared a penaltax violates her equal protection since she doesn t win just seems like a stretch even for them it s spelled out pretty explicitly and clearly when the electors cross state lines to cast their ballots did they engage in any economic activity or if they cast them from their home state did they use the post office internet well we know what nate silver thinks about this possibility by his choice of baby shit yellow for nm seriously that is an odd color choice i guess normal yellow was taken by gary s tie it shold be orage the lp is always yellow or gold get it and the greens are always green the dems used to be red and the repubs blue but the dems in the media didn t want their party associated with red commies anymore at some point but sliver went with mustard for some reason i hadn t thought of the gold connection but maybe the people at 270towin did no it wasn t nate silver silver and gold i guess we should be glad that the lp has gotten a standard color for political maps yellow why yellow basically red blue green and yellow are the four colors people think of as being sort of primary colors like on the windows logo red and blue are taken by the republicrats and green logically should go to the greens so that leaves yellow for the lp i guess as for why red is for republicans in what seems to be an inversion of the old democrats communists reds association the networks say that prior to 2000 they used to alternate every four years between red for democrats blue for republicans and the reverse in 2000 it happened to be the reverse and because of all the controversy about the election results that year the association of red for republicans blue for democrats became fixed in the public mind simply because it was being used for weeks rather than for a single night so that is what has been used ever since that color is from 270towin not nate silver he used their electoral college map to create the image if u see this comment while scroling u have been visited by the trumpet skelton of the abyss good bones and calcium will come to u but only if you reply thank mr skeltal to this comment why this weirdness i like big butts make with the twerking domo arigato mr mulatto no time for that there is a skeleton war going on is this what you do all day when not teaching english to south koreans wtf this skeleton crap makes me miss icejjfish at least i could turn the volume off and gaze pervertedly on the good looking women he featured in his videos the skeleton war is way less metal than it used to be the thing is that the fuckboys are so basic they don t even know they re in a meme war what hm was really thinking hey jameis stop throwing it to the other guys thanks jameis will jamais stop throwing interceptions i m worried about my fellow alum trevor siemian though i heard he went out with a shoulder injury we don t have the game here have they had any updates on the telecast it was collar bone they were concerned with they say he s done and play next week stoopit phone they say he is fine and will play next week this would be a pretty cool outcome actually and hey now i know a clinton loss in any form will give maher the rage embalism that could finally shut him up so it s the little things to look forward to anything that throws this election into greater dissarray is pretty cool i will bet that good portions of at least 3 democrat controlled cities will be on fire the eve of the election if it gets thrown to the house so what scenario is preferable trump winning and destroying the republican party forever at least until 2022 or 2026 and causing people to reject the gop in favor of a lp that will not totally sell out hey stop laughing at me or hillary winning and either dying or being so shitty that it can t be blamed on republican kulaks that will lead to the libertarian moment i mean 8 years of obama lead to a rejection of big government oh wait and it doesn t sound like ernst thalmann s first brown then red theory however awful the 21st century has been so far to many of us it is far worse for established ideologies and political parties who are really taking it on the chin citation needed not to mention the kims the castros and maduro are still in power citation needed didn t you click the link if you did you d know that democratic republican identification near historical lows i bet democrat bigwigs are panicking sure in one generation we ve gone from a party capable of losing 49 states in a presidential election to having such an electoral college advantage that we re now basically starting with 200 ec votes but our party identification is too low trump winning is clearly preferable from a libertarian perspective for many reasons one is that of the likely outcomes it s the most disruptive of the current establishment and two party structure that s good for third parties stretch armstrong please plastic man nm save us you re our only hope also dalmia s orwellian correction is pretty hilarious so why does she write for reason again beyond loving immigration she suffers from tds and i makes for great lulz yes you do makes for great lulz so how does gillespie explain sputnik and yuri gagarin i thought new tech leads to libertopia and did deanna durbin i love lucy and lend lease lead to destalinization you know instead of everyone hating the two major parties and voting for them anyway what would happpen of everyone voted for a third party also bill maher used to be a respectable libertarian then he whored himself out to the progressives to fit in fucking loser bill maher used to be a respectable libertarian cite he used to call himself libertarian mostly because of drugs i m not sure he really embraced anything else bill maher was never a libertarian he just wanted legalized drugs a jackass who didn t want to identify as a pro drug progressive does not equal libertarian instead of everyone hating the two major parties and voting for them anyway what would happpen of everyone voted for a third party if only there were a third choice people say despite what he says maher is and was never a libertarian his comments over the years on the aggregate make him more of a liberal make him more of a liberal zeb and francisco have a sad i think i ll manage being against dumb wars so what obama was saying back in 2008 good thinking socially liberal and fiscally conservative you know who else engaged in reactionary appeals to a romanticized non existent 1960 s 1970s past william shatner holds up card 9 1 cameron crowe hitler jeez denver what do you say when a cop asked you if you know why you were pulled over because you didn t do well in high school winner so are gillespie and welch going to have cancel their cocktail party invites the lp is no longer a stick to beat the gop with but the enemy so weed mexicans and ass sex won t save you anymore also i am amused at the reason editors butt hurt over the aleppo moments and the pothead jokes you guys knew that if libertarianism every became a serious political force then they will face a lot of opposition and a lot of nasty attacks especially from the progs right or did gillespie and welch think that all their talk about the libertarian moment meant that everyone will agree with them and allow the libertarian agenda to proceed with only fringe opposition spend enough time with progs and the fantasy land mentality they live in starts to rub off a stretch armstrong style reach i honestly thought nick was making an obscure reference to my homeboys also i remember back during the shutdown reason reported on some polls showing that people wanted the politicians to get things done reason naturally tried to proclaim it as the part of the libertarian moment but i thought it seemed more like a desire to get things done and of course years later we have trump and a lot of pro hillary stuff is scare different from saying she ll get things done and will this shit show of an election teach us that the politicians have too much power and the system is corrupt so we should become libertarian or that we need a top wo man to get things done then there is the possibility of one or more faithless electors it is more likely to come from an elector in a state that trump won given that he is disliked much more by the republican party establishment yeah thats a much more interesting topic than the theoretical impact of gay jay i have no doubt there will be a few electors who just ignore the popular vote and just go their own way and then it becomes interesting if an elector violates state law to create an outcome to the election other than what would have occurred had they abided by the law is the final outcome legitimate i imagine scotus would get to make that decision also how does reason explain that the canadian liberals american democrats uk labour and various anti austerity parties in europe are most certainly not rejecting the old welfare state leftist mindset that was supposedly rejected by the left in the 1990s including by hillarycare clinton just with a quick glance i don t have any big problems with those state predictions except for maybe maine going red that could be offset with new hampshire going red in the map they show new hampshire as blue but as we know johnson is drawing as much or more support away from hillary rather than trump in a state with a lot of libertarian minded voters that should be a big boost for trump that s only the one congressional district of maine going trump according to rcp trump is in fact ahead in that district never thought trump would be getting new england votes back let s play with this a bit wasn t nick just saying something about stupid distractions a minute ago on reflection shikha and sheldon sundays are probably not as bad as just letting nick ramble about whatever i much prefer old man gillespie s navel gazing and two decade old pop culture references to richman s vapid boomer foreign policy philosophizing or shikha s dishonest and increasingly deranged attempts at argumentation it s mostly harmless and or pointless like listening to grandpa talk about his trip to the dmv while the other two are like dealing with really disingenuous door to door jehovah witnesses richman s vapid boomer foreign policy philosophizing yes but no one really takes sheldon seriously he s like reason s andy rooney a crazy old man they let ramble during the time slot they had left over he s fun reading just to spot the where does he blame the jews today or to see how far he bends certain libertarian ideas to accommodate his lefty impulses nick on the other hand will blow a few thousand words on one big pile of nothing its not even interesting enough to mock i honestly hope gj breaks 5 well enough that he s blamed for whomever wins and the ensuing 4 year shitshow it will at least provide some lulz i m disappointed that derpman hasn t written anything on the eu or brexit i wonder how he will address his hatred of neoliberalism and his hatred of nationalism localism directed in ways he disapproves of and his fondness for multilateralism a better derpman article would be about how he sees no difference between malalia jose fernandez and adam lanza dalmia s next article should be attacking trump s statements in an onion article and how we need syrian immigrants to clean her shoes and how indira gandhi would have saved us from trump how about a gillespie article about how bojack horseman is libertarian and so much better than gilligan s planet which proves that the libertarian moment is upon us or how hillary trump getting 80 of the vote and all 538 ec votes is proof that libertarian moment is upon us he s like reason s andy rooney a crazy old man they let ramble during the time slot they had left over he s fun reading just to spot the where does he blame the jews today or to see how far he bends certain libertarian ideas to accommodate his lefty impulses if crazy old man blaming the jews is your thing we might as well just cut out the middle man and let michael hihn write for reason the pure insanity would be worth it i d feel bad for kmw having to be his editor though i m sure sudermann has some vox openings for welch and gillespie in order to accommodate hihn you goober bully aggressor let michael hihn write for reason they probably have an in person interview for their prospective writers i wonder if hihn showing up in the same grimy t shirt that he wears for days at a time sitting in his dimly lit one room apartment yelling out loud about what he reads in the comments section will be considered a plus or minus by gillespie well they accepted terry michael and steve chapman so anything is possible that sounds a lot like me i applied to write for reason but when i listed all of gillespie s bullshit as i always do they were upset then we have the retards who get pissed because i merely mention how the jew got their homeland by committing mass genocide of an entire culture the canaanites ruled the land for fewer than 300 years then lost it entirely on their own when they were invaded after their own civil war and their fellow jews refused to help them defend their very lives does that mean the entire old testament is anti semitic lol where would be without derpman s articles about how libertarians are leftist extreme radical socialist anti capitalist sjws because of some obscure victorian guy who wasn t all that influential used those terms and could be considered libertarian dude lives inside his head needs to get out more funny how the theoretical electoral college maneuvering has already started will be glad to see the end of this election cycle hopefully not a repeat of 2000 i had the 3 part sons of liberty on my dvr forever just finished watching the last episode highly recommend watching if you get the opportunity georgia keeping citizens safe from baby chicks http hotair com archives 201 by chicks omwc hardest hit that should give peta something to froth about i m pretty sure they ve already published screeds about how pets are in fact slaves the idea that people can just dispose of juvenile livestock in any way they see fit will surely get housewives across america into some kind of tizzy i recall crazy bitch case study 20928342109812 long island woman who sparked a protest over a farmer s plan to drum roll eat his own cow as a counter example i have a vague memory of there being an instance where peta expressed uncharacteristic lack of concern over the marketing of peeps candy in fact i think they actually said they re fun go ahead w your bad selves animal shaped candy something like that maybe whomever was running their blog was high i can t seem to find any mention of it unfortunately although recommendations for ethical easter baskets are pretty easy to find you don t eat family lol so sad people think that they live in a disney movie nick is right have we so quickly forgotten what matters all of these distractions from the important news are ruining our national character my favorite quote from that page didn t even come from the story twitter s recent ban of a sexist troll was a step in protecting women on the internet but we ve got a long way to go human fence protecting women on the internet so much for women s liberation we re in the digital victorian

capable of being moral or immoral but only well or poorly made and that only brutes and illiterates whose views on art are incalculably stupid would make such judgements about art funny how the modern left no longer approves such a statement anymore hg wells was a eugenicist if memory serves i always enjoy reading wilde mainly because he was an unapologetic hedonist and contrarian i ve always found

you talking about his relationship with jeanne eagels or bette davis did he sleep with them off camera too marshall also played a maugham stand in in the moon and sixpence and maugham himself in the

american top 40 every week afaik he had one other hit in the states i just wanna stop i wouldn t know any of his other songs i m a fan of me but you never go there that reminds me of something i was just thinking about today are there any novelists who are libertarians or classical liberals i like novels from between 1890 and 1940 but it seems like most of the good authors are straight up communists or at least very hostile to capitalism john steinbeck jack london dashiell hammett theodore dreiser frank norris i don t really care they re excellent writers i m just wondering if there are libertarians classical liberal novelists from that era who might write stories with a different perspective ayn rand sorry just kidding henry david thoreau is considered libertarian but he was earlier than the period you describe and not a novelist robert a heinlein is just after the 40s he started with ya books in the late 40s and 50s but he s libertarian trump destroyed the republican party so unless the libertarians pick up the pieces it will soon be a one party system if they survived 1936 i think they will survive trump did you steal from agile cyborg s stash omg burn well hell

but cavalier toward sex he seems very keen on it oops i must have confused him with robert herrick the cavalier poet well that joke was stillborn or i may have confused him with richard lovelace how about some rusty tamblyn not to be confused with a rusty venture this is from tracy k smith we like to think of it as parallel to what we know only bigger one man against the authorities or one man

johnson is obviously an idiot and will not be seen as a true alternative it s good he didn t get in the debates he would have only embarrassed and discredited the party weld on the other hand is an asset so the key is to strengthen the party downballot instead of constantly complaining talk about the issues and where the lp can contribute for example reducing debt and restoring free markets to

poets just in case you think i m picking these out at random this was read at president obama s inauguration one ground our ground rooting us to every stalk of corn every head of wheat sown by sweat and hands hands gleaning coal or planting windmills in deserts and hilltops that keep us warm hands digging trenches routing pipes and cables hands as worn as my father s cutting sugarcane so my brother and i could have books and shoes a list you came up with or off a website either way i d be interested in fine here these are modern poets you need to know about thanks i m quite ignorant when it comes to poetry but wish that i were not i don t know much about poetry but i know what i like yes you do know what you like what i like what you love also read a poem at a presidential inauguration is this the ultimate libertarian film https www youtube com watch v fprvonwmync i vote for the mating game 1959 paul douglas leads a maryland farming family who make their living entirely by the barter system their neighbor doesn t like them and wants their land so he rats on them to the irs and this is portrayed by the movie as an unequivocally bad thing irs agent tony randall visits the farm falls in love with daughter debbie reynolds and complications ensue the happy ending comes when it turns out that the government has been dicking the family since the civil war and actually owes them an eight figure sum because dicking people is what governments do he rats on them to the irs and this is portrayed by the movie as an unequivocally bad thing damn teahadists maryland farming family the government has been dicking the family since the civil war white farmers in maryland dicked over by lincoln slaveowner i believe these days and according to many reasonoids lincoln and grant are they only real top men to ever occupy the white house actually the family s ancestors helped the union government in the war the government took some of their horses for the war effort and never reimbursed them per the 5a takings clause i know i read the wikipedia article these days it seems that any criticism of lincoln is a slaver even among many libertarians didn t lincoln only free the slaves in the south as a war time tactic and didn t he think black people were subhuman and had no place in the future america liberia i wonder how he has escaped the social justice wrath where someone like wilson hasn t lincoln s attitude seems to have changed substantially by the end of the war no doubt he was an opportunist but he made sure the 13th amendment passed congress before the end of the war misinformation by progressives has saved lincoln most people don t know anything about wilson either and that is their way to hide how bad wilson was the shift just has moved to modern liberal saviors like jfk lbj clinton and of course obama fdr s internment of japanese americans is just to hard to hide and ignore for the progressives who know things false advertising this poem isn

totally not just one giant argumentum ad ignorantiam lack of data on sexual rights leaves millions of girls invisible london thomson reuters foundation millions of girls are left invisible because of a lack of data a children s charity said on monday and the absence of accurate statistics on issues such as sexual violence means policymakers cannot draw up effective plans to help them there is no data that fully captures the daily realities of girls in poor communities plan international said in a report including why girls drop out of school or how many become pregnant because of sexual violence we do count how many girls start school but we actually don t count how many girls leave school said anne birgitte albrectsen ceo of plan international this absence of data is just the tip of the iceberg we need to spend more money to find out more about the things we need to spend more money on noted given how orgs like cdc have effectively turned into marketing departments for radical leftist feminists by giving them a definition of sexual violence so broad that unwanted facebook messages can be considered assault you can just imagine how many of these selfsame groups and gun grabbers too btw look to the un as the motherlode of potential bullshit reporting generating powers all they need is a few compliant un committees and soon they ll have something like an international version of the doe s office of civil rights handing out threats to people all over the us that they need to be reporting x data on an assortment of sexual rights issues and demonstrating what they re doing to ensure there s no intimidation or harassment etc else they be considered international human rights violators or the like seriously this isn t even an exaggeration this is the sort of thing hillary would just hand out like party favors to various activist groups and let them run wild partly because the attention these people glean from the press from journos like robby tends to detract reduce the focus that people spend on otherwise more serious stuff like fiscal issues or gigantic regulatory grabs etc which are less click baity and more boring wonk issues top 10 public pension

businesses will bring back jobs like you won t believe yet no top 100 corp execs will support him a few support hillary what s going on could it be that people actually care about the budget as a whole taxes spending yet no top 100 corp execs will support him a few support hillary weird you mean they d rather deal with someone who has a proven track record of corruption crony s gonna crony also what top 100 exec is stupid enough to endorse trump knowing the shitstorm that will follow from every loudmouth person and agency on the left for crying out loud just writing trump 2016 is considered a hate crime in some places easier just to keep your mouth shut and vote for trump i think trump will get several percentage points higher than he gets in most polls on election day just because of the average person s reluctance to deal with the crap resulting from saying his name out loud who will nonetheless vote for him whether that will be enough to win remains to be seen do any support johnson that is the libertarian moment does johnson johnson support johnson weird you mean they d rather deal with someone who has a proven track record of corruption crony s gonna crony a money manager i know tells me he s voting johnson from principal but says most of his clients and his contacts are holding their noses and voting clinton the feeling is that she s within the normal distribution of dishonesty and corruption the market prefers predictability trump is too much of a loose cannon neither his nor my votes mean a thing ca s in the bag for the hag i m predicting clinton at 310ec votes most liberals live in such a bubble that they have no clue of the impending landslide for trump remember folks its states that carry trump that win electoral college votes with typical democrat voters not voting for hillary and more and more new republican voters voting for trump you get a landslide victory for trump popular or electoral college polls don t 1 1 with reality but we have 47 45 hillary leading that one s fairly close i doubt either candidate wins by a popular vote land slide partially just because most people don t like either candidate however trump to get a land slide would need to flip north carolina nevada florida colorado this would get a win penn nh possible i guess but i wouldn t put money on a land slide the fact that polls show hillary and trump neck and neck tells me that trump is ahead the polls are notoriously skewed to limit bad news for democrats the progressives mostly live in big cities and thanks to the electoral college city wins don t win states not only is trump going to win typical republican states but is going to take typically democrat states like pennsylvania and new york https ballotpedia org gubernatorial and legislative party control of state government this is the reality of republican vs democrat politics trump might not get taxifornia and that s about it damn link limit face it people either the corrupt socialist is going to win or the corrupt mercantilist is going to win our goofball is never going to win because he is slandered in popular culture as a goofball and his running mate is a drunk like ted kennedy

supporters are grasping at straws grasping at johnson when they re not grasping at straws yes grasping at strawmen this is nick everything is the libertarian moment gillespie you are talking about i m not sure how people figure the outcome of this election will be anything other than a landslide victory for clinton who s going to win new mexico clinton if you define landslide i ll take that bet an election in which the winner gets a much greater number of votes than the loser merriam webster in 2012 332 electoral votes went to obama and 206 went to romney it won t be that close this time i m not betting on this to happen or rooting for this to happen but i think this is what is going to happen if you are curious about bets check out the odds being placed in countries where it s legal it s not even close the bucs went from 1st and 10 at denver s 37 to 4th and 43 at their own 30 that s the kind of can t do ferociousness i expect out of this team bravo guys 4 and oh baby 4 and oh ot 2 5

check you fagging privileges shit lord law professor geoffrey r stone criticizes the chicago tribune s endorsement of gary johnson clearly on a roll the tribune editorial board then turned to hillary clinton who they sensibly observed is undeniably capable of leading the united states moreover electing her the first woman president would break a barrier that has no reason to be in short clinton s election would be an historic milestone in our nation s all too reluctant recognition that women can actually lead whereas trump couldn t do this job clinton the tribune s editors boldly proclaimed clearly can a good rational sensible analysis but that s when the drugs took hold in the next several paragraphs the tribune s editorial board launched into a mindless rant that would put even fox news to shame the tribune editorial board then launched into a scathing attack on hillary clinton s honesty and integrity the plain and simple fact is that as she has conceded hillary clinton has made some mistakes and those mistakes raise legitimate questions about her judgment to be honest some of those mistakes have made me cringe but none of them is even remotely disqualifying none of us after all is perfect uh huh so even though he admits that their attacks have merit the fact they think them disqualifying and support the lp makes them a product of an addled doped up mind what a surprise sarah silverman and bill maher explain why bernie bros shouldn t support libertarian candidate gary johnson that might be the most unappealing link ever congratulations i wonder when the dem robots realize that millennial bernie bro as a filthy millennial myself i will say they are a lot more complicated than most give them credit for it would be very stupid to think that all people under 30 are socialists but it is an alarmingly high number vanity fair has this clever headline a vote for gary johnson is a vote for donald trump jeb bush s support for the third party candidate is as good as throwing away his vote dammit why doesn t weed mexicans and ass sex make them love the johnson they are all lesbians now they do not like the ass sex or the johnson no go cry yourself to sleep winston with a bottle of whine and some cheese https www youtube com watch v owfc5mkabno simpsons did it oh no guys you ve lost esquire the chicago tribune s reasons for endorsing johnson are as clear as they are detached from objective reality donald trump cannot be president because he s plainly nuts hillary rodham clinton cannot be president even though she is immensely qualified because bernie sanders magically turned her into emma goldman and also benghazi benghazi benghazi which leaves colonel mccormick s heirs with the carmen sandiego of weed city what s funny is how reason ridicules the perception that 3rd party candidates are taking votes away from the major candidate in one paragraph and then licking their chops at that prospect a few paragraphs later several people on this site have called lincoln the third party candidate in 1860 which is a rather dubious statement since the whigs had been wiped out by 1856 and the republicans were the clear opposition to the democrats jim geraghty writes at national review the standard argument in favor of third party candidates is that they don t get nearly as much coverage as the major party candidates which is indisputable broadcast network news has ignored gary johnson almost entirely but johnson s gotten the most coverage of any third party or independent candidate since perot if gary johnson s 8 percent or so is sufficient why not jill stein s 3 percent if you include those two why exclude evan mcmullin sorry pal you needed 15 percent and fell short i gotta hand it to the solibs many of them are turning to the johnson i hadn t expected that at all i thought they would reluctantly vote for hillary because lenin was dead wait lenin is dead when did this happen if wasn t in the news what do you guys think of this http en wikipedia org wiki t nthropists the book advocates a socialist society in which work is performed to satisfy the needs of all rather than to generate profit for a few a key chapter is the great money trick in which owen organises a mock up of capitalism with his workmates using slices of bread as raw materials and knives as machinery owen employs his workmates cutting up the bread to illustrate that the employer who does not work generates personal wealth whilst the workers effectively remain no better off than when they began endlessly swapping coins back and forth for food and wages this is tressell s practical way of illustrating the marxist theory of surplus value which in the capitalist system is generated by labour continued a major recurring theme in tressell s book highlights the inability and reluctance of the workers to comprehend or even consider an alternative economic system other than free market capitalism the author attributes this inability amongst other things to the fact that they have never experienced an alternative system and have been raised as children to unquestioningly accept the status quo regardless of it being potentially inimical to their own interests in plato s work the underlying narrative suggests that in the absence of an alternative human beings will accept and submit to their present condition and consider it to be normal no matter how contrived the circumstances the first volume of capital and interest which ludwig von mises decreed as the most eminent contribution to modern economic theory titled history and critique of interest theories 1884 is an exhaustive study of the alternative treatments of interest use theories productivity theories abstinence theories and so on also included was a critique of marx s exploitation theory b hm bawerk argued that capitalists do not exploit their workers they actually help employees by providing them with an income well in advance of the revenue from the goods they produced stating labor cannot increase its share at the expense of capital by 1884 it was recognized as horseshit it ignores time allegory of the cave sure the problem is breaking the status quo would rely on there being a better alternative people want to eliminate money everyone is free to live their life the way they want to instead of slaving away at a job five days a week until they die great but then how do we motivate people to actually do all the shit we need to do to live the way we ve become accustomed to who in their right mind is going to medical school when it means they eat the same government cheese in the same government apartment as their janitor neighbor the problem with this ideal socialist society is it makes incorrect assumptions about the goodness and selflessness of human nature the problem with this ideal socialist society is it makes incorrect assumptions about the goodness and selflessness of human nature the new soviet man never did and never will exist https www youtube com watch v ta z psxodw best illustration of that fact that i ever read was victor belenko s book mig pilot he was raised fully immersed in marxist bullshit from the day he was born and he saw through it all and escaped jcr people want to eliminate money once i passed the age of 14 the idea of getting rid of money always struck me as weird if there s no system of currency how is an orange farmer supposed to buy an automobile with 30 000 oranges how is he supposed to produce that many at once and what if the automobile manufacturer doesn t want 30 000 oranges at the moment how would you even stop that many oranges from going bad within a few days doug casey says that money is life it represents the value created by a society and by inflating it you are basically stealing life from the people who earned it without money you remove the pricing mechanism and the myriad benefits that come with it people who hate money are luddites and should be pounded over the head with their ipads there is a wonderful book the history of money jack weatherford in it he argues convincingly that trade alone uga give basket to agu for fish made humanity immensely more prosperous than it was and that the concept of money advanced that result geometrically see croesus rich as he s the guy who pretty much started the practice and his kingdom flourished until it was plundered by those who took the gold and ignored the reason it was there those who propose money be eliminated are ignoramuses not worthy of consideration they propose that we all return to boiling rocks in the hopes of getting lichen soup it only makes sense in the abstract if you don t really think about the details too much you wouldn t need to buy a car because you d either get the same shitty economy car as everyone else or there would be public transportation but to produce those 30 000 oranges people would be assigned picking oranges as their government mandated job how happy do you think those people stuck picking oranges in the hot sun will be why can t i get a job fixing cars like i want or helping to develop new medicine i m smart is it because i m you racists every potential philosophy you could apply has its positives and its negatives but the grass is always greener do we assume that employers do not work the illustration doesn t really illustrate capitalism at all it has the workers doing something meaningless which is not really even close to reality if we assume he is running a business where they cut bread for a baker as a service which is a terrible business model then the entrepreneur in this situation has found a need that someone would pay for and in turn creates wealth and value by providing a service to the baker and the consumer plus providing employment to the workers that they would not otherwise necessarily have in this fantasy world that socialists live in all business owners do nothing but move money around and only do meaningless value free activities such meaningless employment can only be actualized in the world in keynesian public works projects as in the free market they would fail it s october time for an october surprise mr putin mr assange

simulation on the cheap writing if gj wins new mexico this time he might win the presidency after four years of a giant douche or turd sandwich administration unfortunately the next financial collapse is quite likely to happen in that timeframe jcr i think the chances of a libertarian winning the presidency before they win a single house or senate seat or governorship as libertarians at least are basically zero but i think you re right about the next financial crisis and how exactly is he making up 11 support to catch hillary while trump gains 0 mass plague that selectively kills democrats please this is an asinine article i think rand paul is more likely to win the republican nomination than gary johnson is to win the general election as a libertarian even if trump wins he ll face a
