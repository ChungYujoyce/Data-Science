apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic pro china officials in the white house and pentagon are quietly undermining japan s request to buy 50 advanced f 22 jet fighter bombers to avoid upsetting beijing s government according to u s officials familiar with the dispute japan s defense minister fumio kyuma made a formal request to defense secretary robert m gates earlier this month for classified technical data on the jet as a first step toward a purchase the japanese view the advanced warplane as a key element of a military modernization needed to counter current missile threats

security council and within the office of the secretary of defense are opposing the sale and plan to delay acting on japan s request until after a september deadline when tokyo will then be forced to look for other jets to upgrade its aging aircraft arsenal dennis wilder the nsc staff china specialist declined to endorse the f 22 for japan days before japanese prime minister shinzo abe first raised the sale with president bush at the white house mr wilder told reporters at the time it was an open question to be left for experts on the type of u s aircraft sold to japan china opposes f 22 sales since the ultra modern fighter bomber can carry large numbers of precision guided bombs can hit targets at long ranges and has anti radar stealth that can evade all of china s air defenses both the air force and the f 22 manufacturer lockheed martin corp favor building an export version of the f 22 to reduce unit costs now estimated to be around 150 million per jet and to bolster the alliance with japan south korea australia and israel also are interested in buying the f 22 congress will first need to change legislation to permit foreign sales but the administration so far has not taken any steps to seek a lifting of the ban the f 22 export is a major test of u s support for japan and is being watched closely by japanese government officials who are worried washington will not

kevin t campbell said this week the threat from iran s missiles is growing and that the united states needs a third anti missile intercepter site in europe to counter it gen campbell told a breakfast meeting of defense specialists sponsored by the national defense university foundation and national defense industrial association that iran is in a sprint to build intercontinental range missiles to complement its current arsenal of short and medium range missiles gen campbell said a failure to deploy a third ground based interceptor site in poland and the czech republic would undermine the renewed dedication to missile defense on the part of u s allies russia s government opposes the site despite repeated claims by u s officials that the site will not pose a threat to moscow s missile arsenal the iranian long range missile program could be slowed down if the united states lessens the value of those missiles through the deployment of missile defenses the three star general said the iranian missile threat prompted two states within range of iran s missiles to contact the united states this week about acquiring missile defenses including a key persian gulf state and a nation in

buildup report accurately on beijing s pollution and contribution to greenhouse gases and global warming don t count on it the officials said liberal environmentalists in congress and the private sector will probably make sure that the intelligence reports on global warming avoid criticizing the communist regime in beijing which recently announced that economic modernization still trumps any concerns over chinese pollution a provision of the fiscal 2008 intelligence authorization bill calls for the director of national intelligence to produce a national intelligence estimate on global
