indicted for allegedly using campaign funds for personal use left michael cohen middle pleaded guilty to tax evasion as well as violating campaign finance law and paul manafort right was convicted on 8 counts ap getty history may not repeat itself but it sure does rhyme the war in iraq wasn t going well in the fall of 2005 and early 2006 a federal grand jury indicted top white house aide scooter libby house majority leader tom delay r texas faced an indictment and was forced to step aside from his leadership post delay aides tony rudy and michael scanlon encountered criminal charges in the jack abramoff lobbying scandal so did rep bob ney r ohio ney went to jail rep duke cunningham r calif resigned and did time after pleading guilty to bribery and fraud charges but none of that quite sealed the deal for the rival party in the midterms then word surfaced on the final two days of september 2006 that rep mark foley r fla sent inappropriate text messages to male teenage house pages the foley news erupted in the final hours of congress trying to wrap up work in washington and head home to campaign for the midterm elections voters awarded democrats both the house and senate that november it s unclear that if in november we ll look back at aug 21 the same way we viewed the final days of september some 12 years ago but the potential is there in the span of three hours a federal jury convicted former trump campaign manager paul manafort former trump attorney and fixer michael cohen pleaded guilty to another set of charges then the feds indicted rep duncan hunter jr r calif and his wife margaret hunter on charges of using campaign funds for personal expenses after the manafort and cohen stories one could almost frame the hunter story in the category and in other news the charges against hunter have nothing to do with what went down involving manafort and cohen but it s noteworthy that hunter was one of president trump s earliest and most enthusiastic supporters in 2015 and early 2016 this is back when there were only a few republicans on capitol hill getting behind the president hunter was among them this wouldn t be so interesting if it wasn t for the fact that authorities also just arrested rep chris collins r n y on insider trading charges two weeks ago like hunter collins was one of the president s other original congressional supporters the collins charges aren t related in any way to hunter and are in no way linked to anything with manafort and cohen but as they did in 2006 people may just look at the chaos and pull the lever the other way collins isn t seeking re election that seat could now be in play because republicans can t pry him off the ballot hunter s attorney gregory vega wrote a letter to a favorite gop whipping boy deputy attorney general rod rosenstein vega argued that the justice department was rushing to indict congressman hunter vega asserted the indictment was politically motivated because of hunter s early endorsement of president trump as a result vega contends the indictment means a solidly republican district is being handed to a democratic candidate hunter s counsel wasn t the only one talking tuesday so was cohen s attorney lanny davis today hestood up and testified under oath that donald trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election said davis of cohen if those payments were a crime for michael cohen then why wouldn apos t they be a crime for donald trump now let s step back for a moment storms have churned around trump for a long time in 2016 democrats and pundits thought there was no way he could win he was coarse there was the access hollywood tape you name it and yet trump sits in the white house in other words all of the customary issues that could imperil a lot of politicians don t seem to affect trump his approval ratings have even been on the rise of late there s chatter about a democratic wave this fall but no one is really sure if we adopt the 2006 model republicans are probably toast democrats would claim the house by a lot and maybe even win the senate when democrats earned control of the senate in 2006 they did so by picking up six seats marshaling a 51 49 edge if democrats have any chance of controlling the senate this fall they ll do it by a seat or two at best but history doesn t necessarily repeat itself so be careful when suggesting that the events of aug 21 offer keen insight on the midterm elections yes democrats may do great and pick up a bunch of house seats in pennsylvania and california come november but there are too many uncertainties about seats in play in virginia texas new hampshire north carolina nevada and minnesota a day like aug 21 may yield some clues to the midterms but not everything lots can still happen somewhere brewing out there is an october surprise some morsel of information which could tip the midterms one way or the other consider the possibilities it s hurricane season the devastation of hurricane katrina in 2005 contributed to the republican downfall in 2006 school is back in session or will be soon the left organized after last winter s shooting in parkland fla another mass shooting just before midterms could influence voters in november the international stage is far from settled big issues percolate with russia turkey iran north korea and syria no one can ever rule out an international crisis and you just never know what trump may say or do he apos d better not talk about pardons for michael cohen or paul manafort tonight or any time in the future warned senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y as the president headed to a campaign rally in west virginia sen patrick leahy d vt argued that the backlash of pardon talk for manafort or cohen would have watergate written all over it still this isn t 2006 or 1974 for that matter the convergence of things that doomed the republicans in 2006 may be immaterial this year but it sure does rhyme capitol attitude is a weekly column written by members of the fox news capitol hill team their articles take you inside the halls of congress
