to enjoy all the benefits of our website a grim choice faces 21st century societies panopticons or pandemics mitigation is the new suppression where weeks ago many western governments deemed it enough to isolate those with covid 19 now they are closing down societies and producing scenes that few in the bc before coronavirus era imagined would ever be seen outside of films factories and offices are shuttered stadiums and cinemas gather dust trains and buses run empty or not at all the streets of the world s major cities now exist in a permanent dawn state silent but for the occasional car delivery van solitary pedestrian or jogger the police break up groups in parks and stop people to demand a reason why they have left home following boris johnson s announcement on 23 march of a lockdown even britain once the trailblazer for a more laissez faire mitigation path has joined the ranks of countries imposing harsh suppression measures this is probably the only way at the time of writing the rates of contagion in italy and austria among the first european countries to introduce lockdowns are finally slowing such measures have been integral in those east asian states china singapore hong kong taiwan that have somewhat contained the spread but now what releasing the lockdowns too soon risks triggering a second wave the likes of which killed more in the spanish flu of

infections back up hong kong s institutions began reopening in mid march after a seemingly successful lockdown the numbers of infections initially stayed low but then doubled from 157 to 313 prompting

the medium term without risking a lethal second wave is for governments to ensure that those who have or may have the virus remain isolated to do that they must monitor and condition the behaviour of the entire population in individual and mass cases at an intensity never before seen in the democratic world so countries are faced with what one might call the coronavirus trilemma they can pick two of three things but cannot have them all limit deaths gradually lift lockdowns or upholdcherished civil liberties not all countries are facing up to this reality the us remains a notable laggard but
