understandably given its potential for large scale loss of life and severe economic disruption coverage of the covid 19 pandemic has so far focused on its short term health and economic impact eventually however we will have to start thinking about the longer term repercussions of the virus particularly its political fall out according to the social science literature there appears to be a positive correlation between the prevalence of disease and an increase in authoritarian nationalist political views 1 this could have important ramifications in continental europe where several of the countries at the epicentre of the outbreak were already dealing with the rise of authoritarian nationalist opposition parties and have upcoming elections the possibility of the eu s three largest economies germany france and italy shifting toward authoritarian nationalist politics and upending the liberal settlement of the world s biggest economic block means the political fall out from covid 19 could influence events around the world for decades to come this conjecture is built on two foundations the first is the evidence that greater prevalence of disease increases authoritarian nationalist politics in individuals and countries the second is the explanation of how this occurs which is that higher disease prevalence leads to greater disgust sensitivity the psychological term for a stronger tendency to experience disgust which acts as a negative moderating influence on personality traits that predict liberal political views if this analysis is accurate it looks likely that the covid 19 pandemic will cause a rise in authoritarian nationalism the evidence linking pathogen risk the psychological term for an increased likelihood of dangerous disease and authoritarian nationalist views concerns both short and long term differences in ideology across countries and cultures a 2013 study that aimed to review the existing literature found the data provide empirical substantiation for the hypothesis that societal differences in authoritarian governance may result in part from ecological variation in the prevalence of disease causing parasites this correlation holds among individuals in some 30 countries and in modern as well as isolated hunter gatherer societies importantly priming people with pathogen threat increased their authoritarian nationalist tendencies immediately see here and here like most observations of human behaviour the link between greater disease risk and authoritarian nationalism makes more sense when put into an evolutionary context across the millennia in which the evolutionary influences on human nature took effect there was what scientists have called an opportunity parasite trade off to changing social norms and interaction with outside groups new practices or interaction with outsiders might mean innovation and trade but they could also mean ending traditional practices that maintained cleanliness and being exposed to new diseases it is therefore logical that we would have developed a response to higher disease risk that included becoming more politically conservative it appears that in societies and individuals the increased risk of disease can have an impact on the personality traits mapped to the five factor model of human personality that influence our political views at times of high disease risk our heightened disgust dials down openness to experience which is positively correlated with political liberalism and negatively with authoritarian nationalism this relationship appears to be true for overall ideology attitudes to individual political issues and party preferences historic pathogen risk predicts countries political authoritarianismand social conformity even in the short term a sudden increase in disease risk is likely to turn the political tide away from liberalism towards authoritarian nationalism this disease risk liberalism trade off is helpful when it comes to explaining the consistent victories of liberal politics particularly in europe a healthier wealthier europe has embraced a more open politics the eu single market the schengen open border zone pluralist democracy and liberal individualism and the rest of the world at least the richer parts with traditionally lower pathogen risk has followed a similar pattern this combination of an ever decreasing threat and ever increasing liberalism buttressed by other complimentary trends for example higher urbanisation and education levels has led the conservative author ed west in small men on the wrong side of history to bemoan the fact that the future appears progressive and conservatives defeat is inevitable part of an arc of history that leads irrevocably to a progressive utopia in which they re left in the dustbin indeed some people on twitter have argued that covid 19 might even contribute to this arc of history by disproportionately killing off older voters such people also argue that conservative political leaders such as scott morrison in australia donald trump in america and boris johnson in the uk might suffer politically from an incumbency effect they will be punished for being in office when the virus struck regardless of how well or badly they handle the crisis although the people making this prediction all think they ve handled it badly but social science suggests the opposite at least in the medium to long term the most likely political fall out from the pandemic will be an increase in authoritarian nationalism that was broadly what happened after the spanish flu broke out in 1918 20 that pandemic was one of the worst in history killing an estimated 50 million people coming as it did at the end of the first world war and coinciding with tumultuous events ranging from the russian revolution to hyperinflation in weimar germany its political impact is hard to isolate but in the years that followed america having suffered 675 000 flu deaths adopted a policy of international isolationism and higher tariffs the far right began to rise in europe and fascism emerged in a japan ravaged by the disease though britain elected its first labour government in 1924 the liberal party and its associated ideology vanished so quickly that by 1935 george dangerfield was able to write a book called the strange death of liberal england the spanish flu pandemic coincided with a rapid turn away from a liberal global order towards authoritarian nationalism italy is probably the best place to start in considering how the covid 19 pandemic might change european and global politics italy has already felt the full force of political turmoil in recent years with its 2018 general election seeing the populist right win the most seats and the populist left win the most votes the italians sense of getting a bad deal from the eu after decades of economic stagnation and bearing the brunt of the migration crisis has been aggravated by the emerging perception that its eu allies have abandoned it during its covid 19 hour of need the leader of its populist right matteo salvini has seized the opportunity to push authoritarian nationalist rhetoric he has already used the virus outbreak to call for tighter borders and tweeted when europe has been in need italy has always given now that we are asking for help all the other countries are starting to close their frontiers the reaction from ordinary italians is hard to judge but it is the italian il tricolore not the eu flag that gets flown in the skies by its air force and its own national anthem that is the subject of nationally coordinated balcony singing not europe s ode to joy this undercurrent could provide fertile ground for salvini s campaigning in a future election that could occur at any time turning from the eurozone s third largest economy to its second france was already facing a populist surge ahead of its 2022 presidential election marine le pen leader of the right wing rassemblement national has begun to lead in first round opinion polls as macron s popularity has crumbled following the gilets jaunes protests she was already pitching her campaign as an end to violence and chaos and around patriotism even before the pandemic arrived since the covid 19 outbreak she has like salvini used it as an opportunity to call for an end to the eu s system of open borders between countries even in europe s dominant economy and the eu s lynchpin member germany there appears to be a high risk of post covid 19 political disruption the right wing alternative f r deutschland afd has been growing in popularity in recent elections especially in the poorer east with an election due in october 2021 the ruling christian democratic union party has already been thrown into disarray at state level by the afd s rise causing the resignation of the party s leader and presumptive nominee for chancellor with the afd polling around 15 percent the party s leader in the german parliament has argued that the covid 19 pandemic was caused by the dogma of open borders goldman sachs has echoed chancellor merkle in estimating that 70 percent of germans may catch the virus the impact of a national and global lockdown is likely to be especially severe on an export driven economy with a strong dependence on global supply lines and pan european trade the primary and secondary economic effects of the virus could also provide fertile ground for europe s authoritarian nationalists populists have historically capitalised on economic downturns particularly the type of depressions that will likely occur in the countries and continents hit hardest by the virus in sweden the right wing sweden democrats already lead in the polls ahead of the 2022 general election and in greece where an election is due in 2023 populists have enjoyed electoral success on the back of anti eu sentiment for nearly a decade even in countries where the virus has not yet taken hold as severely as in italy the higher pathogen risk and likely economic impact of the pandemic mean that nationalist parties will find a favourable electoral climate in the coming years in countries like the uk the us and australia there is little sign that electorates will punish conservative incumbents donald trump despite widespread criticism of his handling of the crisis has steady approval ratings and is already using the virus to argue for lower immigration boris johnson s personal approval ratings are holding up and his party s poll ratings have never been higher and scott morrison has regained his lead on who australians see as the best prime minister among party leaders these anglosphere countries and asian liberal democracies such as japan and south korea may drift in a more authoritarian nationalist direction but lack the tinderbox context of continental europe it is there that we find the volatile combination of increased disease risk augmented by its negative economic effects with rising authoritarian nationalist opposition parties what might the ramifications be for europe and the world in the eu the least dramatic scenario is that liberal integrationist leaders like emmanuel macron and angela merkel will be forced to tread lightly and even go into reverse on further european integration come election time the increasing popularity of nationalist parties will force more mainstream parties into awkward and potentially unworkable coalitions creating an even bigger opportunity for the nationalists in the next round of elections in the mid to late 2020s the next step could be the end of the eu s open border schengen zone and reduced economic coordination and adherence to budget rules in the eurozone following on so soon from brexit that could be a huge challenge to the future of the eu an even greater challenge would be italy or france leaving or demanding wholesale reform of the eurozone or single market while the eu could probably survive a greek exit and germany is unlikely to countenance leaving the eu would face an existential threat if its second or third largest economy was to leave or opt out of various integrationist arrangements while marine le pen has rowed back on her earlier position of demanding frexit she still calls for control of immigration economic patriotism and rational and reasonable protectionism salvini s league is even more eurosceptic it renewed its campaign for italy to abandon the euro in december 2019 reversing its more moderate position while in government for now politicians and voters are focusing on minimising the terrible human toll of covid 19 but understanding the social science literature which tells us that increased pathogen risk is likely to shift voters toward authoritarian nationalism and taking into account the fragile state of some of europe s biggest economies suggests that the political fall out from the pandemic could be the not so strange death of liberal europe this would be an impact felt for decades to come jamie martin is a former special adviser to the uk government he tweets jamieamartin1 note 1 in this essay i will for ease use authoritarian nationalist to mean hostility to immigration social conservatism and sympathy for protectionist economic policies and liberal to mean in favour of open markets high immigration and social permissiveness europe s move towards nationalism has been going on for a few years now limitless immigration increasingly authoritarian eu politicians and terrorism have been driving the move i m not sure covid 19 is making anything happen that wan t already happening with respect to people wanting to control who comes into their country and elected officials in their country running it not faceless unaccountable politicians in brussels so i m supposed to believe that the european union was in favor of free trade and that therefore brexit and donald trump were and are opposed to free trade and are therefore illiberal and thus authoritarian i am 76 years old i have read lots of history i keep up with what s going on in the world and i am not willing to swallow a lot of what i read even on quillette were already dealing with the rise of authoritarian nationalist opposition parties and have upcoming elections maybe if governments didn t treat their people as some kind of disease to be cured things would get better but they aren t so they won t immediately tying nationalism to authoritarianism is this dishonest sort of argument ironically it is the result of the same kind of disgust reaction that the author deplores the first is the evidence that greater prevalence of disease increases authoritarian nationalist politics in individuals and countries there it is again open borders caused this catastrophe jonathan pageau talks about it here https www youtube com watch v eihj0k8gt2u on february 1 2020 the mayor of florence italy declared hug a chinese day as a stand against racism this was before italy was later forced to quarantine its entire country because of the coronavirus it has already been forgotten https youtu be mnmdg4morqs it s funny how the exact same people who said borders don t work closed the borders when it was their health and livelihoods under threat the author and his fellow travelers are as incompetent as they are arrogant they are condescending these experts and professionals as contemptuous of commoners lost to common sense and hopelessly inept niall ferguson gave a talk on google zeitgeist a couple of years back which argued that historically populism with it s associated anti immigration sentiment always emerged when the levels of foreign born citizens in a country reached around 14 and an economic downturn ensued within the western tradition people can be incredibly open and inclusive where matters of race and religion are concerned provided in the latter case that every effort is made to conform to the laws and ideals of the host society but with culture there is a marked difference if we look beyond big five personality traits to jonathan haidt s moral foundations then it quickly becomes clear that their are natural limits to the levels of psychological liberalism within societies because even in the wealthiest societies only a maximum of 35 of the population can truly be called a b or c1 in a population when one considers that the prerequisites of the liberal mindset also requires higher than average self perceived socio economic status and a degree of positive inclination towards educational self improvement beyond the mere obtaining of credentials just because you work in an office or are called an assistant manager this doesn t mean that you share the liberal s trait openness to experience indeed with the rise of the cult of wokeness as a secular religion a schism within the liberalism has appeared and this may well be because of a general broadening in the category of c1 to be sure their is a significant element of patronage on the part of the children of very wealthy parents evidenced by the much higher degree of high ses backgrounds within the woke but the tendency towards an intolerance of divergent ideas and beliefs traditionally known as bigotry may well have it s roots in thought leaders coming from more socially conservative backgrounds but on a broader note what we are witnessing is an inability to absorb peoples from different cultures beyond certain very clearly delineated levels clearly whenever a new culture makes it s own home within a host culture it brings it s own brand of cultural uniqueness which enriches the home culture immeasurably just look at the fact that british peoples favourite takeaway food is indian even if this food bears little resemblance to the depth and variety of food available within india but there are limits the host culture needs cultural integration just as much as migrant communities to promote openness and inclusion even while communities retain their own sense of self identity there needs to be a sense of inclusion under the umbrella of national identity common culture and shared values and goals it s not by accident that the most successful second and third generation children of migrants have invariably acclimated and integrated most successfully taking up the cultural traditions of the west and making them their own whether it s opera football rugby singing in choirs or participating in baking competitions the successful invite themselves and this is the fatal flaw in multiculturalism because by holding that all cultures are equal whilst simultaneously denigrating the west for sins that were common to all cultures they ultimately inhibit this tendency to join the home culture effectively excluding newer migrants in sweden teenage boys are desperate to make friends with local boys asking how they can join and adhere to local custom yet they are resolutely told no you must be yourself this in turn leads to a sense of alienation and the tendency to self segregate in turn having profound socio economic implications by denying these boys access to the informal networks and networked economic opportunities that usually work so well for the marginalised and dispossessed and of course if you happen to tend to fail towards the bottom end of the socio economic spectrum by parental background then you are far more likely to possess traits of a psychological conservative for the social conservative a broader sense of belonging to the national community and culture is vital to the ability to thrive and maintain a healthy sense of well being meanwhile the sense of social isolation that multiculturalism imposes between groups has the potential to provoke the very racism and outgroup hostility that the purveyors of multiculturalism seek to stamp out apologies to conservatives in advance but i m going to use a very apt analogy which i ve been thinking about for the last few days consider the socio economic transformation in fortunes that conservatism brings like the transition from caterpillar to butterfly the problem that liberals have is that they keep treating caterpillars like butterflies they make no effort to study the benign conditions that brought about their own rather fortunate circumstances of birth often several generations removed otherwise they would do their best to promote the stable families faith based social institutions cultural integration and strict but not harsh schools that served their forebears so well try to teach a caterpillar to fly without first supplying all the material needs and growth necessary to aid their transformation and you just end up with a rather bruised and hurt caterpillar i don t find the article particularly convincing i take note of the first scientific part but the second part of the article contains some wild speculations based on what appears to be no more than gut feeling some remarks the reaction from ordinary italians is hard to judge but it is the italian il tricolore not the eu flag that gets flown in the skies by its air force and its own national anthem that is the subject of nationally coordinated balcony singing not europe s ode to joy based on what is this covid 19 stimulating nationalism even in the era of european integration flags and national anthems have always been expressions of national pride without implying any dangerous nationalism whatsoever nobody waves the eu flag over its national flag and nobody sings ode to joy not in italy not in spain not in lithuania and not in denmark yes macron used it at his victory rally in 2017 and that was when many people including me learned that there is such a thing as the european anthem one can draw no conclusions from that about people s support for or opposition to the eu even in europe s dominant economy and the eu s lynchpin member germany there appears to be a high risk of post covid 19 political disruption i m not sure about germany but let me translate this to the netherlands where i don t see any risk of post covid 19 political disruption beyond the political disruption that already exists and always has i suppose in fact the leader of the main right wing conservative opposition party in the netherlands last monday stated that with the latest measures the government led by a liberal pm is doing the right thing to fight the virus populists have historically capitalised on economic downturns particularly the type of depressions that will likely occur in the countries and continents hit hardest by the virus except that in this case there is no governments to blame because the oncoming downturn has nothing to do with structural flawed policy the virus will affect each and every economy that it reaches liberal or closed right wing or left wing in countries like the uk the us and australia there is little sign that electorates will punish conservative incumbents following this logic the crisis is an opportunity for liberal incumbents to demonstrate their capabilities as well everything depends on the outcome regardless of the incumbent s political colour the next step could be the end of the eu s open border schengen zone and reduced economic coordination and adherence to budget rules in the eurozone again zero evidence simply wild speculations for me the end of schengen is completely unrealistic since its inception cross border supply chains and services have been designed on the absence of borders right now even when borders are closed for individuals cargo transport and distribution are exempted but still face problems when they end up in hour long queues sometimes the article even cites salvini complaining about closed borders when it comes to reduced economic coordination i am wondering what economic coordination the author is thinking about economic policy is first of all a national matter the eu does play a role but hardly at a level at which one can speak of economic coordination yes there is the common agricultural policy and yes that is a disaster the author probably is right though about the adherence to budget rules in the eurozone but this issue also predates covid 19 see italy s 2018 budget soap and it has long been known that the benefits of common currency are questionable to say the least the possibility of the eu s three largest economies germany france and italy shifting toward authoritarian nationalist politics and upending the liberal settlement of the world s biggest economic block means the political fall out from covid 19 could influence events around the world for decades to come the basic thesis of this article is at best wrong the possibility perhaps the fact that the three largest economies are shifting toward authoritarian nationalist politics would form a reasonable assertion for this thesis but possibility of course we all love quillette but occasionally a stinker does slip through but what the hell we are all supposed to love free speech too so even stinkers are permitted their day in the sun as a citizen of a country whose political divide is libertarian nationalist vs authoritarian socialist i find the terminology of this piece inaccurate also the evolutionary psychology argument behind the influence of parasite load on openness is just that an evolutionary argument assuming that the virus killed off more welcoming people more effectively it probably does and assuming that a large percentage of them die they probably won t then you might see an impact on politics in 20 30 years when the next generation born after the plague produced by its survivors comes of age how that would figure into the next round of european elections is beyond me on the other hand the reasonable realization that strong borders contain diseases of both the biological and psychological varieties and that the willingness of people in your country to sacrifice for each other might be important after all that might actually change some people s minds authoritarian nationalist politics and upending the liberal settlement of the world s biggest economic block the author seems to believe that if you want borders for your own nation you are ipso facto an authoritarian but an unelected central bureaucracy with unelected diktats top down implemented by force is not authoritarian and how do we parse the meaning of borders then apparently if the author thinks the voters don t see this he is foolish then again he struggles with the meaning of authoritarian 1 in this essay i will for ease use authoritarian nationalist to mean hostility to immigration social conservatism and sympathy for protectionist economic policies and liberal to mean in favour of open markets high immigration and social permissiveness apparently for ease of use the author will ignore any possibility of a middle ground between hostility to immigration and high immigration in other words those people who favor low to moderate levels of legal immigration and at the same time are hostile to illegal immigration are given short shrift in this article it seems the author is one of many wokesters who are kept up these nights by the realization that their woke resurgence is not imminent brexit is happening bernie is a bust greek citizens are beating back hordes of immigrants at the border and now the wuflu fear of contagion aside i think it must really suck to be a prog these days the author says in this essay i will for ease use authoritarian nationalist to mean hostility to immigration social conservatism and sympathy for protectionist economic policies i get the nationalist bit putting the interests of your own nation first but in what way does this imply authoritarianism the limit of freedoms or stricter control of the actions of the citizenry hmmm my entire life i have been told by my betters that the europeans were horrid for giving small pox to the american indian well now these same people fall in to paroxysms when the corona virus is mentioned in conjunction with china or the city of wuhan the boer farmer living in the transvaal is a war criminal and a usurper even though he migrated there in the 17th century when the land was empty of human inhabitants yet every african asian or middle eastern person has a universal human right to move to northern europe and live off the welfare state forever the british were despicable for forcing opium on the chinese in the 19th century as a state policy to cure a horrid trade imbalance the chinses today enjoy an obscene trade surplus with the united states but still see it as a state prerogative to protect the fentanyl trade which will kill more americans this year than will covid 19 indian and pakistani nationalists have openly stated that it is their manifest destiny to people the entire anglo sphere with their race this to me sounds like the worst kind of jingoism and racial determinism that came from the mouths of european social darwinists in the nineteenth centuries last but not least i was reared in a home with a father who was a unionized rail road employee the idea of strike breaking or crossing a picket line was anathema i believe it still is to the woke crowd who are all for the worker unless that worker is a tech or stem employee who will lose his job to an h1b visa holder hired for half the salary then it is cool because we are all showing our openness and tolerance to other superior cultures things that can t last won t last the new world order of the 21st century was bound to fail and thanks to chinese bat soup it has failed this is an interesting cultural artifact of modern western leftists they accept this chain of reasoning near as i can tell we re all familiar with their equation of controlled immigration dog whistling racism i d posit that it is a gruber effect for instance many are in fact in favor of marxism but since that s socially unacceptable of course they ll reasonably ask for single payer while setting up the system to fail it s fallacious reasoning but is revealing when applied to their positions it s also why the right wasn t the one to radicalize first i ve been observing this for awhile and what s interesting about it is the performative aspect in their minds there s either some scorekeeping judge or low information rube that the performance is being done for meaning that you cannot have any kind of good faith discussion they ll lie cheat and distort to set up their performative display to convince this other figure of their position when the jussie smollett thing happened i shot over to the root to see what the aa dominated comments section had to say in a long stream of police officers are racist social reinforcing posts one gentleman posted yeah cops are racist also we all happen to know that cops are really good bs detectors so if they think he s lying about what happened he s probably lying right there were a series of responses yeah they are and he probably is but they re racist pigs anyway i found it fascinating see the same with peta this attempt to out perform each other in the extremity of their positions reminds me of the monty python skit in my day we woke up before we went to bed and were beaten 30 hours a day kids today don t understand how good they have it or some of the recent discussions on trump politico of all places had an editorial responding positively to trump s recent actions on coronavirus regarding the stimulus i ve mentioned to my wife you can tell which news outlets are staffed with true believers of the russia gate style crap they maintain the line and which were doing it out of expediency well he s crazy but this bit here is ok because we need to get behind our leadership now and they know it what i can t fathom is who this other is sometimes it s definitely the rube the uninformed voter but frequently it s like performing for an authority i chalk it up to the fact that many on the left still have an immature teenager young adult worldview and still automatically are performing for the adults for grades plaudits i include many even of retirement age who are like speaking to college students i assume they ve never reconciled to the revolution being a dumbass failure dok either you re being sophistic or you don t understand the difference between the world economy 200 years ago and now 200 years ago the usa was entirely different it wasn t a world power it had tons of open land and tons of jobs available it had slaves too so your argument seems to be hey it was ok 200 years ago so it s ok now i can apply this attitude to almost anything slavery vitalized the south 200 years ago so it should be ok now there was no income tax 100 years ago so there should be none now only 5 of people graduated high school 60 years ago so only 5 should now women didn t have the vote 100 years ago so they shouldn t now i could go on and on but i m sure you get it the world and economy is not the same as it was 200 years ago on multiple levels no one is against legal immigrants what i m against are illegal economic migrants for many reasons that have zero to do with being authoritarian actually those in favor of economic migrants are the ones who are authoritarian because they believe they re morally right superior to others and have the right to force their beliefs on the entire population without their consent since the majority of the population in most countries disagrees with them the only way they can change the laws is by top down fiat and threats as far as your logic that we can bring in unvetted immigrants because we birth children um children are vetted they get legal birth certificates legal social security numbers and so on i have to believe you re being sophistic this doesn t convince anyone except those who already agree with you what s the point i don t know if that s another reply to me or not but illegal immigrants do pay taxes illegals don t pay taxes they use all kinds of dodges to reduce their payments claiming huge numbers of dependents etc in addition the illegals here cost communities a huge unnoted tax the remittances they send home the remittances 30 000 000 000 year for mexico 30 000 000 000 for central america consist of money taken out of communities that would have been spent there rather than spending the money on local businesses to build houses and hire people it goes to mexico and is used to build houses there this remittance tax is not noticed by most but is a huge cost to all communities which have a lot of illegals 90 more replies pingback przemy lenia w ci kich czasach photography asperger pingback i tho i i m tin ng y 27 th ng 03 n m 2020 doithoaionline
