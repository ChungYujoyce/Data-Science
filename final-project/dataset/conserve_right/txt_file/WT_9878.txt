apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the following is an excerpt from bowing to beijing regnery publishing nov 14 2011 mutual dependency can guarantee a certain amount of pragmatic behavior by both sides but there should be no romantic illusions about how the chinese communists feel about america we hate you guys china banking regulatory commission director general luo ping fumed about the prc being forced into buying u s treasuries to protect beijing s massive u s debt holdings once you start issuing 1 trillion 2 trillion we know the dollar is going to depreciate so we hate you guys but there is nothing much we can do he says there is nothing they can do because beijing needs americans to keep buying their consumer goods approximately 20 percent of imports into america come from the prc and that percentage is on the rise china s huge pool of cheap labor means the country can produce more stuff at lower cost than anyone else as if the peasant advantage weren t enough for its production facilities beijing has pursued monetary policies to keep the yuan artificially low to guarantee that its products can undercut any competitors prices even more top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century this is a mixed blessing or mixed curse depending on one s point of view with a flood of inexpensive products coming from china american homemakers can spend less on most household goods which leaves more income to save invest spend on luxury goods or dedicate to children s education on the downside artificially low prices for chinese goods create an unlevel playing field on which u s companies can t compete a situation that unquestionably led to millions of u s jobs being sent overseas and the resultant collapse of america s domestic manufacturing base there is an uneasy alliance of some political factions on the left and right on this issue even devout free traders agree that a working system of free trade depends on a regime of rules that prohibits uncompetitive national practices that prop up or unduly support domestic industries a may 2011 editorial in the new york times offers a critique of beijing practices with which almost anyone on the ideological spectrum can agree the list of complaints is long 80 percent of the computer software in china is counterfeit beijing just published a new investment catalog that keeps a long list of industries off limits for american firms the old gray lady protested it changed the investment vetting process to allow chinese companies to recommend barring acquisitions by foreign rivals it has done nothing to reduce the enormous subsidies in the form of cheap credit to favored state owned firms the catalog of beijing s sins goes on and on but the point is that the people s republic can essentially do what it wants and it gets away with it as thea m lee policy director for the afl cio testified before the commission on u s china economic and security review enforcement of wages hours and health and safety rules is lax or nonexistent in many areas of the country and forced and child labor are prevalent in some sectors it s no surprise many u s labor unions have staked out a tough stance on the prc and some of it for good reason along with child labor beijing has a penchant for openly pursuing unfair trade practices and violating international trade rules one of the most common practices is direct government financial subsidies for prc industries so they can sell goods below the price of production thereby stealing market share the other major way beijing cheats to get its companies ahead is by forcing state owned banks to provide low interest loans to businesses and making these financial institutions absorb losses by exporters chinese businesses have a significant and unfair competitive advantage by not having to pay market priced interest rates on borrowed money and not having to cover losses on their books as republican rep duncan hunter put it succinctly china is cheating on trade at the center of the prc s trade strategy are machinations to keep their currency undervalued which makes the price of their exports cheaper in relation to products from nations with stronger currencies washington s sale of so much u s debt to beijing unwittingly strengthens this communist ploy because of their undervalued currency and large trade surplus abundant u s dollars are officially overpriced in china jonathan rothwell a research analyst at the brookings institution explains chinese banks take deposits from exporters in dollars convert them to yuan lend them out and get artificially high returns by virtue of the enhanced buying power of yuan in effect the chinese get more bang for the buck than americans do by using the relative high value of the dollar in their own markets where prices are low because of the artificially depressed value of their own currency to keep the value of the yuan low china has bought more than 3 trillion in foreign currency reserves its reserves are the world s largest accounting for 31 percent according to businessweek china still closely manages the level of its exchange rate and restricts the ability of capital to move in and out of the country u s treasury secretary timothy geithner complained in january 2011 these policies have the effect of keeping the chinese currency substantially undervalued the obama administration is crying wolf about beijing manipulating its currency but so what secretary geithner has insisted that beijing strengthen the yuan to help improve u s price competitiveness but this clearly isn t in china s interest and the u s treasury has little leverage with its biggest creditor it s hardly china s fault that we re so dependent on their largesse that fluctuations in the yuan are dangerous at home in the place formerly recognized as the land of the free in no uncertain terms america is not free if we re shackled to the economic policies and monetary decisions of a communist state mr geithner has warned that president obama believes the prc is manipulating its currency but there is nothing the united states can do about it because we depend on the prc continuing to prop up our markets as the augusta chronicle of georgia put it so aptly if you took out a sizable loan from your neighborhood bank you re not likely to strut into the bank president s office and tell him how to run the place but that s what obama and geithner are doing or at least doing for the cameras they don t have a leg to stand on america s addiction to cheap chinese consumer products as well as our reliance on a constant flow of chinese loans to buy the junk stem from economic indiscipline and weak political leadership in washington at the root of the problem is an obstinate refusal to live within our means while both political parties have had a poor recent track record on spending it appears that republicans now understand the imperative to mend our ways while democrats are bitterly resisting change in a more responsible direction this standoff was painfully obvious during budget battles in 2011 over raising the debt ceiling so government can continue to borrow from future generations to pay today s bills president obama and democratic leaders in congress resisted any republican attempts to tie an increase in the debt ceiling to corresponding cuts in federal spending or entitlement reform on april 11 2011 just a few days before tax payments were due to the irs white house spokesman jay carney said we believe that we should move quickly to raise the debt limit and we support a clean piece of legislation to do that translation give capitol hill big spenders a credit card with no limits house speaker john a boehner a republican insisted that any increase in the debt ceiling must be equaled or surpassed by corresponding cuts in government spending but he was ignored in the other chamber by democratic senate majority leader harry reid so the cycle continues a u s government on the verge of insolvency spends more than it has on big government programs it cannot afford the sugar daddy
