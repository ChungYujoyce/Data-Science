general in the people s liberation army to boot he s a stiff policymaker a suit with the bland public persona of most chinese leaders vice president xi jinping is in line to take the country s top post in two years setting up an unusual scenario in a system where leaders families are kept almost invisible how will the ruling communist party handle a first lady who s arguably more famous than her husband so far the answer appears to be by making her disappear too references to mr xi s marriage to peng liyuan are being scrubbed from the internet she has been given a desk job at her military song and dance troupe reducing her public appearances top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens sex at birth hungary bans people from legally

overseeing the chinese military boosting the likelihood he will lead the communist party in 2012 political wives have long been viewed suspiciously in china ever since chairman mao zedong s wife jiang qing promoted his most radical policies took part in purging opponents and ultimately made a grab for power she was arrested and imprisoned after his death in 1976 in a world where first ladies from france s carla bruni to america s michelle obama routinely grab media attention liu yongqing the wife of chinese president hu jintao is rarely seen except during state visits with the spouses of foreign leaders the almost absent chinese first lady reflects in part the preference of the technocratic authoritarian leadership for running the rising global power at an impersonal distance on the one hand they have been talking about governance with a human touch and given that mrs peng s image is positive what s the point of trying to eliminate it said dali yang a china expert at the university of chicago it s only making it more mysterious and provides room for speculation by all public accounts the 47 year old mrs peng s image is squeaky clean many chinese can recall her almost yearly appearances on state television s spring festival gala which draws 800 million viewers beginning with the inaugural 1982 program on fog filled stages dressed in pouffy evening gowns mrs peng performed rousing patriotic songs such as on the plains of hope having a first lady who s well known in her own right would likely be a point of pride for many chinese who know little about their

teenage daughter when they met she was upset this guy was such a country bumpkin and he looked old according to a 2007 article in the zhanjiang evening news a southern newspaper mr xi charmed her talking about music theory the article said peng said at that time i was very moved isn t this the one i ve been looking for he s unsophisticated but he s really intelligent that article was widely reprinted in whole or part even by the official xinhua news agency and the communist party s peoples daily newspaper but has since been removed from their websites in a 2001 article mrs peng said she felt fortunate for having an understanding husband as a government official he s very busy when i visit him in fuzhou he has to delay meetings or trips to the countryside in order to find time to spend with me the shanghai morning post quoted her as saying every time i go we ll try our best to avoid quarrels and enjoy those hard earned days those articles and others have been deleted from most websites while the deletions are not definitely the government s handiwork the fact that cached versions of the articles are being erased too conforms to the way china s internet censors work the state council information office did not respond to a faxed request for comment rebecca mackinnon a china specialist and senior fellow at the new america foundation studying internet issues said the
