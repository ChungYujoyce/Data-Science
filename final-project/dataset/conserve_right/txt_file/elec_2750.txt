ball that is always wrong more than 240 000 new democrats and independents showed up to vote in virginia s republican presidential primary this week the tip of a massive shift as all the enthusiasm and interest are moving to the gop the numbers are staggering in other big states as well more than 535 000 new democrats and independents in texas 175 000 in georgia 172 000 in tennessee and 143 000 in alabama according to a washington times analysis of exit polling that compared this year s election with the 2008 race the last time both parties had a contested primary donald trump the iconoclastic republican front runner says it s all his doing top stories postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni ann coulter turns on trump most disloyal actual retard that has ever set foot in the oval office we have expanded the republican party the billionaire businessman declared tuesday night as results showed republicans demolishing record after record in primary turnout they re longtime democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched and they were independents and we ve actually expanded the party exit polling shows mr trump has indeed helped build up the party this year with nearly 10 million people casting ballots in the 15 primaries and caucuses so far about 4 million more than voted in the same republican races in 2008 mr trump has won about a third of the votes building a formidable and durable coalition that somehow spans moderates and evangelicals draws heavily from self identified independents and tilts toward older and less educated supporters just how successful he and his fellow candidates have been is captured in the numbers 14 of the 15 republican contests so far have set records for turnout just as striking is the drop off for democrats who though setting a record tuesday in colorado s caucuses have seen turnout plummet in every other race accounting for all 15 races so far democratic turnout is down more than 30 percent compared with the heady days of 2008 when barack obama battled hillary clinton in an epic clash in fact the numbers this year are almost exactly reversed through the same races in 2008 democrats had accounted for 62 percent of all votes cast but this year powered by a surge of interest from democrats republicans and independents alike republicans account for 59 percent of the votes cast democrats insist much of the difference is attributable to the size of the republican field which went into iowa with a dozen candidates compared with three for democrats in super tuesday races republicans had five candidates and democrats were down to two mrs clinton and sen bernard sanders i understand there s been a disparity across the country i think it s a disparity that s caused by the fact that the republicans have so many candidates sen amy klobuchar minnesota democrat told msnbc s andrea mitchell reports program they ve had a major major race we ve had one too and it s really important but it s not been nearly as volatile the white house saw the math the other way press secretary josh earnest said that when the votes were tallied in states such as virginia mrs clinton ended up with more support in her two person race than any of the five republican candidates did i think this is an indication that there is ample enthusiasm on the democratic side particularly in the places where it matters most in the general election mr earnest said indeed most of the races tuesday were in states that are unlikely to be battlegrounds in november s general election virginia was the chief exception digging into the numbers though republicans said they are confident that the overall turnout in virginia bodes well for recapturing the state in november mr obama won virginia in 2008 and 2012 nearly 240 000 more voters chose to cast a ballot for republican candidates versus hillary or bernie said john findlay executive director of the virginia republican party mr findlay said republican turnout exceeded that of democrats in almost every region of the state including the big suburban swing counties of loudoun and prince william in the washington region henrico on the outskirts of richmond and chesapeake in the southeast the road to the white house runs through these localities and republican candidates had more votes on tuesday than democrats in each and every one of them he said mr earnest said some of the massive republican turnout is due to hostility toward mr trump suggesting he could be a drag on the party if he is the nominee in november a number of voters emerging from polling places tuesday said they were searching for an anti trump strategy that was the case for cori defrancis 61 a consignment shop owner voting in atlanta who backed sen marco rubio in the republican primary because she thought he had the best chance of beating mr trump i m very very concerned about donald trump becoming the nominee she said i find him embarrassing to our party party leaders are also worried that mr trump will drive away rank and file republicans like ms defrancis mr trump though says the numbers speak for themselves we re going to be a unified party he said and we are going to be a much bigger party and you can see that happening we re going to be a much bigger party our party is expanding and all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where i ve won his coalition hits the republican sweet spot he does best among voters who identify as somewhat conservative while holding his own among very conservative and moderate voters it s also striking which demographics are not trouncing mr trump analysts predicted that hispanic voters would reject him for his brash comments about mexico and his strong stance against illegal immigration but in states with sizable hispanic populations nevada and texas he has won hispanic voters at nearly the same rate as his
