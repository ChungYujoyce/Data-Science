destroyed trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore some commentators and bloggers think the broadcast could be cctv producers pushing the envelope of censorship or another sign that the ruling communist party s newly installed leader xi jinping is serious about reform oh god cctv unexpectedly put out v for vendetta i had always believed that film was banned in china media

which is not accessible to most chinese because of government internet controls this great film couldn t be any more appropriate for our current situation dictators prisons secret police media control riots getting rid of heretics fear evasion challenging lies overcoming fear resistance overthrowing tyranny china s dictators and its citizens also have this relationship china s authoritarian government strictly controls print media television and radio censors also monitor social media sites including weibo programs have to be approved by the state administration of radio film and television but people with knowledge of the industry say cctv the only company with a nationwide broadcast license is entitled to make its own censorship decisions when showing a foreign movie it is already broadcast it is no big deal said a woman who answered the phone at movie channel cctv 6 we also didn t anticipate such a big reaction the woman who only gave her surname yang said she would pass on questions to her supervisor which weren t answered the spokesman for the state administration of radio film and television said he had noticed the online reaction to the broadcast i ve not heard of any ban on this movie wu baoan said thursday the film is available on video on demand platforms in china where movie content also needs to be approved by authorities a political scientist at the chinese academy of social sciences who used to work for cctv said the film might have approval or it could have been cctv s own decision to broadcast it every media outlet knows there is a ceiling above their head said liu shanying sometimes we will work under the ceiling and avoid touching it but sometimes we have a few brave ones who want to reach that ceiling and even express their discontent over the censor system it is very possible that cctv decided by itself to broadcast the film liu said if so he added it would have been due to a gut feeling that china s film censorship will be loosened or reformed v for vendetta was released in the united states in 2005 and around the world in 2006 china has a yearly quota on the numbers of foreign movies that can be imported on a revenue share basis making it tough to get distribution approval other movies that failed to reach chinese screens in 2006 include brokeback mountain and pirates of the caribbean dead man s chest chinese moviegoers that year were able to see mission impossible iii with tom cruise and the painted veil which was filmed in china and set in a chinese village warner brothers which produced and distributed v for vendetta declined to comment china doesn t have a classification system so all movies shown at its cinemas are open to adults and children of any age a filmmaker and beijing film academy professor xie fei published an open letter on sina weibo on saturday calling for authorities to replace the movie censorship system that dates from the 1950s with a ratings system the airing of v for vendetta raised some hopes about possible changes under xi who was publicly named china s new leader last month he has already announced a trimmed down style of leadership calling on officials to reduce waste and unnecessary meetings and pomp his reforms are aimed at pleasing a public long frustrated by local corruption state media say they have reduced reports on officials trips as part of this drive the official xinhua news agency warned this week that media outlets should learn to play professionally in today s information age as an increasingly picky audience is constantly putting them under scrutiny an american business consultant and author with high level chinese contacts said there is no less commitment to one party rule in china so any media reforms will only go so far you can t have a totally free media as we would have in the west and still maintain the integrity of a one party system said robert lawrence kuhn who wrote the book how china s leaders think he said he thinks restrictions are being eased but it has to be limited the new leadership has to tread carefully kuhn said because in the age of the internet talk about reforms won t be forgotten high expectations if they are not fulfilled will create a worse situation he said ap
