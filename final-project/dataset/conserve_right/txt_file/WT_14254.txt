the hottest players on the international circuit having just won the tata steel challengers tournament in wijk aan zee last month a victory that earns him a spot in the elite tate masters in 2016 with barely a pause to reboot wei continued his winning ways at the superstrong tradewise gibraltar tournament now underway on the mediterranean island starting out with four wins and a draw before finally losing at the hand of veteran english star david howell with six wins in the first six rounds american gm hikaru nakamura was setting the pace with three rounds to go monday wei has long been a talent to watch he earned the grandmaster title at age 13 at the time becoming the youngest gm in the world one of the games on the way to the title was a fine win over fellow chinese star and 2010 national champion gm zhou jianchao from a 2013 invitational in danzhou employing the english attack in a sicilian scheveningen wei as white lands the first blow after 13 exd5 nxd5 14 nf3 nxe3 black understandably moves to eliminate a powerful bishop but this doesn t turn out well better was 17n7f6 15 nxd5 nxd5 16 bg1 with just a slight edge for white 15 qxe3 qe5 16 qd2 bc5 17 nf5 bc4 0 0 18 nc6

attack and the position grows extremely sharp 19b3 20 axb3 qb4 21 c3 qxb3 22 ngh5 rb8 23 nd3 ba3 when 24 qxh6 loses to 24bxb2 25 nxb2 qxc3 26 kd1 rxb2 but with 24 rh2 white s defense holds up just barely long enough to do the job 24bb7 qa2 25 qxh6 qa1 26 kd2 rxb2 27 nxb2 qxb2 28 kd1 qb1 29 ke2 qb2 30 qd2 holds and wins 25 kb1 bxf3 26 qxh6 qxc3 27 re5 a beautiful blocking sacrifice mate on g7 is threatened and if 27nxe5 white can choose between 28 qg7 mate and 28 nf6 mate zhou resigned we go from a glimpse of the future to a blast from the past california gm james tarjan was one of the country s best players in the late 1970s and early 1980s a regular participant in u s championships a member of five olympiad teams and a qualifier for the 1978 1980 world championship cycle but after finishing third in the 1984 u s title tournament tarjan gave up the game for three decades paying the bills by working as a librarian now tarjan who turns 63 later this month has suddenly resurfaced scoring a creditable 7 2 in last year s u s open and now competing alongside wei at the tradewise gibraltar event the rust showed even as he got off to a nice 2 start as he had to struggle to defeat english im nigel povah from the black side of a trompowsky attack in round 3 tarjan s queen gets chased around the queenside as white builds up his position with strong pressure along the d file with an increasingly jumbled position black makes a good practical decision to jettison the pawn on 25 nc7 rc5 26 qd2 nxa6 bxa6 27 rxa6 nb4 d5 27 nxd5 kh8 28 qe2 ne5 although white retains a clear advantage but black claws back into the game after 29 nxe5 better was 29 ndb6 nxc4 30 rxc4 rxc4 31 bxc4 bxg2 32 kxg2 keeping his edge bxe5 30 nb6 rxd1 31 qxd1 qd6 32 qxd6 rc1 33 bf1 bxd6 34 rd4 be5 and black s bishop pair provides strong compensation for the pawn deficit those bishops help turn the tables as white s pieces suddenly start getting in each other s way 36 nc4 bf6 37 rd7 the wrong square for the rook equal was 37 rd6 bf3 38 nd2 rd1 39 nc4 bc6 38 rc7 bf3 39 rd7 bc3 also strong was 39be2 when white had to try 40 nd2 rd1 41 ra7 rxd2 42 bxe2 rxe2 43 rxa6 and hope to hold on 40 nd2 the last chance to fight for a draw was giving back the pawn with 40 e4 fxe4 41 ne3 ra1 42 rc7 though again the black two bishops give him a strong endgame edge bc6 41 rd6 bxd2 and white resigned because 42 rxd2 bb5 collects the pinned bishop wei yi 4th danzhou tournament danzhou china may 2013 1 e4 c5 2 nf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 nxd4 nf6 5 nc3 a6 6 be3 e6 7 f3 b5 8 qd2 nbd7 9 g4 b4 10 nce2 h6 11 o o
