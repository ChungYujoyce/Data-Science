effort in recent years to bring greater attention to china s cultural offerings top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged

come to be defined said alicia adams the vice president of international programming and dance at the kennedy center in washington d c and producer of its festival of china showcase in 2005 produced by the team behind the 2008 beijing olympics opening and closing ceremonies panda opened to mixed critical reviews in december and recently added dates through july it comes after other chinese shows have led the way to u s stages including two chinese produced resident shows in branson mo and a steady flow of touring chinese arts troupes at venues across the country i hope that the show provides an opportunity for cultural bonding and shared mutual reference so that chinese culture will have a tighter bond with other cultures said zhong min xu producer of the vegas show answering questions by email through a translator while panda is privately funded china has been sending performing arts troupes to overseas festivals and universities for years often with backing from its ministry of culture in the mid 2000s the ministry set the explicit national priority of exporting chinese culture it s an effort in part to win hearts and minds at a time when the country s politics vex its

were large scale nationalistic spectacles modeled after similar communist pageantry in the soviet union it has taken time and specialists such as barbash to fine tune the flow of shows overseas newer exports are more subtle diverse and abstract they understand what success is in the wider world barbash said and what that may mean is that if they want to be respected by the wider world an evolution
