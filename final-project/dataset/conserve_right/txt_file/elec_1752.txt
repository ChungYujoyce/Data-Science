promised impossible tax cuts 10 percent for the middle class before the november 6 election and gave texas rally goers last night a rather mundane by now rendition of how isis illegals ms13 gang members liberal mobs congressional democrats and the media are working together to take america down the substantial crowd ate it up anyway i had a nearly front row view of the action something that felt especially surreal when trump turned the crowd s attention to the scourge of the fake news media i don t think they like us very much pic twitter com ag68blrhon elizabeth nolan brown enbrown october 23 2018 but the most bizarre and entertaining part for me came before even entering the houston arena where the rally was being held a few blocks away i passed a hulking and seemingly wet shirted alex jones of infowars fame huffing away from the area with a small entourage of men in maga hats i about faced to ask if he had just had some sort of confrontation with protesters right in time to see jones take to the middle of the street to shout at a pile of horseshit while jones camera guy and i took video jones addressed the shit pile as if it were beto o rourke the texas democrat challenging sitting republican sen ted cruz in the upcoming midterm elections literally the first thing i encountered in the vicinity of the cruz trump rally was alex jones screaming at a pile of shit pic twitter com lxmpgjamb5 elizabeth nolan brown enbrown october 22 2018 cruz was ostensibly the reason for the rally and why trump had come to town horse race midterms types would point out here that this makes little strategic sense as cruz is projected to win tidily and the president s time might be better spent throwing a bone to less safe gop candidates but cruz seemed almost an afterthought throughout the pre trump speakers who mentioned cruz did so only in the most general terms i e vote for cruz if you don t want texas and or america to become a horrible socialist dystopia vote for cruz if you want jobs not mobs they spent much more time slagging a cartoonishly radical caricature of o rourke than touting anything specific about cruz trump who earlier in the day had told reporters that lyin ted was now beautiful ted had a few kind words for cruz at the rally but he was much more animated talking about louie gohmert other republican politicians in attendance or just about anyone else overwhelmingly trump gave the impression that he was there not so much for cruz as because he wanted a big old texas sized rally the president spent a significant amount of time not only touting the alleged honor of newly confirmed supreme court justice brett kavanaugh but also bragging about how many people he had already placed on the supreme court in less than two years we have a record number of supreme court judges said trump as if the vacancies he had an opportunity to fill were some sort of testimony to his greatness rather than a mere temporal quirk at least i only spotted two qanon shirts this time the u s food and drug administration is going after a website that sold abortion inducing drugs the website aid access has been quietly shipping the drugs from a pharmacy in india to women in the u s for the last six months reports the daily beast in response to what the site s founder said was an overwhelming demand from american women more for women who pass the site s online screening they must say they are less than ten weeks pregnant and live within one hour of a hospital for example founder rebecca gomperts fills the prescriptions herself and sends them to a trusted pharmacy in india she maintains that the process is legal because the fda allows people to import medicines for their personal use but the fda currently subjects mifepristone to a strict distribution protocol which prevents it from being sold online or in retail pharmacies although the drug is used in roughly a third of all first trimester abortions and has resulted in only 22 deaths to date it can be distributed only at pre approved clinics hospitals and private practices next when george orwell got in a fight with the anarchist author of the joy of sex elizabeth nolan

ted was an afterthought at his own rally this was too important to leave the charm offensive up to cruz come on fist you wasted an opportunity to use a tet offensive pun too soon i m tet offended anyway never too soon for tet a tet hello what was alex jones saying it can t be any more retarded than say krugman thinking there was going to be a global recession because trump or the claim that there was going to be a nuclear holocaust because trump or that narcissistic weasel obama claiming credit for the healthy economy or the repeated canard of migrants commit less crimes than natives that needs tweaking etc etc right like you alex jones speaks horse shit ok whatever you say mr classical liberal dont get buttplugger started on his desire to enslave an entire race of people alex jones yelling at poo is gonna be hard to top today i don t think they like us very much pic twitter com ag68blrhon elizabeth nolan brown enbrown october 23 2018 don t pretend the feeling isn t mutual i don t think they like us very much when the shoe fits and the shoes are on sale it s like they are paying you to take their shoes the u k is banning the phrase fake news in government documents the english only movement for the left still permitted balderdash poppycock rubbish bollocks and my all time favortite codswallop tommyrot piffle twaddle it doesn t really matter since the lefty media are propagandists its not fake news that they are oozing but propaganda well said ingsoc literally the first thing i encountered in the vicinity of the cruz trump rally was alex jones screaming at a pile of shit pic twitter com lxmpgjamb5 elizabeth nolan brown enbrown october 22 2018 don t say i didn t bring you any scoops from this thing elizabeth nolan brown enbrown october 22 2018 boooooo poooooo fist you gilmored us all you bastard i know it looks like everyone is being sarcastic at me and i don t like it at all webmaster jennifer or mike a or whichever nerd is in charge of this site these days feel free to delete the original comment i ll take that for the team for goodness sake did somebody forget to close an italics tag not again the horror no reason truncated my comment thanks to enb s twitter smiley emoji or something bottom line not my fault definitely your fault your italics makes it seem like you re saying sarcastically that it s my fault which means you re saying it isn t give it up you two it s the emphasis tag as far as i can tell and it can t be closed it can t be bargained with it can t be reasoned with it doesn t feel pity or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop ever until this post is dead so emoji is stripped they are but only enb s smug one gets through horse race midterms types would point out here that this makes little strategic sense as cruz is projected to win tidily and the president s time might be better spent throwing a bone to less safe gop candidates i wonder what would happen if the media spent even half of its trolling efforts of trump working under the assumption that the love of beto is partially what got trump there actually trying to use the manipulation for things they want the previous post on orwell might have something to say there right wing terrorist plants bomb at home of international capitalist george soros https goo gl vkaywo soros who made his fortune in hedge funds has donated heavily to liberal causes and is vilified on the right he is also the subject of many unfounded conspiracy theories recently conservative critics have without evidence accused him of secretly financing a caravan of central american migrants to make their way north toward mexico and the u s others have falsely accused him of being a nazi collaborator during world war ii when he was a child in hungary activists frequently post the addresses of homes he owns in westchester county north of new york city on social media sometimes accompanied by ill wishes fox news you know who planted it shouldnt you share that info for hitler s special buddy soros the right wing terrorists who live under your bed must have done this you should call the fbi and inform them of this since by your own link the fbi has no idea who did this i doubt the fbi takes your calls anymore maybe you can get a friend to do it for you if you did it then fess up john one of you deplorables did it are your tiki torches not enough please let us know who i don t want hitler jr soros injured others have falsely accused him of being a nazi collaborator during world war ii when he was a child in hungary fox news he took the property of jews sent to concentration camps it s going to be a bit difficult to gloss over that i guess he was doing the kind of work nazis did not want to do but it hardly justifies hitler jr tell fox news and the sane world about your crazy ct soros has said he did so but again like other open borders advocates he was doing the work native citizens apparently wouldnt when you actively work with nazis to steal property and then help send the owners to their deaths you might get a bad reputation they called those people collaborators technically the jewish sonderkommando were collaborators too they got incoming murder victims to unclothe and walk into the showers willingly they have been forgiven by jewish groups and most of them died paying for their sins so it is what it is soros continues to undermine freedom in the usa and get an american socialist regime to steal property soros is good at that you appearently forgot to take your meds today what was palin s take on scalise asking for a friend i read the article there was no mention of a right wing terrorist or any suspect of any political persuasion lefties are the bombers weather underground timothy mcveigh ted kaczynski the new world liberation front the symbionese liberation army i know better to reply to an idiot like you but mcveigh was right wing all the way his motive for okc was ruby ridge and waco actions by bill clinton janet reno george soros was a nazi do you think the only person who could be offended by ruby ridge and waco would be a right wing person the weavers at ruby ridge were neo nazis waco had the koresh commune set up by a religious sect of the mormon faith mormons are more socialist than quite a few of the christian denominations the cult of mormon controls utah in many similar aspects like socialist states do try again buttplugger nazis are of course socialists ha enjoy the endless italics everyone my work here is done this is too much power for anyone to have let alone you i feel it brings us all together and we need that right now you know who else brought everyone together the strong nuclear force and the van der waals forces and gravity it s beautiful like nice penmanship easier to read love it at least it s not bold president trump called himself a nationalist patriotism is when love of your own people comes first nationalism when hate for people other than your own comes first charles de gaulle wow what a timely quote thanks for sharing yes he is a nationalist as is the vast majority of the country you fucking half wit actually that s incorrect haven t you seen the studies reason publicizes showing record numbers of americans say immigration is a good thing openborders that doesn t mean they are not nationalists the fact that they support immigration because they think it is good for the country means they are nationalists who want want is best for their country stick to parodies re john you seem to have this penchant for defaming people john or for equivocating in a disturbing way you may think that most others are like you when they re not most people are patriotic but that doesn t mean most are nationalists and no the words are not interchangeable you don t know what either word means much less that there are many senses and definitions to both this is because you are a simple minded moron who sees the world in black and white good quote above there spb trump quote from link in article you know they have a word it sort of became old fashioned it s called a nationalist trump said at a campaign event in houston no surprise there trump is a nationalist he is also a socialist he s said he ll never cut social security and is strongly opposed to cutting back on federal ownership of huge slices of fed lands in the western usa wants to socialize border control and buying goods from ferriners and on and on der trumpfenfuhrer is a nationalist socialist heil trumpfenfuhrer heil trumpfenfuhrer at least lefties are finally admitting that nazis are socialists well some lefties may admit it a wee tad what pisses me off is the hollyweird ratio of movies and who is the bad guys for every movie portraying the commies as the bad guys there s 379 872 movies i counted them made with the nazis as the bad guys i admit that the nazis were bad guys no troubles there now let s start talking about commies and venezuela and so forth rocky iv makes up for quantity with quality i must break you the second part sounds like the democrats something that felt especially surreal when trump turned the crowd s attention to the scourge of the fake news media did they look at you square in the eye enb and start chanting lock her up lock her up they spent much more time slagging a cartoonishly radical caricature of o rourke than touting anything specific about cruz that s because they re scared some unreliable polls might have cruz ahead but i don t even live in texas and i can tell the enthusiasm for beto is real i see his lawn signs and bumper stickers everywhere libertariansforbeto libertariansforforgivingoldduis bluetsunami what state do you live in obl state of denial it ain t just a river state of delusion passportiswhiteprivilege white people shouldn t be allowed to have passports or travel https www youtube com watch v s1wtcnuck9m trump at 47 approval in the latest nbc wall street journal poll note that this is higher than block yomomma was in the same poll at the exact same point two weeks before his first midterm election a fact that no doubt is going to drive welchie boy gillespie dipshit dave weigel mary stack and all the rest of the tards completely insane trump is the opposite of obama people felt a lot of social pressure to approve of the first black president so a lot of people would tell pollsters they approved of obama even though they really didn t approve of his policies or performance in office they just liked him as a person because they felt they had to trump is the opposite in that people approve of his policies and actual performance but feel they must dislike him as a person after the fact many obama supporters describe obama in terms of a let down even larry sharpe describes being an obama supporter and being let down when hope and change never happened being libertarian means never having to be disappointed by a politician trump is easy to dislike as a person that s for sure i disagree having met people who have worked for him he seems to treat the people who work for him and especially those at the bottom of the pay scale very well trump is mean and nasty for sure but he seems to be so only towards people who can both fight back and deserve it i like the guy bucs you might make a better point if you described some of the ways that trump is easy to dislike don t get too confident my progressive friends are more motivated than ever now that drumpf has rushed through yet another dangerous right wing extremist supreme court justice we all know this is the most important midterm election of our lifetimes and we re committed to making sure democrats take not only the house but also the senate http amgreatness com 2018 10 ousewives democratic senate candidate krysten sinema appaearently hates housewives the list of people the left hates is pretty long when you think about it white males republicans people who join fraternities black conservatives housewives christians people who live in small towns people who drive inefficient cars people who don t recycle people who fly the american flag on their lawn heterosexuals people who don t believe in global warming people who think your genes determine you gender the list goes on and on but remember they are the tolerant ones they just hate everyone who doesn t think and act just like they do because they care so much list of people conservatives hate partial journalists writers scientists gays immigrants intellectuals the blacks mexicans ivy leaguers nfl players atheists rationalists environmentalists accountants secularists etc list of people lefties have enslaved partial black folks europe americans russians mexicans south americans venezuelans cubans chinese north koreans etc everyone hates journalists and the only people i know who hate scientists are the left when said scientists give them answers they don t like as for the rest of your list you are just projecting you are the most disgusting racist on here you hate blacks and mexicans and think they are inferior people to be ruled by retards like yourself and you love the gays so much you are going to invite millions of muslims in the country to kill them what s your npc mr classical liberal rationalist exactly i have a conservative brother in law and you would not believe the hateful bile he spews about accountants at every single family get together it s maddening i loled friggin awesome conservative businessmen hate accountants for their audits facts see worldcom ebbers enron skilling and team were big fans of dubya and dozens of others i can name from the bushpig era of course they ran public companies unlike the con man who runs a family business and does not have to deal with a true audit said the guy who didn t get the joke list of turd s posts which are not lies these women who act like staying at home leeching off their husbands or boyfriends and just cashing the checks is some sort of feminism because they re choosing to live that life instead they should leech off taxpayers or if they insist on working let their beta male boyfriend leech off them while he figures out how to make money from his degree in comics studies the 42 year old unmarried bisexual atheist lawyer with a ph d in justice studies it s a good thing she s unlikely to reproduce at this point the best part is that she went to byu i guess when mormons go off the rails they really go off the rails all the democrats had to do was find candidates who were not crazy and they couldn t even do that it used to be that they kept people like tony and buttplug locked in closets during election years only to let them out and quietly give them government jobs after the election was safely won now they not only let them out of the closet the lunatics have taken over the entire party sinema s another self loathing hicklib like kirkland she hates her skin color and blond hair hates her home state there s plenty of videos out there of her slagging arizona and hates her upbringing which means she ll probably win in a landslide considering mccain and flake were voted into office there there s plenty of videos out there of her slagging arizona then i don t like her nope thanks enb for venturing straight into crazy town and reporting on the trump volk rally if buttplug says you re good then you re a ok by me enb i just knew you musta been smart all along i knew you were a real libertarian trump talks illegals while promising impossible tax cuts at ted cruz rally what is impossible about trump s tax cuts trump is deciding to starve the beast rather than wait around for bi partisan balanced budgets which will never happen trump knows that americans love tax cuts it will be harder to raise taxes in the future and he can get congress to pass tax cuts re lovecons oh fuggedaboudit you re no lover of the constitution what is impossible about trump s tax cuts getting the votes to pass them being able to borrow the money from the same people he demonizes you know reality the very place trumpistas such as you are oblivious to trump is deciding to starve the beast the beast is social security medicare and the military none of which he s cutting which means you re either delusional or lying getting the votes to pass them being able to borrow the money from the same people he demonizes you know reality the very place trumpistas such as you are oblivious to shoter mexican all of your money belongs to the government and taking less of it is impossible but remember it is everyone else who is the collectivist not mexican re john all of your money belongs to the government and taking less of it is impossible aw how quaint a strawman it s been what two months since i ve seen one it s impossible for him because the process to obtain them is political do you think lowering taxes is impossible or don t you if you do then yes you believe taking less of people s money is impossible and if you think that you most certainly think all of their money belongs to the government otherwise letting them keep more of it wouldn t be so offensive to you and seen as an impossibility that is what you think you are just too stupid to understand the logical consiquences of what you are emoting the path to prosperity is paved with more taxez don t you know it re don t look at brain because it ain t there who is arguing for more taxes you buffoon what trumpistas don t get is that the president is not a wizard perhaps a grand wizard but not a real one nor is he thanos who can lower taxes at the snap of his fingers so you agree with the concept just not the method technically he could decide to use prosecutorial discretion and order the irs to ignore anybody s returns who are paying at least whatever percentage he wants to be the tax rate re john do you think lowering taxes is impossible or don t you it is not impossible to lower taxes per s what trump is promising lowering taxes at the snap of his fingers that s impossible so you think it is bad to advocate for lower taxes how do you know it is impossible he got the last tax cut through why not another why are you so angry that he is trying to do another one if you don t think lowering taxes is a bad thing you really don t seem to have any opinions beyond that you hate trump and the vast majority of the people who live in this country that you have decided to squat in the economy took off after a small tax cut it is likely that another tax cut might free up more capital for more economic expansion lefties cannot have that and you have yet to demonstrate why ypu just keep saying it and insistign that your fever dreams are reality maga sorry maga this is what bastiat had to say about starving the beast citizens in all times two political systems have been in existence and each may be maintained by good reasons according to one of them government ought to do much but then it ought to take much according to the other this two fold activity ought to be little felt we have to choose between these two systems but as regards the third system which partakes of both the others and which consists in exacting everything from government without giving it anything it is chimerical absurd childish contradictory and dangerous those who parade it for the sake of the pleasure of accusing all governments of weakness and thus exposing them to your attacks are only flattering and deceiving you while they are deceiving themselves looks like basiat was a dumbass after all true libertarians like lc understand that that third system is the best c mon sarcasmic we all know that bastiat was just a nevertrumper infected with tds or he was a proggie prog just virtue signaling either way we can t really take him seriously well yeah he obviously didn t vote for trump which means he had tds the fact that he d been dead for over a hundred and fifty years is no excuse this is what bastiat had to say who gives a shit pretty much every economist from the austrian school of economics you know those economists who libertarians used to listen to until trump came along now true libertarians don t give a shit what any economist says maga sarcasmic never explains how basiat is always right sarcasmic drops basiat s name with regard to trade restrictions yet basiat never addresses how to get trading partners to agree to free trade monsanto punitive damages slashed by judge verdict upheld the judge said jurors are entitled to accept the conclusion of johnson s expert witness who said roundup caused his cancer and reject the conclusions of monsanto s expert witnesses who concluded there s no proof the weed killer causes cancer https www cbsnews com news monsanto punitive damages slashed by judge verdict upheld judge idiot in the chron the article mentioned the lobbying effort aimed at the judge organized the an organization of scum bag ambulance chasers but they misspelled the name as jurors president trump called himself a nationalist only because he probably thought it wasn t a good idea to call himself a collectivist since the two terms are pretty much interchangeable promised impossible tax cuts 10 percent for the middle class before the november 6 election and cars for everyone you get one you get one too everybody gets one trump gave texas rally goers last night a rather mundane by now rendition of how isis illegals ms13 gang members liberal mobs congressional democrats and the media are working together to take america down the substantial crowd ate it up anyway because that is what trumpistas do eat trump s bullshit if you are not a nationalist and a collectivist why do you call yourself a mexican i guess collectivism is different when you do it re john if you are not a nationalist and a collectivist why do you call yourself a mexican because my passport says mexico in it why else would i call myself a mexican trump called himself a nationalist i didn t call myself one he did if your passport says mexican and you are so offended by all of the trumpistas why do you stay here you make it appearent every day how vastly superior you consider mexicans to be to the typical dumb america do you feel some kind of obligation to try and better your inferiors why would you not want to live in the paradise of the superior race known as mexico re john if your passport says mexican and you are so offended by all of the trumpistas why do you stay here who said i am offended there are not enough trumpistas out there to offend me what i find amusing is the way you are offended by my nick i find that hilarious and pitiful who said i am offended you every time you post and i m offended every time that you post because every time that you post it is empty headed insults and nothing more and then some people wonder why readers are abandoning these comments pages and going to sites like glibertarians it s because people like you reduce the iq level of these debates to about 1 4th of the level that they used to be at there we go john love america or leave it we all knew you would get there eventually yes jeff you hate a place and the people who live there it is fair to ask why you stay there mexican hates pretty much everything about this country he has never once written a positive thing about it on here that is his right there are a lot of places i don t like either guess what i don t live in those places la raza la casa con queso sorosistas vamos keep the posts coming enb you are a great writer yes people like you and think you have some value keep doing the amazing job you re doing and by golly never change libertariansforenb enbisliberty imwithenb bestwriteronreason the rightful president of the united states explains what s at stake as drumpf attempts to transform the supreme court a reality of a supreme court with a right wing majority is that the states are a new important front in protecting civil rights especially the rights of the most vulnerable among us the progressive libertarian alliance wants democrats in control of the federal government of course but don t forget to vote democrat in local races as well bluetsunami literally the first thing i encountered in the vicinity of the cruz trump rally was alex jones screaming at a pile of shit literally one of the things you encountered was alex jones figuratively screaming at various enemies as if they were pieces of shit it was obviously intended as comedy making like you didn t get the joke might be funny in a sarcastic way if alex jones weren t being all but blackballed by social media as if he were a communist in hollywood during the red scare re ken shultz literally one of the things you encountered was alex jones figuratively screaming at various enemies as if they were pieces of shit it was obviously intended as comedy what only if they re laughing with you not when they re laughing at you yeah mexican i am sure you get all of the jokes being angry and overly earnest about everything will do that john mocking anyone for not getting jokes is a helluva thing damn straight it is if anyone is qualified to opine on being overly earnest it is me 1 i watched the video and laughed my ass off crazy people are funny alex jones reportedly has a net worth of about 10 million you wish you could be like alex jones the reason you aren t is because you can t this is not a comment on alex jones per se but there are lots of uber rich shysters how do you rate george soros given how rich he is i don t care for soros tactics i think he s let his childhood experiences dictate his politics i can t judge people in his position for that but i don t approve of his actions before the wall came down i was a big fan i wish i had his trading acumen and i would love to have worked for him on wall street my brother used to work across the hall from quantum fund in new york i m more of a value investor by temperament which has done me well in commercial real estate when pricing was completely irrational circa 2007 i could and did still find discounted bargains by focusing on underlying value that means i m impressed by winning strategies i don t fully understand seeing hedge funds outperform the market year after year after year by way of high speed trading etc is more normal now but back when soros was focused on making money none of that existed he did it with his brains he did it with his character he was amazing i admire him for that always have i read his books p s i can t help but wonder if government regulation didn t make soros political activities worse in july 2011 to avoid having to register with the sec 4 and comply with reporting requirements under the dodd frank reform act the quantum fund announced they would be turning the fund into a family investment group and returning all outside money to investors by the end of 2011 5 the fund is now exclusively managing soros family money 6 http en wikipedia org wiki q p of funds if he still felt compelled to maximize his customers returns he s presumably be more focused on that freed from those concerns he s devoted himself to politics i helped manage an italian restaurant in san diego right out of high school the owner s wife would come down from santa barbara and run things on the weekend she was such a holy terror we were afraid the waitresses and the crew would all quit we called up the owner and explained the situation to him he told us in no uncertain terms that the restaurant was losing money the only reason he kept it open was to give his wife something to do on the weekends other than drive him up the wall quantum fund may have been like that italian restaurant only it was making money it s just that when soros doesn t have something else to do he spends his time and money driving the rest of us crazy interesting take ken i tend to agree that some uber rich people do meddle in affairs to mess with people jeez ken lighten the fuck up alex jones is rich who knew i m glad for him being financially secure is hard work and is something to be proud of i know i actually like alex jones i listen to his weekend radio show when i can and he s the only person who has really covered the whole johnny gosch jeff gannon story which is scary fucking shit but having followed alex for 10 years i know he can be a little screwy and if a guy screaming at a pile of shit on the ground makes me laugh it doesn t mean i really wish that i was him sometimes i still go out to will grier s place in calabasas https theatricum com he was blackballed along with a lot of other actors during the red scare they couldn t get any work so they started doing shakespeare and other things on grier s property mostly for each other and their families eventually they opened it up to the general public i despise communism still i d never take any delight in seeing grandpa walton reduced to putting on productions in his backyard because of what he believed and kicking him when he s down there isn t anything funny about that it s kinda worse these days too when the left is aiming to treat the rest of us like alex jones if they can we may all live to see the day when we can t get a job because of something we wrote on social media for instance back when we were pissed off about gamergate and there isn t anything funny about it tech companies are trying to set their own regulatory policy before congress gives them something worse the market cannot self regulate marxians in the media told me so on monday a federal judge lifted the stay he issued last month that had kept the nebraska state patrol from putting juveniles on its sex offender registry if they weren t tried as adults kids will have to go back to masturbating over the lingerie section of the old 1980 s sears catalog just to be on the safe side house of cards is back but without kevin spacey which is like roseanne without you know kamala harris new plan to give money to the middle class even has a lot of liberals skeptical yet the nationalist djt talks about cutting taxes and all of a sudden skeptics are tarred and feathered by trumpistas interesting how things turn around in this nutty world the u k is banning the phrase fake news in government documents better for it most government papers are fakes too i had a nearly front row view of the action something that felt especially surreal when trump turned the crowd s attention to the scourge of the fake news media the most ignored piece of information about the 2016 election by the news media is this little tidbit washington d c americans trust and confidence in the mass media to report the news fully accurately and fairly has dropped to its lowest level in gallup polling history with 32 saying they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media this is down eight percentage points from last year gallup september 14 2016 http news gallup com poll 19 w low aspx about two weeks before the election at a time when trump s approval ratings and hillary clinton s approval ratings were remarkably low the american voters opinion of the news media was even lower than it was of either candidate in crucial swing states those voters eventually broke for donald trump there are a number of interesting observations to take from this one of them is that the news media vastly overestimates its influence on the american voter they may imagine themselves the heirs of woodward and bernstein but hardly anyone else sees them that way alternatively the more the news media hates someone like trump the more it seems to make the american people like him in other words trump may not have won in spite of the negative coverage by the news media he may have won because of their negative coverage if the news media hasn t done anything since then to improve their coverage then i don t see a good reason to assume that dynamic isn t still in play with all the excellent negative coverage trump has been getting i d bet it s giving the republicans a bump in the turnout if not in the polls alternatively the more the news media hates someone like trump the more it seems to make the american people like him in other words trump may not have won in spite of the negative coverage by the news media he may have won because of their negative coverage that is a huge part of why he won ken in the same way voting for obama was a way for people to show their association with the elite and tolerant voting for trump is a way for people to tell the media and the establishment to fuck off the media and the political establishment loath large portions of the population trump won and will likely be re elected because he saw that and was and still is the only candidate who promises to represent them trump benefits enormously from the hatefulness and arrogance of the media and coastal elites hating the rest of the country and feeling superior to the rest of the country is a large part of their self image and identity so it is impossible for them to reach out and co opt trump s issues and appeal to his supporters the only message they have is one of condesension and telling them to start suppoting their side and be tolerant and intellectual relevant to the recent npc memes i can basically predict the majority of the comments section on any article based on the standard npc s that will be encountered john reason sucks it s the worst i hate reason so much but come back every day to read their articles and tell them how much of a shit job they do sevo cursing without any actual substance lc lefties are the reason for all the sads lefty anarchist democrat something something trump is the god king maga last of the shitlords purge all the progs rev half educated bigoted cant keep up yadda yadda hihn bots bold faced insanity maybe we should just paste this in the top of the comments section to get it out of the way at the start of each post everyone s viewpoints and opinions should shift with the days yesterday i totally agreed maybe we should just paste this in the top of the comments section to get it out of the way at the start of each post why to demonstrate that you have absolutely no clue what the npc meme is all about like your fellow npcs goddamit didn t close the tag ha i did close the tag it was already gilmored should read the whole thread before castigating myself i don t think he gets the joke well it s on him so maybe he s just salty about being made fun of which is why you re here just to make fun of other people some of us can think and offer thoughts to each other you know and some of resent those of us like you who do nothing other than pollute this place with 2nd grade level insults get thee thy putrid butt behind us satulpatanic satulpan aww that s cute they don t know what an npc is and thought it was something only pertaining to the retard libs to help you out briefly scripted thought and dialog while rev is clearly the best example the others have the same repetitive shtick in most of the comments sections look at just the past weeks articles or the ones around kavanaugh confirmation to see the above comments appear again and again like talking to the townspeople in an elder scrolls game fist makes pretty good jokes don t forget him bucs is one sexy mutherfucker dont forget him loveconstitution1789 exists ha good joke i find it revealing that jimbo did not include himself very hihn esque jimbo something something whiny bitching about trump military and entitlement spending alex jones standing in the street screaming at a pile of horse shit is such a perfect metaphor for american politics in the current era that it had to be scripted alex jones sstanding in the street screaming at a pile of horse shit is such a perfect metaphor for american politics in the current era that it had to be scripted ftfy well i can t really argue with any of your corrections here i don t think they like us very much pic twitter com ag68blrhon elizabeth nolan brown enbrown october 23 2018 they re talking about media that lies elizabeth not exaggerates not omits lies lies to the audience to further an agenda while lying about their impartiality is reason really so desperate to be a part of that us that was my first thought though i doubt it s so much reason s position more than it is enb s check out her twitter feed for her wokeness avocado toast pictures and it will all make more sense similarly listen to the reason podcast for some real insight into the reason s brand of libertarianism peter suderman will make you bang your head against the wall journo los all do god s work and are in constant danger so they must stick together above all else who else will tell us that alex jones and trump are big doo doo heads now she even hates tax cuts libertarians writing for libertarian mags hate tax cuts trump has totally mindfcvked the entire world this is one of the best parts about trump he does libertarian ish things and reason staff cannot praise him without some glib tds remark not that most reason staff are libertarians but i dont think gayjay could have ever pulled off so many libertarian ish trump policy decisions if he actually won and become president another day at reason making excuses for alex jones defending the concept of nationalism hating on undocumented migrants did i miss anything that you re wrong about all of that says the one who never says or offers anything other than grade school level insults if that s your takeaway then the real world must be a very frightening place for you its takes much effort for him to even visit reason patriotism love of country nationalism prioritizing the interests of the state above the interests of the individual justified by an appeal to patriotism i m a patriot i m not a nationalist that s the difference i seriously doubt any trumpers could grock that wow you used a big word like grock did you stay up all night thinking of that if he had he d realize there s no c in it and that he looks pretty stupid putting one there i hate that word with a passion not only it is an ugly sounding word it is also an unnessary one since it is a perfect synonym for understand there is no reason to use it other than to be a douche bag who feels the need to use unecessarily obscure words where common ones will do the people who use it think they are being clever when in fact that are showing a very poor understanding of the english language and when it is appropriate to use a word other than a common one sarcasmic is that kind of person he uses basiat to find purpose in everything i love watching you cry do you ever bother to even try to post thoughtful comments here are you even capable of composing such things or do you enjoy just pooping all over everything patriotism has come to mean the love of everything in the country except the people who live in it it is generally assocaited utterly undeserved sense of entitelment and condesension you are absolutely a patriot can t argue with you there nationalism is a word with many senses and meanings one of them is the old blood and soil nationalism of europe american nationalism has always been different and not connected to blood but only to a set of ideals and the space that is america somehow the idea that the governement owes a duty to its own citizens over and above the rest of the world has been slandered to mean blood and soil nationalism it is basically how stupid people like you declare anyone who disagrees with you a nationalist and their position morally illegitamate relieving you of the duty to think or make a rational point in defense of your position the left associates patriotism with ideas rather than people it s why they think stuff like the constitution or america itself appeared out of thin air and that the people who conceptualized it and the society in which it was created and evolved over time are irrelevant to those ideas of course they can t figure out why historically liberalistic ideas were created and developed in european cultures rather than third world ones but they re pretty certain africa would be a bastion of freedom if it wasn t for the former absolutely instead of the magic dirt theory where the dirt in a particular place makes it a nice place and not the people they believe in the magic power of words and ideas they think that if you just say something and have a document that says some ideal it will magically translate into reality and the people who make it translate into reality are incidental it is intellectualism in the absolute worst sense of the term yes we know rrwp real patriotism is recognizing the white supremacy of europeans isn t that right culture and values matter the color of your skin doens t matter but what you believe does places like afghanistan are not like the us because the people who live there are not like the people who live here you are a typical half witted libertarian who can t comprehend that most people in the world are not like you and have no interest in your values and moving them next door to you isn t going to change that if you don t think western civilization is superior to the rest of the world go live in the rest of the world and get back to us good luck with that which part of western civilization is the superior part would that be the marxism the fascism the communism how about the genocide on an industrial scale you sound like those proud boys idiots who run around proclaiming how much they defend western civilization when what they really mean is they defend the parts that they like and wave away the parts that they don t like and for the record there are many parts of western civilization that i like there are many parts that i don t like and it is frankly silly to be declaring entire civilizations to be superior to entire other civilizations when no one can even agree on proper metrics for such an assessment however much you disagree with islam and the muslim world it is also true that people in islamic countries tend to be far more pious than people in western countries wouldn t that be a good thing from your point of view the piety itself not necessarily the religion to which they devote themselves and it is frankly silly to be declaring entire civilizations to be superior to entire other civilizations when no one can even agree on proper metrics for such an assessment what a hilariously autistic statement to be fair white people are pretty awesome my white relatives are certainly less fucked up than my hispanic ones that s for sure patriotism has come to mean the love of everything in the country except the people who live in it it is generally assocaited utterly undeserved sense of entitelment and condesension you are absolutely a patriot can t argue with you there so you think patriotism is an undeserved sense of entitelment and condescension so is this the game where you redefine words in order to define me to be bad and define you to be good yes the term patriotism has been co opted by people like you and has come to mean exactly what i said it is you claim to love the country but loath nearly all of the people who live there and long to see them replaced with foreigners of superior stock and culture oh i see so this is the game instead where you put words into my mouth where have i ever said that i loath nearly all of the people who live here some i like some i don t like but i don t loath them just because they vote a different way in fact i am the one who sticks up for not questioning the patriotism of fellow citizens just because they vote a different way the people who loath a large chunk of their fellow citizens aren t people like me but people like team red team blue tribalists such as yourself patriotism means exactly what i said it means love of country it doesn t mean love of every single person in the country i ll freely admit that i don t love every single citizen but i do love this country and its ideals i know you do too john i am happy to admit that i think you are a patriot too and that both of us can be legitimate patriots while still having honest disagreements about what is best for the country can you make the same good faith admission sure you have never said it but the fact that you believe that is revealed in the policies you support if you didn t loath the people who lived here you would be concerned about the harms done to people by mass immigation or at least admit it is a legitimate concern you don t because you could not care less what happens to the people who already live here they are just eggs for your wonderul utopian omelet of a borderless world you will happily allow other people to suffer for your principles if you didn t loath the people who lived here you would be concerned about the harms done to people by mass immigation or at least admit it is a legitimate concern i have never said it is an illegitimate concern and i reject the framing of your argument you seem to be arguing that if a person doesn t agree with the mob then that person must hate the mob that is a false choice i disagree with the popular view on immigration but it doesn t mean i hate those who disagree with me i think they are largely mistaken in their views you attribute malice where none exists you don t because you could not care less what happens to the people who already live here they are just eggs for your wonderul utopian omelet of a borderless world i think this country will be a better place when everyone s properly understood rights are more fully respected and defended by the state and i can make logical arguments to support my position and it is rich seeing you making the appeal to emotion when it comes to the mob you just don t care enough about the common folk you will happily allow other people to suffer for your principles as do you as does everyone who makes a deontological argument in favor of some abstract moral principle both you and i support the right to keep and bear arms and we do so on a deontological basis full well knowing that the more widespread gun ownership is the more likely it is that innocent people will be shot these are harms that both you and i have accepted as a result of our principles based position on self defense so don t you dare lecture me about how i am the bad guy for allowing people to suffer defense of liberty means that individuals will of course suffer when that liberty is abused and misused neither you nor i want to live in a state of perfect security in which no one has liberty so stop it with your dishonest appeals to emotion and long to see them replaced with foreigners of superior stock and culture and good heavens john i have never ever said that i favor free migration of people because i think the migrants as a whole are intrinsically superior to native born residents in some way you need to go burn your strawman arguments somewhere else when i call myself a patriot it s about being an enthusiastic defender of the constitution and its principles having read chemical jeff s shit i don t consider him a patriot no one else would either yes we know ken not voting for republicans means hatred of america i dont consider chemjeff a patriot wow we get to make up our own definitions now how newspeaky in regards to the news media i find pretty much all of it revolting i ve looked at everything as far left as the the young turks tyt through the middle mass market stuff to as far right as one america news oan and i find pretty much all of it lacking in various ways the stuff on the right gets caught up in minutia that i find tedious if it isn t on a topic they ve already rehashed for weeks you might not hear about it at all on stage right that s less annoying than stage left the stuff i see from the left is annoying because for all practical purposes it s intended to mislead the people who are watching that news want their news slanted in a way that not only confirms their biases but that also propagandizes their imagined enemies this is what a lot of the political correctness is about they want to project a worldview in which certain ideas are socially unacceptable and that s presumably what their viewers want too the news media isn t really a market failure it s just that the profits the owners are trying to maximize aren t necessarily in dollars and cents when buffet bought into the washington post parleyed capcities abc into disney etc the goal wasn t only profits as evidenced by his protege gates buying into cable news with msnbc etc in the aftermath of the antitrust case against him it was also a defensive play there is a huge benefit to having anyone who might want to work for you someday being reluctant to criticize you in public especially when you re among the wealthiest people in the world the ted turners and murdochs of the world aren t just about maximizing cash flow either some of it s about getting the same kind of benefit penitents get for crawling on their knees on a pilgrimage they re willing to sacrifice because they want influence they could make more money if they were doing things differently p s i m digging the reuters app on my smart tv it asks you how much time you want to spend watching and serves you up a summary of original news stories based on that you re such a douche who had the over under that tony the douche would show up at 12 44pm i don t think they like us very much are you fake news house of cards is back but without kevin spacey then house of cards is not back i agree roseanne isn t back either the idea that you could make her show without her is amazingly stupid it is so hard to get a hit show in this day and age but when you get one the revenues are enormous actors on hit tv shows make millions an episode because the revenues generated by such a thing are so enormous abc finally had one and they threw it away to appease a idiot twitter mob and media mob that didn t even watch the show in the first place when you consider the amount of revenues lost because of that decision it is a complete breach of faith towards the shareholders it is the equivelent of the ceo of shipping company sinking a brand new container ship to make it an artifical reef so the greens like him 1 and now i see i riffed old mexican above oops i ignore oml so he gets extra upset every day all these italics are giving me bedspins keep protesting and she will lock tomorrow s roundup in bold why did enb put the word illegals in quotes it s an empirical fact that there are indeed a lot of illegals in the united states whether she wants to acknowledge that status as such
