The official fundraising results are in for June. Team Obama: $71 million. Team Romney $106 million.

President Barack Obama's re-election campaign and its Democratic partners raised some $71 million in June, a campaign official said on Monday.

The figures put Obama, the Democratic incumbent, well below his opponent, Republican Mitt Romney, whose campaign and partners raised $106.1 million in the same month.

Team Obama is saying "we could lose if this continues," in a new fundraising email subject line. 

Well, I've got some good news and some bad news.

Good news first: June was our best fundraising month yet. We exceeded expectations -- more than 706,000 people stepped up and pitched in for a grand total of $71 million raised for this campaign and the Democratic Party.

Bad news? We still got beat. Handily. Romney and the RNC pulled in a whopping $106 million.

So, to recap: We had our best fundraising month yet, and we still fell about $35 million short. We can win while being outspent -- but we need to keep it close.

You know what that means. We've got some work to do.

Pitch in $3 or more right now to start closing the gap.

This is no joke. If we can't keep the money race close, it becomes that much harder to win in November.

But this election isn't about how much money our campaigns can raise -- none of us would be fighting this hard just to win a money war. We're here because we believe in something bigger -- because none of us wants to see this country go back to the policies that drove our economy into a ditch, which is exactly what the other side wants to do.
