relations between the u s and russia and what to expect from that helsinki summit with john bolton president trump aposs national security advisor in his first interview since returning from moscow then trump we have to pick a great one we have to pick one that aposs going to be there for 40 years 45 years wallace who will president trump pick to replace justice anthony kennedy leonard leo trump adviser on judicial nomination if the president dominates someone extraordinary like neil gorsuch again i think it aposs very hard to stop that kind of a nomination wallace we aposll handicap possible nominees with leonard leo who will play a key role in president aposs choice and how will democrats try to block senate confirmation we aposll ask dick durbin the senate aposs number two democrat who wants to delay a vote until after the midterm plus trump journalists like all americans should be free from the fear of being violently attacked while doing their job wallace critics of president trump link his attacks on press to shooting deaths of five people at a newspaper in maryland we aposll ask our sunday panel about both sides playing a disturbing blame game all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington as america settles in for fourth of july holiday president trump has set an ambitious agenda for this week he aposs finalizing his supreme court pick to be announced in just eight days and preparing for a trip to europe including a summit with russian president vladimir putin in a moment we aposll talk with national security advisor john bolton who is just back from moscow but first let aposs bring in correspondent kevin corke at the white house with the latest on the president aposs plans kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris for a president that has been has been well let aposs just say strikingly unconventional this idea of following an orderly structured playbook to nominate and ultimately seat a second supreme court justice is frankly not trumpian but given the gop aposs razor thin margin in the senate prudence in this case is presidential begin videotape corke president trump is said to be narrowing his focus on five potential nominees for the supreme court vacancy created by the retirement of justice anthony kennedy trump he has displayed tremendous vision and tremendous heart and he will be missed and hopefully we aposre going to pick somebody who will be as outstanding corke white house counsel don mcgahn and leonard leo are said to be spearheading the search drawing from a list of more than two dozen reliably conservative jurists the confirmation battle on capitol hill is expected to be fierce democrats contend that since majority leader mitch mcconnell stole the nomination of merrick garland in 2016 turnabout is fair play sen kirsten gillibrand d n y he said we will not allow a supreme court justice during an election year but what aposs good for the goose is good for the gander we should not allow justice in an election year sen dianne feinstein d calif it was a low standard if you will but it was a standard and i for one and i think others haven apost forgotten that and you know as you sow so you reap corke while the high court battle looms in washington overseas a number of major stories are developing with reports that north korea is concealing key aspects of its nuclear program renewed questions about u s troop levels in germany the fast approaching nato summit and talks of a highly anticipated one on one between president trump and russian president vladimir putin end videotape corke with ukraine crimea and syria among the many topics to be broached when the leaders meet in helsinki july 16th chris wallace kevin corke reporting for the white house kevin thanks for that joining me now the president aposs national security advisor john bolton in his first interview since meeting with russian president vladimir putin this week in moscow ambassador bolton welcome back to fox news sunday john bolton national security advisor glad to be with you wallace what does president trump want from his summit with putin is it beyond just improving the dialogue and general relations does he realistically hope for any breakthroughs on ukraine or syria or arms control bolton well i think the first point is that it aposs very important to have this bilateral meeting not on the margins of a larger meeting like the g20 as he aposs been able to do before but to have a conversation with vladimir putin that covers the full range of issues i expect it will be somewhat unstructured certainly in their one on one meeting but it will give them a chance to go over some of these issues free of the pressure of a media deadlines or crises and i think in establishing that line of communication the president has very much in mind he wants to understand the russian position and perhaps more importantly he wants vladimir putin to understand our positions now if breakthroughs come from that that will be great but frankly having this meeting roughly a year and a half into the administration is a key fact wallace after the singapore summit here aposs what president trump told our colleague bret baier about what he thought might be able to happen if he could sit down with vladimir putin begin video clip trump i could say would you do me a favor would you get out of syria would you do me a favor would you get out of ukraine end video clip wallace does president trump really think it aposs going to be that easy to sway vladimir putin would you do me a favor bolton now i think what he aposs saying is look if we can have a direct conversation between the two leaders especially given the russian system where putin essentially calls the shots we can find out where russia aposs main points of what its main objectives are and what we need to achieve but without this kind of discussion which has been precluded for sometime by the political noise over the allegations of collusion with the campaign we haven apost been able to do that so that aposs why having the meeting and getting started is in and of itself so important wallace some european leaders have come out this week and said that they are worried that we aposre going to see a repeat of what happened with the g7 summit in canada and in the president aposs trip to singapore that he will meet with our nato allies in europe and be very critical of them and then he will go to helsinki and meet with president putin and be some and lavish praise on him in canada the president reportedly said that nato is as bad as nafta bolton well look i was there in canada i didn apost hear that remark i aposm not aware that he said it i think there are a lot of stories that grow with the telling but let aposs be clear the nato summit is an important meeting i think the president has made clear to all european leaders he aposs met with that nato is an important alliance for the united states our most important he just has a very precise idea that the nato allies should live up to the commitment that they themselves made to send 2 percent of their budget on 2 percent of their gross national product on defense spending wallace but i think the point is that he seemed to be tougher on our allies at the g7 than he was on an adversary like kim and the concern among european leaders is that if he does that same thing and is critical of nato and then goes and praises putin that it weakens nato vis a vis russia bolton yes well i don apost read the way he conducted these meetings the same way and i don apost think anybody ought to have a case of the vapors over the discussions we have in nato or the g7 versus discussions with putin and kim jong un they are very very different the president treats them differently he understands what the strategic interests are and that aposs what he aposs trying to pursue wallace but let aposs look at some of the statements that president trump has made with regard to russia recently and i want to put them up on the screen he said that russia should be invited back into the g7 in canada he reportedly told the other leaders crimea which putin of course seized is russian because everybody who lives there speaks russian this week he tweeted russia continues to say they have nothing to do with meddling in our election and the pentagon is reportedly studying pulling troops out of germany so the question is is the president making concessions to putin before the two men even sit down bolton no i don apost think that aposs the case and that long list of things you just read it aposs really an interesting catalog some things are true some things are not true some things are partially true i don apost think we have enough time for me to go through and parse each and every one of them i think though it goes back to the main rationale to have a bilateral meeting between president trump and president putin let them discuss these issues and see exactly where there might be room for progress or where we find there is no room at all in my meeting with president putin he was very kind to go through the whole list of items on his agenda i think there were some where it was clear our position was very very far apart there were others where perhaps there is room for some kind of progress we aposll just have to see but given the nature of the russian system in particular i don apost think we aposre going to find out until the two leaders get together wallace well you say some of the things that we listed these were all obviously reported some of them were clearly true he did invite bolton lots of things were reported that don apost even come close to wallace i mean he himself said that he would like to see russia back in the g7 bolton that aposs the one that almost unambiguously true right wallace well and the tweet is unambiguously true did he say at the g7 that crimea is russian because everybody there speaks russian and the reason i ask that because between that and inviting russia back into the g7 there aposs this argument that aposs been made that he doesn apost he doesn apost want to punish russia for its bad behavior invading and seizing crimea bolton right i didn apost hear him say that either and i didn apost see it in the notes you know a lot of these things come out of these meetings it did end with some disagreements with the other members so a lot of this i think is potentially exaggerated i think the key point is that where there are areas of disagreement certainly with our closest allies but also with our adversaries the president aposs view is he wants to sit down and talk about them wallace all right i want to ask about one other specific thing on that list which is that you have been very clear about russian meddling in 2016 last year you called it an act of war and after putin denied meddling to president trump at an economic conference you said this begin video clip bolton everybody who has looked at the classified information says there aposs no doubt the russians tried to affect the election vladimir putin looked donald trump directly in the eye and lied to him and i think that aposs the single most important takeaway coming out of this meeting end video clip wallace is president trump you aposll love it when i play these old clips bolton i love watching myself absolutely laughter wallace is president trump as clear as you are that forget the issue of collusion that russia meddled in the 2016 election and if so why would he retweet their denial this week at the same time attacking the fbi bolton yes i think the president has already said that he aposs going to raise the question of russian meddling again with vladimir putin he said it this past week wallace does he believe it happen bolton and what well i aposll tell you what president putin said to me through the translator of course but he said there was no meddling in the 2016 election by the russian state so i think it still raises the question i think the president will want to have a conversation about this and say we don apost want to see meddling in the 2018 election crosstalk wallace so are you suggesting that maybe do you have doubts that the kremlin was involved bolton look i think the intelligence is what i said it was before i haven apost changed my mind on that and i think it aposs something that we aposre concerned about that aposs why the president is going to speak with him about it again wallace all right we haven apost had a chance to talk since singapore and i aposd like to ask you briefly about the north korean summit after the summit president trump said that north korea is no longer a nuclear threat to the u s but as you well know there are new reports this weekend that u s intelligence has concluded that kim is trying to conceal the full range of his arsenal and in fact has no intention of giving it all up have you seen those intelligence reports do you believe them and is kim playing us bolton well look i aposm not going to comment on any reports true untrue partially true about intelligence there aposs a good reasons why leaking intelligence is a criminal offense in this country it harms the united states when it happens it gives away a lot of information to our adversaries i aposll just say this not answering the specific reports we aposve seen over the weekend but i will say this we are using the full range of our capabilities to understand what north korea is doing it doesn apost profit the possibility of eliminating north korea aposs nuclear weapons to talk on a day to day basis they are doing this they are not doing this they are doing the other thing there aposs nobody involved in this discussion with north korea in the administration who is overburdened by naivety we aposve seen how the north koreans have behaved before the president has been very clear he aposs not going to make the mistakes of prior administrations we aposre going to pursue this and we aposll see what happens that aposs i think what the next step in the discussions will be wallace i want to get two final questions and in the time we have left back when you worked for bush 43 you called kim aposs father a tyrannical dictator and north korea a hellish nightmare and they responded in kind one of my favorite lines of all time they called you a human scam and a bloodsucker you called it a badge of honor here we can see you sitting at the same table with kim in singapore was there and i know you met with him you shook hands with him he was there recognition of the fact that you and pyongyang have history bolton you know they also called me a very ugly fellow which wallace well i can deny that that aposs fake news bolton but at one point in our lunch kim jong un said to me you know the two of us have to get a picture together i want to take it home and show my hardliners you aposre not such a bad guy wallace and did you how did you feel about him saying that bolton wonderful laughter wallace well it was good for the meeting finally mexico is voting for president today and it appears very likely almost certain that this man andres manuel lopez obrador the leftist candidate will win he said recently mexico will not do the united states apos dirty work stopping central american migrants heading north and he will defend the rights of all migrants who need to leave their towns to go and make their life in the u s is amlo as he aposs called is amlo going to be trouble for the trump administration bolton well honestly i think people may be surprised on this and i think president trump will follow through with the same pattern he aposs used with other foreign leaders they look forward to meeting with him sitting down and talking about these things we have a relatively long transition period between the election and the inauguration of the new mexican president wallace but are you concerned by some of these statements bolton i think we aposre going to get some things done during the transition statement and i think in this kind of context having the two leaders get together may produce some surprising results wallace ambassador bolton thank you always good to talk with you please come back sir bolton will do thank you wallace up next president trump aposs supreme court nominee faces a tough confirmation battle in the senate where republicans can apost afford to give up a single vote we aposll discuss the contenders and the stakes next with trump judicial advisor leonard leo and democratic senator dick durbin commercial break wallace president trump has the opportunity to reshape the supreme court for a generation by nominating a solid conservative to replace the court aposs key swing vote justice anthony kennedy who announced his retirement this week joining me here in washington leonard leo a key advisor to president trump who helped draw up that list of 25 from which the president says he will choose his nominee mr leo democrats are making roe v wade women aposs right to abortion the central issue in this campaign and this confirmation battle you call that a scare tactic the democrats have used for more than 30 years but i want to play an exchange that i had with candidate trump in the third presidential debate here it is begin video clip wallace you just said you want to see the court protect the second amendment do you want to see the court overturn roe v wade trump well if we put another two or perhaps three justices on that aposs really what aposs going to be that will happen and that will happen automatically in my opinion because i am putting pro life justices on the court end video clip wallace given that isn apost roe v wade on the line with this nomination leonard leo trump adviser on judicial nomination chris the fact of the matter is that roe v wade is a very major precedent in america and for 36 years people have been talking about it being overturned it was an issue with sandra o aposconnor david souter anthony kennedy all of whom people would set would overturn roe v wade no president is particularly good at speculating about these things and nobody is and so i don apost think at the end of the day it aposs about roe v wade it aposs about having judges on the court who are going to interpret the constitution the way it aposs written and part of interpreting the constitution is taking into account major precedents and that aposs going to happen wallace but as you well know sometimes justices adhere to presidents and sometimes they overturn them leo absolutely but major precedents of the court require a lot of attention and respect and scrutiny and we aposve seen that there aposs only one justice out of nine over a period of 36 years who is saying that he would explicitly overturn roe wallace and that aposs clarence thomas leo that aposs correct wallace but this does figure into the confirmation battle because given the republican majority in the senate and the fact that there is no longer a filibuster one of the few ways that a trump nominee could fail to be confirmed is if you get one of the two and here they are on the screen if you lose one of the two republican senators susan collins or lisa murkowski were both pro choice is it fair to say that the president won apost pick someone who has a record of opposition to roe v wade leo i think senator collins made the point very clearly she wants someone who aposs going to adhere to the constitution and the law more than anything else so what you really want chris is wallace but she also said roe is a firm precedent and settled law if you have somebody who has a record of having said for instance william pryor that it was an abomination roe v wade that aposs clearly going to set off alarm bells would it be fair to say that the president is not going to pick somebody who has a clear record of opposition to roe v wade leo none of the people who are being talked about now in the public space in the media are people who have a clear position on roe v wade the most important thing here is a record showing fairness someone who listens very carefully to arguments on both sides someone who tries to keep an open mind and prospective nominees like brett kavanaugh and amy barrett and raymond kethledge and tom hardiman are people who have not specifically said they oppose roe v wade and their writings and their work show that they are very fair they look at arguments from both sides all the time and they analyze them very carefully and when they take a position they then say these are what the other people have said about this and here aposs why i don apost agree with them and that aposs really at the end of the day what we want we want that kind of fairness in a judge and i think senator collins and senator murkowski and others who went through the gorsuch process saw that in neil gorsuch and i think that aposs what they aposre going to be looking for again wallace you just mentioned four names is it fair to say that those are the four frontrunners at this point leo no i don apost think it aposs fair to say that and here aposs why the president is really in the driver aposs seat on this along with the assistance of white house counsel don mcgahn those are certainly people who are under very serious consideration two of them as you know chris are people who were through the process to some extent before and brett kavanaugh wallace hardiman and kethledge leo yes that aposs right hardiman and kethledge and then brett kavanaugh is one of the most distinguished jurists in america so it aposs not a natural that he is being mentioned he has over 300 opinions he is respected by both sides on the political and ideological spectrum and amy barrett similarly is one of the most talented and distinguished women in the legal academy anywhere in the country former law clerk to justice scalia someone who again people across the ideological and political spectrum greatly admire wallace i want to ask you specifically about circuit court judge brett kavanaugh who as you point out is one of the front runners he has written that the president not this president any president should be exempt from quote time consuming and distracting lawsuits and investigations which would ill serve the public interest especially in times of financial or national security crisis given the fact that president trump is now facing lawsuits given the fact that he is now dealing with a special counsel wouldn apost be any kind of a conflict if he were to pick somebody like brett kavanaugh who is on record was saying that he is opposed to that that aposs an issue the court might have to deal with leo well first of all you have to remember that when brett kavanaugh said that it was when we hadn apost independent counsel statute if i remember correctly and there were a lot of problems with the independent counsel statute in terms of having zero accountability zero transparency and so there were constitutional issues there and even liberal law professors like akhil amar from yale law school have said that it aposs a very reasonable position that brett kavanaugh took when he wrote about that some years back so it aposs not clear to me what he said then necessarily applies to now secondly what you are really seeing and what kavanaugh said is that the core of what he believes in which is this idea that if you really want to protect freedom and you want to have accountability you have to respect the limits on government power in the constitution which includes the separation of powers wallace i got less than a minute left what are the stakes here how will replacing anthony kennedy who was a distinguished jurist but with a more conservative a consistent conservative how will that reshape the court potentially for the next generation leo well any supreme court confirmation is transformative this is a court that is often equally divided at the end of the day i think what aposs really important to remember is that there aposs been a movement on the court towards being more originalist and textualist in other words the idea that law means something it has determinate meaning and that aposs the trend that i think this president wants to continue wallace mr leo thank you thanks for coming on and we will be watching the president aposs announcement in just eight days are you a little worried about eight days are you ready to go in eight days leo i think the president and his team at the white house will be ready wallace good that aposs fortunate because if we go on the air and he aposs not there it would be in it would be embarrassing leo it would be rather embarrassing laughter wallace joining me now from springfield illinois the number two democrat in the senate dick durbin senator welcome let aposs start with the democrats apos basic positions since justice kennedy announced his retirement this week here is your leader in the senate senator chuck schumer begin video cilp sen chuck schumer d n y senate minority leader americans should make it clear that they will not tolerate a nominee chosen from president trump aposs preordained list end video clip wallace now senator donald trump told the voters that he was going to pick his nominees from that list there was a big issue in the campaign donald trump won isn apost he entitled just like barack obama was entitled to have a legitimately qualified nominee approved by the senate sen dick durbin d ill senate minority whip of course he is every president would be but you just had a man on your show mr leo who has an extraordinary position he is involved not only in the selection process he is key to it when the white house chose neil gorsuch they didn apost call mr gorsuch judge gorsuch to tell him they called mr leo and they said would you like to call judge gorsuch and tell him the good news that he aposs going to be the president aposs nominee that aposs what aposs going on here the federalist society is going through a clearance process make no mistake they make sure before any name really reaches the finals they know exactly what crosstalk wallace i don apost know about that as a fact but let me just ask you so what i mean the fact is the federalist society has vetted these people they are all distinguished jurists they are obviously conservative which you don apost like but how can you say anybody who is on that list is out durbin i didn apost say that wallace well chuck schumer says that durbin what i will say is this i think well i can tell you this i think the chris wallace second debate if that aposs what it was question to then candidate donald trump nailed it the president is looking for someone who will overturn roe versus wade but even equally important he aposs looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the affordable care act aposs protection of those with pre existing conditions is unconstitutional that will mean thousands if not millions of americans will lose their health insurance because of this decision on who will fill the kennedy vacancy on the court that hits home for most americans we may be divided and we certainly are on the issue of abortion but when it comes to basic health care for american families protecting those who have pre existing conditions this administration is attacking that on constitutional grounds and at this moment donald trump is looking for a justice who aposs going to rule in his favor wallace leonard leo says the democratic party is using roe v wade as a scare tactic i just asked him about it to try to defeat the president aposs nominee i want to play a clip from one of your senate colleagues kirsten gillibrand this week here she is begin video clip gillibrand this is a line that aposs been drawn about whether we are going to criminalize women whether we are going to be arresting women for making decisions about their bodies this is not a fire drill end video clip wallace senator no one is talking about arresting women isn apost that the definition of a scare tactic what kirsten gillibrand was saying there durbin what kirsten is saying goes back to your question chris to candidate donald trump you talked about second amendment you came back to him and said well what about roe versus wade he was quick to add that aposs what i want to do and he said just yesterday the day before crosstalk wallace i understand but even if roe versus durbin this is a justice on the court for 40 years wallace but sir even if roe versus wade would overturn nobody is suggesting that women would be arrested and in addition to which it would be as he pointed out as president trump or candidate trump pointed out it would go back to the states i aposm not saying it aposs not a big deal but nobody is suggesting that women would be arrested if roe versus wade were overturned durbin the basic issue at hand here is whether or not a woman has the power to make decisions the freedom to make decisions regarding her own body and her own life that is the fundamental issue here and when you start denying that to women across america those are fighting words because these women believe that they have to make this decision they have the right to make this decision those on the other side disagree it gets down to that fundamental principle wallace to have any chance to win you not only are going to have to pick off at least one of the republican senators and we talked about the two republican pro choice women senators collins and murkowski you aposre also going to have to keep all 49 of your democrats on board and the fact is during the gorsuch nomination president trump aposs nomination of neil gorsuch last year three red state democrats up for re election heitkamp donnelly and manchin all voted for gorsuch how as the senate whip the person in charge of counting votes how certain are you that all three of those democrats will stay on board this time and vote against whoever the president nominates durbin well of course we don apost have a nominee aposs name to start with and that aposs a critical point and the second thing i would say is this each and every one of my colleagues on the democratic side understand the historic significance of this decision as the president said this is a justice who aposs likely to serve for 40 years is going to have dramatic impact on health care in america on the rights of privacy in america and i will say for each of my colleagues they have to make an individual important principled decision and the question as we found with affordable care will the president pick someone who is so far out of the mainstream in the case of affordable care three republicans broke with the president if only one or two you understand the dynamics wallace right durbin and the math of the senate at this moment with senator mccain if one or two republican senators believe this choice is out of the mainstream then we could have a very serious issue before us on confirmation wallace i have a less than a minute left and i have one final question democrats would be able to block this nomination if you still have the filibuster back in 2013 when the democrats were in the majority the leader harry reid decided to change the rules of the house and democrats supported him to end the filibuster make it a simple majority for all cabinet appointments and for all lower court appointments and then last year with the gorsuch nomination mcconnell senator mcconnell extended that to the supreme court looking back because you guys opened the door to it was that a mistake durbin i can tell you harry reid faced a dilemma changing the senate precedent and rules and he did not change it for the supreme court i aposm glad you put that into your preface but at that point mitch mcconnell senator mcconnell had been using the filibuster in ways never imagined in the senate to stop any judicial nominees from moving forward on important courts like the d c court of appeals which was a hard decision but harry reid made an exception to the supreme court wallace but but but you guys used it i mean there aposs no original sin here senator both sides used it i aposm what i aposm just asking is this looking back at it and looking at the fruit of it now the fact that you cannot stop this nominee on your own the democrats can apost do you have second thoughts about having changed the rules back in 2013 durbin well you aposre assuming again chris that harry reid did not recognize this possibility he did and he said it took it would take 60 votes for the supreme court it was mitch mcconnell who changed that rule that fundamental rule on the supreme court wallace senator durbin thank you thanks for joining us always good to talk with you sir and please come back durbin thanks chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss whether the senate should wait until after the midterm election to vote on president trump aposs nominee plus what would you like to ask the panel about how the president aposs pick could sway the balance of the supreme court just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up a primary upset shakes democrats as the possible heir to nancy pelosi loses to a democratic socialist begin video clip sen mitch mcconnell r ky the energy in the democratic party is self avowed ph socialist rep nancy pelosi d calif they made a choice in one district but let aposs not get yourself carried away end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel how far left the party is moving commercial break begin video clip trump so we have a pick to come up we have to pick a great one we have to pick one that aposs going to be there for 40 years 45 years end video clip wallace president trump signaling he wants a replacement for justice kennedy who can serve on the supreme court for decades cementing a conservative majority and it aposs time now for our sunday group jason riley from the wall street journal mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service anne gearan of the washington post and josh holmes mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff and now a gop strategist josh when bush 43 was president you led the team at the rnc to help get john roberts and sam alito confirmed to the court given as we aposve explored the fact that the filibuster is no longer in existence is there any way that trump aposs nominees will fail to get confirmed by the senate josh holmes founder cavalry well i think the question itself chris gives us a pretty good indication of how far we aposve come in this battle right how do we kill a nominee when we don apost even know who the nominee is yet i mean i think president trump could probably nominate lady justice herself and i think democrats would say that she aposs in there to try to overturn roe v wade the bottom line is right the filibuster is gone but there aposs a very razor thin majority here we aposre dealing with a one seat difference they obviously have a tactic here to attack senator susan collins and lisa murkowski but what they aposre ignoring his red state democrats here with joe manchin you aposve got donnelly in indiana heidi heitkamp in north dakota wallace all three of them voted for gorsuch holmes they did and that aposs not even the extent of it you have you have jon tester in montana and you aposve got claire mccaskill and missouri all of these red states that president trump carried and probably have a population that identifies much more with his view of what should what the court should look like and so i think democrats are in a rough spot here wallace democrats one of the other arguments they make is they say the confirmation should be put off until after the midterm election in november noting what mitch mcconnell did holding up president obama aposs appointment of merrick garland in 2016 to the supreme court but mcconnell always talked about presidential election years not midterm election years take a look at what mcconnell said on this show back in 2016 begin video clip mcconnell we think the important principle in the middle of this presidential election which is raging is that the american people need to weigh in and decide who aposs going to make this decision not this lame duck president on the way out the door but the next president next year end video clip wallace and in fact three members of the current court alito breyer and kagan were all confirmed in midterm election years anne does that democratic talking point the idea it aposs an election you can apost wait until the senate is changed by the voters in november does that taking point go anywhere anne gearan the washington post well i think that democrats are already backing away from it which is an indication that it that it isn apost perhaps their strongest argument i mean the the chief difference between an election year a presidential election year and a midterm election year is the main problem there it the the stronger suit the democrats appear to be going heading to play is is the abortion question rather in other words fight this nomination on issues rather than on on tactics and timing wallace abortion and it aposs interesting to say there aposre also really pushing health care and saying look it was only a 5 4 gearan yes wallace although it wasn apost kennedy who voted to save health care it was roberts but the idea that health care could be and pre existing condition protection could be in jeopardy gearan yes social issues kitchen table issues things that affect americans lives those are the talking points i expect to her democrats use wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of how the replacement for kennedy could sway the balance of the court rena b tweeted this do you think roe v wade would be overturned jason how do you answer rena do you think if you get a conservative solid conservative justice on the court that roe v wade will be gone jason riley the wall street journal it aposs possible that roe v wade could be gone with another with a fifth vote for that side but at the same time what that would mean is that the issue would go back to states and the consensus thinking there is that there aren apost very many of any states that would criminalize abortion we go back to what was going on pre roe when states were already legalizing the procedure states like new york in fact had already legalized abortion so go back to the states so i don apost think in that sense that the pro choice crowd has much to worry about pragmatically wallace as a member of the pro choice crowd mo do you agree with that mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public service no i think it aposs a concern i think i think it is rightfully a concern and and you aposve got a president out there who says that he would nominate a justice who would overturn roe v wade look i get the people trying to dismiss this as saying yes but you know it just goes back to the states and the states aren apost likely to do it the what roe v wade did was guarantee that no woman would be treated differently across america on this issue and so i think for a lot of people it is a legitimate concern i think it is the smarter tactic for democrats to take i i think wallace issue not process elleithee right i mean this isn apost about process at the end of the day it is about the direction of the court it is about the individuals democrats have an opportunity to push these issues incredibly hard during the confirmation hearings i aposm glad that this whoever the nominee will be will actually get a hearing which was not afforded to president obama aposs final nominee was not afforded to merrick garland there will be a hearing held here and and they aposll be able to push these issues and that could help democrats electorally but as most of the country even in red states is not opposed supports maintaining roe v wade wallace all right i in the little bit of time we have left i want to talk about the man who set all of this in motion justice anthony kennedy who spent 30 years on the court he has announced now he aposs going to retire which is why we aposre talking about a replacement and he was known as the famous swing vote on the court a term he didn apost like take a look begin video clip anthony kennedy supreme court justice you aposre very gracious not to use the term swing vote i hate that term it has this visual image of the spatial gyration the cases swing i don apost end video clip wallace and if kennedy is replaced by a consistent more consistent conservative though isn apost there a danger that some of those 5 4 rulings he had where he he sided with the liberals on the court whether it was on protecting abortion on rights for same sex couples that a lot of that could be undone gearan absolutely i mean he he dislikes the term but but what it refers to is as has been the case for for ten years it used to be he and o aposconnor where they decided to place their conservative leaning but not consistent votes would usually determine the outcome of a case we aposre going to go from a 5 4 court to a 6 3 court and that will have huge consequences riley i think the real replacement for kennedy as the swing vote is going to be chief justice roberts and it aposs going to be interesting because we don apost normally have a situation where the chief justice is the swing vote so you aposre going to will have in chief justice roberts someone with an outsized role in deciding which cases the supreme court takes choosing who writes opinions and deciding the outcome i think he he is really the person that aposs going to be the real swing swing vote going forward he aposs the real replacement wallace you know this court was often called the kennedy court so now finally the roberts court will be the roberts court all right panel we have to take a break here when we come back some journalists are linking that deadly shooting at a maryland newspaper to president trump aposs attacks on the media is that fair plus he had been discussed as the next house democratic leader now joe crowley aposs out of a job after losing to a long shot primary challenger we aposll ask our panel about the democratic party aposs move to the left commercial break begin video clip question shootings in annapolis question mr president can you inaudible shooting in annapolis inaudible question would you please talk to us about the dead reporters in annapolis question mr president inaudible keep talking about the enemies of the people question any words of condolence for the families mr president question why are you walking away question why won apost you come and talk to us about that end video clip wallace well reporters shouting questions at president trump and drawing an apparent connection as he returned to the white house after the murder of five journalists at a newspaper office in annapolis maryland and we aposre back now with the panel jason i have been very outspoken about president trump calling the media the enemy of the american people i think it aposs wrong but i have to say that that aposs practical that we saw on the south lawn and some reporters in any way trying to draw a link between his comments about the media to the shooting in annapolis of five reporters in a newspaper office the shooter apparently with a long grudge against that paper i think is outrageous am i wrong riley well we aposre we aposre in a new environment chris on the left particularly blame trump ask questions later that aposs the new mode that the that the press operates in and so as you say we start to learn the facts we learn that this goes back to 2011 2012 this grudge that the gunman had and oh well i guess we jumped the gun there but that aposs that aposs the environment that we live in now and and it aposs unfortunate on a personal level though you look at something like this happening in the newsroom where many of us have worked for many years if you aposre an opinion journalist and you aposre not upsetting some you aposre probably not very good at your job and you know you get used to the angry comments you get some nasty phone calls but you see something like this and it is quite chilling wallace you know even you say after the fact came in people went oh we jumped the gun the fact is some reporters even after they know the knew the facts jumped on this rob cox an editor at reuters tweeted this blood is on your hands mr president save your thoughts and prayers for your empty soul he later apologized margaret sullivan media columnist for the washington post wrote this a couple of days after the shooting everybody know about the shooter and his grudge against the paper while there is no causality there is a connection in the attitudes of this unhinged gunmen and the president of the united states a dangerous failure to understand the role of the media in our society anne i hate to put you on the spot but do you think that aposs fair gearan well i mean i think margaret is correct that there aposs not any link here i mean this guy aposs beef with the paper to your point went back to 2012 i mean it donald trump has nothing to do with why he was angry at this particular paper why why the gunmen alleged gunman was but there there aposs a there aposs a different environment that surrounds anything having to do with reporting and reporting on trump now and i think i agree partially with jason here that i mean trump when trump says that not only says that the press is the enemy of the people but points to specific reporters and points to reporters on the back of of his rallies with the clear implication that he hopes his his followers will jeer at those reporters will call them by name what he aposs encouraging people to hate on on the press directly i think he if it wallace i i agree with all of that and you can be troubled by all of that but it has nothing to do with this shooting gearan oh it had nothing to do with the shooting it has everything to do with the environment in which the shooting is being processed now in the press and in the public mind wallace jason can you buy that riley the shooting was yet another pretense for going after donald trump that aposs what this was about and that aposs the environment we live in now and it aposs unfortunate and i think you know the public the voting public sees right through this and they aposre not fooling anyone wallace all right speaking of the voting public i want to turn to another big story this week and that was the democrats apos dramatic turn to the left first you had that woman alexandria ocasio cortez shocking primary upset of a house leader joe crowley in a new york primary this week then you had more democrats calling for and more mainstream democrats calling for the abolishment of immigration and customs enforcement which president trump jumped on take a look at this exchange begin video clip gillibrand we should protect families that need our help and that is not what ice is doing today and that aposs why i believe you should get rid of it start over reimagine it and build something that actually works trump you know what would happen to parts of our country it would be overrun with the worst criminal elements you have ever seen end video clip wallace mo are democrats in danger of moving too far to the left on immigration and other issues elleithee on immigration i i think it aposs only a very small group of people that have come out so far and called for the abolition of ice i do not think that is necessarily the most the strongest case for democrats to be making the democrats have a very powerful issue by keeping the focus on the separation of families talking about reforming ice to help reunify these kids and and make sure we don apost see this kind of debacle at the border again reform i think makes sense abolition i think takes the spotlight off of an issue that is incredibly important on this wallace you you say let me just say you say a few but the few include kirsten gillibrand who potentially is running in 2020 and elizabeth warren who may be the leader of the elleithee yes and i think this is going to be an important point to see what other democrats do moving forward do they try to take the more keep the focus where it aposs been or chase this other perspective on on the primary result in new york i remember also a few months ago when conor lamb won in pennsylvania and everyone said is this you know is this the new model for the democratic party this more centrist approach now you know in what happened in new york it is is it this more progressive approach i think what you saw in both cases were democrats nominating candidates that fit those districts she won in an incredibly progressive district holmes it aposs a very clear distinction conor lamb actually didn apost have to win a primary right he didn apost have to face democratic primary voters they could select him from a central committee he wouldn apost have any prayer of making it thorough a democratic primary elleithee oh i disagree holmes what what you aposre seeing right now is all of the energy on the left focused on a very radical set of ideas it aposs going to make them extremely difficult to field a 2020 candidate that it is anywhere near the mainstream inaudible wallace so forget 2020 what about 2018 holmes no i think we have that problem first right they what we aposve seen with a lot of house candidates in particular is that the the quote unquote establishment candidate has been defeated by somebody who aposs significantly to the left now they didn apost have their you know top tier inaudible the eric cantor inaudible until this week and i think that this is a much more significant development than any democrats will want to believe here i riley i would i would agree with that and on a whole range of issues that used to be considered fringe and for progressive not just eliminating ice but but free college tuition medicare for all legalizing pot and so forth those have all become mainstream democratic wallace i want to give mo you aposve got 15 seconds final word elleithee yes i mean the the primary results does just doesn apost bear that out where you saw across over the course of the entire year we aposre at the tail end of the primary process over the course of the entire year only one democratic incumbent has been knocked off the establishment candidates and the progressive candidates are battling in this kind of a war wallace you know the best thing we don apost have the election until november so we aposve got lots of time to talk about that elleithee have some time to figure this out
