city of 3 million people as rebel forces launched a new offensive against assad despite some battleground success there have been complaints that the opposition is hopelessly splintered and unable to coalesce around a transition plan that was adopted by members of the u n security council in geneva over the summer friday s meeting was intended in part to encourage better cooperation among assad s foes it is encouraging to see some progress toward greater opposition unity but we all know there is more work to be done clinton said u s officials have noted that revolutionary councils in cities including damascus homs aleppo idlib and deir al zour were becoming increasingly organized members of local groups from across syria and representatives of the exile group the syrian national council including its head abdulbaset sieda attended the meeting but u s officials declined to name others taking part or let them be photographed saying that doing so would risk putting those opponents of assad in danger of reprisals the meeting was co chaired by the arab league league secretary general nabil elaraby lamented the u n s inability to demand that the geneva plan be implemented by threatening sanctions against those who would not abide by it all of our efforts up to now have led to failures he said we have not managed to change the situation neither russia nor china which have

lavrov who was to address the general assembly on friday has accused the u s and other countries of encouraging terrorism in their stance on syria however clinton told the meeting that the greatest threat to syria other than the assad regime itself was iran let s be very frank here she said the regime s most important lifeline is iran there is no longer any doubt that tehran will do whatever it takes to protect its proxy and crony in damascus iran will do everything it can to evade international sanctions clinton said she urged syria s neighbors to take extra steps to ensure that iran is not
