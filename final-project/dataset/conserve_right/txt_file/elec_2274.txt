prejudice and paranoia he has taken hate groups mainstream and is helping a radical fringe take over the republican party the speech that followed those words was an extended argument that her opponent is a racist a conspiracy theorist and a man temperamentally unfit to be president clinton s campaign had promoted this in advance as an address about donald trump and his advisors embrace of the disturbing alt right political philosophy the alt right being an umbrella term for an assortment of racist micro movements and online subcultures yesterday i suggested that making the alt right the stars of such a speech could only give a signal boost to what is after all a rather obscure political faction but clinton s comments about that faction took up only about a minute of her remarks and while that minute was pretty juicy the alt right wasn t really the rally s star villain after all the star villain was donald trump everyone else that clinton brought into the address the alt right breitbart alex jones david duke nigel farage vladimir putin was there in a supporting role some of clinton s arguments didn t make a lot of sense she led her litany oddly by quoting trump s recent remarks about how bad blacks have it in america poverty rejection horrible education no housing no homes no ownership crime at levels nobody has seen most people would call his comments a clumsy attempt to reassure voters that he cares about the black community s problems but clinton declared them a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters she also wildly overstated the alt right s influence declaring that the de facto merger between breitbart and the trump campaign means the alt rightists have effectively taken over the republican party she was on sturdier ground at other moments as when she mentioned trump s habit of retweeting white nationalists or his false claim that he watched thousands of new jersey muslims cheer the 9 11 attacks running through all her claims both the weak ones and the strong ones was one basic theme donald trump is a bigot and a nut and while that s an idea you ve been hearing ever since the mogul turned reality tv star entered the race this was as forceful and concentrated an expression of it as i ve ever heard emerge from hillary clinton s mouth it s bound to fire up her supporters and i expect it will help her get out the vote whether it also leads a bunch of curious conservatives to google alt right depends i suppose on how much coverage that minute of the speech gets in the next few days but the guy who must be really delighted right now is alex jones hillary clinton just attacked him by name his listeners will be hearing clips from this speech til ragnarok advertisement next justice dept offers cops advice on not

willie wonka wilkinson and his guaranteed minimal income oompa loompas lord that tool has surfaced from his bunker and has been debating brian caplan on twitter if libertarians are alt left the green party must be ctrl alt left green party is backspace times 10 000 years dems are control alt pinkscreen whenever they see an image of government almighty well sad to say the same is true for the rethuglicans just on different issues or as you refer to them the seattle city council the democratic party behaved responsibly and vanquished them were you born an intellectually bankrupt mendacious sack of shit or did you have to work hard at becoming one i think the nature vs nurture question often misses the point the democratic national convention ended less than a month ago the dnc cheated the alt left out of the nomination of alt reality sanders and adopted their policies so much for the will of the people i guess so far majorities are speaking i ll let you know if that changes really you mean all that money she raised above sanders didn t buy her the election or the dnc working actively to ensure her victory you hadn t heard about that mind you i am aware of the usefulness of institutions in keeping the idiot majority from imposing their utopian fantasies on the rest of us but you re the one who loves to go on about society and the people and yet the same anti democratic forces you complain about incessantly were what secured clinton s victory fundamentally the problem was the gop primary system was too democratic they made the mistake of putting too much faith in the voter sanders raised more money than clinton in the primary he lost because he couldn t win over minorities there was no nefarious conspiracy i m making over 7k a month working part time i kept hearing other people tell me how much money they can make online so i decided to look into it well it was all true and has totally changed my life this is what i do http goo gl d5ic10 i basically profit close to 10k 15k every month doing an online job for those of you who are prepared to do easy at homee jobs for 2h 5h each day at your house and earn valuable paycheck while doing it then this work opportunity is go to web http www 14earnpath com who is the alt left spiderman the debates should be interesting the left has cried hitler and racism so often now you get trump and it s the boy who cried wolf these are the same people that said romney was going to kill your grandma and mccain was some far right radical not convinced for one second these attacks would be any different if it was bush or rubio or anyone else up there even a left leaning kasich was not moderate enough for them because as my prog friends said he hates women jesus christ there will be no debates trump will whinge about the rules or setting or moderators and walk or will hillary will claim something trump said was so beyond the pale that she won t be on the same stage with him neither has anything to gain by a debate so each will be more than obliging to let the other cancel i hope so maybe they will let gary johnson have a shot instead johnson breaking the 15 threshold guarantees that clintrump won t debate one on one they each pander to their respected bases no win no loss just the chance of a unforeseeable oops moment which is why they are both better off not debating put johnson up there and they both have a chance of losing voters thus no debates johnson has zero chance of breaking 15 and even if he did he would have zero chance of team purple not finding a way to negate it iow he s not getting on the debate stage he has a 15 chance of getting 0 it s not a very high chance but it s non zero he s actually getting some press and not just stossel cnn s smerconish is championing him or at least letting him debate i m not gonna hold my breath til he reaches 15 but i won t be getting out my shocked face if he does cnn are making fun of him and libertarians in general if not for that he would be getting zero air time from them cnn which now ranks lower in the ratings than msnbc he was on fox this morning they gave him a shot and he stepped on his own dick he isnt going to get 15 well if it s long enough for him to step on it that s gotta count for something right hell maybe they should let him have a few shots a little dutch courage might liven up his act a bit the debates will be canceled because hillary s health crisis and the donald is a big meanie the left will mourn poor hillary missing her chance to show how great she is the next day cnn will report that hillary is in perfect health and the donald is still a big meanie no one will notice this would be hilarious to see or not see as it were awwwwwwwllllllllll righty then do not go in there trump has oodles to gain from a debate i m not sure clinton can think fast enough at this time to effectively be in a debate against someone who s actually trying just a little bit bernie basically laid down on the mat in the democrat debates if there are any debates it won t be between clinton and trump it will be between the moderator and trump clinton will just sit back and try to make it to the election 1 candy crowley romney s binders full of women comment was met with the same level of outrage as some of trump s worst comments not that the right doesn t do the same thing but if left leaning media folks are really as incredulous as they claim to be about why their trump warnings are falling on deaf ears looking at everything they ve written the past several election cycles would be a good place to start has trump accepted his invitation to the debates yet or is he still negotiating conditions for his appearance not convinced for one second these attacks would be any different if it was bush or rubio or anyone else up there sure they would half the republican establishment wouldn t be trying to torpedo bush or rubio that well has run dry http hotair com archives 201 ng racism a quinnipiac national poll out today shows that 72 percent of them believe that the way donald trump talks appeals to bigotry versus 23 percent who don t would this be any different if this was bush or rubio i suspect not in fact rubio would probably be excoriated for being a fake hispanic because he doesn t want to put white people on the shame train trump makes it all even worse than it would have been any gop candidate would have gotten some of these same attacks but i don t think you d see the widespread backlash that trump has caused romney mccain etc weren t popular with non whites by any means and they both got hit with some accusations of bigotry but i think you re kidding yourself if you think that perception was equally widespread among society as a whole and not just left wing democratic partisans looking at that same poll even a majority of whites without a college education agreed with that statement trump gets an added layer of backlash for not being one of the elected officials club any other pub nominees would have most of his own side on his side also from that link i mentioned this a few days ago in looking at the new nbc surveymonkey poll the racial demographic that s doing the most damage to trump isn t blacks or latino it s whites i ve been saying for months that while it would have been nice for trump to increase republican vote share with minorities he d get a lot more traction pushing the envelope on increasing voter participation support with whites because there s so much less ground to cover to start flipping states something like a 3 or 4 increase would lead to an electoral wipeout for him he s getting beat by hillary among college educated whites and that s what s really killing his candidacy not his low numbers with minorities which would have been low anyway you mean college brainwashed voters those that haven t been in the real world and cast an absentee vote from their safe space i graduated college 8 years ago and some of the dumbest people i know have college degrees um college educated whites are a demographic that has voted for the republican presidential candidate since polling began other than maybe johnson s wipeout of goldwater trump appears to be losing them even goldwater won that group it s been more than 60 years since the gop lost that demographic trump s doing terrible with college educated whites for a lot of the same reasons he s doing terrible with non whites basically the college educated whites are adopting the same attitude about the republican candidate in this election that non whites do in every election where is andrew dice clay when you need him f ing mother goose holds up mirror so swiss can narrow gaze 1 rover took over aaaaawwwwwhhhhrrrrgghhh that s the sound of alex jones coming in his pants when hillary mentioned his name next you know the gop will be using terms like superpredator i like the way so many disparate things are velcroed together to make a really really scary bogeyman there s gotta be a koch in there somewhere which reminds me i haven t been hearing much about the kochs lately i guess trump pushed them to the back burner in the fevered minds of progs the bright side is that just as when the term neo conservative was diliuted to mean nothing the movement was neutered so too will the alt right if everything is the alt right then nothing is and the anime nazis will return to the comfort of their mother s basements to masturbate to another season of himouto umaru chan anime nazis didn t they play the opening act at lollapalooza one year you spelled urotsukidoji incorrectly i hate anime nazis no anime nazis drop space stations on australia there s no need to be anti zeonist i haz a sad that i got that joke and knew exactly what pan zagloba was talking about without clicking the link heil zeon look man 80s anime is bound to be cool again what with all them cycles right i mean come on gundam uc flavor macross bubblegum crisis patlabor lodoss war i have all of those on dvd except for patlabor which i ve never even heard of patlabor which i ve never even heard of whaaa patlabor is my favorite anime thing of all time series both ova and tv is a delightful office comedy with mecha and movies are basically dry run i d argue better written for ghost in the shell with same writer composer and director all praise mamoru oshii everyone should watch patlabor 2 which is a wonderful meditation on law peace and terrorism made years before 9 11 and still relevant today you haven t heard of future funk aka overly processed funk disco with 80 s anime samples and visuals interesting i ll check that out my wife s favorite is evangelion but i prefer to be able to at least pretend to understand what s going on in order to truly enjoy a show the new netflix voltron ain t half bad we watched it all and it hit the nostalgia buttons for me and she actually enjoyed it my wife s favorite is evangelion she is good people you tell her i said that i guess i am good people too or burn down london wait i thought they glorified western culture this is part and parcel of western culture they didn t make these kinds of cartoons before we took a giant nuclear shit on them and split their dainty women with our giant western cocks you are basically describing my average day they totally invented hentai though has this now replaced tea party as the meaningless catch all word for prog signalling bookmarks for later reason com is a proud member of the alt right and not only does it allow comments from avowed racists like the one who calls himself a dramatic pause mulatto dramatic pause and frequent misogynistic comments about sasquatch rape it encourages such abhorrent behavior reason com s alt right readership also includes a sexual deviant who writes erotic fiction about politicians a trump supporter who loves fat chicks several off the plantation racial and sexual traitors numerous woodchipper enthusiasts warty hugeman one of the most annoying catholics on the internet a time traveler and multiple drug fiends and an impactful number of canadians yep i think you covered everyone with the possible exception of an octogenarian anti aggressor crusader angrily banging away on his steam powered difference engine and the obnoxious 14 year old canadian nephew of nathaniel branden that he sometime babysits oh and our future reptilian overlord what about tulpa oh wait that s the reasonable one in this situation some of us fall into multiple categories saunters off proudly nothing about my pecs don t forget omwc or is his predeliction now alt acceptable this is amazing now where s my cocaine the term alt right got a funk to it a couple of years ago john derbyshire has labeled himself as a member of the dissident right so hrc is swinging a bit late on the ball john derbyshire has also labeled himself a white supremacist so i don t think he s a good source on branding advice left to her own devices hillary could easily self destruct anybody else hear the latest on the clinton foundation 1 they ve decided to keep taking donations from foreign governments after all 2 chelsea isn t resigning after all now or ever what s the point of having a bribe laundering service if there s no viable pathway to influence and hence bribes once hillary s out of office while the parent clinton foundation will stop accepting money from foreign governments and corporations the foundation s largest project the clinton health access initiative might continue to accept foreign government and corporate funding clinton health initiative officials said wednesday http tinyurl com gvkydus you see when hillary said the clinton foundation would stop taking money from foreign governments she was talking about the parent company not its individual projects get it if you do you realize that the clintons will keep taking money as long as money is being offered and hillary clinton would do anything for a big enough donation no i didn t call her that i said she d doing anything if you offered her enough money anything left to her own devices hillary could easily self destruct for that to happen trump would have to shut up and stop saying attention grabbing retarded things and we all know that s unlikely trump is psychologically incapable of following napoleons advice to not interrupt your enemy when he is destroying himself for that to happen trump would have to shut up and stop saying attention grabbing retarded things and we all know that s unlikely i was speculating earlier in am links today i think he may be doing that i speculated that the only reason we re finally hearing about the clinton foundation is that donald hasn t been saying outrageous things lately he hasn t tweeted or said anything retarded for almost two whole days now two whole days all kidding aside i think his new team may finally have him on a leash he s reversing course on immigration supposedly among other things it s still close enough in swing states we haven t even had a debate yet the election may be decided in october left to her own devices hillary could easily self destruct and we are all just prisoners here of our own device 1 they ve decided to keep taking donations from foreign governments after all this is truly shocking i tell you want to know what will be even more shocking when they decide to keep doing so even after hillary is potus president of official national territories and neo conservative government ken you are the master of wishful thinking masquerading as the obvious truth you keep on getting my hopes up keep on keeping on most of the people who get classified as alt righters aren t even fucking conservatives these are angry white dudes from their teens to their early 30 s who would have been liberals 8 years ago but got sick of being demonized as straight white men everywhere they went they are liberals they agree with the left on just about everything besides multiculturalism and immigration these are the same angry young white dudes who hated bush and loved the young turks before but who can t stand identity politics that exclude them then you have your small core of genuine racists the boogiemen of the movement example sargon of akkad would be classified as alt right by most of the batshit crazy progressives who rant about it but the guy is a complete liberal on nearly everything he grew up liberal and extremely anti bush blair the left lost these guys and now they get lumped in with libertarians along with genuine nazis to smear everyone who disagrees with progs i ll speak up for sargon he may be a luvvie laborite but man s commitment to free speech and liberal values is genuine shit his reading of hayek s exhortation to the english is a lovely tribute to a genuine old school liberal i don t always agree with him but fuck if he s not miles above say trudeau son and father or neil kinnock arthur scargill labour ok i guess this is a real person at first i thought we were talking about sauron as being alt right which confused me because i definitely would have taken sauron to be a neocon which is not to say that they aren t taking over the republican party trump is a liberal on just about every issue except multiculturalism and immigration she might not be wrong but she probably won t assign any responsibility to whatever genius decided the democrats should return to its racist and bigoted roots but attack the majority instead of minorities because why choose to be stupid or evil when you can be both at any rate i don t think a political movement bankrolled by a nazi gets to throw too many stones about hate group connections and if she s going to attack trump not by who he associates with but who supports him then i think it s fair game to point out that she had the man who taught the miami nightclub shooter to hate sitting right behind her at her fucking rally if donald trump is the kkk s candidate hillary is isis s candidate if donald trump is the kkk s candidate hillary is isis s candidate there s no small number of people who would think this comparison favors clinton she might not be wrong but she probably won t assign any responsibility to whatever genius decided the democrats should return to its racist and bigoted roots but attack the majority instead of minorities why would she blame them the left in america has always used race to divide an conquer the peasants the left sold white identity politics with slavery kkk jim crow segregation then when it got to be a harder sell with whites they sold non white identity politics in the 60s by some strange coincidence also the time that they changed the immigration system to tilt immigration to non white less free countries democrat calls republican racist how many originality points does that earn negative infinity prog roomie well trump is a racist and has re awoken the southern democrats he s empowering all the white people to hate brown people again seriously though name me one republican you wouldn t just dismiss as racist sexist whatever ism makes you feel better are you telling me without trump you wouldn t launch these attacks anyway christ hillary made a lot of the same attacks on obama that trump has 8 years ago hat tip to suthernboy for pointing it out her followers started the birther shit and her campaign leaked obama in funny foreign looking garb to promote the he s a foreigner muslim stuff not to mention her previous positions on immigration criminal justice superpredators and war prog roomie running through all her claims both the weak ones and the strong ones was one basic theme donald trump is a bigot and a nut and if he s such a bigot and a nut why did you go to his wedding why was your husband his regular golfing buddy why did you accept his support when he was defending your husband at this point i m thinking of starting up a pool to see how long it will take for the democrats to start decrying how far the republican party has strayed from the good old days when it had sensible moderates like donald trump it pretty much tells you democrats are pathological liars they simply can t help themselves it s mostly why they get so much support from people under the age of 35 the people who eventually outgrow pathologically lying also eventually see democrats for what they are republicans lie like crazy too but they have to think about it for a democrat it is pure instinct also consider that gop candidates have a very real chance of being booted from their cushy job by angry constituents democrats have no such fear all they need to do is promise more free shit and babble on about other crazy things and the vote is automatic true but the lies are so fucking transparent at this point it s not the lying that i object to it s the insult to my intelligence that the lie represents if they think i ll believe half the shit they re dishing out they must think i m an abject moron you must not take it personal when i first listened to obama lying through his teeth at first though the same thing then i realized he wasn t talking to me he was talking to his cult followers and didn t give a shit about what i thought hell i figured out they were always lying when i was 12 so how exactly did she work the conspiracy theorist accusation into her vast conspiracy theory everyone else that clinton brought into the address the alt right breitbart alex jones david duke nigel farage vladimir putin was there in a supporting role the alt right would be likes of moldbug nick land and steve sailer even david brooks reads steve sailer so does robbie re paul joseph watson s tweet hillary s direct personal attack on alex jones proves we have shook her campaign to the core wrawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwng it proves we have shaken her campaign to the core english please come on jesse if she overstated alt right influence it s by design hers isn t the first campaign to attempt to fix an extreme label on an opponent it was shrewd politics on her part and to be fair trump deserves it alt right has been fueled by right wing media for years and you re sadly mistaken if you think right wing media hasn t been influential brietbart major player in taking down eric cantor nuff said matt drudge and the blue dress the ministey of truth does not approve hey jackass shows up for a non climate related thread hey there jackass i have a feeling i ll regret agreement but i agree right wing media has influenced the right but the left wing media has definitely influenced the left and the mainstream media affects many on both sides and resembles a more polished and more tone downed version of left wing media but it s still an interesting point giving some evidence as to why neither the ds nor rs could nominate better candidates where one could argue more polarized media on both sides and the tone deaf echo chambers which have been erected around media sources this ends in two presidential nominees neither of whom are fit for the presidency though that may also show why hillary is likely to win giving evidence that ds are more brainwashed into identity team politics than are rs you see you have two very bad candidates but the ds will still come out in force to prove group identity so even those ds who dislike hillary will vote for her the rs however will lose due to many more staying home and simply not voting for trump as they don t like trump anyone than many ds don t like hillary but since they do not care about this team politics crap they ll not vote but it s just a theory you have to admit hilary is a much more practiced liar than trump i m not sure she practices it may actually be her superpower which she is unable to turn off the star villain was donald trump no shit democrats could just as easily tell the truth about everything and it would make zero difference to their campaign hillary could stand on stage and say that she s going to raise taxes on the middle class and poor that she s going to sell us influence to the saudis and even isis that she actually detests her own voters and could care less about them that she s going to instruct the justice department to make sure blacks suffer even more under a corrupt judicial system than they do now etc etc it would make zero difference to her voters they would pull the lever for her just the same and if anyone asks them a day later about all the things she said they would deny she ever said it democrat voters are sheep that is all hillary only lies because it s her nature it has no effect on her campaign sad thing is that if she s elected she s going to do all of those things over the course of a month i had a prog deny that obumbles ever said under my plan energy prices will necessarily skyrocket three times even though i showed him the video of obumbles saying it after each of his denials i even characterized the quote thusly he just told you he is going to fuck you to death there it is on video after each viewing i could see the confusion on his face apparently they can selectively wipe things from memory good thing you didn t show him the one where he claimed to be a muslim or where he said that he could make what happened in detroit happen everywhere in the nation the prog denied obama three times his name is peter isn t it and then the crow cucked or something like that hillary could stand on stage and say that she s going to raise taxes on the middle class she actually did this and the crowd cheered it was inadvertent i think because she was earlier talking about the riches fair share and all that but she said it in a loud screech and the crowd roared it was a freudian slip kinda thing http goo gl uvbbkx i can t believe the trump team doesn t have this playing on a loop if this doesn t impress independent voters i can t imagine what will hillary could stand on stage and say that she s going to raise taxes on the middle class and poor i d consider voting for her then that s the only way to finance the current welfare state it s what europeans are doing all this nasty talk about alt right just makes me want to google them and find out what they re all about and then make me want to vote for trump even more did someone yell out pepe during the speech a plague of racist frogs is about to descend normies reeeeeee reeeeeeeee reeeeee one thing that is cool about the alt right and right in general is that it is an army of davids as glen reynolds would say you don t have to philosophically agree with them to see their value who is going to actually read hrc s emails not the skirts at fox news or the drones at npr yes and their day of revenge cometh even if it means the donald will be king for a day they will hack your icloud nudes does this devil donald image come on a coffee mug all the progs will love me until i tell them to piss off and go back to their retard space go back to your retard space would be a good mug when you fill it with hot coffee it turns into a picture a wall her demonization of the alt right as taking over the party allows republicans to save face and backpedal off support for trump it was a pretty brilliant move on her part jill stein does not approve of this message that the republican party has been taken over by right wing extremists is an evergreen meme among democrats pro lgbt anti trade pro choice big government right wing extremists the worst kind of right wing extremist i m a right wing extremist well like you had to tell us that you re on reason com duh i thought we were way to the right of right wing extremist or is it way to the left of left wing extremist i guess it depends on who s doing the trolling someone asked me not long ago if i was right wing or left wing i said i would have to move way over to the left to be considered right wing he was puzzled but didn t press it hey there s this collection of weirdos who believe in conspiracy theories about jewish world cabals and white genocide what should we do about them give them all the attention they ve ever craved validate all their conspiracies and associate them with a populist candidate the alt right has effectively taken over the republican party if only federalist not feeling the love i have to give at least a couple points for amalgamated ghosts of old cigarettes http thefederalist com 2016 bamboozle there has to be some percentage of dried up cunt in there somewhere jesse you missed a rather large one she accused trump of promoting the conspiracy that she herself invented and pushed that obumbles is not a citizen the unawareness she assumes about her base are stunning it couldn t be worse if she had stood on the stage and looked them in the eye and said i know you stupid motherfuckers are going to vote for me no matter what i say or do now stand up and applaud she is right too just a few days ago a feminist group declared that they knew bill clinton is a rapist but thats ok because at least he is not a republican or donald trump i don t know how it could be worse than that jesse you missed a rather large one she accused trump of promoting the conspiracy that she herself invented and pushed that obumbles is not a citizen the trouble with levying a charge of hypocrisy here is that she herself never endorsed that theory it had its first real burst of popularity with her hardcore supporters during the 2008 primary campaign and i ve seen it plausibly claimed but not proven that people working for her played a role in fanning it but unlike trump she didn t associate herself with it so i didn t get into it in the post too much to unpack it may have been circulating on fringe anti muslim sites first but it was the pumas who made it popular the trouble with levying a charge of hypocrisy here is that she herself never endorsed that theory of course not the clintons always strive for plausible deniable and having others do their dirty work and are always accused of being guilty precisely because they didn t do anything that depends precisely on what the meaning of guilty do anything and precisely is cockroach hahaha i bet you even still think bill is a faithful husband you ll fellate any d won t you yes trump is a scumbag and that s why the clintons have given him back every penny he ever poured into their slush fund right oh wait jcr hillary calling trump a bigot a racist and a sexist is like a dirty cast iron pot calling a slightly stained china teacup black um if the alt right has taken over the party they re not
