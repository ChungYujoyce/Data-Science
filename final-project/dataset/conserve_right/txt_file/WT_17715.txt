tion should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion one of the most peculiar exercises of democracy in history has been unfolding over the past two weeks in taiwan a country known for its quirky politics thousands of demonstrators took over the taiwanese parliament building on march 18 to forestall the ruling party from passing a trade in services agreement with china that threatens to integrate the island s economy with china s they are still there it is peculiar for three reasons first it s the first time in democratic asia that a parliament building has been taken over by peaceful protesters without a coup junta or tank in sight second the demonstrators have the tacit approval of most parliamentarians themselves third the u s state department seems to be enjoying the spectacle top stories gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed the department s official spokesman noted in a routine diplomatic briefing well we certainly support taiwan s vibrant democracy which allows for this kind of robust political dialogue on a range of issues not a typical u s reaction to a mob takeover of a functioning legislative process the taiwanese activists also learned useful lessons from ukraine taiwan is america s 11th largest trading partner and sixth largest market for u s farm goods taiwan s economy is on the verge of being absorbed by china s and is now struggling to avoid that fate there are similarities with ukraine where protesters are struggling to avoid being absorbed by russia and to strengthen ties with the democracies of the european union poor ukraine only ranks as no 70 on the list of u s trading partners russia in fact is ukraine s largest market but strong pro russian politicians maneuvered to forestall a european embrace by scuttling a eu partnership with a hammerlock dependence on russia the results in ukraine however have not been pretty likewise strong pro china political forces in taiwan seek to lock the longtime pro american island into china s economic sphere and sever its security relationships with the united states and democratic asia like ukrainian voters most of taiwan s voters about 70 percent think their country is already far too entwined with a giant neighbor huge popular sentiment in taiwan supports the demonstrators and opposes the unionists today s taiwanese are far more aware of the lack of support they have in washington than ukrainians are that hasn t deterred them though from thinking of ways to avoid joining hong kong and macau as just another special administrative region of china when taiwan s vocally pro china ruling chinese nationalist party tried to ram a new trade in services agreement with china through taiwan s parliament on march 17 even the nationalist party s own legislators had second thoughts alas they were under strict legislative whip discipline and did not dare vote no the only way left to derail the agreement was to short circuit the parliamentary process entirely the trade in services agreement will not benefit taiwan s services exports instead there is a potential that it will be used by china as a backdoor into the u s market unless rules of origin are very tight the integration of the taiwanese and chinese economies may make it more complicated for taiwan to achieve workable new free trade agreements with its pacific partners not less taiwan literally is a nation of shopkeepers about 2 4 million of its 6 million workers are employed in taiwan s 1 million shops and services taiwan s domestic services sector is diffuse and varied local retail printing e commerce logistics mass transport taxis even undertakers are in vibrant and dynamic competition china s services sector is far more centralized and restricted by government regulation and licensing in general taiwanese businesses already have far more access to china s services sectors than any other foreign investors of course taiwanese investors in china do not have the same protections from arbitrary law enforcement regulations and contract disputes as investors from other countries which have embassies chinese investors in taiwan s services would be functioning in a modern democracy with an established rule of law and contracts most of the agreement s market openings are restricted to fujian province and are conditional for example taiwanese undertakers are banned from cremation services in china where 99 percent of all funerals involve cremation yet taiwan s market openings for chinese investors are countrywide and unconditional taiwanese also calculate that their ability to penetrate china s financial services market under the agreement would be greatly restricted with little prospect of influencing reforms in china s financial sector taiwan s banking institutions are smaller diffused and too competitive among themselves to have any structural impact in china by contrast china s financial institutions are all centrally controlled and have vastly more capital the agreement affords chinese banks and institutions up to 20 percent ownership in taiwan counterparts and thus effective control it is impossible for any taiwan institution to take effective control of any chinese counterpart small retail businesses face a similar potential for being swamped the investment threshold of 200 000 brings with it a potential of bringing in 21 new immigrants from china three employees and up to seven family members per worker in a broad demographic sense china can absorb unlimited taiwan immigration but taiwan cannot absorb unlimited chinese migration nor can taiwan s retail sector absorb unlimited competition unlike other foreign investors in taiwan chinese investors do not have to renounce chinese citizenship to be naturalized as taiwanese voters in taiwan taiwan s voters see few if any real advantages of the trade in services agreement to taiwan s overall economy over what taiwanese businesses already enjoy in china there are no new investment guarantees no new arbitration advantages no new dispute settlement mechanisms no doubt the agreement fulfills a taipei government goal of further integrating taiwan s economy with china s and enhancing china s already massive influence in taiwan s economy like ukrainians view of their russian economic partnership most taiwanese see the agreement as a strategic move on the way to taiwan s political union with its biggest economic counterpart unlike ukrainians taiwanese have parried the maneuver cleverly legislators including the speaker of taiwan s parliament have acquiesced in a physical takeover of the country s legislative yuan by demonstrators mostly students and young activists on the eve of the agreement vote anxious parliamentarians worried about voters but under a strict party whip now seem content to let the demonstrations delay the vote indefinitely most taiwanese hope they will get enough moral support from washington tokyo canberra ottawa and brussels to persuade the ruling nationalist party to rethink the trade in services agreement it is a move they judge will not draw backlash from beijing the obama administration s ukraine policy has been a horrible failure for washington and the western democracies but it seems that the state department has learned its lesson with a little bit of encouragement for taiwan s people the united states may be able to preserve taiwan as an important trading partner separate from china without it taiwan will eventually disappear as an independent entity in democratic asia john j tkacik is president of china business int
