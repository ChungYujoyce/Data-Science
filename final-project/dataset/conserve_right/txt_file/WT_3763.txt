he acknowledged that the hotel has charged high rates in the past including during trump s inauguration the hotel got a premium then he said alabama donor william mcfarland said he didn t hear anyone complaining about the cost of rooms in order to be invited you have to be obviously a major donor to the rnc but there was no hard sell it s just an annual dinner they have said mcfarland that said he found a cheaper place to stay elsewhere if i was going to pay that kind of money for any hotel room i d rather just give it to the rnc mcfarland said an rnc official declined to comment specifically on the cost of rooms at the trump hotel how much money was raised through the weekend s events or to give details on any perks offered to donors the official who insisted on anonymity to discuss
