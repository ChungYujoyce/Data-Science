the institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme model cited by white house coronavirus task force officials has increased its projections of the number of coronavirus deaths in the united states by august 4 to 93 765 the projection is based on key assumptions about the implementation of social distancing policies the ihme saidin a statement released on wednesday these estimates assume the strong continuation of statewide social distancing measures in places where they are already enacted and future adoption within the next seven days in states without them if such policies are relaxed or not implemented the us could experience a higher covid 19 death toll and hospital burden than what our models currently predict the model now projects 12 651 more deaths in the united states than it projected five days ago when its first projection of 81 114 coronavirus deaths was announced on march 26 the model s estimation of coronavirus deaths has increased with every published update on monday march 30 at 6 00 a m pacific time the model projected 82 141 coronavirus deaths by august 4 just 24 hours ago on tuesday march 31 at 6 00 a m pacific time the ihme model projected 83 967 coronavirus deaths in the united states by august 4 wednesday s projections represent an increase in estimated coronavirus deaths of 9 798 based on a single day of new data the model is dynamic and its projections for the country and individual states are updated every 24 hours at 6 a m pacific time based on the most recently reported data the increase is primarily driven by increasing death tolls in states that previously had very few covid 19 deaths states with more covid 19 deaths such as new york and washington show far less fluctuation across daily updates if the number of cumulative covid 19 deaths rise by state we expect increasing accuracy for predictions across states the ihme saidin wednesday s statement the sensitivity of the model s projections to new data confirms what white house corona task force member dr anthony fauci has stated about epidemiological modeling of the course of the coronavirus pandemic it s a moving target the ihme statement added today s estimates show that nationwide covid 19 deaths are predicted to peak on april 16 when we predict 2 607 deaths range of 1 294 to 4 140 in a single day this projection is higher than our estimates released on march 31 which projected peak us covid 19 deaths at 2 214 range of 1 106 to 3 321 on april 15 april 16 also is now estimated as the peak hospital use date in the us at this peak date the us is projected to need 260 342 total hospital beds 38 849 for icu and 31 082 ventilators to support covd 19 patients this could equate to a projected shortage of 84 671 total hospital beds and 18 905 icu beds given current covid 19 trajectories the statement also provided these additional details on data updates and how they influenced the model s new estimates an updated estimate of total coronavirus deaths hospital capacity and peak days as projected by the ihme model is expected to be released at 6 00 am thursday april 2 the ihme covid 19 model research project is run by professor christopher j l murray of the university of washington the director of theihme funding was provided by the bill melinda gates foundation and the state of washington according to thereporton the study published on march 30 at medrxiv healthpoliticsbill and melinda gates foundationcoronavirusepidemiologistuniversity of washington please let us know if you re having issues with commenting copyright 2020 breitbart
