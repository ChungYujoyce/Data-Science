president of the united states though clinton called trump her campaign initially did not concede defeat earlier her campaign chairman john podesta addressed supporters nearby in new york and said several states were too close to call clinton herself did not appear at the rally podesta had urged supporters to head home and said they would not have anything more to say tonight amid trump s victory republicans also were projected to hold onto their majority in the house and senate improving trump s chances of advancing his agenda in office a surge of support in key battlegrounds and especially surprise victories in states like pennsylvania and wisconsin helped propel trump to victory the gop nominee built a commanding lead early on with wins in heavily contested north carolina florida ohio and iowa clinton won her share of battlegrounds including virginia and nevada and colorado but could not make up for trump s strong performance in other states thought to favor the democrat the billionaire businessman s victory marked a remarkable upset and turnaround after he had been complaining amid a rough patch just weeks ago the vote could be rigged against him clinton was still thought to have the clear advantage in the electoral map going into tuesday s vote yet the polls had been tightening in the race s closing days his victory could demonstrate just how much the dynamics were shifting in his favor and perhaps how his true support was elusive all along to pollsters and others gauging the race without question his bid was helped over the last two weeks by a burst of setbacks for his opponent eleven days before the election fbi director james comey announced the bureau was revisiting the investigation into clinton s personal email server use while secretary of state after discovering new messages on the laptop of disgraced ex rep anthony weiner the estranged husband of a top clinton aide he closed the case again on sunday but the political damage may have been done and the wikileaks release of emails hacked from podesta s account became a constant distraction for the campaign as the messages revealed infighting internal concerns about the clinton family s foundation and even evidence that the now head of the democratic national committee leaked town hall questions to clinton during the primaries this at times overshadowed the numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against trump that came out in october which he denies following leaked footage from over a decade ago showing trump making crude comments about women trump s victory marks the second time clinton was thwarted in her bid to become the first female u s president having been defeated by president obama in their 2008 primary race but trump has been able to defy expectations from the start he defeated a deep field of 16 competitors during the republican primaries stitching together a motivated coalition of voters invigorated by his outsider populist message throwing his rivals off their talking points during a raucous marathon of debates and commanding media attention throughout with his unpredictable learn as he goes campaign style he also defied party orthodoxy railing against free trade deals like nafta and the trans pacific partnership and staking out a sometimes confusing set of positions on foreign policy that may yet evolve democrats have criticized him heavily for statements expressing admiration for russia s vladimir putin and a desire to rebuild ties with moscow trump was aided by the infrastructure of the gop but his campaign never came close to the juggernaut operation mounted by clinton while she entered the final stretch of the race with an army of high powered surrogates trump s campaign was driven mainly by him an inner circle of family members and a rotating set of top campaign advisers surrogates like retired lt gen mike flynn and former new york mayor rudy giuliani advocated aggressively for the republican nominee but he remained at odds with many influential elected republicans who in some cases as with house speaker paul ryan endorsed him but only reluctantly his stances on trade as well as his hardline immigration proposals including variations on a plan to suspend muslim immigration from certain countries also made party brass uncomfortable the late emergence of a 2005 tape showing him making crude comments about women led some congressional republicans to abandon him entirely but even the biggest controversies seemed only to ding trump whose resilience in the polls could be credited to a movement of grassroots supporters who seemed to have little interest in the nominee s tensions with the gop establishment and saw him as the true change maker in the election get all the
