apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the emergency landing of two u s marine corps f 18 fighter jets on the island of taiwan appears to have been a political message from the pentagon to beijing following a recent chinese bomber drill near the island nation that is a key rival to beijing s rule the pentagon said the marine f 18s landed at a southwestern air base that taiwan s defense ministry identified as the historic tainan air force base maj paul l greenberg a marine corps spokesman said the aircraft were on a routine mission flying in support of a training exercise two f 18c hornets from marine fighter attack squadron 323 vmfa 323 based at kadena airfield in japan made a precautionary landing this morning at an airfield in southwestern taiwan maj greenberg said there were

between taiwan and philippines archipelago this may be a simple accident but one hopes the symbolism is not lost on beijing analysts say military analyst rick fisher said the marine jet landings appear to be pentagon sending a political message to china since the aircraft could have made an emergency landing at a less controversial location such as the japanese airfield at shimoji island 120 miles east of taiwan the emergency landing for two f a 18 fighters at an air base in taiwan while perhaps unintended does give china a significant signal of u s resolve two days after china used its
