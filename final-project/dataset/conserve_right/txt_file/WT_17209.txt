apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic china s top diplomat said thursday beijing has legitimate national security concerns over the potential deployment of an advanced u s missile shield to south korea in response to growing nuclear provocations from north korea but chinese leaders also respect that it will be up to seoul to make a final decision on the matter chinese foreign minister wang yi made the comments in washington on thursday a day after he and secretary of state john f kerry reached an agreement on a u n security council resolution to expand international sanctions against north korea in response to its recent nuclear test it was unclear whether beijing pyongyang s main economic partner and ally had agreed to cut critical coal and other mineral imports from north korea but the new resolution would significantly tighten international scrutiny of all goods flowing in and out of the so called hermit kingdom top stories oregon becomes first state to offer

federal covid 19 funds the developments follow weeks of behind the scenes pressure on china from obama administration officials who have criticized beijing for failing to pressure north korea s young dictator kim jong un into abandoning his nuclear and military provocations mr wang speaking at the center for strategic and international studies defended china s handling of the situation on thursday but suggested that beijing is engaged in some real soul searching over how to deal with its smaller isolated neighbor the chinese foreign minister s comments on missile defense were a departure from beijing s aggressive resistance to the installation of the u s military s so called terminal high altitude area defense thaad system in south korea noting that the missile shield would extend into parts of china we believe china s legitimate security concerns must be taken into account and a convincing explanation must be provided to china mr wang said while conceding south korea had the right to make its own decisions i don t think it s too much to ask his remarks came a day after south korean officials warned beijing not to try and bully seoul out of accepting the missile system this is a matter we will decide upon according to our own security and national interests jung youn kuk a spokesman for south korean president park geun hye said on wednesday the chinese had better recognize that the talk of thaad has also drawn the ire of russia where officials say it would be an unnecessarily aggressive u s military move in north asia mr kerry has tread carefully on the issue but defended the discussions given the threat from the north we have made it very clear that we are not hungry or anxious or looking for an opportunity to be able to deploy thaad mr kerry said but he quickly added thaad is a purely defensive mechanism it s not an offensive weapon and doesn t have offensive capability chinese state media outlets have carried articles during recent years accusing washington of stoking tensions with north korea purely to create a pretext for expanding america s military footprint in the region some 30 000 u s troops are presently stationed in south korea and roughly 60 percent of the u s navy s active assets deployed in the pacific theater chinese officials have for years warned that a south korean embrace of thaad could damage the growing economic and diplomatic relations between seoul and beijing but on wednesday mr wang suggested chinese leaders may be willing to accept thaad s deployment if washington can clearly convince them the missile shield will not threaten china s own national security south china sea tensions the thaad back and forth has played out this week as mr kerry and mr wang sparred on another front the south china sea and

begin conducting mandatory searches of all cargo passing through their territory to or from north korea to look for goods that might be in violation of the existing u n arms embargo if passed by the security council u s officials said they hope for a vote by saturday the new resolution would close a loophole in the existing sanctions which only require searches of ships where there are suspicions that there was illicit cargo on board there would also be a new ban on the transfer to north korea of any item that could contribute to strengthening the north korean armed forces such as trucks that could be modified for military purposes other proposed measures include a ban on all supplies of aviation and rocket fuel to north korea a requirement for states to expel north korean diplomats
