there are worse weeks to have when announcing a presidential bid a new poll conducted in the sunshine state finds that marco rubio has a slight if statistically insignificant lead over perhaps his biggest rival in the hunt for the 2016 republican presidential nomination jeb bush politico reports rubio garnered 31 percent support from republicans and essentially tied bush s 30 percent according to a mason dixon polling research survey conducted tuesday through thursday and shared exclusively with politico the other likely and announced presidential candidates polled in the single digits and 17 percent were undecided rubio s slight edge is statistically insignificant in part because it falls easily within the margin of error but the poll is instructive nonetheless one of the greatest and most pressing concerns for rubio before taking the plunge i assume was whether or not he could secure enough donors and supporters to lock up his home state a state that he just so happens to share with establishment juggernaut jeb bush if he can t win florida so the argument goes he might as well sit this one out so of course the skeptics urged rubio stay in the senate defer to his mentor and keep quiet presumably because bush is unbeatable in florida and thus launching a presidential campaign undercutting him would inevitably go down in flames ultimately however rubio refused to back down i ve heard some suggest that i should step aside and wait my turn rubio said earlier this week when announcing his presidential bid but i cannot because i believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake and i can make a difference as president he has a compelling message that moves people to open their wallets and their minds too thus as this poll seems to demonstrate perhaps rubio didn t make a mistake after all giving up his senate seat perhaps and this might be news to team bush and everyone else watching the state of florida is very much up for grabs alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist twitter fact checks a pair of president trump s tweets update trump responds townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
