so serious often involving classified materials that affect national security the rules provide for an immediate review of the complaint the complaint against mr trump alleged that he offered a promise to a foreign head of state that was unlawful or threatening to national security the ic inspector general a trump appointee evaluated the complaint interviewed the whistleblower examined documents that the whistleblower provided and concluded that the complaint was urgent and credible the complaint related that mr trump held up the sale of 250 million worth of military equipment and the delivery of 140 million in congressionally mandated foreign aid until the government of ukraine opened a criminal investigation against the son of former vice president joe biden the leading democratic contender to oppose mr trump in the 2020 presidential election can the president of the united states legally ask a foreign government to provide assistance to his reelection in a word no here is the backstory after special counsel robert mueller delivered his report of the relationship between the trump campaign and russian agents to the department of justice and then testified about what he discovered mr trump claimed exoneration mr mueller s report found some evidence of a conspiracy 127 telephone calls and numerous meetings between mr trump s campaign and russian agents but not enough to charge the crime of conspiracy to solicit foreign assistance in a domestic political campaign mr mueller also found 10 instances in which mr trump had committed the criminal offense of obstruction of justice by his personal efforts to derail the mueller investigation mr mueller did not seek an indictment of mr trump for behavior that would have gotten any other person in america indicted because mr mueller knew that his boss attorney general william barr who needed to sign off on such an indictment would not do so mr trump felt exonerated and emboldened at the same time that the country was debating publicly what the mueller report revealed about his behavior the president instructed the treasury department to hold off on the licenses it had provisionally granted to american arms manufacturers to sell a quarter of a billion dollars in arms to ukraine he also instructed the state department to hold off on the delivery of 140 million in direct aid to ukraine that congress told him to deliver also at the same time he began his conversations with his ukrainian counterpart during which he urged a criminal investigation of the younger biden even though mr biden s commercial activities in ukraine while his father was vice president have produced no credible evidence of criminal behavior yet as if to flaunt the mueller findings mr trump apparently personally and directly committed the crime for which he claimed mr mueller exonerated him what was that crime it was the attempt to solicit foreign assistance for his campaign it was the manipulation of american foreign and military policy for a corrupt purpose a corrupt purpose puts the president personally above the needs of the nation in short the whistleblower alleges that mr trump offered a bribe to his ukrainian counterpart go after my likely opponent s son and you will get the 390 million in goods and cash that we are holding up if demonstrable this behavior is far worse than anything alleged or uncovered by mr mueller the acts of obstruction that mr mueller found arguably constitute impeachable offenses that s because the constitutional language of high crimes and misdemeanors as one of the three bases for impeachment has been found by the house of representatives in three different generations to include obstruction yet there is still wiggle room as to how much personal presidential obstruction and underlying criminality is needed to constitute an impeachable offense there is no such wiggle room for bribery the constitution is quite clear that treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors shall constitute a basis for impeachment was mr trump offering to bribe the ukrainian president the circumstantial evidence is yes the transcript of mr trump s critical conversation with the ukrainian president shows he asked his counterpart to coordinate with american authorities to prosecute the son of his likely political opponent in 2020 that is the solicitation of something of value from a foreign government a felony within a week of that conversation mr trump put his hold on the 390 million in aid that s when the ukrainian president got the message where does this leave us we are at the precipice of a constitutional crisis we have a president whose apparent corruption is palpable we have a constitution that prescribes a remedy we have an attorney general who acts as if he were the president s personal lawyer we have republicans in congress who see and hear no evil from this president and we have congressional democrats hesitant to do their constitutional duty we have a mess andrew p napolitano a former judge of the superior court of new jersey is a regular contributor to the washington times he is the author of nine books on the u s con
