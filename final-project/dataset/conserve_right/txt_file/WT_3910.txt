clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots if americans have devoured past live hearings in washington following each dramatic twist and turn many seemed only to nibble and graze on wednesday s proceedings they scanned headlines on their phones read social media posts or clicked on snippets of video pushed out online they planned to catch up with highlights or clips later from a range of sources and were content to let it play in the background the fractured and filtered way the country consumed the testimony and all news may have consequences democrats are hoping to use a series of hearings to tell a complex tale of overseas intrigue involving unfamiliar figures and a distant war there were signs wednesday that many americans were falling back on their partisan allegiances rather than diving into the details i get bits and pieces said bee quarterman a 64 year old census worker in savannah georgia just enough to know what s going on as she walked into a barber shop for a lunchtime haircut she glanced up at the hearing on the tv and said americans should just go to the ballot box to settle whether trump should remain in office house democrats argue trump abused his power when he solicited a political favor from the president of ukraine and held up millions in foreign aid polls show more americans support impeachment than oppose although the partisan divide on the question is striking and consistent in the weeks leading up the hearings in putting two respected and measured u s diplomats on live television wednesday democrats were hoping if not for a national epiphany then at least a day that would stand out from the partisan acrimony and circus like atmosphere of trump era washington i don t want to say it will be the tipping point but i think it will be the beginning of a week or two where it will be very difficult for the president to change the subject said adam cutler a denver technology manager and democrat who arranged to work from home so he could watch the day s events democrats goal is a shift in public opinion that mirrors 1973 when the nationally televised watergate hearings helped sink president richard nixon s approval ratings before his 1974 resignation from office but other recent examples offer democrats less hope special prosecutor robert mueller s testimony about his investigation into interference in

year old farmer and rancher from hitchcock south dakota the ukraine affair was just the washington establishment s latest attempt to thwart an outsider president he is not one of them and they don t like it he said just before the hearings began gatzke caught as much as he could during his morning chores on the farm before he had to load up cattle for the processing plant his wife sheila gatzke watched too and fumed about what she claimed was testimony based on hearsay a defense trump has pushed and his republican defenders on the committee echoed on wednesday christian jacobs 50 sat in a

democrat he had initially balked at impeachment but has come around to it as details trickled out about trump s behavior with ukraine i m so afraid left to his own devices what else he may do jacobs said of trump jim borelli s response to the turmoil and conflict in washington pray the 60 year old attorney in the kansas city suburb of overland park kansas read his bible at a coffee shop part of his daily devotional after listening to part of the hearing wednesday morning one of the daily readings was a verse from the book of wisdom which he found appropriate for today the democrat said noting that it reads in part for those in power a rigorous scrutiny impends i pray that our leaders exercise wisdom in the impeachment process he said he watched part of the hearing with his 95 year old mother but said it s hard to talk about politics with some people in the current environment i think we are in a bad space he said in baton rouge louisiana bryant randall a freshman at louisiana state university didn t like what he saw either but that s because the registered republican found the democrats case unpersuasive all the witnesses who have come forward so far are saying i interpret this as a quid pro quo randall said i don t care how you interpret it i care about what the facts are while democrats control the house and likely have the votes to impeach trump they would need about 20 republican senators to vote to convict him of high crimes and misdemeanors before he would be removed from office that s tempered some democrats hopes of what they can achieve in the impeachment
