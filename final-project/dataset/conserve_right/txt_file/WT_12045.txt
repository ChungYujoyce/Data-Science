chongqing the shallow draft boat which was not designed to withstand as heavy winds as an ocean going vessel can overturned in what chinese weather authorities have called a cyclone with winds up to 80 mph 130 kph the river ships tend to have a lower standard on wind resistance and wave resistance than ocean ships zhong shoudao president of the chongqing boat design institute said at a news conference along with weather and transportation ministry officials under the special circumstance of cyclone the pressure on the one side of the boat went beyond the standard it was designed for resulting in the overturning of the boat the boat had lifejackets and lifeboats but due to the sudden capsizing there was not enough time for people to put on lifejackets or for the signals to be sent

than 180 airlifted from the provincial capital of wuhan and from as far away as guangzhou cctv said rescuers were deciding wednesday whether to cut into the overturned hull an option that would imply hopes still lingered for finding survivors trapped in air pockets or to right the ship by bringing two salvage ships to the stern and bow to act as a vise keeping the craft in place while a crane pulls it back into an upright position transport ministry spokesman xu chengguang said divers would continue to search the ship for as long as possible until all hope is lost and more accurate

were seeing leaving the area with their lights on and sirens blaring local communist party officials and the foreign ministry organized a boat trip for about four dozen journalists to a location about 100 to 200 meters yards from the overturned hull where they were able to see some of the rescue work including two men in orange life vests standing on the overturned hull the disaster has drawn considerable attention in asia and globally and the tour was a way for normally reticent chinese authorities to accommodate foreign media requests for access the rescue and salvage are being staged
