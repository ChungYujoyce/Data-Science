when the president spoke favorably to aides about mr scaramucci as the young italian kid mr scaramucci 55 a wall street hedge fund manager was one of the president s most visible and vocal defenders on tv and mr trump rewarded him with the job of white house communications director in a move that caught some in the west wing by surprise anthony is a person i have great respect for and he will be an important addition to this administration the president said at the time after 11 turbulent days mr scaramucci was forced out a victim of his own theatrics by then white house chief of staff john f kelly along the way he threatened mass firings in the press shop for leaking and drew ridicule for a profanity laced tirade published in a new yorker interview that he said he thought was off the record mr scaramucci remained mostly supportive of the president until a few weeks ago he said the breaking point was what he considers mr trump s racist rhetoric against four female house freshman lawmakers all of whom are minorities white house aides and allies are dismissing his criticisms as self serving and revisionist i think what s motivating scaramucci is that he s trying to rehabilitate his image in new york with his colleagues who have had a big problem with him being pro trump said one republican close to the west wing he is trying to show people way before the 2020 elections that he is a changed man it feels very disingenuous to come after the president after supporting him for so long this republican said mr scaramucci also might have been feeling ostracized socially in liberal new york city he s still playing at a really high level on the social circuit the republican said i m sure no one is sitting at his lunch table right now and he s trying to make some new

president she told sinclair this is all self serving on his part and the media plays right into it it s embarrassing to watch former white house communications director mercedes schlapp said mr

eaten crow over the last two or three years i m in a twitter war with the president of the united states mr scaramucci said on the podcast last week just think about how surreal and ridiculous that is but i have been successful in detaching my emotions from it he said of the president so far he hasn t laid a glove on me in recent days mr scaramucci has been openly speculating that mr trump will abandon his reelection bid early next year if his polling doesn t improve there is a scenario it s less than 5 that the president doesn t run he said on his podcast i m not ruling out voting for president trump i just wish he would stop there s no reason for racist tweets coming from the oval office if he doesn t cut it out i do predict that there is a 5 chance maybe less than that of an intervention where a group of senior leadership in the republican party says ok it s going a bridge too far he recited for his audience some of the harsh criticisms coming at him from white house aides on the podcast his wife urged him to get off social media you re spending way too much time online mrs scaramucci told her husband why are you wasting your life reading these comments from
