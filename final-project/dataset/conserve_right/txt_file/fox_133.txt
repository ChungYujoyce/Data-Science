a rush transcript from fox news sunday april 14 2019 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news anchor i aposm chris wallace president trump threatens to send migrants detained at the border into democratic stronghold is he serious begin videotape president donald trump california certainly is always saying oh we want more people well we aposll give them more people rep nancy pelos d calif that is unworthy of the presidency of the united states and disrespectful of the challenges that we face wallace the talk of shipping detainees to sanctuary cities comes as the president orders a major shakeup at the department of homeland security kirstjen nielsen former dhs secretary dhs has a vast array of missions i want to make sure that we continue to execute them all with excellence through the transition wallace we aposll discuss the crisis at the border and the president aposs response with white house press secretary sarah sanders live only on fox news sunday then waiting for the mueller report attorney general william barr promises to release a redacted version this week and drops a bombshell on capitol hill william barr attorney general i think spying did occur yes i think spying did occur wallace we aposll get reaction from democratic senator ben cardin plus mayor pete buttigieg d south bend indiana this is the way we can begin to win not just an election but an era wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the rise of mayor pete buttigieg and the 2020 democratic field and our power player of the week the daughter of bobby kennedy on the lasting power of his message half a century after his death all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington when the story first broke this week that president trump looked at a plan to ship detained immigrants to sanctuary cities the white house said it was an idea that had been floated and rejected but now the president says he seriously considering it as part of this ongoing battle with democrats over border security all of this as washington braces for the release of the mueller report in a moment we aposll speak with white house press secretary sarah sanders but first kevin corke is tracking the latest developments from the white house kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris sanctuary cities are supposed to offer at least in theory a protected buffer zone for those in this country illegally to prevent them from being deported or arrested by federal authorities but to hear officials at the white house tell it they also may be the ideal place to send thousands of migrants already here as they await further asylum cases to be heard begin videotape hogan gidley white house deputy press secretary we aposre working with dhs we aposre working with ice to try to make sure that happens because after all it aposs what they want they should not say this is retribution politically they should say this is an olive branch corke shortly after that by white house deputy press secretary hogan gidley the president tweeted the usa has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to sanctuary cities from city hall to the halls of congress to the 2020 campaign trail democrats have long argued that the humanitarian crisis at the border demands a nuance humane approach calling the latest white house gambit cynical and accusing the president of using migrants as pawns in a heated political battle pelosi what the president is doing is in my view terribly wrong what we need to do is sit down and have comprehensive immigration reform corke all this in a week that saw leaders from the capital to the white house carefully monitoring the justice department which is expected to release a redacted version of the mueller report aposs findings soon end videotape corke certainly we aposre all looking for that by the way chris the president also won a rare victory from the typically left leaning ninth circuit court of court of appeals in california on friday the court stayed a lower court ruling effectively allowing the administration to send central american asylum seekers back to mexico to wait while their asylum cases can be heard here chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks for that joining us now white house press secretary sarah sanders sarah welcome back to fox news sunday sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary good morning great to be with you chris wallace so let aposs start with the president statement on friday about possibly shipping detainees immigrant detainees to sanctuary cities all over the country here he is begin video clip president donald trump california certainly is always saying oh we want more people and they want more people in their sanctuary cities well we aposll give them more people we can give them a lot we can give them an unlimited supply end video clip wallace is the president serious does he really intend to ship thousands of immigrants all across the country to cities like new york and san francisco and a lot of other places sanders certainly we are looking at all options as long as democrats chris continue to ignore the crisis at the border continue to refuse to sit down with the president and republicans in congress and come up with a solution to stop the national security and humanitarian crisis and the number of illegal immigrants that are flooding across our border then we have to look at all options across the table so that the towns right there on the border aren apost taking on the entire burden and that we aposre shifting some of that burden to places who constantly claim to want to have open borders and want to have an open city so let aposs put some of those people into their communities and into their towns and see if they are ok then with that same impact again the big part of the question and the big thing we have to look at here is how do we stop this from being a problem in the first place we shouldn apost have to be putting people and moving them all across the country to spread that out we should have a border that strong a border that secure a border that functions the way that it aposs supposed to that aposs the president aposs number one priority that aposs what he aposd like to see happened and that aposs what he aposd like democrats to work with him to solve if they continued to be unwilling to do that we aposre certainly looking at all options wallace ok i want to pick up on this specific option though about shipping migrants to sanctuary cities the president tweeted last night that he has the government has quote the absolute legal right to do so but as has been reported this was floated by the white house brought over to dhs and they said repeatedly that it was not legal to do so and also they said counterproductive take a look at some of the objections that dhs raised they said congress has approved no specific money for this purpose ice says it would be an unnecessary operational burden sending them to century cities which don apost cooperate with federal enforcement of immigration laws would make it harder to round them up later and then also it might be an incentive to more illegal immigration i guess the question is how do you overcome all of those problems sanders again nobody thinks this is the ideal solution but until we can fix the crisis at the border we have to look at all options this is one of them whether or not it moves forward that aposs yet to be determined this was raised at a staff level initially and pushed back on the president wants us to export again so that is being done and they aposre doing a complete and thorough review but again the big thing is if democrats including the mayors and members of congress in these communities want these individuals they should be helping the president frankly look for solutions to bring them to their communities instead of fighting that president every step of the way let aposs work together let aposs solve the crisis at the border and let aposs figure out how it doesn apost make a massive impact on any one particular community like were seen in a lot of the border towns all along our southern border wallace one of the questions on immigration i want to move on there is a lot to talk about the new york times reports that last week sanders we like to stay busy wallace yes and you keep us busy and we appreciate that the new york times reports that last week the president told acting dhs chief kevin mcaleenan that he urged him to close the border to migrants and offer to pardon him if necessary the white house says that aposs not the way it went down what did the president say to mcaleenan sanders look the president has addressed this dhs has put out a statement on this topic saying that that is inaccurate reflection the president is a person and a president of law and order that aposs his entire focus that aposs coming in is actually restoring law and order to this country crosstalk sanders real process when it comes to the immigration system wallace i understand that but did he say what i aposm asking what did he say sanders look the president has asked them to do everything they can and everything they are allowed to do under the law to stop the massive crisis we have at our southern border it aposs the same thing he says publicly day in and day out it aposs the same thing he says behind closed doors to staff is figure out how we stop this crisis how we fix this problem let aposs look for every possible option to do so and that aposs what our team has been doing but it would be really nice and much simpler if congress would spend 15 minutes and sit down with the president and let aposs just come up with the best solutions so that we don apost have to do this we don apost have to look for all of these different options it seems so basic wallace i aposm sanders and yet congress refuses to want to spend all of its time up attacking the president investigating the president on these taxpayer funded fishing expeditions that are completely outrageous and completely baseless instead of doing their jobs wallace all right let me ask you a little bit about that and i promise we aposre going to ask democratic senator cardin in the next segment about the democratic plan for immigration attorney general barr sanders they don apost have one their only plan is to fight the president and that aposs it aposs a sad day in american when the mexican government is willing to do more for the united states illegal immigration problem than democrats in congress and i hope you will ask them i hope you aposll ask what their solution is and why they aposre so unwilling to crosstalk wallace well let aposs get finished with this segment so i can get to the next one attorney general barr says that he is going to release a redacted version of the almost 400 page mueller report this week but i want to put up with the president tweeted last night on this subject this is the president why should radical left democrats in congress have the right to retry and examine the 35 million two years in the making no collusion mueller report when the crime committed was by crooked hillary the dnc and dirty cops attorney general barr will make that decision i understand the president says there he aposs leaving it to barr but is he suggesting that congress doesn apost have a right to see the mueller report sanders no that aposs not what he aposs saying the president has been clear he wants transparency throughout the process but the president e is 100 percent right once they get the report and they see what the summary has already laid out that there was no collusion there is no obstruction it is time to move on they don apost get a second chance and trying to reinvestigate the president after two years and millions and millions of taxpayer dollars wasted wallace but sanders on a complete hoax that we all knew was a lie from the very beginning wallace but sarah the sanders it aposs something that democrats used as an excuse for why they lost an election wallace but sarah the report according to barr and that aposs all we know about it was his bottom line conclusions says that according to mueller while the does not find clear evidence that the president committed obstruction it doesn apost exonerate him either and the question is how are you going to deal with some evidence that going to come out in this report that clearly is going to be damaging to the president sanders i don apost think it aposs going to be damaging to the president because the entire purpose of the investigation was whether or not there was collusion mueller was crystal clear in the fact that there was no collusion not just between the president crosstalk wallace but he wasn apost crystal clear on obstruction sanders but any american they couldn apost find anything they couldn apost make a determination which is basically mueller aposs way legally of saying we can apost find anything we aposre going to leave that up to the process which is the attorney general he has made a decision and so we consider this to be case closed that there was no collusion there was no obstruction which i don apost know how you can interpret that any other way than total exoneration wallace all right we aposre sanders i think it aposs absolutely absurd that democrats are going to continue to push this false narrative that there was somehow wrongdoing on behalf of the president he won because he was the better candidate with a better message a better vision and he simply outworked his opponent wallace ok i aposm crosstalk sanders i mean it aposs just absolutely insane that they aposre going to continue to push this wallace ok i aposm trying to ask some questions let aposs do a lighting round because i got three more questions i want to ask you quick question quick answers the justice department has now charged sanders i aposll do my best wallace i aposll do my best too the justice department has now charged julian assange with conspiracy to hack into the defense department computers here aposs what the president said about wikileaks during the campaign and then this week begin video clip trump wikileaks i love wikileaks this wikileaks it aposs like a treasure trove well i love reading those wikileaks i know nothing about wikileaks it aposs not my thing end video clip wallace how can the president say he knows nothing about wikileaks remembering lighting round and does he regard julian assange as a villain or a hero sanders look clearly the president was making a joke during the 2016 campaign certainly we take this serious in fact our administration is the only one that aposs done anything about it let aposs not forget the reason he is being looked at as because of the engagement he had with chelsea manning that individual is the person that the obama administration actually commuted their sentence we aposre the only ones that have taken this whole process seriously and actually doing something to solve the problem wallace ok sanders the president was making a joke during the campaign and was talking about the specifics of the case at that moment wallace was a joke he made over and over again but in any case let me ask you about ilhan omar the president tweeted a video friday of a message that congresswoman ilhan omar made intercutting it with images of 9 11 take a look begin video clip rep ilhan oma d minn some people did something end video clip wallace now that was only the only five seconds we felt comfortable showing you it goes on in a much worse way of her seeming no question about it to minimize 9 11 and then horrible images from 9 11 i guess two questions one it goes on for 43 seconds like that is the president why is the comfortable putting out horrible images like that and secondly does he worry at all about inciting violence against muslims in general or ilhan omar in specific sanders certainly nothing could be further from the truth the president is not trying to incite violence against anybody he aposs actually speaking out against it the question is why isn apost the congresswoman why is she brushing this off dismissively she continues to make anti semitic comments over and over again and democrats refuse to call her out for it if she continues to do it the president will continue to call her out call her out by name and he aposs not going to be ashamed nor should he be the only shame i see in this is that democrats and others aren apost standing up and taking the same wallace ok sanders hard line that the president is that was one of the most horrific moments in american history and for her to talk about it in such a dismissive way is frankly disgusting and abhorrent and i aposm glad the president is calling her out and holding her accountable for it wallace ok final question and we have just blown through all kinds of lightning round rules i aposm not sure you aposre going to be invited back for lightning rounds after this sanders you aposre not asking yes or no crosstalk wallace i know that well i try better this time house democrats have now given the irs nine more days to turn over six years of trump tax returns here aposs what the president said about that this week begin video clip trump while i aposm under audit i would not give my taxes there is no law whatsoever end video clip wallace will the president demand that the irs not turn over his tax returns or will he live this is i think pretty close to yes or no will he live with what whatever the irs decides sanders the president has been clear from the beginning as long as his taxes are under audit he aposs not going to release them he aposs also filled out hundreds of pages and financial disclosures i think crosstalk wallace i know but will he tell the irs not to sanders hold on chris this isn apost crosstalk wallace will he tell the irs not to release them though sanders we aposll have to see what happens on that front but the president has been clear this issue has even been litigated we went through it in 2016 but one of the biggest things that i think people aren apost seeing is the fact that the only reason that the oversight committee has the ability to request someone aposs taxes or for the purpose of determining policy this has nothing to do with whether or not they aposre going to determine policy this is all about political partisanship this is a dangerous dangerous road and frankly chris i don apost think congress particularly not this group of congressmen and women are smart enough to look through the thousands of pages that i would assume that president trumps taxes will be my guess is most of them don apost do their own taxes and i certainly don apost trust them to look through the decades of success that the president has and determine anything he has filled out hundreds of pages in a financial disclosure form wallace have you sanders and i think it aposs a disgusting overreach they are making when they aposre not doing this based on policy it puts every american who has filled out tax reform or tax forms in the past crosstalk wallace this is a yes or no question have you filed have you filed your taxes yet sanders i aposm almost finished i aposm in the process laughter sanders i need ph a couple more days i get them in before it aposs time crosstalk wallace i aposm asking for an extension ok sarah thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sanders you bet thanks chris up next the president and washington brace for the mueller report which attorney general barr says he will release this week we aposll ask democratic senator ben cardin about that and the a g aposs statement the trump campaign was spied on next commercial break wallace more than three weeks after robert mueller handed over his report to the attorney general we should learn more about what is in the almost 400 page document but how much of it will we actually see joining me now from baltimore senator ben cardin the number two democrat on the foreign relations committee senator before we get to the mueller report is the president aposs idea of shipping migrant detainees to sanctuary cities all around the country is that legal and if the president goes ahead with it what will congress to sen ben cardin d md my understanding is it aposs not legal there is no budget for that purpose this is clearly a political move for the president he is using the immigrants as pawns in his political game of chess he aposs not really interested in a solution he aposs more interested in preserving a political issue for the 2020 election wallace you may not like the president aposs possible solution here but i think you have to agree that there aposs a crisis on the border i want to put up numbers in march of 2018 last year 50 000 people were caught crossing the border last month it was more than 103 000 the big spike is in family asylum request in 2018 dhs decided these are bureaucrats and 76 percent of cases that asylum seekers have established credible fear about what would happen to them if they were returned to their countries but when they actually finally saw an immigration judge only 16 percent were actually granted asylum meanwhile there aposs a backlog of 800 000 cases and the waiting list it takes about two years to be heard by a judge so i guess the question really is and sarah sanders brought it up what is the democratic plan i know you talk about border security there clearly is a problem here with people gaming the system on asylum what aposs the democratic plan to stop that cardin what democrats would like to see is let us take up legislation to reform our broken immigration system we can start with the bill to pass the senate a few years ago there have been changes that we have to deal with including the dreamers and tps i mean there were a lot more now about the budget needs of the border let us take up legislation mitch mcconnell the majority leader of the senate has yet to bring a bill to the floor of the united states senate so we can debate this crosstalk wallace sir we know comprehensive immigration reform i mean just as a practical matter is going to go nowhere between now and 2020 why not specific niche changes if you will to deal with this explosion of people seeking asylum cardin chris i aposm going to disagree with you if the president would support comprehensive immigration reform and work with democrats and republicans we have the consensus to pass comprehensive immigration reform but the president doesn apost want that to happen certainly we aposll take up niche issues we have to take up issues i hope that we could get things accomplished but what we need is comprehensive immigration reform and secondly you talk about more people coming to our border we have to deal with the reason why migrants are migrants in the first place and that is don apost cut off the aid to central america let us work to reduce the flow out of countries wallace would you agree that there aposs a problem with an asylum system where three quarters of the people who come in they are given incredible fear excuses or status they aposre able to stay in the country for two years there is an 800 000 backlog and then only 16 percent i guess it is yes 16 percent actually granted asylum do you think there aposs a problem with that cardin i would acknowledge that we have an immigration problem in this country our immigration laws are not what they should be asylum is a very important policy for america and it aposs a global value that we protect people that are in fear of their lives so we need we want to lead on asylum but we need to have an orderly process and because we don apost have an orderly immigration process we find that the asylum laws are not working the way they should wallace all right let aposs get to the mueller report attorney general barr testified before congress this week and he made quite a stir talking about the investigation of the term campaign here he is begin video clip william barr attorney general i think spying on a political campaign is a big deal it aposs a big deal yes i think spying did occur i aposm not saying that improper surveillance occurred i aposm saying that i am concerned about it and looking into it end video clip wallace senator do you agree there should be a full investigation of how the fbi and other intelligence agencies acted in looking into the trump campaign in 2016 and then on into 2017 cardin chris what i think the american people want to see first is the release of the mueller report so that we can draw our own conclusions and do not have to rely on the conclusions of attorney general barr whether it relates to the president aposs involvement what russia did in our election or how the fbi handled the investigation we need to see the full report yes there needs to be reductions as it relates to source information or sensitive information that has nothing to do with the president or these issues but we need to see the report you need to see the report and the american people need to draw their own conclusions so we are getting dribs and drabs from the attorney general as to parts of the report let us take a look at the full report then that aposs a fair question to ask wallace well ok but you aposre going to get the reports apparently unless the attorney general is delayed by tuesday so in the next 48 hours you know a lot of people say there are legitimate questions here about how the whole investigation started into president trump was there bias on the part of fbi agents the fisa warrants all kinds of stuff isn apost that the legitimate issue to be brought up as well cardin you say we aposre going to get the report in 48 hours i aposll wait to see if we get the full report in 48 hours i hope we do we then need to read the report and be able to understand that then i hope it tells us information more than we have today about russia aposs tactics of trying to influence our election so that we can protect ourselves against future attacks from russia tells us exactly how the president and his campaign were involved in this so we can draw our own conclusions and how the investigation was done wallace let me ask you about this let aposs assume and i think it aposs fair to assume that attorney general barr is not lying to the american people he says that according to the mueller report special counsel said he found no collusion by the president with russia and nobody was indicted for that including any of the people around him that a lot of people had talked about and he clearly didn apost find overwhelming evidence or a preponderance of the evidence of obstruction so is that the best use of congress aposs time to continue to argue about something that the special counsel investigated for two years or shouldn apost you be trying to solve the countries problems cardin i think mr mueller was looking at the criminal standard beyond reasonable doubt so let aposs again take a look at the source documents he did say that there was clear evidence in regards to obstruction of justice whether it reached the standard that it could be proved beyond reasonable doubt is an issue that he mr mueller did not draw a conclusion mr barr did draw a conclusion the american people need now to draw a conclusion remember the principal reason for this investigation is that russia attacked our democratic system in the 2016 elections we need to take steps to prevent us prevent this country from being attacked again and compromised by russia this report is going to be very valuable so that we can take the appropriate steps congress passed legislation to deal with this bipartisan legislation i was involved in crafting that legislation i would hope this report would give us additional blueprint of what we need to do to shore up our protections in america but also understand how the trump campaign and mr trump interacted with the russians wallace senator cardin thank you thanks for sharing your weekend with us cardin thank you walace please come back sir cardin thanks chris wallace next up we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss disarray at dhs and the battle over the border plus the rise of mayor pete in the polls and his feud with vice president pence commercial break wallace coming up democrats wrestle with how to respond to president trumps immigration proposal begin video clip president donald trump they aposre always saying they have open arms let aposs see if they have open arms rep nancy pelosi d ca we all know we aposre supposed to secure the border we don apost need any inaudible or tantrums from the president on that score end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel how serious the president is end video clip commercial break begin video clip president donald trump we are giving very strong consideration to having people after a 20 day period because again you aposre not allowed legally to hold them for more than that we will move them into sanctuary cities end video clip wallace president trump confirming reports friday that he is thinking about a controversial plan to ship migrants detained at the border to democratic strongholds across the country and it aposs time now for our sunday group rich lowry of national review neera tanden president of the liberal think tank the center for american progress anna palmer from politico playbook co author of the new book the hill to die on the battle for congress and the future of trumps america and republican pollster kristen soltis anderson rich what do you make of the president aposs moves this last couple of weeks on immigration whether it aposs the idea of shipping immigrants to to sanctuary cities closing the border cleaning house at dhs how much of it is real and how much of his is just showing the his frustration rich lowry national review yes well i think the shipping the idea of shipping these migrants to sanctuary cities is more a rhetorical point than a policy the idea that ice this time is completely overwhelmed by this crisis at the border and is underfunded to begin with is going to undertake this major logistical operation on top of what it aposs doing now to get these migrants to the sanctuary cities is just implausible but it all goes to just how the president is infuriated by the situation at the border and he should be our rules are completely insane if you are family units from central america and you come here we basically waive you in and we aposre seeing a situation where over the course of the next year 1 percent of the population of guatemala and honduras could come to this this country and be admitted and that aposs crazy the president desperately wants to do something to stop it but he can apost without congress acting wallace anna there there may be at least in these specific moves we aposre talking about more politics and policy in terms of what the president aposs discussing but to the degree that border security does become an issue in the 2020 campaign don apost the democrats have the same problem with immigration that republicans have with health care which is they just don apost have a plan anna palmer politico i think it aposs a problem for them clearly they aposre going to blame the president and the president always says i want to work with democrats on this but everything he aposs doing right now does not portend for anything to happen before the 2020 election for democrats they aposre going to have to say how are they going to stop this i mean this is not something if you aposre a 2020 candidate you have to have a policy that is going to stop this crisis wallace but you just heard senator cardin he aposs not a presidential candidate but he aposs one of the leaders of the democrats in the senate i mean he aposs talking about comprehensive immigration reform the rubio plan in 2013 they aposre i mean they you aposve got a specific problem now particularly with asylum democrats don apost have an answer for that palmer i think you aposre going to see democrats try to pivot a lot on this right you and i in my time covering this i have never seen republicans and democrats further away from any kind of a deal small or large on immigration wallace let aposs turn to the democratic presidential race and what i would argue is the most surprising development so far very early in the race and that is the rise of mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana take a look at some polls they came out this week two new polls in new hampshire buttigieg is now in third place behind biden and bernie but ahead of warren and harris and beto and in iowa buttigieg in also in third place and interestingly he aposs now making an issue of his faith begin video clip pete buttigieg d 2020 presidential candidate my marriage to chastain has made me a better man and yes mr vice president it has moved me closer to god end video clip wallace kristen what aposs going on here kristen soltis anderson echelon insights i think mayor pete is doing something very interesting which is recognizing that there is a large slice in the democratic party and the democratic primary electorate that does not look like what say democrats on twitter want what people think of the democratic base as wanting he aposs trying to bridge this gap between sort of electability and saying things that i think get democratic voters excited by reaching out to democrats who are people of faith democrats who do come from sort of the middle america small towns like south bend and i think what you aposre going to see is this democratic primary being defined by viral moments which is something mayor pete has shown he aposs very good at having these moments where he sort of says something that catches everybody aposs attention that sounds a little different than what you aposre normally expecting these are the moments that are going to let these democratic candidates fund raise very well and help them have these boomlets ph in the polls wallace neera a couple of questions i aposll start with this one first how seriously should democrats all of us looking yes i know it aposs crazy crazy early in the race should at the boomlet for mayor pete how seriously should we take it neera tanden center for american progress i think he aposs a serious candidate and he aposs announcing today i think you were right that actually democrats are looking for a unifying message they think that donald trump is a pretty divisive figure and is are looking for candidates who can have a unifying message that actually does reach out to all parts of the party but even perhaps some moderate voters and that aposs been a selling point for mayor pete it aposs also a selling point for the vice president beto o aposrourke and others so i think he aposs a he aposs a very serious candidate and the fact that he aposs willing to defend progressives on issues like faith is something that really is more it aposs something that democrats are looking for wallace you you talk about biden how reassured should biden be that after all of this talk for a week or two about his inappropriate invading women aposs space that he aposs still the frontrunner tanden well i think that speaks to how much democrats are looking at electability and the vice president still is very strong in polls against donald trump and there is a well of support for the vice president he aposs he was you know obviously worked for president obama and people feel very fondly within the party about the last democratic president so i think as a as a nominee or as a candidates he aposs going to actually have to talk about these things more and be on the stump and really get with reporters but i do think democrats feel pretty positively about him wallace rich what do you make of this field lowry well i think the rise of mayor pete is just one of what will be many surprises this will be a completely wild ride and we aposre just at the beginning of it but i think what mayor pete aposs trying to do is what obama did circa 2008 talk about his faith be a progressive but do all you can not to be threatening to the other side while you light up the base with your youth and with your narrative and he aposs had some really success with that wallace you know it aposs interesting kristen because on the one hand when he was well he still is the mayor but when mike pence was the governor they seemed to get along pretty well and now mayor pete is kind of picking a fight with him which incidentally the vice president keep say no we got along just fine obviously on the issue of of gay rights it seems to be working in terms of elevating his standing and his cred inside the democratic field anderson well and i think it aposs interesting to contrast the way mayor pete has sort of handled his relationship with pence versus the way former vice president joe biden who sort of got chastised by the democratic base for saying i find vice president pence to be a good guy we may disagree on the issue he kind of had to walk that back in response to backlash from the democratic base i do think that even someone who may be kind of indiana nice like mayor pete is will find that there are limits to what the democratic voters are willing to accept in terms of olive branches to the other side wallace and briefly anna what about the argument i think some people make that when it comes to joe biden this is his high point palmer i think that he aposs going to have a big issue i think he aposs probably the most popular before he enters into the race he aposs clearly shown an inability to punch back in this environment where it aposs just twitter which is fast everybody aposs wondering where is he why is he not out there more is he going to run or isn apost he wallace and you also had the sort of ham handed thing where he made speeches and joked about well i got permission to to be touched that didn apost go over very well palmer no i mean this is not a laughing matter and clearly you know he wanted to kind of sidestep it i do think one of the interesting thing is he went on twitter he can punched back against the president and that is why i do think he is so strong in the polls wallace all right panel we need to take a break here when we come back what to look for in the mueller report when its finally released this week plus what would you like to ask the panel about the effort to bring julian assange to the u s to face charges just go to facebook for twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip president donald trump this was an attempted takedown of a president and we beat them what they did was treason what they did was terrible what they did was against our constitution and everything we stand for end video clip wallace president trump doubling down on attorney general barr aposs suggestion this week the fbi and intelligence agencies spied on his campaign and we aposre back now with the panel anna democrats are going to obviously make as much as they can of whatever damaging information is in the mueller report once they finally get their hands on it we assume in the next couple of days and they aposre going to fight over the reductions anything that aposs been left out and even the underlying evidence which wouldn apost be in the report but given the fact that apparently the special counsel did not find hard evidence any evidence of collusion and didn apost find criminal evidence of obstruction how much can democrats really do with this report palmer i think there is a fear of overreach when you talk to democratic operatives and some of the staff that you aposre going to have a lot of members who are going to want to hit on this and go for the next several weeks to try to continue to press on this because that is where they aposve been wanting to see this mueller report there was all this anticipation that there was going to be some big bombshell that clearly didn apost happen so i do think there is a little bit of concern that they are going to try to overreach on this issue but i would expect them people on capitol hill members of congress to hit on this for the next several weeks wallace kristen fox news i kind of love this did a poll but just before the mueller report was handed over from mueller to barr and 70 percent of those surveyed said it didn apost make it made little or no difference what was actually in the report their minds were already made up so given that how big a deal do you expect the mueller report to be anderson i think very little still ph i think you aposre going to see very little movement in the polls because this is a political inkblot test if you are a supporter of the president you will say look there aposs no inclusion no obstruction if you oppose the president you will see collusion and obstruction hidden between the lines throughout the report or behind many of the reductions which are certainly going to be the political flashpoint but for those voters in the middle this is something that i think at this point they wish we would move on from and that aposs why the democrats who were the majority makers in the midterms who won those races that were hard fought and are the reason why nancy pelosi is speaker they ran on things like health care they ran on pocketbook issues and sort of sidestep this issue altogether i don apost think this is the type of issue that moves swing voters and i aposm very skeptical that barring some major bombshell this report will have any change in the president aposs poll numbers or the overall political environment wallace i want to turn to the arrest this week of julian assange back in 2010 when wikileaks published hundreds of thousands of sensitive classified documents some of which endangered people aposs lives conservatives generally condemned him no longer take a look begin video clip mollie hemingway the federalist we defend media the rights of people to publish for good reason it is a first amendment freedom andrew napolitano fox news judicial analyst this is a case about free speech this is a case about punishing journalists in this case a journalist who revealed information devastating to what the united states had been saying and lying about end video clip wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of julian assange we got this on facebook from carmen holmes why is julian assange wikileaks being targeted for exposing the truth neera how do you answer carmen and is assange a hero or a villain tanden i think of him as more of a villain but i would say that what happened here is he aposs being prosecuted not for publishing but for actually taking part in a hack the stolen actually trying to steal materials himself that does not actually there aposs no protections for journalists in actually doing crimes publication is a separate issue i do think for this people who cite the barr report the barr report itself said that essentially the russians did hack into the dnc and into the clinton campaign and therefore assange was at least a witting or unwitting agent of that and ultimately what this whole issue is about is whether russia undermined our democracy and it aposs not whether assange was part of that but he that is not what he is that makes his actions bad or good but what he aposs actually being prosecuted for is stealing wallace rich are you surprised that so many of your fellow conservatives at least these days and a lot of them were condemning him back in 2010 but these days are defending embracing julian assange lowry yes and i think it aposs wrong look i thought he was an anti american sleaze when he was publishing u s secrets i thought he was anti americans sleaze when he was publishing democratic e mails during the 2016 campaign and yes if you aposre being prosecuted for publishing this information there would be real first amendment issues as neera points out he aposs this charge has to do with participating in the act or attempting to participate in the act of theft wallace well i aposm a i aposm a little surprised by it too and i guess my question is how do you explain it lowry partisanship basically it was really helpful to have those e mails out in 2016 i don apost think they swayed the election but they certainly weren apost created bad news cycles for hillary clinton in for a lot of conservatives unfortunately that was enough and it aposs also just to this guy aposs low and disreputable character it aposs worth remembering the reason why he ended up holed up for seven years in an ecuadorian embassy in the first place was not that he was fleeing the united states government he was fleeing a sexual assault charge in sweden wallace you were shaking your head anderson well i think he rich is right that i mean back in 2010 the polls showed about three quarters of republican saying that they viewed what julian assange was doing was wrong and there has been i think whether it comes to julian assange or you saw this in the polls actually with jim comey where for a moment in time democrats thought he was public enemy number one and republicans liked him and then after trump fired him it flipped i think partisanship is a big driver here and i think we shouldn apost forget that julian assange aposs number one goal was not to provide information to the people but i think to sort of disrupt western government aposs ability to protect themselves lowry it aposs also worth noting you know this whole conspiracy that the trump administration is beholden to russia obama didn apost the obama administration didn apost indict julian assange the trump administration indicted this guy who was a cutout for russia during the campaign wallace anna palmer yes i mean i think what aposs really interesting here is the defense that they aposre trying to use that he aposs a journalist but clearly i aposm a reporter and i aposm not trying to hack into government you know to get secret documents so he went a step further than any of us and the other thing i think is very interesting how they are prosecuting him or how they are trying to charge him is very narrow but what we aposve heard from members of congress is they want to hear what he has to what he knows about russia what get him to the u s and he may have a lot more information that we don apost know yet wallace you know go ahead palmer we i would just say that i do think it aposs important this what you were just saying is is a really important point and also you just have to recognize that there aposs lots of information we don apost have and that is one of the reasons why the mueller report should be public and something that this entire issue the entire mueller report investigation was about what happened with russia and our elections and i think if the public wallace well but wait wait it wasn apost just about that it was also a lot about donald trump his involvement palmer absolutely what inaudible wallace and the fact that they spent two years and they didn apost find collusion palmer right ok but the issue is not you said evidence of obstruction we do not know what evidence there was for obstruction or not they seems to be the wallace i understand on collusion though it seems pretty clear that they didn apost find collusion palmer right but there could be additional evidence that happened and again that aposs a criminal question and i think that ultimately the public has to understand what happened here what happened with the russia investigation lowry the mueller report is going to be released palme inaudible lowry the attorney general is combing through it with mueller and then is going to release it wallace all right and you know what fox news is going to be all over it when that happens thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week we talk with robert kennedy aposs oldest child about how his words still resonate in today aposs political climate commercial break wallace political speeches used to be inspiring soaring rhetoric and calls to meet great challenges well if you think our national discourse has gotten uglier in recent years on all sides you aposre not alone here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape kathleen kennedy townsend daughter of robert f kennedy if you aposre an american you get involved you act you make a difference you don apost stand on the sidelines wallace voice over kathleen kennedy townsend on her father aposs message in his final

very much that aposs sweet of you to say language can lift us up and i think right now is a time that we do need our language lifted up wallace voice over townsend was talking about her father this week and the relevance of a collection of his most famous speeches called rfk his words for our times kennedy martin luther king was shot and was killed tonight in memphis inaudible wallace speeches like the one he made april 4 1968 and indianapolis despite warnings from local police kennedy and what ph dedicate ourselves to what the greeks wrote so many years ago to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the light of this world townsend here is a man who came from privilege who quotes the greeks in an inner city and calms the crowd and in a sense speaks to the better angels of people aposs nature and succeeds wallace or a speech he made at the university of mississippi in 1966 hostile territory for the former attorney general who led the fight for civil rights kennedy it is far easier to accept and to stand on the path than to fight for the answers of the future townsend he was the devil too many people of the university of mississippi and it just taught him that if you are honest if you go to where it aposs difficult you can win over hearts and minds being in washington is just so filled with memories wallace townsend was the oldest of robert kennedy aposs 11 children she remembers how he always pushed himself townsend my bedroom was next his bathroom and every morning i would hear him do his sit ups while he listened to shakespeare so that he could have the language to speak to the deepest issues in our in our american spirit wallace she was 16 when her father was assassinated wallace on camera do you feel at all cheated that you didn apost have all the years with him you should have had townsend we were always talked about martyrs we talked about sacrifice it aposs hard to grow up in our family without the idea that life is filled with sacrifice wallace voice over townsend hesitates to speculate what her dad would think of our current politics but she has no doubts on one subject wallace on camera what do you think your father would say made of donald trump townsend he would be hurt by the pain that donald trump has caused so many people and the glee it seems that he takes in causing other people such pain wallace voice over one more reason she says to keep her father aposs message alive townsend the idea that we aposre a generous people that we aposre a compassionate people that we have a goodness in us and that we need leaders that appeal to the good part of us end videotape wallace kathleen kenned
