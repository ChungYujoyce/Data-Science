apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump s trademark campaign rallies have evolved into a kind of fine art and a very effective art at that they are frequent mr trump has back to back rallies coming up in phoenix colorado springs las vegas and charlotte north carolina and they will likely continue beyond campaign season we ll keep the rallies going if we win mr trump told a recent economic summit in north carolina the crowd responded by chanting four more years and why shouldn t the events continue these rallies are authentic effective emotional dynamic and have become refreshingly joyous top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens a jubilant crowd was hooting and hollering holy hell the most tangible feeling was of brotherhood writes david marcus a columnist for the federalist who attend a recent trump rally in new hampshire trump supporters catch a lot of hate whether being mocked as deplorable or dismissed as uneducated rubes there is always something or other wrong with them according to democrats and the news media they know it and in each other s company a weird fellowship forms of half college football game half family reunion he says recalling the big moment when the president made his entrance upon entering the cheering was so loud trump could barely begin his speech they could have drowned out a megadeth concert it sounded more like a national convention than a new hampshire campaign rally mr marcus says he noted that mr trump himself actually took it easy on such foes as house speaker nancy pelosi and sen mitt romney the sole republican who voted in favor of an impeachment article the president still has a close read on his audience and the art of the rally as well the rhetoric was restrained and perhaps trump realizes that this time he can t run against washington but must run on his record as far as this crowd was concerned that record is more than enough mr marcus observes hillary on the horizon inquiring minds now wonder if former secretary of state hillary clinton will step up to the white house plate for a third try this time as running mate of democratic presidential hopeful michael r bloomberg bloomberg needs immediate help to win the nomination with march a make or break month clinton as the world knows is desperate to get revenge on donald trump and will almost certainly seize another chance at the white house even if it means being relegated to standby equipment while bernie sanders and his committed clan will be loud exceptions enough democrats i believe will support a bloomberg clinton ticket as the best chance to defeat trump writes new york post columnist michael goodwin if all that comes to pass the general election would be a combustible clash that will make the 2016 election look like a walk in the park it won t exactly be a trump clinton rematch but close enough that the faint of heart should start searching for safe and quiet refuge mr goodwin observes noting that there s a big role for former president barack obama to play obama too would love nothing more than to help end trump s presidency if the clinton proposal comes to fruition and gives bloomberg an instant boost expect obama to move quickly to help secure the nomination the columnist says small business a staunch trump ally main street and small business still stand by president trump six out of 10 small business owners approve of the job mr trump is doing while 52 say that their business would be better off if mr trump was reelected according to a new gallup poll of small business owners in all 50

the u s and this constituency is an important one for any presidential candidate to win over most small business owners indicate they have benefited from trump s 2017 tax law and report that their

the sequel so are certain democrats really going to try to impeach president trump again the news media would be ecstatic i know they are obsessed with continuing investigations of this president it s not out of the realm of possibility rep ben cline tells the daily signal a publication of the heritage foundation the virginia republican was a witness to the impeachment hearings as a member of the house judiciary committee but because the democrats essentially took their best shot and fell short and now we are seeing exactly the bounce this president has gotten in polls and the momentum he has gained from being acquitted i think they may have learned trying and failing doesn t get them where they want to be says mr cline nothing would stand in the way of house democrats impeaching mr trump again but they likely would face political consequences notes hans von spakovsky a senior legal fellow at heritage there is nothing constitutionally that would prevent the house from undertaking a second impeachment investigation but i believe it would be an abuse of power and misuse of the impeachment power mr von spakovsky tells publication poll du jour 32 of small business owners say taxes are the greatest challenge to their business operation 21 say government regulators are the greatest challenge 20 say health care costs are the greatest challenge 15 cite u s trade tariffs 7 cite
