apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap china s move to scrap term limits and allow xi jinping to serve as president indefinitely puts him on track to deal with some of the country s weightiest long term sovereignty challenges especially the fates of hong kong and taiwan the question is will xi bet big on bold moves that could result in potentially disastrous consequences hong

presidential term limits opening the door for xi to rule for as long as he wants hong kong activists had already been set on edge by the disqualification of pro democracy lawmakers from the city s legislative council and the apparent abduction by chinese security forces of several men who published salacious tomes about china s leadership still hong kong remains one of the world s freest economies and a window to the outside for the chinese financial system which operates under much tighter restrictions the cosmopolitan city of 6 million with its vibrant tourism arts and education sectors also remains a beacon to many aspiring chinese i don t think bold action is necessary with respect to hong kong said michael mazza of the american enterprise institute think tank in washington d c xi is already well along in the process of turning hong kong into just another chinese city he said self governing taiwan however is quite a different story posing a direct challenge to the communist party s claim as the representative of all chinese and guardian of chinese sovereignty independence and territorial integrity since splitting from the mainland amid civil war in 1949 the former japanese colony has evolved into a wealthy vibrant democracy whose 23 million people take an increasingly dim view of any form of political integration with beijing by casting himself as a
