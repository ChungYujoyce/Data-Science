apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic impeaching president trump it is the favorite dream of many democrats particularly house judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler who is already making plans for a formal inquiry into the matter the majority of americans do not have the belly for it plain and simple the notion that the nation would rejoice over impeachment proceedings against mr trump is fantasy plain and simple the majority of the public consistently opposes the idea and multiple polls have confirmed this trend in the last six months and here comes another one a monmouth university poll finds that 6 out of 10 voters condemn impeachment while 52 say even the aforementioned house inquiry is a bad idea among those who say an impeachment inquiry is a bad idea the top reasons include feeling that trump has done nothing wrong 27 it would be a waste of time and money 22 the inquiry would be a partisan witch hunt 13 trump has done a good job as president 12 and congress should be working on other issues 10 the poll analysis says top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time others say the inquiry is a waste of resources will ultimately backfire against democrats and that it is too late in mr trump s term of office to start the process some also felt there was no point in impeachment because the senate would not vote to remove the president donald trump is not a popular president by most measures but the appetite for impeachment remains low notes patrick murray director of the independent monmouth university polling institute more voters say a failed impeachment process would help mr trump than harm him about a third believe that a formal impeachment process without a conviction will put mr trump in a stronger position to be reelected next year another 23 say it will put him in weaker position while 36 say it will have no significant impact on his reelection there could also be some unexpected collateral damage however the survey reveals that 34 of voters say an impeachment process without conviction will put the democrats in a weaker position come 2020 27 say it will strengthen their standing while 31 say it will have no significant impact either way more numbers in the poll du jour at column s end obama real estate former president barack obama and former first lady michelle obama are in the process of buying a mega

charade some of the democratic presidential hopefuls may rue their own rhetoric serious question have any of the 2020 democrats actually read their health care plan sen kamala harris proudly declared she wanted to eliminate all private insurance sen bernie sanders is literally selling stickers that say i wrote the damn bill but now it seems they ve just gotten around to reading it says michael ahrens communications director for the republican national committee he reports that mr sanders recently informed an iowa worker that his bill would allow unions to negotiate health care benefits uh oh the washington post then described this moment as mr sanders acknowledgment of a role for private coverage noting that the democratic socialist s campaign has railed against others for not taking a hard enough stance against such plans yes well mr ahrens also notes that mr sanders mocked ms harris for changing her position on a government takeover of health care for the third time the bottom line at this point sanders and harris should launch the international brotherhood of health care flip floppers union did they not know it eliminates all private plans did they not know it will more than double our taxes the american people will see through this blatant charade mr ahrens advises since mr sanders has just released his own version of the green new deal the gop will have a brand new set of claims to investigate make no mistake about it the climate crisis that we face today is similar to the enormous challenges faced by president franklin delano roosevelt in 1941 when the united states was attacked at pearl harbor mr sanders advises in his rationale which also guarantees that his plan will create 20 million new jobs we already know this yes we already know this but we might
