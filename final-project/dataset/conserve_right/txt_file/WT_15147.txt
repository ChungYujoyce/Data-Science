of its military forces the commander of one of japan s four aegis equipped missile defense ships said in an interview north korea presents a real threat and it has been hostile in its behavior and its words said capt yasuhiro sato of the japan maritime self defense forces capt sato is commanding officer of the js kirishima one of four kongo class destroyers armed with the u s made aegis battle

mainland top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time on april 4 2009 north korea launched a long range rocket that put a satellite into orbit the booster rocket passed over japan if the launch had failed the rocket could have fallen on to parts of the densely populated japanese archipelago so that s one of the real threats that we are feeling he said the captain declined to comment on the kirishima s role in operations to monitor and track north korean long range missile tests noting that details are classified in addition to its long range taepodong missile north korea has some 200 nodong ballistic missiles with the range to strike most of japan north korea fired seven surface to air missiles on friday in response to recent ongoing u s and south korean joint military exercises the kirishima and other missile defense ships closely monitor north korea for missile launch preparations and share data with the japanese air force which operates an alert system capable of sending cellphone text messages to warn citizens of missile firings on the threat from china which has territorial disputes with tokyo and a large number of missiles that could ravage u s military bases in japan capt sato was more cautious i recognize that china is a rising power based on its developing economy and growing military budget he said so we have china in sight we hope we can keep a good relationship by abiding by international rules but we are aware that there are disputes between our nations so our mission is to protect our land and citizens and to abide by international rules and we hope our neighbor would do the same he said a u s congressional china commission has reported that in the event of a conflict in asia chinese missiles can attack and shut down five of the six american military bases in the region including those in japan china is opposing u s led efforts to develop regional missile defenses beijing is pressing south korea s government not to deploy the highly effective terminal high altitude area defense that was requested by the commander of u s forces in korea gen curtis scaparrotti upgrading as part of a military buildup to counter china japan is adding two additional missile defense destroyers to its fleet and plans to buy the patriot pac 3 missile segment enhancement mse that includes a significant upgrade to the system s radar we also are planning to enhance the automatic surveillance systems fixed radar systems and enhancing ballistic missile countermeasure capabilities with u s japan joint development of the anti ballistic missile capabilities known as sm 3 block 2a said japanese vice defense minister kenji harada the block 2a variant will be deployable on land as well as on aegis ships and is considered one of the most effective and lethal missile defense interceptors it will have a larger rocket motor and larger warhead allowing it to defend larger areas the missile will be deployed in 2018 another enhancement for japan s missile defenses is an effort to maintain a heightened state of readiness in response to missile attacks harada said the higher alert status requires more resources to maintain japan s four aegis missile defense destroyers currently are the backbone of japan wide missile defenses other defenses include land based pac 3 missile defenses deployed near tokyo which can be integrated with the aegis defenses we use this multilayered system to protect important targets depending on specific situations and circumstances capt sato said they could be islands cities bases it depends on the nature of attack asked whether most japanese are aware of the current missile threats capt sato said i can t speak for ordinary citizens but we for sure as members in charge of protecting the country are well aware of the dangers missile defenses have a high priority for japan s navy along with other defense missions such as counterpiracy and ocean surveillance capt sato discussed his warship and crew at the funakoshi naval base near yakouska japan the kirishima is currently undergoing maintenance in nearby yokohama like most operational commanders the captain said he needs more of two things money for training as well as intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance data or isr the key enabler of modern joint war fighting additionally capt sato wants to see new legislation that will assist japan s forces in operating more smoothly the captain said asked which is the most pressing need he replied all of the above the highly complex mission of missile defense requires more training reaction time to a missile launch requires rapid target identification and the passing of electronic data prior to launching an interceptor a process that demands constant training north korea is improving its missile systems with more accurate warheads capt sato said so we do need to improve our capabilities and posture against the threats regional cooperation is crucial for missile defense and the captain said he hopes the united states and south korea will work even more closely in dealing with regional missile threats especially in the isr area in a related development shotaro yachi
