in fundraising an effort to create a taxing democratic battle that could help tillis stay in office the leading candidates are ex state legislator cal cunningham an iraq war veteran who ran unsuccessfully for u s senate 10 years ago and current state sen erica smith democrat ella nelson 65 who attended a black history month parade in durham where cunningham and smith appeared said she was undecided on a choice but focused on finding someone who can beat tillis it s about replacing those that are not working for the people nelson said cunningham has the endorsement of the democratic
