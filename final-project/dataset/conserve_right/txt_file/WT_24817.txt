tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion hindsight is 20 20 but when you are the commander in chief you can t afford to be wrong when it comes to iran george w bush was very wrong and barack obama was very complicit and now it s left to president trump to clean up the mess i refer in particular to the way tehran used both mr bush and mr obama albeit in different ways to promote its own interests in the middle east and put its troops on israel s doorstep all to fulfill a long held dream of eradicating the jewish state from the map although it can seem like ancient history we re living with the consequences to this day mr bush was told that iran was the major threat in the region not iraq s saddam hussein he was told that if he invaded iran the mullahs would make life hell for american troops he was told that iran wanted to take control of iraq i know i ve talked to the people who told him top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick you see over the prior decade a massive rebel army had been building on iran s northwestern border with iraq safely housed inside iraqi territory these weren t iraqis they were patriotic iranian exiles who called themselves the people s mujahadeen of iran also known as the mek the mek s national liberation army of iran at its height before the iraq war boasted 10 000 battle hardened and 300 armored vehicles on a previous excursion into iranian territory it had traveled over 60 miles into the islamic republic captured thousands of iranian soldiers scores of armored vehicles and inflicted 55 000 casualties for two decades the mek had been an existential threat to the mullahs murderous regime so much so that iran s government executed over 120 000 of its members and demonized as a terrorist organization in the western media and the iranian regime s campaign to eliminate what it saw as a mortal threat was not over as tensions between washington and baghdad soared enter ahmad chalabi the iraqi politician who was in bed with iranian intelligence services and fed mr bush false information about saddam having weapons of mass destruction don t believe me just google it scott ritter the american weapons inspector said mr chalabi boasted openly of his intelligence sources in iran and even offered to set up a meeting with the head of iran s intelligence service when the u s led coalition invaded iraq in 2003 officials publicly stated that the mek compounds in eastern iraq were bombed as a favor to the mullahs the mek never fired a shot in anger at american forces even as the 500 lb bombs rained down on their bases when u s commander gen ray odierno approached their main camp to force a surrender mek leaders served his staff dinner and they parted as friends but mr bush in a catastrophic misjudgment disarmed the mek apparently in the misguided hope that moderates in tehran might make a deal and stop exporting terror the last best chance to challenge the tyrants in tehran was thrown away the upshot with the mek out of the way iran proceeded to produce endless mischief in iraq aiding anti u s insurgent groups and directly and indirectly harassing and bombing u s forces when president obama in 2009 pulled u s combat troops out of iraq iranian troops and iran backed militias flooded into the resulting power vacuum in iraq and syria reaching all the way to israeli border along the golan heights after american troops left the now defenseless mek supporters were left to the mercy of iraqi special forces and missile attacks pushed on by iran president trump in so many ways is right the iraq war was one of the greatest foreign policy disasters in american history the bush administration knew better but was blinded by arrogance the obama administration s approach was marked by equal parts naivete and duplicity the results are on full display today with mr trump left to clean up the mess iran now has its coveted shia land bridge to supply allies and proxies from tehran to damascus we finally have a president who correctly diagnosed the problem let s hope he has he fortitude to supply the remedy l todd wood is a former special operations helicopter pilot and wall street debt trader and has contributed to fox business the moscow times national review the new york post and many other publications he can be reached through his website ltod
