of the shooting arguing that it incites violence and spurs racial divisions several have gone so far as to call him a white supremacist sen cory a booker of new jersey said it s not enough to just not engage in racist behavior but individuals and the government have a duty to actively push back on violence inciting racism we have somebody who is actually adding to it who is contributing to this kind of divisiveness and these kind of dark forces in our nation through his own rhetoric through the way he talks about americans through the bigotry that passes through his lips that incites white supremacists to literally use his language in their chat rooms to further activate this kind of hate he said of mr trump the president has brushed off the criticism from democrats saying they were desperate to tie him to racial divisions in order to score political points i think it shows how desperate the democrats are mr trump told reporters i am not any of those things for them to throw out the racist word racist racist racist they call anybody a racist when they run out of cards i m winning in the polls they re desperate mr scalise said that instead of trying to point blame across the aisle lawmakers should focus on shoring up background check systems to ensure that people who are mentally unfit to have a gun fall through the cracks he argued that background check legislation

announced he s interested in expanding background checks but was unclear what congress will be able to pass out of both chambers sen lindsey graham announced a bipartisan deal earlier this week to pass red flag laws that push states to let law enforcement confiscate guns from those reported as a potential threat democrats however want to go further and are planning to push for other proposals like an assault weapons ban while republicans have hesitated to support gun control bills they see as violating the second amendment presidential counselor kellyanne conway insisted on fox news sunday that the differences are all reconcilable the president has been actively talking to republicans and democrats on the matter of background checks and just being able to have meaningful measurable reforms that don t confiscate law abiding citizens firearms without due process but at the same time keep those firearms out of people who have a propensity towards violence she said dave boye
