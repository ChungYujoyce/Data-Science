vulnerable on welfare changes and the president attacks romney s private sector record with an eye on ohio join the live chat and we apos re now starting to get in the campaign swing and i tell people this campaign apos s still about hope if somebody asks me it apos s still about change president obama in an interview with cbs news with the news cycles turning more slowly these days and the election drawing near the political world has devoted itself utterly to soon to be republican nominee mitt romney s business background and wealth after months of good luck and a breeze at his back romney is now facing the withering attacks of the president the press and even some of his fellow republicans this is the hinge moment in president obama s long war of attrition against romney obama has already spent 100 million on television advertisements most of them heavy handed attacks on romney s character his campaign is standing by an accusation that romney could be a criminal because of securities regulatory filings a decade ago and the repeated demands that romney divulge his tax records dating back to the clinton years are drawing out more and more criticism of the quarter billionaire former ceo but having gone so far over the top with the attacks so early and so often obama had darned well better destroy romney right now or the president can kiss re election goodbye given the state of the economy his own unpopularity the unpopularity of his key policy provisions and a strictly small ball approach to a second term agenda obama needs to wipe romney out now because if the republican makes it out of mid summer alive the president will have a very unhappy fall obama is hoping that by oct 3 when the two men meet for their first of three debates romney will be a toxic asset for republicans that romney s success as a businessman prior to becoming an olympic organizer for the 2002 salt lake city games and his term as massachusetts governor will be considered a negative attribute but unlike the similar effort against sen john kerry and his military service in 2004 these attacks aimed at turning a positive into a negative have come directly from the president and his campaign the failure of democrats to embrace outside groups and political action committees despite the president s urging has left obama holding the flamethrower democrats say that obama will make a pivot to positivism and progress by the time he arrives on stage at bank of america stadium in charlotte in september and will close on an uplifting note for the nation but right now despite lackluster fundraising obama still retains a cash advantage because he faced no primary opposition he has the bully pulpit of the presidency and romney is still scrambling to build an effective organization though it risks his brand and drives up negative views of the once very popular president obama must believe that not only does he have no choice but to be his own swift boat veterans for truth but also that he has time to recover but that depends on obama being successful in killing romney s chances now having started on a negative note and stayed there for four months would obama really be able to shift back to happy talk not likely romney s greatest vulnerability right now is on his taxes the business about in which year romney ceded effective control of his former firm is chicken feed romney is now in a box on his taxes he says he will eventually meet the standard set by john mccain in 2008 and release two years worth obama who had released eight years worth when he ran that year says not good enough it s puzzling that romney didn t dump more documents back in february when he was pushed to offer up a years worth plus an estimate for his 2011 tax bill it s also puzzling that having faced identical attacks from all of the not romneys in the primaries he was not better prepared to rebut the attacks from obama the press may eventually lose interest with the story but romney will get another round of coverage about his wealth and how he protects it from the irs when he eventually comes out with his tax bill doing that closer to the election seems worse not better wrong footed as romney may have been on this subject he may yet make it out alive another round of tax return releases may come sooner rather than later and romney can chalk up a couple of rough weeks and move on perhaps to the unveiling of his running mate so far the attacks haven t really stuck romney remains tied in the polls with obama and negative perceptions of the candidates are basically holding steady as romney gets more famous more people like him and dislike him but there s been no change in the gap between those two numbers given the president s straitened circumstances he may believe that an intensely negative campaign is the only way to go but at a certain point if romney survives these weeks obama won t be able to continue harping on sec filings and tax returns given a worsening economy and frustration with political dysfunction personal attacks from the president will not wear very well for the attacks to be worth the damage they do to obama s brand they need to be more potent than this obama believes he can take small things and make them seem large in 30 weeks of a sustained assault but peggy lee sang is that all there is the day in quotes if i was in his shoes i d be making the same argument president obama in an interview with cbs news on republican mitt romney s attacks on obama s handling of the economy as mitt romney said once to his own republican colleagues stop whining i give him his own advice stop whining if you want to claim bain capital as your calling card to the white house then defend what happened to bain capital chicago mayor rahm emanuel former white house chief of staff on this week remember who s up for grabs in this election independent voters they were drawn to obama in 2008 because he was going to change politics and raise and elevate the political discourse this is gutter politics of the worst chicago sort karl rove former senior adviser to president george w bush on fox news sunday with chris wallace no we will not apologize mr romney claims he apos s mr fix it for the economy because of his business experience so i think voters entirely legitimately want to know what is exactly his business experience president obama in an interview with wavy the nbc affiliate in hampton roads va about allegations from his campaign that mitt romney may be a criminal mitt romney should release the tax returns tomorrow it apos s crazy you apos ve got to release six eight 10 years of back tax returns william kristol editor of the weekly standard on fox news sunday with chris wallace if we can t get a good deal a balanced deal that calls on the wealthy to pay their fair share then i will absolutely continue this debate into 2013 sen patty murray d wash head of the democratic senate campaign committee in remarks to be delivered today as provided to the washington post murray will call for allowing tax rates to rise for all payers of federal income tax if republicans don t agree to higher
