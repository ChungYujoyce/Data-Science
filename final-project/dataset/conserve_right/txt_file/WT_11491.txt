flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic buenos aires opposition groups in venezuela are warning that billions of dollars in chinese loans are driving the state oil company toward bankruptcy miguel rodriguez an opposition member of congress who leaked government memos from the oil ministry predicted that the loans will end up accelerating the bankruptcy of petroleum of venezuela sa known by its spanish acronym pdvsa oil minister rafael ramirez was so alarmed that he warned president hugo chavez that the terms of the loan which require payment in hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil at cut rate prices are creating a very heavy financial load for pdvsa top stories ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey in a memo addressed to comrade president mr ramirez said that the loans caused pdvsa to lose 12 5 billion last year mr rodriguez told the washington times that he is preparing legal action to challenge the loans before venezuela s high court he said the loans are unconstitutional partly because they violate a national law prohibiting the use of state resources as loan guarantees these are illegal debt mechanisms he said mr rodriguez said the leaked documents are proof that the loan conditions are bad for pdvsa he also said that 23 billion of what critics call the china fund are unaccounted for the president uses the china fund as if it were money in his own pocket he said opposition presidential candidate henrique capriles who is slated to face mr chavez in an election in october has attacked the deals for their lack of accountability venezuelans have no access to timely reliable information and as a consequence we have no idea how much money is left how much we owe or the terms under which we have to pay it off mr capriles said during a debate in november since 2007 mr chavez s government has received some 32 billion from china to finance infrastructure construction throughout the country and for oil projects in the orinoco tar sands the world s single largest petroleum reserves with 513 billion barrels of recoverable heavy crude oil in november venezuelan finance minister jorge giordani said venezuela pays china with nearly 500 000 barrels of oil per day though some analysts doubt those numbers fueling the chavez machine critics say the chinese have given mr chavez an untracked source of money that has propped up his political machine others also suspect that the deals violate venezuelan law and that mr capriles if he becomes president would renegotiate and possibly cancel many of the loans gustavo coronel a former pdvsa board member said in an email that the loans show signs of being illegal and not properly authorized by the national assembly this poses a risk to china of a new government repudiating the loans he said diego arrias a former venezuelan ambassador to the united nations said he thinks a new government would renegotiate the loans the whole arrangement as far as it is known is very muddy he told the times it is a mortgage on our future oil development because it has been tapped repeatedly to pay for mr chavez s various social projects pdvsa has been forced to go on a borrowing spree in recent years in 2006 it borrowed 2 5 billion as of december that figure had shot up to 34 9 billion chavez haggles for cash another document mr rodriguez released summarized a february 2010 meeting between venezuelan and chinese officials and illustrates the fuzzy nature of mr chavez s oil dealings it shows that mr chavez originally requested one loan of 116 billion over a decade a deal that would have required venezuela to repay beijing 250 000 barrels of oil per day for 10 years that would be about one third the amount the united states imported from venezuela in november alone the last month for which u s figures are available the chinese appear to have balked and asked to see in advance a list of mr chavez s projects that he would finance with the loans a pdvsa manager named asdrubal chavez however presented the chinese with a preliminary list of projects that totaled only 38 billion china in turn offered 11 5 billion mr chavez pressed for at least 20 billion and offered cut rate prices per barrel of oil to get more money upfront in order to close this deal he offered china a price of 70 a barrel substantially below the current and predicted price for the near term said mr coronel who has reviewed the document no other details are known about the deal oil is now trading at more than 100 a barrel after mr rodriguez made the documents public mr ramirez of pdvsa announced in november that the structure of the company s payments had been changed and that pdvsa would be paid 7 billion for chinese oil shipments in 2011 luis giusti a former president of pdvsa said that if mr capriles is elected he should open an extensive investigation of pdvsa in the event of a regime change an immediate urgent effort must be undertaken to evaluate all important aspects of the venezuela oil industry he said mr giusti said it would be unwise to nullify chinese deals without thoroughly reviewing them each one of them as many others should be evaluated commercially and strategically on its own merits and shortcomings he added if current conditions are not fair they should be renegotiated and only canceled if the other party is not willing to do it in recent years china has become a major lender in latin america chinese state banks have lent more than 75 billion to regional governments since 2005 in 2010 they made more loans than the world bank inter american development bank and export import bank of the united states combined according to a report by the washington based inter american dialogue venezuela and ecuador together received 61
