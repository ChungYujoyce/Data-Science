health care for alland more have been more widely embraced in the party in a curious moment though sanders said that biden will be the nominee yet went on to stress the importance of continuing to win delegates for his own campaign so he apos ll be able to exert influence on the party platform calling it a difficult and painful decision sanders stressed that while this campaign is coming to an end our movement is not more than any other democratic campaign sanders apos candidacy indeed represented a movement a populist liberal grassroots army of young people and others drawn to his democratic socialist beliefs which he brought from the fringes to the mainstream of the party biden now the presumptive nominee said in a statement that sanders and his supporters changed the dialogue he said but more than any one issue or set of issues i want to commend bernie for being a powerful voice for a fairer and more just america it s voices like bernie s that refuse to allow us to just accept what is that refuse to accept we can t change what s wrong in our nation that refuse to accept the health and well being of our fellow citizens and our planet isn t our responsibility too bernie gets

enough fox news has confirmed that biden and sanders have since spoken on twitter biden praised him for creating a movement i know bernie well he s a good man a great leader and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country and it s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one single tweet so i won t try to biden tweeted to bernie and jane as friends from jill and me you haven t just run a political campaign you ve created a movement and make no mistake about it we believe it s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday that s a good thing for our nation and our future biden wants sanders to be part of apos journey apos for a time sanders almost looked poised to clinch the nomination as he and a handful of others emerged in early 2020 as the last candidates standing from a once massive field of primary contenders sanders won new hampshire apos s primary and scored a landslide victory in the nevada caucuses in latefebruary as he surged to front runner status in the nomination race the populist lawmaker however then suffered a string of major primary defeats in his second straight presidential bid biden steadilyamassed a near insurmountable delegate lead following decisive victories in south carolina and then on super tuesday as well as subsequent contests before coronavirus measures forced most primaries on the calendar to be delayed but until now sanders had refused to back out of the race instead pressing biden to embrace progressive policy positions sanders apos lingering presence in the race had agitated biden allies concerned he would continue to make it difficult for biden to fully focus on a general election battle against president trump biden however was already moving ahead planning to consider running mates and even downplaying the possibility of any future debates with sanders as part of the primary process the most recent primary was held tuesday in wisconsin though most others are postponed results in that race are not expected for another week though biden was thought to have the clear advantage there biden s path to the nomination was already clearing thanks to not only his delegate lead but support from much of the party establishment and former primary rivals one prominent figure still has not formally endorsed biden however former president barack obama obama and sanders spoke multiple times the past few weeks as the senator from vermont mulled the future of his white house bid a source close to obama s orbit confirmed to fox news h e s had multiple conversations with candidates including senator sanders about how to best position the democratic party to win in november while the content of those conversations remain private there was always agreement that winning in the fall was paramount the source said sanders on wednesday blasted trump as the most dangerous president in modern american history in a statement trump campaign manager brad parscale took renewed swipes at biden with bernie sanders suspending his campaign it s all but official that the democrat establishment got the candidate they wanted in joe biden as well as the candidate president trump will destroy in november president trump is still disrupting washington dc while biden represents the old tired way and continuing to coddle the communist regime in china democrat elites shoved bernie sanders to the side for a second time leaving many of his supporters looking for a new home sanders was considered the longest of long shots when he launched his first white house bid in the spring of 2015 but after nearly defeating hillary clinton in the iowa caucuses and then crushing the former secretary of state in the new hampshire primary he battled the eventual nominee throughout the primary calendar he made an uneasy peace with clinton in the summer of 2016 but many of his progressive and younger supporters never embraced the democratic nominee the lack of unity was a contributing factor in helping donald trump upset clinton there are deep concerns among democrats of a repeat of the 2016 lack of unity biden has praised sanders in recent weeks and has said he would not pressure the senator to drop out of the race biden has also embraced some progressive proposals such as bankruptcy reform and free college tuition at public colleges and universities policies that sanders had pushed but he has not embraced medicare for all sanders apos signature policy that has many supporters among congressional democrats fox news apos andrew craft
