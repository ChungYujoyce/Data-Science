chinese liberation army were charged with hacking into the equifax international credit reference agency the fbi alleges they plundered personal details of more than 140 million americans and millions of u k and canadian citizens in 2017 it is very easy to confuse china s economic liberalization with political reform indeed how could communist china become the world s second largest economy without loosening state control two key factors were the reforms made by its former paramount leader deng xiaoping to allow its moribund economy to revive and its repossession of hong kong karl marx predicted that capitalism would be replaced by communism but china was the first country to utilize free enterprise to finance and secure its communist structure under deng s leadership china learned to harness
