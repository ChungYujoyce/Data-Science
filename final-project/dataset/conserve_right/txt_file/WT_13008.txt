magazine that portrayed the wall street institution as a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money mr li s book takes ample license in its attacks on goldman sachs the company s ultimate goal he says in the first chapter is to kill china like a fox chewing a bone goldman sachs knows the rules of the game and when to go for your neck it says with the cruel character of a manchurian tiger the group creeps around the world like a veteran hunter stalking its prey when it smells blood it pounces the chapter says goldman sachs office in beijing refused to comment on the book and on others of its ilk the financial cataclysm of 2008 and ensuing global recession has resulted in a profusion of books dissecting the role of global investment banks including goldman sachs it reads like a novel rather than a real story said peng yunliang a securities analyst goldman sachs has been at the eye of the storm and is seen as the culprit behind the mess that s clearly the most popular topic on the market he said goldman was sharply criticized especially in the u s for its high executive pay after it

commentary particularly when the targets are not communist party officials the chinese language book also accuses goldman sachs of involvement in the recent dubai and greek debt debacles and the wider european financial and fiscal crises to buttress its myriad allegations the book notes well known links between former top goldman sachs executives such as former u s treasury secretary henry m paulson jr and government officials in the u s and other countries it includes copies of what appear to be u s court documents they include a complaint against goldman sachs and fabrice tourre a
