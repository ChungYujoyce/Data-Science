widespread use of an unproven drug president donald trump touted as a remedy for covid 19 rick bright former director of the biomedical advanced research and development authority says he was

era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey removing dr bright in the midst of a pandemic would raise serious concerns under any circumstances but his allegations that political considerations influenced this decision heighten those concerns and demand full accountability pallone said the inspector general s office had no immediate response bright is seeking to be reinstated as head of the research agency said his lawyers debra katz and lisa banks a performance review shows he received a top rating controversy has swirled around hydroxychloroquine since trump started promoting it from the podium in the white house briefing room barda the agency that bright formerly headed is a unit of hhs created to counter threats from bioterrorism and infectious diseases it has recently been trying to jump start work on a vaccine for the coronavirus i am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus science not politics or cronyism has to lead the way bright who has a doctoral degree in immunology said a statement released wednesday by his lawyers specifically and contrary to misguided directives i limited the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine promoted by the administration as a panacea but which clearly lack scientific merit bright said i also resisted efforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections he added asked about bright at wednesday s briefing trump said he never heard of him the guy says he was pushed out of a job trump said maybe he was maybe he wasn t i don t know who he is bright s lawyers said thursday they will soon file formal complaints with the hhs inspector general and the office of special counsel an independent agency that has as part of its charge the protection of government whistleblowers while i am prepared to look at all options and to think outside the box for effective treatments i rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the american public bright wrote in his statement he also alluded to clashes with hhs political leadership over his efforts to invest early in vaccines and supplies critical to saving american lives one of the major criticisms of the trump administration s pandemic response is that little was done in the month of february to stockpile needed equipment science in service to the health and safety of the american people must always trump politics bright said trump has repeatedly touted the malaria drug during his regular coronavirus briefings calling it a game changer and suggesting its skeptics would be proved wrong he has offered patient testimonials that the drug is a lifesaver but a recent study of 368 patients in u s veterans hospitals found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine and more deaths the study was an early look at the medication which has prompted debate in the medical community with many doctors leery of using it in a statement hhs confirmed that bright is no longer at the barda agency but did not address his allegations of political interference in scientific matters hhs said it was bright who had requested an emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for his part bright said he had insisted that the authorization be limited to a restricted group of patients those hospitalized with confirmed covid 19 under the supervision of a doctor hydroxychloroquine was given to patients in the new york area the nation s most intense covid 19 hot spot it is usually administered in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin an official biography describes bright as a flu and infectious disease expert who joined the agency 10 years ago and was focused on vaccine development he also held the title of hhs deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response reporting to dr robert kadlec bright s performance review shows he got the highest rating level 5 achieved outstanding results in federal fiscal year 2019 dr bright continues
