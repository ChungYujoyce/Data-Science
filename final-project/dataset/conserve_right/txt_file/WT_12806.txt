apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic defense secretary robert m gates said today that the united states will remain actively engaged in asia despite its commitments to fighting the war on terrorism and the conflict in iraq some people have suggested that the united states may be neglecting asia because we have been too focused on iraq afghanistan and other hot spots mr gates said at the shangri la conference in singapore top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore in reality far from neglecting asia the u s is more engaged than ever before he said at the annual conference of defense leaders and specialists we have been extraordinarily busy in recent years as we reshape and strengthen our security ties based on shared interests mr gates said u s relationships in asia have been renewed and modernized including those with india japan and south korea in fact the united states is set to sell advanced warplanes and high technology military equipment to india as part of a growing relationship between the two nations the speech was noticeable for its few comments on china which was the focus of a pentagon report last week that report stated beijing is building up advanced forces for a conflict over taiwan which it considers part of china and for operations beyond taiwan aimed at securing energy resources and sea lanes mr gates noted common interests with china on issues such as terrorism countering arms proliferation and energy security but we are concerned about the opaqueness of beijing s military spending and modernization programs issues described in the annual report on the chinese armed forces recently released by the u s government he said mr gates noted that there is a difference between military capacity and intent as a result he said i believe there is reason to be optimistic about the u s china relationship his comments were in sharp contrast to the 2005 speech at the same conference by defense secretary donald h rumsfeld who criticized china for its large scale military buildup and deception on its defense spending mr gates also spoke positively of president bush s troop buildup in iraq the immediate goal is to create the breathing room necessary to allow reform and reconciliation to go forward steps that will give all of iraq s communities majority and minorities alike a stake in that nation s future he said according to the associated press whatever your views on how we got to this point in iraq it is clear that a failed state in that part of the world would destabilize the region and embolden violent extremists everywhere in an exchange later with members of his audience mr gates was asked how long u s intelligence agencies think it will take iran to build a nuclear weapon the ap reported the general view of american intelligence is that they would be in a position to develop a nuclear device probably sometime in the period 2010 2011 or 2014 or 15 he said according to the ap there are those who believe that it could happen much sooner late 2008 or 2009 the reality is that because of the way iran has conducted its affairs we really don t know and it puts a higher premium on international community coming together in terms of strengthening sanctions so that they begin to face serious trade offs in their economic future the conference includes about 20 defense chiefs from asia and elsewhere and is hosted by the london based international institute for strategic studies china s military however declined to send a defense minister level official and instead sent a less senior military leader the snub is intended to signal beijing s displeasure at participating in forums where the united states and not china
