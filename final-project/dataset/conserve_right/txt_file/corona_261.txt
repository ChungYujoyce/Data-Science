national review apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions against jo rae perkins biden s progressive gamble biden says we should look at his record on race it doesn t help his case donald trump has at least five strong historical arguments for his reelection one he is an incumbent incumbent presidents have won 14 of 19 reelection bids since 1900 the few who lost did not enjoy positive approval ratings in a gallup poll from earlier this month trump enjoyed his highest approval rating since his inauguration squeezing out a 49 percent favorable rating vs 50 percent unfavorable two the public perception of the economy usually determines any presidential election as incumbents gerald ford jimmy carter george h w bush and herbert hoover learned the hard way currently the u s is enjoying low inflation low interest rates positive economic growth near record low unemployment rising workers wages and record gas and oil production three unpopular optional wars derail incumbent presidencies the quagmire in vietnam convinced lyndon johnson not to run for reelection in 1968 jimmy carter was tarnished by the seemingly never ending iranian hostage crisis of 1979 1981 the iraq war drove down george w bush s second term approval ratings and helped derail his would be republican successor john mccain jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk

as when watergate forced the resignation of richard nixon five the opponent matters barry goldwater was caricatured as an out of touch extremist and made incumbent lyndon johnson s election a sure thing in 1964 george mcgovern s radicalism ensured that richard nixon would be reelected in 1972 ronald reagan was assured of a second term by walter mondale s anemic candidacy how does trump stack up on all such criteria his poll numbers have climbed steadily since democrats began impeachment proceedings against him in september 2019 his gallup approval rating is now four points higher than when he was inaugurated in january 2017 trump now has far more campaign money than he did in 2016 and unlike then he has the full backing of the republican party a mostly positive record of economic achievement lots of campaigning and governing experience and presidential incumbency true the u s continues to borrow about 1 trillion per year trump has followed the profligate spending habits of his predecessors george w bush and barack obama who both dramatically increased the national debt during their eight year tenures china is reeling from the hong kong protests the coronavirus the trade war with the u s and the global outcry over its forced imprisonment of minority groups if the chinese economy crashes it could take down global commerce a notch both the stock and housing markets here in america are overheating at some point they will be due for a reset all that said few economists are predicting a recession in the next eight months before the election given the near record employment and increased disposable income from rising wages and lower taxes gallup found that 63 percent of the public approves of the trump economy the highest rating for any president in that category over the last 20 years will trump get into a war china iran and north korea would benefit if trump were not reelected any of them might seek a confrontation over the summer to provoke trump into an unpopular pre election shootout yet trump s record suggests that he is unlikely to favor preemptory attacks nation building or the use of u s ground troops in large numbers so far he has used mostly air and sea power to accomplish limited objectives without committing u s ground troops to the usual nasty places in the middle east scandal wise trump has already been impeached by the house but was acquitted by the senate special counsel robert mueller s team spent 22 months and some 35 million to investigate collusion between the trump campaign and russia in the 2016 election and came up short the more democrats have sought to abort the trump presidency through impeachment congressional investigations lawsuits and sheer hysteria the more trump seems teflon like and his approval ratings go up trump s greatest advantage in 2020 however may be his most likely opponent the unapologetic socialist senator bernie sanders the various agendas of the radical sanders turn off a majority of the public even mainstream democrats are terrified of sanders s redistribution schemes former front runner joe biden appears befuddled on the campaign trail and has been hurt by revelations about his son hunter s ukrainian shenanigans the only other serious democratic contender is multibillionaire mike bloomberg compared with his rivals bloomberg is a moderate with unlimited financial resources and ample experience as a three term new york city mayor yet bloomberg s first debate was a disaster he has variously posed as a democrat republican and independent his strength as a moderate in a sea of extremists was nullified by his decision to apologize for or disown many of the decisions that made him an effective mayor bloomberg has been more reckless in speech than even trump almost daily an embarrassingly crass quote pops out of his past add it all up and if one looks at 2020 dispassionately and historically the election appears to be trump s to lose 2020 tribune content agency llc get
