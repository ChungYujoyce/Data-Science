telecommunications equipment produced by china s huawei technologies and zte in the u s over concerns from electronic spying by beijing commission chairman ajit pai announced oct 28 that new rules will be put into place later this month aimed at safeguarding u s communications networks the two part plan calls for barring communications companies from using fcc money provided under a program called the universal service fund to purchase equipment or services that pose a national security threat that includes huawei and zte mr pai stated the new order also creates a system that could designate other suppliers that pose national security threats should the chinese seek to circumvent the ban by using subsidiaries or by renaming their companies the second part of the proposal calls for regional telecommunications carriers to remove huawei and zte equipment from their networks as the u s and other nations move to 5g national wireless networks the proposal will also seek to determine the scale of chinese equipment currently being used in those networks when it comes to 5g and america s security we can t afford to take a risk and hope for the best mr pai said we need to make sure our networks won t harm our national security threaten our economic security or undermine our values mr pai said the chinese government has shown repeatedly that it is willing to go to extraordinary lengths to do just that additionally chinese regulations require all companies to secretly comply with requests from intelligence services to access data and equipment as the united states upgrades its networks to the next generation of wireless technologies 5g we cannot ignore the risk that the chinese government will seek to exploit network vulnerabilities in order to engage in espionage insert malware and viruses and otherwise compromise our critical communications networks mr pai said the goal of the new rules is to prevent the use of funds from the 8 5 billion universal service fund from undermining american security through untrusted vendors such as huawei and zte mr pai said the action followed a 2017 letter from 18 members of congress warning about the threat posed by the use of huawei equipment both the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the senate select committee on intelligence have long been concerned about chinese espionage in general and huawei s role in that espionage in particular the lawmakers stated an fcc vote on the new rules is set for nov 19 foreign threat to 2020 elections a joint statement by u s intelligence and
