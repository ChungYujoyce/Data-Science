have been comatose for the past week it is highly likely that you have seen a statistic or a headline that would lead you to believe that the trump administration has lost track of nearly 1 500 illegal immigrant children if true such a report would be absolutely horrifying but as with much of what we read quite simply it is not true the hysteria was caused by partisan democrats mistakenly linking to a 2014 article in the arizona republic thinking that the photos in the article were current trump derangement syndrome led to a textbook self own by the left as is the case these days the outrage outran the facts top stories australian researchers see virus design manipulation coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history you are not going to die from covid 19 what is the real story unaccompanied alien children uac enter the country and when they are apprehended current law and court precedent requires that they be transferred into the custody of the department of health and human services through their office of refugee resettlement orr the law then requires the department to quickly locate a parent relative or sponsor to take in the children according to hhs deputy secretary eric hargan approximately 90 percent of the children s sponsors are parents or close relatives and historically orr has not tracked children once released but in 2016 orr began proactively and voluntarily calling sponsors one month after placing the unaccompanied minors with them to inquire whether additional assistance was needed the statistic published in the arizona republic that the feds lost yes lost 1 475 migrant children is false in a recent report 14 percent of those called did not respond they did not answer the call this does not mean the children are missing it means the sponsor did not answer the call or return it does anyone remember similar hysteria in 2016 when president obama was in office of course not because this is a manufactured controversy immediately rep joaquin castro a democrat from san antonio chose not to let a manufactured crisis go to waste organizing what he called a national day of action for children thousands of messages have been shared online with the hash tag wherearethechildren what would democrats want the trump administration to do actively surveil these homes where vetted sponsors take in the unaccompanied minors the health and human services department does not have the legal authority to return the minors back to government custody according to hhs if there s a reason why our providers believe that the child is unsafe or that there has been a change in circumstances that they think that it s warranted then yes they reach out to the local child welfare entities to get them involved on this an unanswered phone call clearly does not meet the standard of a child being unsafe you may ask yourself a sensible question why would the national media and the democratic party actively mislead the public about this bogus crisis because it s at the heart of the democrats turnout strategy for the midterm elections democrats desperately want to take back the house so they can investigate the trump administration and impeach him effectively shutting down his legislative agenda and weakening him for re election this is their top priority to do this they need high latino turnout democrats must believe the only way to excite the base is to create false narratives and peddle them to constituency groups here is the reality thousands of unaccompanied alien children are apprehended every month this is not safe for a child and it is often the result of a human smuggling operations from central america there are two separate issues first we should discourage unaccompanied minors from entering the u s illegally second we should humanely and legally handle these children once they arrive here i have no reason to believe this is not being done currently but if it is congress should step in by providing oversight and changing the law currently approximately 10 000 unaccompanied children are in the system on top of more than 100 000 who have been released into the country previously it is shameful that some would falsely spread conspiracy theories about the trump administration as part of political strategy for win a few more votes in november matt mackowiak is president of austin texas and
