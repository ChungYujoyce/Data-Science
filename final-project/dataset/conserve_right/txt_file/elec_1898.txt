national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions there are two possible explanations of joe biden s inability to tell the truth about things one is that his mind is failing him the other is that his honor is in neither case is biden fit to hold the office of president of the united states of america and democrats would discredit themselves and endanger the nation to nominate him yes yes go ahead but trump etc and continue when you ve completed the ritual of equivocation and don t think too hard about how far and in what direction that line of moral self justification has carried the republican party joe biden is a plagiarist and a liar among other things in the most recent example detailed by the washington post biden made up a story in which he as vice president displayed personal courage and heroism in traveling to a dangerous war zone in order to recognize the service of an american soldier who had distinguished himself in a particularly dramatic way it was a moving story this is the god s truth he concluded my word as a biden but his word as a biden isn t worth squat as the post showed reporting that biden got the time period the location the heroic act the type of medal the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong as well as his own role in the ceremony which is a nice way of saying biden lied about an act of military heroism in order to aggrandize his own role in the story like hillary rodham clinton under fictitious sniper fire biden highlighted his own supposed courage in the face of physical danger we can lose a vice president we can t lose many more of these kids jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist https cdn jwplayer com v2 playlists xtkmeukk contextual

jwp publisherid 23390304 labelmapping labelmapping if biden here is lying with malice aforethought then he ought to be considered morally disqualified for the office if he is senescent then he obviously is unable to perform the duties associated with the presidency and asking him to do so would be indecent dangerous and unpatriotic the evidence points more toward moral disability than mental disability inasmuch as biden has a long career of lying about precisely this sort of thing the most dramatic instance of that is biden s continued insistence on lying about the circumstances surrounding the horrifying deaths of his wife and daughter in a terrible car accident it is not the case as biden has said on many occasions that they were killed by a drunk driver an irresponsible trucker who drank his lunch as biden put it that is a pure fabrication and a slander on the man who was behind the wheel of that truck and who was haunted by the episode until the end of his days imagine yourself in the position of that man s family whose natural sympathy for biden s loss must be complicated by outrage at his persistent lying about the relevant events why would biden lie about the death of his wife and daughter why would he lie about the already heroic efforts of american soldiers in both cases to make the story more dramatic to give himself a bigger and more impressive narrative arc that he would subordinate other people real people living and dead to his own political ambition in such a callous and demeaning way counsels strongly against entrusting him with any more political power than that which he already has wielded biden lies about matters great and small he lies about his trip to afghanistan he lies about the death of his wife and daughter he is wildly dishonest about his role in the iraq war and the 1994 crime bill landmark moments in his legislative career that later became political liabilities and whatever the state of his brain today he was not senile back in 1987 when he plagiarized the words of margaret thatcher and neil kinnock for his own speeches like his lies his plagiarism is part of a lifelong habit as recently as this year he was filling out his policy papers with uncredited stolen material from advocacy groups the united states has become an empire of lies we are governed by liars chosen on the basis of lies and the worst partisans have begun openly to admire the lies so long as they are skillfully constructed and delivered the lowest among us enjoy being lied to and celebrate it entire political careers are based on lies and policy initiatives too but if not the serial liar joe biden then whom will the democrats choose elizabeth warren who has misrepresented her supposed native american ancestry kamala harris who has lied about murder in order to serve her own political ends robert francis o rourke who cannot tell the truth for five minutes about basic and fundamental questions of public policy the democrats are ready to go into november with nothing better to say for themselves than our liar is better than their liar it is doubtful they will even be morally conflicted about that but the nation will be worse off for it inasmuch as democratic assumptions built on a foundation of lies must necessarily be unstable joe biden has exhausted whatever presumption of goodwill or benefit of the doubt we might have extended to him for the past 46 years he has had his chance to show that he is a man capable of honor integrity and honesty and he has failed that test at every turn if there ever was a time for him that time has passed the last thing this country needs is another pathological liar in its highest office he is unfit for the presidency in every way and democrats owe the country better than to nominate him in the pursuit of their own selfish partisan interests get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
