national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge there are some bible stories that really stick with you here s one that s challenged me my entire life centuries before the birth of christ the tiny and vulnerable kingdom of judah faced an existential threat from the assyrian empire the prophet isaiah s message to the judean king hezekiah was clear trust god for your salvation he alone can and will protect his people the demand for trust was so absolute that isaiah unequivocally condemned any quest for a military alliance for protection his words echo through the ages woe to those who go down to egypt for help and rely on horses who trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are strong but do not look to the holy one of israel or consult the lord consider the challenge here a king is told to shun a military alliance with a pagan power and to face death and destruction alone trusting solely in god s deliverance i never forgot the lesson i remembered the admonitions of sunday school teachers my bible professors at college and my pastors christians never forget our ultimate hope is in the lord be wary of an alliance with evil even when the need seems overwhelming obviously these fools didn t understand the importance of electing a junior senator from alabama to fill out a partial term of office sure hezekiah faced the assyrians but by golly we face doug jones we ve got no choice but to ally with a dangerous unfit man a man who proclaims christianity while systematically violating the law seeks to deny the most basic civil rights to his fellow citizens and now faces heavily sourced and corroborated claims of past sexual misconduct with minors i keep hearing these words from evangelicals we ve got no choice the democrats are after our liberties they re seeking to destroy our way of life some even go so far as to say that even if the allegations against moore are true they ll still hold their nose and put him in office to keep jones from serving three years in the senate i m sorry evangelicals but your lack of faith is far more dangerous to the church than any senator any president or any justice of the supreme court i m sorry evangelicals but your lack of faith is far more dangerous to the church than any senator any president or any justice of the supreme court do you really have so little trust in god that you believe it s justifiable no necessary to ally with defend and even embrace corrupt men if it you think it will save the church though i didn t agree with the decision to vote for either donald trump or hillary clinton i also didn t doubt the sincerity of evangelicals who expressed real worry about putting the awesome power of the presidency in clinton s hands but what now there s no defensible argument for choosing the lesser of two evils in alabama yet i see friends and allies excuse and even defend sins in moore and trump that they ve never ever excused or defended in any democrat and for what to win the news cycle to gain influence this disease is spreading too the family research council to its great shame invited steve bannon to address it s so called values voter conference bannon by his own admission helped make breitbarta platform for the vile alt right a violent and viciously racist movement that has time and again threatened even the frc s christian friends and allies what crisis could possibly demand an alliance with such a man i m beginning to realize that countless older christians misled their kids and grandkids they said that moral character matters in politicians they said they were building a movement based around ideas and principles not power and party they said those things right up until the moment when holding firm to their convictions risked handing hillary clinton the presidency and at that point the dam broke now they re willing to sell out for a lousy alabama senate seat the bottom line through word and deed they chose to trust bad men and not a holy god some apply double standards granting the benefit of the doubt to ideological allies even as they condemn their opponents others distort biblical stories to rationalize their alliances it was bad enough to see donald trump compared to king david now we have to endure an alabama official s comparison of roy moore to joseph yes i know there are many instances in which godless kings did good things for god s people god can turn the heart of any man but there is a vast difference between seeking favor from an unrighteous ruler and choosing defending and embracing the same unrighteous ruler from the start evangelicals you re putting people like donald trump and roy moore in office you re declaring to the world he s our man in graver times god s people have demonstrated much greater faith we stumble when the stakes are comparatively low our failures will come back to haunt us there will be woe to those who ve compromised with evil through lack of faith a reckoning is coming may god have mercy on us all read more nr editorial roy moore should drop out conservatives don t dismiss the sexual misconduct
