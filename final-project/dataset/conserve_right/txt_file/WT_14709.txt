ynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic while the united states has been fussing at china for gaining an advantage in trade by depressing the value of its currency other nations while agreeing about china are increasingly focused on the falling dollar and concern that the u s may be doing the same thing treasury secretary timothy f geithner on wednesday stepped up u s demands that china stop closely controlling the value of its currency and allow it to rise against the dollar suggesting that the asian giant may be violating its pledge last year to move toward freer exchange rates with other group of 20 economic powers we have moved aggressively to do our part to help bring the world out of crisis said mr geithner noting congress enactment of strict new regulatory reforms on wall street this summer and a big drop in the u s trade deficit since 2008 as a result of greater savings and less spending by u s consumers top stories trump dismisses

mentioning china specifically in his speech to the brookings institution mr geithner pointed to what he described as other major economies with chronic large trade surpluses and undervalued currencies in an unmistakable reference to the asian giant european nations echoed mr geithner s criticism in a separate forum with chinese premier wen jiabao in brussels and called on china to allow more rapid appreciation of its currency the yuan or renminbi that prompted a strong rebuke from the chinese leader do not work to pressurize us on the renminbi rate he said yes we are going to proceed with the reforms but he suggested the bigger problem for the world economy was the recent large drop in the u s dollar which is the world s main reserve currency mr wen warned of dire consequences if china were to abandon its gradual currency reform and allow a rapid rise of the yuan many of our exporting companies would have to close down migrant workers would have to return to their villages he said if china saw social and economic turbulence that would be a disaster for the world but the united states received strong backing in its dispute with china from an important quarter the international monetary fund in a report wednesday the imf urged china and other asian nations with large trade surpluses to stop devaluing their currencies rely less on exports for growth and encourage more consumer and business spending at home while the imf expects the world economy to keep growing this year led by double digit growth in china and other developing countries it warned that the resumption of distorted trade patterns that prevailed before the recession could undermine the economy once again the recovery is neither strong nor balanced and runs the risk of not being sustained
