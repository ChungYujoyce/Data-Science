apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap president trump s latest tariff hike on chinese goods took effect friday and beijing said it would retaliate escalating a battle over china s technology ambitions and other trade tensions the trump administration raised duties on 200 billion of chinese imports to 25 from 10 china s commerce ministry said it would impose necessary countermeasures but gave no details the increase went ahead even after american and chinese negotiators began more talks in washington aimed at ending a dispute that has disrupted billions of dollars in trade and shaken global financial markets top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the risk of a complete breakdown in trade talks has certainly increased said michael taylor of moody s investors service in a report american officials accuse beijing of backtracking on commitments made in earlier rounds of negotiations the talks were due to resume friday after wrapping up thursday evening with no word on progress china deeply regrets that it will have to take necessary countermeasures said a commerce ministry statement shares in asia were mixed friday amid renewed investor jitters that global growth might suffer in the battle between the two biggest economies and international traders business groups appealed for a settlement that will resolve chronic complaints about market barriers subsidies and a regulatory system they say is rigged against foreign companies companies disagree with tariff hikes but are supportive of the idea in the short term if it helps us get to a strong enforceable long term agreement that addresses structural issues said greg gilligan the deputy chairman of the american chamber of commerce in china the latest increase extends 25 duties to a total of 250 billion of chinese imports trump said sunday he might expand penalties to all chinese goods shipped to the united states beijing retaliated for previous tariff hikes by raising duties on 110 billion of american imports but regulators are running out of u s goods for penalties due to the lopsided trade balance chinese officials have targeted operations of american companies in china by slowing customs clearance for them and stepping up regulatory scrutiny that can hamper operations the latest u s increase might hit american consumers harder said jake parker vice president of the u s china business council an industry group he said the earlier 10 percent increase was absorbed by companies and offset by a weakening of the chinese currency s exchange rate a 25 percent hike needs to be passed on to the consumer said parker it is just too big to dilute with those other factors despite the public acrimony local chinese officials who want to attract american investment have tried to reassure companies there is minimal retaliation said parker we ve actually seen an increased sensitivity to u s companies at the local level he said the higher u s

importers may have to pay the increased charges the negotiators met thursday evening then after briefing trump on the negotiations u s trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin dined with the leader of the chinese delegation vice premier liu he liu speaking to chinese state tv on his arrival in washington said he came with sincerity he appealed to washington to avoid more tariff hikes saying they are not a solution and would harm the world we should not hurt innocent people liu told cctv at the white house trump said he received a beautiful letter from chinese president xi jinping and would probably speak to him by phone the two countries are sparring over u s allegations beijing steals technology and pressures companies to hand over trade secrets in a campaign to turn chinese companies into world leaders in robotics electric cars and other advanced industries this week s setback was unexpected through late last week trump administration officials were suggesting that negotiators were making steady progress u s officials say they got an inkling of china s second thoughts about prior commitments in talks last week in beijing but the backsliding became more apparent in exchanges over the weekend they wouldn t identify the specific issues involved a sticking point is u s insistence on an enforcement mechanism with penalties to ensure beijing lives up to its commitments american officials say china has repeatedly broken past promises china wants tariffs lifted as soon as an agreement is reached while u s officials want to keep them as leverage to ensure compliance a real enforcement mechanism is critical said the american chamber of commerce in shanghai in a statement also thursday canadian prime minister justin trudeau urged trump in a phone call to press china to release two canadians who have been held for five months the men were detained in apparent retaliation after canada arrested an executive of
