closed door deposition with a defense department official democrats said the move compromised national security because some of the republicans took electronic devices into a secure room the protest by republican lawmakers on wednesday captured national attention drawing the focus away from the testimony of a top u s diplomat who told lawmakers just a day earlier that he was told president donald trump was withholding military aid from ukraine unless the country s president pledged to investigate democrats the maneuver delayed a deposition with laura cooper a senior defense department official who oversees ukraine policy until midafternoon the interview began roughly five hours behind schedule after a security check by capitol officials and ended after roughly four hours top stories fox

scif and every gop member is quietly listening rep bennie thompson d miss who chairs the house homeland security committee alleged that republicans intentionally brought their electronic devices into the secure area violating congressional rules and the oath they take to gain access to classified information the unprecedented breach of security raises serious concerns for committee chairs who

s c criticized his republican colleagues for the tactic calling them nuts to make a run on the scif that s not the way to do it he said graham later tweeted that he initially believed republicans had taken the room by force and that it was actually a peaceful protest adding his house gop colleagues had good reason to be upset the republicans who took part in the protest were unbowed rep steve
