apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic toledo ohio ap president trump once promised that coal and steel would be the beating heart of a revived u s economy a nostalgic vision that helped carry him to victory three years ago in the industrial midwest but a year away from election day that promised renaissance is not materializing and both sectors are faltering in ways that are painfully familiar and politically significant recent data show manufacturing jobs are disappearing across pennsylvania michigan and ohio states critical to trump s reelection chances on tuesday murray energy a major mining firm with close ties to the president became the latest of many coal companies to file for bankruptcy this year rattling communities across ohio west virginia and kentucky the news followed recent layoffs at a prominent steel manufacturer in northeastern ohio and general motors final decision this fall to shutter its massive plant at lordstown ohio top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk the turmoil in the manufacturing and mining sectors threatens to undermine trump s claim to a booming economy the bedrock of his and his republican allies campaign strategy in places where it matters most while trump s economy is benefiting high tech manufacturing and energy sectors in other regions the manufacturing slump across the rust belt may test whether trump can retain his appeal to blue collar workers without having fully delivered on his promise to fatten their bank accounts i don t think that ohio is just a lock in the republican s column nor do i think that blue collar voters are settled on who they re likely to select said robert alexander a political scientist at ohio northern university there is a lot of economic angst still in the state recent elections haven t shown that angst to be aimed at republicans after trump won ohio by 12 percentage points the largest margin of any presidential candidate since 1988 republicans fared better in ohio than in many other states in last year s midterms nabbing every statewide office but one their winning formula was based overwhelming support from working class white voters in small communities where a single company can anchor the local economy murray energy is based in st clairsville ohio a small city near the west virginia and pennsylvania borders in a county that voted for trump over democrat hillary clinton by a margin of 40 percentage points but the company s footprint is far larger including 17 mines across alabama illinois indiana kentucky pennsylvania utah and west virginia as well as colombia south america the company s former ceo bob murray is a trump donor and advocate for his company s interests murray openly pressured trump to issue an emergency order that would have exempted his struggling company from environmental regulations he said were burdensome trump flirted with that idea but never approved it murray said tuesday the company was filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy a restructuring that puts at risk the incomes pensions and health care benefits of roughly 7 000 workers democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren a bankruptcy expert seized on the news as evidence of trump failing his voters he made promises to working people all across this country that he would be there on their behalf instead he s been there for the lobbyists he s been there for the giant corporations he s been there to help make the rich richer and leave everyone else behind she said trump bounded into office promising to bring back beautiful clean coal and deliver a victory for every factory worker the message helped him pull out victories in michigan pennsylvania wisconsin and ohio where scars from the great recession that technically ended in 2009 were still fresh for the first two years of his presidency trump oversaw an economic recovery that extended across sectors and regions adding manufacturing and factory jobs in the rust belt and beyond but recent signs show that trajectory shifting downward quickly fueled by a slumping global economy and the trade wars escalated by the trump administration so far this year ohio has shed 2 400 factory jobs michigan has lost 6 200 pennsylvania has 9 100 fewer manufacturing workers west virginia employers have cut 400 mining jobs and kentucky has let go of 600 mine workers general motors struck a devastating blow to ohio by ending more than 50 years of car manufacturing at assembly plant near youngstown a labor stronghold where trump surprised democrats by winning half the vote in 2016 but for every gm scale closure there are other lower profile layoffs in other states nearly 950 manufacturing jobs in pennsylvania were lost in may when the cabinetmaker wood mode shuttered bimbo bakeries closed a plant in july in northern pennsylvania that cost 151 jobs according to filings with the state earlier this month canton ohio based timken steel ousted ceo tim timken also a republican donor as the company s stock has plummeted over the past year timken received 4 million in cash as severance the company eliminated 55 positions in july in order to save 7 million annually next fiscal year according to filings with the securities and exchange commission separately roughly 250 timken steel employees so far have received extended layoff notices said bob harper president of united steelworkers 1123 factories have been idled at times due to a lack of orders each job at timken steel supports about five other jobs in the community said harper who says he thinks the layoffs could turn voters there against trump things are going to get worse he said we re going to get hurt timken s wife is ohio republican party chairwoman jane timken a chief cheerleader for trump s economic stewardship in the state asked about the layoffs and ohio s economy jane timken issued a statement touting trump s record president trump is committed to bringing good paying manufacturing jobs back to ohio and the midwest she said citing statistics largely shaped by great recession layoffs that preceded trump by seven years since he became president he has brought over 14 500 manufacturing jobs back to ohio compare that to president barack obama who only brought 11 700 manufacturing jobs to ohio during his entire administration democrats can cry economic wolf but ohioans know the truth it s far from clear that ohioans are poised to blame trump for the economic blows in ohio dan wade has worked at timken steel for the past 19 years he was temporarily laid off last week but says he expects to go back in a few days he blames the company s troubles on management not trump i m going to vote for him again i like him i like his attitude wade said timken retiree joe hoagland who didn t vote trump and won t in 2020 said he sees no evidence that trump has been a boon for manufacturing i don t see any revitalization hoagland said when you talk about bringing employment back you can t just all of
