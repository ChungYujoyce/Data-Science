apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic democrats are increasingly fending off accusations that their impeachment inquiry is chiefly a mission to oust president trump from office or damage him politically rather than the solemn fact finding quest for truth they have claimed with more witnesses set to testify this week republicans on sunday pointed to democrats recent shift to focus on bribery in the wake of focus group testing as evidence that the impeachment inquiry is intrinsically political in nature the worst part is they don t care about the substance they know they have nothing so now they re making it up and polling to figure out what is best to sell to the american people rep doug collins of georgia the top republican on the house judiciary committee said on fox news sunday morning futures see also nancy pelosi trump will have every opportunity to present his case that was a reference to reports that house democrats campaign arm conducted polling that showed the use of the word bribery provoked a bigger reaction than quid pro quo or extortion in relation to allegations that president trump withheld military aid to ukraine for political reasons house speaker nancy pelosi and other democrats have been saying in recent days that mr trump engaged in attempted bribery by threatening to withhold military aid to ukraine unless the country s leaders publicly announced anti corruption investigations including into former vice president joseph r biden still mrs pelosi said she had no idea whether bribery would be among the articles of impeachment should the house ultimately move to impeach the president she also said she wasn t sure whether the process would be wrapped up by the end of the year there s not even a decision made to impeach the president this is a finding of fact unfolding of the truth and then a decision will be made and that is a decision that goes beyond me the california democrat said in an interview that aired sunday on cbs s face the nation if he has information that is exculpatory that means ex taking away culpable blame then we look forward to seeing it she said of the president sen christopher murphy connecticut democrat acknowledged that it is a challenge to explain the impeachment process to an american public that might be more concerned about other things i think a lot of americans are paying attention to their pocketbooks are more concerned with the president s sabotage campaign against the affordable care act than they are with this impeachment inquiry mr murphy said on nbc s meet the press so we have a job to do to explain why this matters rep adam b schiff the chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence who has been leading efforts on the impeachment inquiry turned some heads when he attacked the president at a california democratic convention over the weekend we are a majority in one house and we will become the majority in the other and we will send that charlatan in the white house back to the golden throne he came from mr schiff said rep michael r turner ohio republican said sunday that mr schiff has been looking for a way to impeach mr trump for three years he s on the quest for impeachment he s obsessed with impeaching the president of the united states and a majority of the democrats were already on record of wanting to impeach this president before the ukrainian call even happened mr turner said on cnn s state of the union so i m certain we ll continue to see the long list of new reasons why adam schiff thinks this president should be impeached he said mr schiff s committee is scheduled to hear from a handful of current and former trump administration officials this week including gordon sondland u s ambassador to the european union mr sondland revised testimony he gave behind closed doors to say that he recalled telling andriy yermak a top adviser to ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky that ukraine would likely not receive the military aid in question until a public anti corruption statement under discussion was made public mr murphy said mr sondland is faced with a choice of whether his primary loyalty is to the united states or to mr trump it seems clear that he was in fact talking pretty regularly potentially with the president directly and if that were the case then he needs to explain that mr murphy said on cnn ultimately this is about his legacy and if it comes out that he misled the committee in his initial testimony or outright lied there are real consequences for him down the line mr schiff s committee also released transcripts over the weekend of closed door interviews with timothy morrison a former official on the national security council and jennifer williams an adviser to vice president mike pence on europe and russia issues mr morrison testified that mr sondland had communicated to mr yermak that he believed they could help expedite the aid if a prosecutor general would go to the mike and announce an investigation into burisma holdings burisma is an energy company where hunter biden a son of the former vice president held a lucrative seat on the board until recently ms williams testified that mr trump s mentioning such investigations on a july 25 phone call with mr zelensky was unusual and inappropriate david holmes an aide to a top u s diplomat in ukraine also delivered testimony friday to house investigators behind closed doors mr holmes said that on july 26 a day after the trump zelensky call he overheard a conversation between mr trump and mr sondland i heard president trump ask so he s going to do the investigation mr holmes said according to his opening statement ambassador sondland replied that he s going to do it adding that president zelensky will do anything you ask him to marie yovanovitch a former u s ambassador to ukraine testified publicly friday before mr schiff s committee mr trump tweeted about her during her testimony leading some democrats to accuse the president of witness intimidation she started off in somalia how did that go then fast forward to ukraine where the new ukrainian president spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him it is a u s president s absolute right to appoint ambassadors the president tweeted ms yovanovitch said the real time attacks were very intimidating asked whether he was trying to intimidate ms yovanovitch mr trump said friday that he just wanted freedom of speech mr turner said that while the president s tweets can be unfortunate they don t amount to witness intimidation it s certainly not impeachable and it s certainly not criminal and it s certainly not witness intimidation he said it certainly wasn t trying to prevent her or would have prevented her from testifying she was actually
