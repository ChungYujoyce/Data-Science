charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore slowly and gingerly the united states is rebuilding its military presence in the asian pacific and in two cases doing so at the invitation though cloaked in diplomatic double talk of the philippines and vietnam in 2012 the philippines reopened to the u s navy subic bay a onetime major american naval base dating to the end of the spanish american war that same year vietnam reopened the huge and largely abandoned naval base at cam ranh bay with the caveat that it was to be used by u s noncombat vessels the navy pulled out of cam ranh bay at the end of the vietnam war and was more or less forced out of subic bay by the philippine government in 1991 meanwhile japan undoubtedly with tacit u s approval is abandoning a ban that has stood since the end of world war ii on the export of weapons and military materiel the related events are as the associated press put it part of an obama administration policy of reasserting the u s role as a pacific power after a decade of war elsewhere it is also a clear and growing reaction to the chinese military buildup and china s growing aggressiveness in asserting jurisdiction over disputed islands in the south china sea the islands

legislature s adjournment changes how tennessee s city governments can annex new territory no longer can city governments expand their borders simply by adopting an ordinance tennessee farm bureau points out that the new law prescribes two and only two paths to annexation one way is by referendum which gives those who might be annexed a voice in the decision the other path is for property

us overlook even today yet americans cannot and should not forget this era in which triumph overcame tragedy while the civil rights movement brought out the worst in some citizens it brought out the best in many others two men who represent the best of the era and its aftermath were in knoxville recently as part of the city s commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the passage of the u s civil rights act of 1964 the act provided equal access to public accommodations restaurants theaters and libraries for example for all races bill baxley a former alabama attorney general and doug jones a u

he made a vow to do something about it baxley said the bombing in a city where such bombings had become all too common was the final straw for the reputable white community it made good people who had been unwilling to get involved get involved he said while information from the fbi pointed to the ku klux klan no charges were filed following the initial investigation in fact local and state
