or persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion in his state of the union address president obama again confirmed that saving the climate remains one of his top priorities yet the recently concluded confab in lima peru didn t really conclude anything certainly no binding protocol to limit emissions of carbon dioxide but kicked the can down the road to the next international gabfest in paris scheduled for december recall however that in july 1997 the u s senate passed the byrd hagel resolution against a climate protocol by unanimous vote democratic sen robert byrd wanted to protect west virginia coal mining republican sen chuck hagel wanted to protect the united states from unfair competition a direct consequence of this bipartisan resolution was that clinton gore never submitted the infamous kyoto protocol to the senate for ratification kyoto was designed to put teeth in the united nations framework convention on climate change popularly known as the rio global climate treaty of 1990 kyoto expired in december 2012 after wasting literally hundreds of billions in 15 years without accomplishing its main goal of reducing global emissions of the much maligned greenhouse gas carbon dioxide on the contrary emissions rose mainly from greatly increased industrial growth in china which was fueled primarily by coal fired power plants at the same time of course global agriculture benefited from these higher levels of carbon dioxide which is a natural plant fertilizer the starving of the world really owe a vote of thanks to china top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey in november 2014 president obama and chinese president xi jinping inked an agreement that mr obama thinks might lead to another kyoto it was hailed as an important breakthrough however while the united states would have to cut carbon dioxide emissions drastically over the next decade china merely promised to peak its emissions by 2030 maybe but would be free to continue its industrial development at our expense it s a bad deal for the united states energy would become super expensive stifling economic growth forcing industry to flee and killing productive jobs all of the calamities that mr hagel back in 1997 feared might happen mr obama s war on coal is indeed making electricity prices skyrocket just as he promised in 2008 when he ran for president voters were beguiled by the vision of slowing the rise of the oceans and of saving the climate little did they realize that they were being fed nonsensical science and that high energy prices would instead lead to growth of poverty had they had the good sense to look at the european experience they might have rejected mr obama s siren song blame if you will the mainstream media tv hollywood greenpeace and the sierra club president george w bush could have saved the situation but he didn t here is a great opportunity for mr hagel to save the u s economy who else can boast of early opposition to kyoto he is no longer bound to silence as a member of mr obama s cabinet free to speak out he has much going for him we now have a congress anxious to take on a lame duck president on constitutional issues the courts are becoming skeptical of executive overreach public anger is rising toward the hated environmental protection agency internal revenue service and department of justice the public is also turned off by foreign policy disasters like benghazi and afraid of terrorism within the united states finally we also have a clear majority of states with like minded governors attorneys general and legislatures disinclined to support any international ventures especially through the united nations more specifically on the climate energy issue mr hagel can point to increasing evidence that nature rules the climate and always has not human activities he can point to the disastrous record of kyoto and scandalous waste of resources and human efforts and how saving the climate detracts from solving genuine world problems we can learn from the sad experience of europe with its rapid rise in energy costs leading to industry flight and job losses all caused by destructive energy regulations based on nonvalidated science we know of the shoddy science of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change exposed in independent non governmental panel on climate change reports the conspiracies documented by emails of climategate and subsequent whitewash efforts and finally the 18 year pause in global warming and failure of intergovernmental panel on climate change climate models to explain it that is why we must strongly oppose creating a second kyoto in paris in 2015 with the active assistance of india japan australia and canada who all share our doubts s fred singer an atmospheric space physicist is the founding director of the u s weather satellite service and founder of the non governmental
