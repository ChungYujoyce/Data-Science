aid trump on signing a relief bill for multiple u s disasters puerto rico should love president trump without me they would have been shut out tweet thursday the facts that s not likely the 19 1 billion disaster aid bill passed by the house on monday and signed into law by trump on thursday ordinarily would have been approved by congress months ago but trump injected himself into the debate demanding that money for hurricane rebuilding efforts that was sought by puerto rico s elected officials republicans and democrats both be kept out trump frequently inflated the amount of aid that puerto rico had obtained in previous bills and feuded with the island s democratic officials congressional democrats held firm in demanding that puerto rico a territory whose 3 million people are u s citizens be helped by the measure the legislation ultimately included more money for puerto rico about 1 4 billion than democrats originally sought the relief measure delivers money to states in the

really paying close to 100 of nato so we were paying to protect all of these european nations and it s just not fair interview thursday with fox news the facts it s not true that the u s was paying close to 100 of the price of protecting europe nato does have a shared budget to which each member makes contributions based on the size of its economy the united states with the biggest economy pays the biggest share about 22 four european members germany france britain and italy combined pay nearly 44 of the total the money about 3 billion runs nato s headquarters and covers certain other civilian and military costs defending europe involves far more than that fund the primary cost of doing so would come from each member country s military budget as the alliance operates under a mutual defense treaty the u s is the largest military spender but others in the alliance obviously have armed forces too the notion that almost all costs would fall to the u s is false in fact nato s article 5 calling for allies to act if one is attacked has only been invoked once and it was on behalf of the u s after the attacks of sept 11 2001 drugs trump look i m dealing with mexico right now they send

from what comes through our southern border they shouldn t be allowing people to come through their country from central from honduras and guatemala el salvador fox news interview thursday the facts trump is inflating the death toll from drug overdoses more than 70 200 in 2017 and wrongly blaming all the known deaths on mexico tens of thousands of those deaths have nothing to do with mexico or central america they are from legally made prescription opioids fentanyl laboratories in china or other sources of international drug smuggling and illicit manufacturing in the u s more than 17 000 of the deaths in 2017 for example were from prescription opioids alone mexico is indeed a significant conduit in the drug trade it s a leading source of heroin for example but it is hardly the only one

decade there have been 301 292 daily heat records set in the contiguous united states compared with only 141 892 daily cold records set according to retired weather channel meteorologist guy walton s analysis of government temperature records that s more than two heat records broken for every cold record a ratio that is the largest of any decade since these types of records started in the 1920s

the shooting in las vegas he said yeah yeah we are going to ban the bump stocks did he ban the bump stocks no because the nra came crashing down and said don t you dare do any restrictions on our guns around this country fox news town hall on june 2 the facts not true trump kept his promise a nationwide ban took effect in march on bump stocks the attachment used by the gunman in the 2017 las vegas massacre to make his weapons fire rapidly like machine guns the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives outlawed the attachments at trump s direction after the shootings killed more than 50 people in the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s history it is the only major gun restriction imposed by the federal government in the past few years the trump administration s move was an about face for the bureau in 2010 under the obama administration it found that the devices were legal but under the trump administration officials revisited that determination and found it incorrect after the las vegas shootings the national rifle association initially said devices designed to allow semi automatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations after the bureau s ruling banning the devices however the gun lobby called it disappointing and said it should have provided amnesty for gun owners who already have bump stocks the government estimates that more than 500 000 bump stocks were sold after they were made legal in 2010 veterans trump on the late sen john mccain i was not a fan i didn t like what he did with health care i didn t like how he handled the veterans because i got them choice he was always unable he was on committees and could have done it interview tuesday with morgan the facts not so mccain did in fact get the veterans choice program passed in congress trump repeatedly claims falsely that he was the first president in decades to get such a private sector health program passed but what trump actually got done was an expansion of the choice program achieved by mccain and sen bernie sanders the main lawmakers who advanced the legislation signed by president barack obama mccain an arizona republican co sponsored the legislation following a 2014 scandal at the va medical center in phoenix where some veterans died while waiting months for medical appointments trump signed the law expanding the program in june 2018 it is named after three veterans who were lawmakers mccain daniel k akaka and samuel r johnson after helping to pass the program mccain fought to expand it even more in his last months before dying of brain cancer in august the original choice program allowed veterans to see doctors outside the department of veterans affairs system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles 65 kilometers to a va facility under the expansion which took effect thursday veterans are to have that option for a private doctor if their va wait is only 20 days 28 for specialty care or their drive is only 30 minutes still the va says it does not expect a major increase in veterans seeking care outside the va under trump s expanded program partly because wait times in the private sector are now typically longer than at va london protests trump i kept hearing that there would be massive rallies against me in the uk but it was quite the opposite the big crowds which the corrupt media hates to show were those that gathered in support of the usa and me tweet wednesday trump i heard that there were protests i said where are the protests i don t see any protests i did see a small protest today when i came very small so a lot of it is fake news i hate to say and i didn t see the protesters until just a little while ago and it was a very very small group of people news conference tuesday with british prime minister theresa may the facts the protests over trump s visit were more than just very very small and some were hard to miss thousands of protesters crowded london s government district chanting as he met may nearby while police erected barricades to stop protesters from marching past the gates of downing street they could be heard as trump and may emerged from the prime minister s official residence to pose for photos before their news conference the protests included a giant trump baby balloon and a robotic likeness of trump sitting on a golden toilet reciting familiar trump phrases like no collusion and you are fake news brexit trump referring to how he stood at his scottish golf resort turnberry on the eve of the brexit referendum and predicted the british would vote to leave the european union i really predicted what was going to happen some of you remember that prediction it was a strong prediction made at a certain location on a development we were opening the day before it happened news conference tuesday the facts he often tells this false story trump did not predict brexit the day before the vote three months before the vote he did predict accurately that britain would vote to leave the eu the day after the 2016 vote not the day before he predicted from his scottish resort that the eu would collapse because of britain s withdrawal that remains to be seen transgender troops trump explaining his ban on transgender troops in the military in the military you re not allowed to take any drugs people were going in and then asking for the operation and the operation is 200 000 250 000 and getting the operation the recovery period is long and they have to take large amounts of drugs after that you can t do that interview tuesday with morgan the facts trump has offered no substantiation for the assertion that transgender military members represent tremendous medical costs and disruption a rand corp study found otherwise nor does the military bar troops from using prescription drugs rand estimates that out of about 1 3 million active duty military personnel 2 450 are transgender only a subset would seek transition related care such as hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery based on private insurance data the study estimates a minimal increase in costs from such care for the active duty armed forces no more than 0 13 or 8 4 million annually as for disruption members representing less than 0 1 of the total force would seek transition related care that could affect their
