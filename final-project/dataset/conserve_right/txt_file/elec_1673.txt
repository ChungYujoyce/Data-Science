 elaine ganley saturday 09 july 2016 04 35 pm le bourget france ap newt gingrich says that he thinks donald trump is a necessary candidate who reflects a global anti establishment sentiment but that he wouldn t automatically say yes to an eventual proposal to become trump s running mate in an interview saturday with the associated press the former house speaker also said a test should be devised to check the safety credentials of syrian refugees based on sharia or islamic law it s a very important way to vet muslims if you believe in western civilization he said gingrich said that he thinks trump will make his choice on a running mate late next week thursday or friday so they go into the weekend with the new vice presidential candidate as a positive story leading into the convention monday gingrich said he has been vetted for the job but he has yet to decide whether to partner with trump were he to be asked i think we would want to talk it through and make sure we knew what the job was and what he had in mind because it s not an automatic yes he said indiana gov mike pence and new jersey gov chris christie are other possible trump running mates while gingrich may be reflecting about his own choice he said in the interview that trump s presidential candidacy is not happenstance i think he s a necessary candidate gingrich said the british vote to leave the eu and electoral successes in europe by populists is part of a worldwide movement toward really being angry at the establishment really feeling cheated by the establishment really feeling that government has failed and i think trump is part of that worldwide movement he said trump is perceived as divisive only in the sense that the establishment is faced with a popular uprising and the establishment doesn t want to give up all of its perks and all of its power gingrich said do i think donald trump is perfect no do i think compared to hillary clinton donald trump would be a radically better president yes hillary clinton is a nightmare he said gingrich was one of numerous former u s officials and international dignitaries attending a giant annual gathering of the people s mujahedeen of iran outside paris the exile opposition group calling for regime change in iran is based in france gingrich said he counts them as modern muslims but has less tolerance for some syrian refugees and other muslims i think particularly with regard to syrian refugees it is just plain a lie for the united states government to suggest that they have any ability to vet who these people are gingrich said officials don t know their loyalties he claimed and lack intelligence capabilities in syria to find out a test on whether or not a person believes in sharia law would be revelatory because belief in islamic law is incompatible with secular law he said he didn t elaborate on how such a test would be administered gingrich also reiterated remarks made a day earlier on cnn about racism in the united states saying white parents cannot know the fears of black parents it s an objective reality that if you are a white parent with teenagers you have dramatically less fear of the police walking up to them than if you re a black parent with black teenagers gingrich said and until we can have an open conversation both of how do you protect the police but also how do you protect the innocent i think we re not going to solve this problem he said the issue came into focus again following fatal police shootings of black men in minnesota and louisiana and the slayings thursday of five dallas police officers guarding a protest march over those shootings copyright 2020 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed newsmax comment policy keep discussions on topic avoid personal attacks and threats of any kind links will not be permitted newsmax moneynews newsmax health and independent american are registered trademarks of newsmax media inc newsmax tv and newsmax world are trademarks of newsmax media inc
