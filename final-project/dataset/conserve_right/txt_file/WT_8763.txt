n the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion on wednesday treasury secretary steven mnuchin declared that google s work in china is not a security concern as he told cnbc i don t see any area again the president and i did diligence on this issue and we re not aware of any areas where google is working with the chinese government in any way that raises concerns no concerns at all google s most disturbing chinese initiatives involve the co development of technology cooperation of this sort is so injurious to the united states that it should be criminalized by emergency presidential order top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 google the alphabet inc unit also believes its projects in china are benign we are not working with the chinese military a google spokesperson said in the middle of march the denial was clear and unambiguous it was as far as is publicly known true google s words however were exceedingly deceptive google is a participant in ventures in china that it must know directly benefit the people s liberation army the military of the communist party google has two cooperative partnerships and one investment that are of special concern first the company runs the google ai china center established in 2017 in beijing second google is participating in ai research at tsinghua university one of china s two premier institutions and is working with peking university the other top institution all three ventures are nominally civilian so why is google s categorical denial deceptive in china today xi jinping the ambitious ruler has vigorously promoted a trend he inherited from hu jintao his predecessor civil military fusion fusion as the word implies means all civilian research is pipelined into the military patrick shanahan when he was acting defense secretary discussed mr xi s policy the fusion of commercial business with military is significant he said in march before the senate armed services committee the technology that is developed in the civil world transfers to the military world closely linked to civil military integration is chinese criminality as mr shanahan mentioned in march there s also systematic theft of u s technology that facilitates even faster development of emerging technology at the moment google s activities in china do not appear to contravene american law but they are highly injurious to american national security especially because the company has turned its back on the pentagon google has announced it is not renewing the project maven contract an ai project with the defense department and it is not competing for the dod s jedi cloud computing project there is one way to put a stop to conduct that peter thiel the tech investor this month correctly called seemingly treasonous president trump referring to mr thiel s comments tweeted his administration would take a look into google besides looking there s something else the leader of the free world can do issue an emergency order to stop google and other companies from participating in tech ventures in china congress can then make such a ban permanent with legislation the time to issue that order would be now google s tech development investments in china are for the long term brandon weichert a national security analyst specializing in emerging technology told the washington times last week to build for the long term google he says has two areas of special interest in china first mr weichert predicts google s ai research in china will push the company to develop cloud computing capabilities and in this regard google is already starting to align with tencent the chinese internet giant on this matter in january of last year alphabet cross licensed technology with that firm and has been in talks with several potential partners about bringing cloud services to china second google will also need quantum computing capacity to get that mr weichert says google will be pushed into some sort of arrangement with the university of science and technology of china which is a partner in a quantum computing laboratory in anhui province the lab is linked with the people s liberation army rest assured unfortunately once china s quantum computing center is complete it will be impossible for google to resist going there and helping the chinese in their research mr weichert also publisher of the weichert report says beijing has every reason in the world to partner with google to obtain technology in some areas like quantum communications china has surpassed the united states in areas where the united states is ahead beijing is making big investments and getting the googles of the world to help china many say american innovation will suffer if u s companies are not allowed to cooperate with chinese counterparts and there is truth in that especially in the short term in the long term however u s companies will suffer by going into china beijing will do its best to make sure foreign firms will not be allowed to benefit from their chinese ventures how do we know that there s a sad history of foreign business in china moreover xi jinping has made it clear with his made in china 2025 initiative that he intends his regime to dominate 11 designated tech sectors in a half decade cm2025 as the plan is known in china may be a grossly inefficient state effort but the selfish character of the program is clear in the meantime with each investment western firms make into china the people s liberation army benefits mr mnuchin should know that google undoubtedly does mr trump must stop it gordon g chang is the author of the coming collapse of china follow him on twitter gor
