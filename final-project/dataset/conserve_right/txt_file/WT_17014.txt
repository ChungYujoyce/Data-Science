health threatening smog most days top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century but as they grow more prosperous chinese are demanding the right to know what the government does not tell them just how polluted their city is if people know what their air is like they are more likely to take action said wang qiuxia a researcher at local environment group green beagle who shows interested residents how to test pollution on a locally made monitoring machine beijing is frequently cloaked in yellow haze buildings a couple of blocks away are barely visible still beijing s official air quality index records the pollution as light a reading at odds with what many people experience a reason for the discrepancy is that the official index does not include the fine particles mr wang s group is tracking pm2 5 sometimes seen as soot or smoke pm2 5 is tiny particulate matter less than 2 5 micrometers in diameter or approximately one thirtieth the average width of a human hair that can result from the burning of fuels in vehicles power plants and agriculture government agencies did not comment for this report scientists say government measures are reducing pollution the ministry of environmental protection has announced plans to factor pm2 5 into air quality standards beyond the coarser pm10 already measured but not until 2016 one environmental official was quoted by state media as saying conditions are not ripe for the tougher standard as many places would fail the government always has this worry that if they tell the truth there will be social unrest but the reality is the reality whether you tell the public or not the danger is still out there said feng yongfeng a journalist and founder of green beagle whose mission is to raise awareness of environmental problems and help improve china s environment what matters now mr feng said is for people to conduct their own testing and see the truth right now green beagle is recruiting people across the city to test the air in their homes neighborhoods offices and public spaces it lends the sole monitoring device it possesses for up to a week some residents even set it whirring in the supermarket in return for lending the pm2 5 detector green beagle gets the readings and posts them on its website while the pollution choking china is testament to the country s explosive growth over the past 20 years so is the call for greater government transparency and cleaner air a new middle class that is increasingly well traveled and wired to the internet is turning its attention to quality of life and demanding official accountability firstly people on low incomes care about food and clothing once food and clothing is no longer a problem they start to care about the environment and health especially the air said mr wang 23 the green beagle activist chinese authorities have squared off against this more assertive middle class on matters such as computer censorship and contaminated milk in august 12 000 residents in the wealthy northeastern port city of dalian demonstrated against a chemical plant thought to be unsafe and the government promised to relocate the plant while posting pollution data on the internet is not specifically illegal challenging the government can be considered subversive in china where the government zealously guards data it considers sensitive in the past people have been jailed for leaking government economic data ahead of the release date the battle over beijing s air seemed to take off this fall amid a run of smog choked days pan shiyi a rich celebrity property developer who symbolizes middle class aspirations took to china s version of twitter to repost readings including pm2 5 from the u s embassy in beijing that measures air quality from a monitor on its roof and publishes them online every hour the u s embassy air quality readings are often bleaker than the official measures early this month during which hundreds of flights were canceled because of poor visibility at beijing s airport embassy readings went from hazardous to beyond index as pollution exceeded the scale used by the u s environmental protection agency beijing s environmental protection bureau said pollution was light deborah seligsohn an adviser to the washington based world resources institute said the government s air quality information isn t timely since it s an average of the previous 24 hours but she said the controversy glosses over the strides that china has made in combating pollution and that the united states did not begin measuring pm2 5 until after 2000 and enforcing limits until 2006 the government is making major moves to control the kind of pollution that was typical of london and los angeles in the 1950s and 1960s said ms seligsohn who lives in beijing it s a long process programs are in place to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide which come from power plants among other sources and which turn to pm2 5 in the air ms seligsohn said and there are plans to control emissions of volatile organic compounds which come from vehicles by 2015 some cities such as shanghai have announced that they will start using standards that include pm2 5 soon the eastern city of nanjing released pm2 5 statistics last month online be
