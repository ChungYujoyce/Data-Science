coming immediately aftera tumultuousyear the trade war with america has hit everyone xue ye a curator from hebei province told me at a dinner party in december 2019 not long before the novel coronavirus outbreak became public the leadership don t know what to do about it nor the hong kong issue the massive protests in hong kong were a popular indictment on the middle kingdom s lapse into authoritarianism under the newly crowned emperor for life the stars and stripes flags and the union jacks waving amida sea of hongkongers sent a message to the world if hong kong fails so goes the world s first line of defence wrote democracy activist joshua wong framing hong kong as a new west berlin though donald trump was hardly the embodiment of the protestor s lofty ideals this dissent was a symbolic coup for the us government the subsequent covid 19 outbreak came as another major pr blow for china right when its international image had been damaged by headlines about hong kong however the current administration in washington has beenshamefully ignorant of east asian concepts of face and unversed in the diplomatic language that has characterised sino us relations since henry kissinger met mao zedong in 1973 following the 2003 sars epidemic which emerged in a live animal market in china s guangdong province as well as outbreaks of bird and swine fluin the interim years the last thing beijing wanted was to arm trump with more yellow peril ammunition but that s exactly what has happened wuhan virus and china virus were promptly added to the us president s arsenal of insults despite this untimely dent in its international standing the communist party recognised covid 19 first and foremost as an existential threat at home a breach of an unwritten contract between people and party beijing based historian jeremiah jenne explains the idea of the unwritten contract is that the party delivers modernity and modernity is tied to a narrative of increased public hygiene since the establishment of the people s republic in 1949 party propagandists have worked hard to forge compelling national myths to galvanise a sense of unity particularly after an ideological vacuum emerged in the wake of the cultural revolution of 1966 to 1976 one recurring theme is that of liberation from the colonialism triggered by defeat in the first opium war when in 1842 british gunboats shamefully blew open a passage for competing powers to enter and start slicing up china the various imperial interlopers used the language of hygiene as justification for their imperial foray

diminishing autonomy at atime when covid 19 has forced protestors indoors despite the criticisms and the suppression of critics china s response has been largely viewed as impressive the symbolic building of a 1 000 bed hospital in just ten days and the efficient movement of medical personnel en masse to hard hit areas was a clear expression of what the world s second largest economy can achieve when it needs to as jenne observes china was able to deploy massive resources to combat the epidemic that s the difference between china and the us it would be harder to cover up an outbreak
