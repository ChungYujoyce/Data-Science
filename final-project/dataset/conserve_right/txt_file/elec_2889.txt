that moore had sexual contact with her when she was 14 the age of consent in alabama is 16 several additional women have since come forward to accuse moore of sexually inappropriate behavior moore denied the allegations saying in a statement obtained by fox news that the allegations are based on a lie supported by innuendo it seems that in the political arena to say that something is not true is simply not good enough so let me be clear i have never provided alcohol to minors and i have never engaged in sexual misconduct he said multiple republican lawmakers called on moore to step aside from the dec 12 special election however president trump offered his endorsement for the embattled politician and the republican national committee began supporting moore after having previously cut its fundraising ties to him white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said the president had no plans for an in person appearance on moore apos s behalf in addition the president previously signed off on a decision by the republican national committee to cut off support for moore apos s campaign but publicly trump unleashed his criticism on democratic candidate doug jones instead of moore the last thing we need in alabama and the u s senate is a schumer pelosi puppet who is weak on crime weak on the border bad for our military and our great vets bad for our 2nd amendment and wants to raise taxes to the sky jones would be a disaster trump tweeted on nov 26 and just over one week before the election trump said he needed moore s vote in the senate when it comes to certain issues such as immigration gun rights and judicial appointments trump also encouraged his twitter followers to vote for moore on the morning of the election as he contended that moore will always vote

alabama sen luther strange who lost the special election primary to roy moore called the allegations disturbing it is too late to take moore off the ballot but strange has been encouraged to launch a write in campaign i think if what we read is true and people are on the record so i assume it is then he should step aside ohio sen rob portman said sen ben sasse r neb called the washington post s story heartbreaking sasse also slammed the republican national committee for providing funds to moore s race this is a bad decision and very sad day i believe the women and the rnc previously did too what s changed or is the party just indifferent sasse said on twitter this sends a terrible message to victims it s not that the party won t believe you if you come forward it might but just doesn t care the senator than warned that if the national republican senatorial committee decided to contribute to moore he would no longer be a donor to or fund raiser for it these are serious and troubling

right to respond to these accusations sen bill cassidy r la officially withdrew his support from the candidate based on the allegations against roy moore his response and what is known i withdraw support he said i stand with the majority leader on this these are serious and disturbing accusations and while the decision is now in the hands of the people of alabama i believe luther strange is an excellent alternative sen orrin hatch r utah tweeted but a week before the election hatch said trump didn t have another choice but to endorse moore bloomberg reported he also said that many of the things he allegedly did are decades ago so it s hard to that s a decision that has to be made by the people in that state if they make that decision who are we to question them hatch said we apos ll probably never know for sure exactly what happened sen pat toomey r pa said onnbc apos s meet the press but i think the accusations have more credibility than the denial i think it would be best if roy would just step aside south carolina sen lindsey grahamtook to twitterto say moore should step aside in the alabama senate race in light of the most recent allegations and the cumulative effect of others i believe moore would be doing himself the state the gop and the country a service by stepping aside graham said if he continues this will not end well for mr moore he has also bemoaned trump s attempt to throw a lifeline to moore house speaker paul ryan r wis said if the allegations are true they would disqualify moore from the special election these allegations are disqualifying if true anyone who would do this to a child has no place in public office let alone the united states senate ryan saidin a statement i would say unless he can provehis innocence the burden is now on himwithin the next day or so i believe he has to step down he owes it to himself he owes it to the state and and he owes it to theu s senate new yorkrep peter kingsaidafter the allegations came out in a tweet

years oldasassistant state attorney is wrong it s just plain wrong he told cnbc adding that he agreed with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell who said earlier monday that moore should step aside we need to stand for basic principles and decency has to be one of those bush added in the really poisonous political environment we have right now one of the rules i think has to apply is that when you attack somebody on the other party and the other team for doing something wrong when it happens on your team you have an obligation i think to speak out as well the president apos s daughter had some harsh words for moore there apos s a special place in hell for people who prey on children i apos ve yet to see a valid explanation and i have no reason to doubt the victims apos accounts ivanka trump told the associated press while she didn t name moore former secretary of state condoleezza rice who is from alabama encouraged voters to take a stand for our core principles and for what is right these critical times require us to come together to reject bigotry sexism and intolerance rice said in astatement to al com it is imperative for americans to remain focused on our priorities and not give way to side shows and antics i know that alabamans need an independent voice in washington but we must also insist that our representatives are dignified decent and respectful of the values
