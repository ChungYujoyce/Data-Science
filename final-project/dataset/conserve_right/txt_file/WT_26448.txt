tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion president trump is correct to be concerned about the european union s over reliance on natural gas imports from russia in the interest of western energy security it is important that the president s foreign policy team elevate the building of the trans caspian pipeline tcp to the top of america s foreign policy priorities initially proposed by the united states in 1996 the tcp is a global energy transportation project that would connect central asia to europe via azerbaijan and the caspian sea this 186 mile underwater pipeline would connect the turkmen port city of turkmenbashi on the eastern shore of the caspian sea to baku across the caspian sea when combined with natural gas export from kazakhstan and uzbekistan tcp could carry close to 50 billion cubic meters bcm of natural gas from central asia along the southern corridor pipeline system through azerbaijan georgia and turkey into europe the southern corridor pipeline that has the full support of the united states and european union originates in azerbaijan this pipeline system currently carries close to 4 bcm of natural gas but is planned to export close to 10 bcm after 2020 an investment of around 5 billion would allow for a small underwater interconnector to be built across the caspian thus linking central asia to europe top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender there are four overarching geo political and economic benefits that would accrue from the realization of tcp first diversifying natural gas supplies into europe will enhance the continent s overall energy security according to the european commission 69 percent of europe s natural gas needs come from imports with a majority 37 percent or 155 7 bcm coming from russia in view of moscow s checkered history of playing politics with its energy exports it is important that europe lay the foundations for reliable and stable imports of natural gas from new suppliers if as a result of tcp 60 bcm of europe s current 401 bcm of gas imports were to be provided by azerbaijan uzbekistan kazakhstan and turkmenistan europeans can rest assured of stable energy security the second rationale for a stronger support of tcp by mr trump s foreign policy team has to do with economic development of central asia and the caucasus region specifically the u s has an interest in the stable economic development of and job growth in central asia currently the combined gdp of kazakhstan uzbekistan and turkmenistan stands at 250 billion if over time tcp adds just another 5 percent to the gdp of these muslim nations it would mean an extra 12 5 billion annually ironically prosperity and stable economic growth in central asia and the caucasus is not only in america s interest but would also benefit russia prosperous nations with high per capital incomes along the periphery of russia means moscow can sell more of what it produces into these regions the third benefit of tcp relates to an immediate consequence of economic development within central asia namely its impact on employment opportunities for the youth although there is no scientific correlation between youth unemployment and radical islam in central asia preventing the region from becoming an incubator for islamic extremists can be addressed through economic growth and job creation here too washington should impress upon moscow that the success of the muslim countries within the region in not allowing religious extremism to incubate in central asia is to the benefit of russia for example if only 10 percent of the financial gain that moscow currently receives from annual gas sales to europe were to accrue to uzbekistan kazakhstan turkmenistan and azerbaijan it would translate to 2 3 billion this sum could be directed to job training apprenticeships and scholarships for the youth in central asia the final geo political advantage of tcp is that it solidifies the key role of azerbaijan as the reliable and stable anchor of western energy security the late american statesman zbigniew brzezinski described this secular muslim nation of 9 million as the cork in the bottle of caspian energy exports indeed azerbaijan and the united states share a common goal of uninterrupted development and transportation of energy exports from the caspian sea region to europe one of the first steps washington can take to achieve this global energy project is to encourage azerbaijan and turkmenistan to jointly develop the kapaz sardar oil and gas condensate field in the caspian sea this baby step will give confidence to turkmenistan uzbekistan and kazakhstan to join forces with azerbaijan to build tcp and even though american energy companies have started to reorient themselves to developing shale oil gas in the u s either european energy giants such as eni or middle east companies such as uae based adnoc or saudi aramco can take the lead in building operating and maintaining the trans caspian pipeline in 1996 president clinton placed american energy interests on the top of his agenda and supported the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline that carries close to 1 million barrels of crude oil to europe each day from the caspian sea by placing the trans caspian pipeline at the top of his agenda president trump can score a big win for global energy security s rob
