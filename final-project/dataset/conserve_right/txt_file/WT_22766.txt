reversed course and now says it foresees no further rates hikes this year even with that change trump has kept up his attacks on the fed kudlow last week called for the fed not only to pause rate hikes but to cut rates by a steep one half percentage point and said the president believed that was the best course of action in a tweet thursday trump said the economy was looking very strong
