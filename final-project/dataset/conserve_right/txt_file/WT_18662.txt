apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic last week s presidential debate on foreign policy has sharpened attention on the candidates views on china and whether its large scale military buildup is a threat to u s security in response to a question during the oct 22 debate about the rise of china and future challenges for the united states president obama declined to name china as the greatest future threat well i think it will continue to be terrorist networks mr obama said top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey the president said china is both an adversary but also a potential partner that must follow the rules so my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that china plays by the same rules as everybody else he said sticking to economics and avoiding direct mention of china s military buildup republican nominee mitt romney in his response to the same question also declined to name china as a major future threat he instead asserted that the greatest national security facing the country is a nuclear iran mr romney then said he regards china as having an interest that s very much like ours in one respect and that is they want a stable world according to mr romney china doesn t want war chaos and fragmentation around the world because that would upset manufacturing and the 20 million people now moving from rural farms to cities in china who need jobs so they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open mr romney said we can be a partner with china we don t have to be an adversary in any way shape or form however observers note that china has not sought to promote freedom in pursuing its version of socialism in asia and the developing world instead siding with dictatorships and communist regimes we can work with them mr romney asserted we can collaborate with them if they re willing to be responsible mr romney then expressed worries about china s view of america s financial problems including the fact that china holds 1 trillion in u s debt securities he also criticized the obama administration s sharp cuts to the u s military as sending beijing the wrong signal they look at us and say is it a good idea to be with america how strong are we going to be how strong is our economy he said they look at america s commitments around the world and they see what s happening and they say well ok is america going to be strong and the answer is yes if i m president america will be very strong mr romney promised he would on day one of his presidency declare china to be a currency manipulator and impose tariffs they re stealing our intellectual property our patents our designs our technology hacking into our computers counterfeiting our goods he said the reference to hacking was the only mention of the security threat posed by china which u s officials have said is among the most aggressive nations engaged in military related cyberattacks the president then countered mr romney by saying that his administration had doubled exports to china as for u s military efforts to counter china s growing assertiveness in asia mr obama noted his administration s pivot to asia that is designed to maintain stability in the region and we believe china can be a partner but we re also sending a very clear signal that america is a pacific power that we are going to have a presence there mr obama said we are working with countries in the region to make sure for example that ships can pass through that commerce continues and we re organizing trade relations with countries other than china so that china starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards the president said that s the kind of leadership we ve shown in the region that s the kind of leadership that we ll continue to show one conservative u s official said he is impressed with the obama administration s tougher security related policies toward china which he said are more focused than the conciliatory trade and business oriented policies of the george w bush administration the romney campaign website focused more on the threat from china than mr romney did during the debate it states there is a danger of a future conflict with authoritarian china and calls for policies designed to encourage beijing to embark on a course that makes conflict less likely china must be discouraged from attempting to intimidate or dominate neighboring states the campaign policy statement says if the present chinese regime is permitted to establish itself as the preponderant power in the western pacific it could close off large parts of the region to cooperative relations with the united states and the west and dim hope that economic opportunity and democratic freedom will continue to flourish across east asia a romney presidency will implement a strategy that makes the path of regional hegemony for china far more costly than the alternative path of becoming a responsible partner in the international system mr romney also promises to counter china s accelerating military buildup with appropriate u s military forces to discourage any aggressive or coercive behavior by china against its neighbors maintaining a strong military presence in the pacific is not an invitation to conflict the campaign statement adds quite the contrary it is a guarantor of a region where trade routes are open and east asia s community of nations remains secure and prosperous a romney administration plans to expand the u s naval presence in the western pacific and assist american partners in the region including sales of advanced weaponry to taiwan the obama administration declined to sell the island nation advanced f 16 jet fighters amid fears of upsetting military ties with beijing which claims taiwan as part of china mr romney also would confront china on its human rights abuses something the campaign policy statement asserts the obama administration has failed to do if the united states fails to support dissidents out of fear of offending the chinese government we will merely embolden china s leaders the romney campaign said china cyberthreats a report by an asian oriented think tank warns that china is engaged in major cyberwarfare and cyberespionage operations that threaten u s national security and require a coordinated u s response the report by the project 2049 institute says the cyber domain is emerging as a new dimension in conflicts of the future based on beijing s political insecurities and its drive for total information awareness china s ruling communist party state authorities and the people s liberation army are waging a coordinated computer network operations campaign against a broad range of international targets the report says chinese cyber espionage poses an advanced persistent threat to u s national and economic security groups operating from chinese territory are believed to be waging a coordinated cyber espionage campaign targeting u s government industrial and think tank computer networks a dozen groups were identified and connected to the chinese military the most active ones operate from beijing and shanghai victims of the cyberattacks in the united states include u s government networks the defense industry high technology and energy companies think tanks and other nongovernmental organizations media outlets and academic institutions the report identified the military s general staff department third department as the main source and said one unit in particular the beijing north computing center is the chinese equivalent of the pentagon s new u s cyber command the report concludes countering a coordinated cyber reconnaissance campaign requires reducing the value of information through thoughtful deception enhanced counterintelligence greater cooperation with international partners such as taiwan and imposing costs through effective deterrence mckeon presses obama house armed services committee chairman rep howard p buck mckeon on monday wrote to president obama to press the white house on his recent requests for information about the sept 11 terrorist attack on the u s diplomatic compound in benghazi libya mr mckeon california republican is seeking answers from the pentagon and the u s military about what the military knew and how it responded during the attack by some 40 terrorists believed tied to the al qaeda linked ansar al sharia an islamist group that operated a camp in benghazi ambassador j christopher stevens and three other americans were killed in the attack on the benghazi consulate and annex mr obama said in an interview oct 26 that he immediately ordered efforts at securing personnel under attack there appears to be a discrepancy between your directive and the actions taken by the department of defense mr mckeon says in his letter as we are painfully aware despite the fact that the military had resources in the area the military did not deploy any assets to secure u s personnel in benghazi during the hours the consulate and the annex were under attack mr mckeon asks the president to explain whom he ordered to secure u s personnel how the order was transmitted whether he ordered specific military assets into libya whether air assets were sent into libyan airspace and if he communicated with the pentagon and military commanders members of the committee on armed services are keenly concerned that any breakdown in communication that may have occurred not be repeated mr mckeon says given your stated interest in transparency and sharing all relevant information with the american people and the families of our fallen i am hopeful you can prom
