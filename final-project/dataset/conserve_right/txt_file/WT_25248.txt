bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn president trump confirmed sunday that he spoke about former vice president joseph r biden in a midsummer call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky but said he did nothing wrong as democrats warned these latest charges may have crossed the rubicon and into impeachment territory leaving the white house on sunday mr trump insisted the conversation that has consumed washington for several days was largely congratulatory but he added it was largely corruption all of the corruption taking place it was largely the fact that we don t want our people like vice president biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the ukraine see also lindsey graham calls for doj probe of biden ukraine connection there is enough smoke here mr trump didn t say whether he pressed mr zelensky to investigate mr biden the front runner to become his democratic rival in the 2020 election or other members of the biden family during the july 25 call the wall street journal reported friday that mr trump urged mr zelensky about eight times to cooperate with his personal attorney rudolph w giuliani on investigating mr biden s son hunter biden over a possible nexus between the son s business interests and the vice president s push in 2016 to oust a ukrainian prosecutor the conversation is believed to be at the heart of a whistleblower complaint that the trump administration is keeping out of the hands of congress sparking yet another investigation into whether mr trump used foreign actors for political gain see also adam schiff trump withholding ukraine aid for biden dirt likely impeachable rep adam b schiff california democrat and chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence said sunday that congress needs to know whether mr trump held up 250 million in aid to ukraine as part of an attempt to extract dirt on mr biden the aid was released sept 12 but an unusual delay coincided with mr trump s interest in mr biden s activities if mr trump demanded such a quid pro quo then impeachment may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents said mr schiff who long has pushed impeachment investigations against mr trump this would be i think the most profound violation of the presidential oath mr schiff told cnn s state of the union we may very well have crossed the rubicon here the inspector general for the u s intelligence community who received a complaint about mr trump s interactions with the ukrainian leader deemed it an urgent concern yet acting director of national intelligence joseph maguire won t turn over the complaint to lawmakers house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat urged republicans on sunday to join democrats in calling for mr maguire to obey the law and turn over the whistleblower s complaint when he testifies before congress at midweek the law requires mr maguire to turn over the complaint she said so failure to do so would endanger national security and have a chilling effect on future whistleblowers we must be sure that the president and his administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the american people not the president s personal or political interest mrs pelosi said in a dear colleague letter that she sent to both democrats and republicans many republicans have rallied to defend mr trump either by questioning the whistleblower s motives or calling on the media to investigate mr biden yet sen mitt romney utah republican said he needs to learn more about mr trump s conduct if the president asked or pressured ukraine s president to investigate his political rival either directly or through his personal attorney it would be troubling in the extreme he tweeted critical for the facts to come out another senate republican patrick j toomey of pennsylvania didn t criticize mr trump directly but did suggest it would be wrong for a president to seek a political leg up from a foreign nation look it is not appropriate for any candidate for federal office certainly including a sitting president to ask for assistance from a foreign country mr toomey told nbc s meet the press that s not appropriate but i don t know that that s what happened here the president traveling in texas said he will consider ways to release details about his call with mr zelensky he also said he would have no problem with mr giuliani testifying to congress about his recent meetings with ukrainians he called his attorney a straight shooter but treasury secretary steven t mnuchin said forcing the president to hand over a full transcript of the zelensky call would set a poor precedent regarding presidential power and diplomatic confidentiality these are confidential discussions between world leaders he said mr trump questioned the whistleblower s motives saying presidents should speak freely with foreign leaders and you can t have people doing this he tried to flip pressure back onto mr biden pointing to the former vice president s claim that he never spoke about business with his son despite evidence to the contrary this is a very dishonest thing that joe biden did and then he said he never spoke to his son does anybody believe that one mr trump said mr trump also highlighted a statement from the ukrainian foreign minister who said his country did not feel pressured by the u s during the midsummer call it was a beautiful warm nice conversation it was put out last night also by ukraine mr trump said democrats say they cannot rely on that statement because ukraine is in an awkward diplomatic position and is beholden to the trump administration for aid money for at least one year and possibly five sen christopher murphy connecticut democrat said mr trump put ukraine through a nervous ordeal by holding back expected aid this summer mr zelensky was really worried about these overtures he was getting from particularly from rudy giuliani and he didn t understand whether this was an official government position these requests to investigate the former vice president mr murphy told nbc s meet the press recounting a visit to kyiv mr trump released the aid to ukraine on sept 12 and even extended 140 million more the president downplayed the delay by saying he was worried that the u s was shouldering too much of the financial burden i backed ukraine from the beginning but i m very upset that other countries aren t doing the same mr trump said germany should be spending much more france all of the european union should be spending money why are we spending money and they re not or at least they re spending very little by comparison so i m not happy about that the white house confirmed that mr trump is scheduled to meet with mr zelensky on wednesday on the sidelines of the annual u n general assembly in new york a meeting that is sure to fan the flames of the saga a senior administration official said mr trump will focus on congratulating president zelensky on his election victories and the incredible energy and success president zelensky has put forward in implementing the reform and anti corruption efforts dave boy
