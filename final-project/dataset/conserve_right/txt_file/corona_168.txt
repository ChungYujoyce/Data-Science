source ap photo evan vucci during a briefing at the white house tuesday afternoon press secretary kayleigh mceneny corrected democrat senator elizabeth warren after she presented false wuhan coronavirus data at a senate hearing earlier in the day i talk to dr birx regularly in fact i talked to her just before i came out here because i had some questions about some funny numbers i heard from elizabeth warren and she helped me to correct those numbers which i d like to correct here because i think it s unfair to the american people to give inflated case numbers and mortality numbers because it leads to those same americans making a decision to not get a mammogram to not have the cancer screenings they need so i d like to reveal some information dr birx just shared with me mcenany said elizabeth warren erroneously said there were 25 000 new cases today in fact there were less than 20 000 senator warren said there were 2000 deaths in fact there have been less than a 1000 i spoke to dr birx about that so i would encourage our democrat colleagues and all americans to make sure we re putting out good information because it does have consequences she continued meanwhile the white house continues to help states access testing supplies in order to get through the three phase reopening guidelines issued by the wuhan coronavirus task force last month president trump will continue to fight for the health safety and economic wellbeing of all americans especially those impacted in low income communities and disadvantaged communities presssec pic twitter com zvwlx1smhj editor s note want to support townhall so we can keep telling the truth about china and the virus they unleashed on the world join townhall vip and use the promo code wuhan to get 25 off vip membership and get access to great additional commentary and news you want thom tillis s first tv ad of the election is a candid one townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
