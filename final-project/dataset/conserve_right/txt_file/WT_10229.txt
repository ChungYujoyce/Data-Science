apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic aggressive chinese cyberespionage and digital warfare capabilities were major topics this week during talks between senior u s and chinese defense officials chinese defense minister gen liang guanglie said tuesday that china is not behind the relentless wave of cyberattacks against the united states a comment challenged by u s national security

becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 he then insisted that during earlier talks defense secretary leon e panetta also agreed on my point that we cannot attribute all the cyberattacks to united states to china in following what u s officials say is a denial and deception campaign gen liang said that china too is a victim of cyberattacks and all nations have an interest in stopping electronic attacks like those that use computers to steal money from bank accounts gen liang said he and mr panetta discussed ways their countries can jointly work to boost cybersecurity although no details were mentioned and the technical issues will be left to experts mr panetta then noted that both the united states and china have developed advanced technology in cyberwarfare and that other countries and computer hackers are behind attacks against both nations but because the united states and china have developed technological capabilities in this arena it s extremely important that we work together to develop ways to avoid any miscalculation or misperception that could lead to crisis in this area mr panetta said he was referring to the danger of a devastating future cyberwar that likely would involve crippling cyberstrikes to knock out military and civilian networks and infrastructure controlled by them although less confident about cooperation mr panetta noted that he appreciated the general s willingness to see if we can develop an approach to having exchanges in this arena in order to develop better cooperation when it comes to cyberattacks a u s official familiar with cyberwarfare capabilities said it appears the defense secretary was letting the chinese military off the hook for its massive data theft and cyberwar activities as part of an effort to try to befriend beijing s powerful military pro china officials in the obama administration apparently influenced mr panetta to follow a script that says any action to look out for u s strategic interests that even slightly upsets the partnership is viewed as too escalating the official said if mr panetta doesn t believe gen liang s assertions panetta should be calling liang out on it because panetta knows liang is lying for his country the official said if panetta believes liang he should know better and he is lying to himself and enabling china according to a pentagon source chinese military visitors as in past meetings declined to discuss the people s liberation army s cyberwarfare capabilities during the meetings this week china s cyberwarfare doctrine has been highlighted in numerous military writings including a 2008 article by pla senior col lin shishan of the department that conducts cyberwarfare operations col lin wrote that because of u s cyberweapons we must establish the information combat concept of attack and destruction of systems and look for crucial points in the architecture which will serve as precise attack targets paralyze the work of the systems and reach the goal of weakening and suppressing their ability to obtain information superiority the pentagon s annual report on china s military stated that in 2010 numerous computer systems around the world including those owned by the u s government were the target of intrusions some of which appear to have originated within china it noted that the methods of the intrusions and data theft are similar to those necessary to conduct
