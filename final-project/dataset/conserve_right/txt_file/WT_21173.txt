apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic former special counsel robert mueller drew a blank on the democrats opposition research firm fusion gps which penetrated the upper reaches of the fbi to feed the trump russia conspiracy theory fusion gps with money from the hillary clinton campaign and the democratic national committee hired christopher steele a former british spy who tapped kremlin intelligence officials to weave a dossier filled with allegations against donald trump including that he led an extensive conspiracy to have russia intervene in the election mr mueller s 22 month investigation found no such conspiracy top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches at the house judiciary committee hearing wednesday rep steve chabot ohio republican asked mr mueller when you talk about the firm that produced the steele reporting the name of the firm that produced that was fusion gps is that correct i m not familiar with that mr mueller answered his answer added to reviews by liberal and conservative pundits that the special counsel appeared somewhat disconnected from his own investigation his report mentions mr steele 13 times it refers to steele reporting in an uncritical way and how candidate and president trump reacted to it the report does not mention mr steele s employer fusion gps by name or its co founder glenn r simpson mr simpson a former wall street journal reporter orchestrated the dossier s circulation deep into washington power centers including the fbi the white house the state department and journalists working for the nation s most influential news sites mr mueller may not be aware of fusion but senate and house republicans conducted a number of interviews and hearings after the election to create a historical record of what fusion did to try to bring down mr trump a review of transcripts by the washington times showed that at least 10 clinton supporters directly or through middlemen fed russian trump conspiracies to the fbi james baker a former fbi general counsel told a house republican task force i had a jaundiced eye about everything yes i had skepticism about all this stuff i was concerned about all of this this whole situation was horrible and it was novel and we were trying to figure out what to do and it was highly unusual fusion launched four major initiatives to insert the dossier and its conspiracy allegations into the hands of people who could thwart mr trump first mr steele organized a meeting in england with a senior fbi agent in early july 2016 for the first time the bureau learned that mr steele was alleging a major conspiracy between the trump campaign and the kremlin for election meddling the agent said he would report back to headquarters second fusion capitalized on its hiring of a russia researcher nellie ohr to hook up the firm with her husband bruce ohr in 2016 mr ohr served as an associate deputy attorney general one of the justice department s most senior lawyers mr ohr then took on the unofficial job of fusion messenger to reach the fbi s hierarchy he met with mr steele that summer and took his dossier material to deputy fbi director andrew mccabe and his counsel lisa page in august ms page was having an affair with fbi agent peter strzok who had opened the investigation into the trump campaign both expressed in texts a deep dislike for mr trump and vowed to stop his ascent mr ohr also briefed andrew weissmann who headed the justice department s fraud division mr weissmann would later be recruited by mr mueller his old boss at the fbi as a senior prosecutor for the special counsel working with fusion mr ohr continued to brief the fbi for months after the election he even had his own special fbi handler in other words mr steele s tale of a vast conspiracy and criminal wrongdoing by mr trump had permeated fbi headquarters as the agency made critical decisions to go after the president former fbi director james b comey said he used the dossier as a guide to try to confirm mr steele s allegations which the bureau never did after mr trump fired mr comey in may 2017 mr mccabe opened an investigation into the president to determine whether he was a russian agent a charge right out of the steele dossier as fbi director mr comey embraced the dossier he briefed the white house on it as well as president elect trump the fbi also included the dossier as the main piece of evidence in a year s worth of wiretaps on former trump campaign volunteer carter page and decided to pay mr steele 50 000 to continue investigating mr trump after his election the fbi fired mr steele for talking to the press but continued to receive his material via mr ohr third fusion organized meetings between mr steele and reporters in washington and fourth fusion arranged for sen john mccain arizona republican to receive a dossier copy through his associate david j kramer mr kramer in december 2016 spread the completed dossier to the white house and to reporters buzzfeed posted the dossier s entire 17 memos in january 2017 and forever changed history mccain who died last august hand delivered a copy to mr comey in all the democratic opposition research firm that mr mueller said wednesday that he didn t know was the driving force in creating the dossier and spreading it around washington the dossier became a constant source of suspicion that mr trump and his associates were felons republicans wondered why mr mueller didn t investigate the dossier as russian interference in the election just as he did russian computer hacking and social media ranting mr mueller declined to answer when mr mueller later testified before the house permanent select committee on intelligence republicans knew he could not or would not talk about fusion gps or mr simpson instead they postured there is collusion in plain sight said rep devin nunes of california the committee s ranking republican collusion between russia and the democratic party the democrats colluded with russian sources to develop the steele dossier then there was the june 2016 trump tower meeting with russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya the mueller report narrated the 20 minute meeting but didn t explore at all ms veselnitskaya s relationship with mr simpson a paid clinton operative she got the meeting with donald trump jr and other campaign officials by promising dirt on mrs clinton but actually wanted to talk about removing u s sanctions on russian businesses ms veselnitskaya hired mr simpson to work for a wealthy russian and met with him at least three times during her u s visit natalia veselnitskaya colluded with the dossier s key architect fusion gps head glenn simpson mr nunes said the democrats have already admitted both in interviews would it surprise you that the clinton campaign dirty ops arm met with natalia veselnitskaya more times than the trump campaign did he added mr mueller s standard answer was outside my purview intelligence committee chairman adam b schiff california democrat was a big fan of mr steele s russian sourced dossier and quoted from it at public events but to him the russia story is all mr trump disloyalty to country those are strong words but how else are we to describe a presidential campaign which did not inform the authorities of a foreign offer of dirt on their opponent which did not publicly shun it or turn it away but which instead invited it encouraged it and made full use of it mr schiff said wednesday republicans said this is exactly what the clinton campaign did pay for russian dirt on mr trump from a foreign national mr steele and
