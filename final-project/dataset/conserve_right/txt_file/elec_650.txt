conversation surrounding kamala harris exit from the 2020 presidential race has been reaching some ridiculous places since the california senator announced she was dropping out yesterday harris herself blamed billionaires basically while supporters and pundits expanded the blame to also include sexism racism biased media coverage and other issues beyond the candidate or her campaign s control if you re wondering whether democrats picked up any introspection since hillary clinton s 2016 loss was chalked up to sexism racism third parties bernie bros and such the signs aren t looking so good on social media and cable news commentators keep coming back to alleged advantages enjoyed by other candidates personal wealth less scrutiny of their criminal justice records etc to supposedly explain why harris was forced to exit early and to complain how unfair it is that folks like michael bloomberg pete buttigieg and sen amy klobuchar remain in the race watching kamala harris drop out of the presidential race to avoid going into debt the same month michael bloomberg shoved his way into the competition with his billions means we should probably have a conversation about money in politics but we probably won t sam sanders samsanders december 4 2019 but all of these explanations fall apart with the slightest scrutiny whatever setbacks harris may have faced based on her race and sex they pale in comparison to the challenges she and her campaign staffers brought upon themselves staff and supporters have cited the senator s strategy debate performances and the flaws of her top advisors for why the campaign failed to sustain either popular or establishment liberal support the campaign certainly got its share of support from corporations and rich donors to start with sustaining harris through several democratic debate cycles so the fact that former new york city mayor michael bloomberg may be able to buy his way in to the upcoming debate by blasting the nation with a concentrated bout of self funded campaign ads hardly seems like the stinging indictment that some want it to be get back to me if bloomberg and all his cash have any shot at getting near the white house or even a second debate stage but for now bloomberg s brief moment in the spotlight means nothing and it s especially absurd to suggest he somehow knocked harris out of the polls her numbers had been steadily declining for months before bloomberg entered the race some people have taken to blaming the kamala harris is a cop meme and any criticism of the former prosecutor and state attorney general s criminal justice record while positioning these things as unfair gotchas and maybe even racist the independent offers a particularly bad example of this one that characterizes kamala is a cop criticisms as springing forth in response to her surging popularity and not something that many leftists and libertarians had been saying for a long time others complain that harris isn t the only former drug warrior and tough on crime politician and yet for instance amy klobuchar the senator from minnesota hasn t seen the same level of scrutiny over her prosecutor past former vice president joe biden hasn t been hit constantly for the 1994 crime bill though he has been hit some for all the justified critique of kamala harris record klobuchar was also a prosecutor who hasn t faced a fraction of that scrutiny biden still leading despite writing the crime bill and pete is up in the polls after his police force killed a black man during the campaign https t co jpp04c8f2s samuel sinyangwe samswey december 4 2019 most of the candidates have some bad criminal justice points on their records of course klobuchar biden and others should have to answer for their carceral ways with biden s burden bearing more recent examples than the crime bill for what it s worth but harris is the only candidate who explicitly positioned her campaign around law and order themes running with the tagline kamala harris for the people a callback to her time as a district attorney and repeatedly emphasizing her progressive prosecutor past harris all but wore a big sandwich board sign saying ask me about my history as a cop and then was completely unprepared when anyone did with the campaign blaming bigotry for folks noticing the very things harris herself kept harping on a lot of harris fans are holding out hope that she ll find a spot on someone s ticket as a vice president but this may be a bit delusional considering the spectacular flaming out of her campaign and the fact that both harris and her people seem to divide more than they unite harris allies have told me that they re worried about her viability as a vp pick because her sister seems to control so much of her operation and that s led to bad decision making and that won t fly on the bottom of the ticket https t co kykjcswpvg alex thomas alexthomasdc december 4 2019 harris could have technically held on a little longer as anna massoglia of open secrets points out she had more than 10 million in funds left there s still time for her to qualify for the next debate a candidate with her credentials and hype could with the right messaging still outlast the likes of tom steyer and exit respectably closer to the top of the tier choosing to leave now is a strategic decision no more need to attack potential future allies no need to fumble around with wishy washy messaging any longer since all those excess campaign donations can now go to harris next senate race dropping out of 2020 kamala harris says i m not a billionaire i can t fund my own campaign fec filings show her presidential campaign had 10 5m left on hand which she can use for her next senate election financial disclosure puts her net worth at 1 89 million to 6m anna massoglia annalecta december 3 2019 biden said he had mixed feelings about harris campaign ending she is afirst rateintellect afirst ratecandidate and a real competitor he told abc news twitter s new terms of service tos contain some cause for worry the changes amount to about 10 lines scattered through the 12 page document notes xbiz while some of them are mere clarifications from the previous tos and one paragraph concerns the twitter vulnerability reporting program there s one change in the terms of service that should concern those interested in the company s control over the content that one s followers see in a nutshell twitter has explicitly reserved the right to shadowban under the legalese of limit distribution or visibility of any content on the service in the current tos twitter reserves the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time and to remove or refuse to distribute any content on the services suspend or terminate users and reclaim usernames without liability to you the new tos adds to this the right to limit distribution or visibility of any content on the service the economic case for sex work decriminalization as the debate over decriminalizing prostitution becomes louder and part of a broader rethinking of the criminal justice system opponents still worry that prostitution is inherently violent and decriminalization would worsen the exploitation of women but economic evidence and theory says otherwise writes karl smith at bloomberg opinion smith looks at a study from economists scott cunningham gregory deangelo and john tripp economists studied craigslist which from 2002 to 2010 gradually introduced an erotic services section that allowed sex workers to advertise directly and anonymously on the internet the staggered rollout allowed the economists to measure the impact on each market as the service expanded as expected the market for sex workers expanded rapidly more important according to the 2019 paper the expansion of craigslist into a market led to a 10 to 17 reduction in female homicides to be clear that figure is not homicides among sex workers which are difficult to measure in real time but homicides among all women in the area this result so astounded the economists that they performed some tests to validate it it passed them all moreover effects have been demonstrated in other studies decriminalization in even parts of a city is associated with double digit declines in sexual assault a 2014 study of an inadvertent decriminalization of indoor sex work in rhode island from 2003 to 2009 found it resulted in a 30 drop in rapes this isn t mere correlation both the rhode island and craigslist studies use several methods designed to identify causation more here trump on u s tech companies they re not my favorite people because they re not exactly for me but that s ok i don t care kathryn watson kathrynw5

foundation we reserve the right to delete any comment for any reason at any time report abuses blaming everyone but kamala harris for her presidential campaign s collapse she ll make someone a terrible attorney general who s cock must i suck for the white house kamala harris perhaps voters don t want somebody whose main qualification for her job is the willingness to allow willie brown to fuck her it says a lot when the party that eagerly nominated hillary clinton finds kamala harris too incompetent corrupt tiresome for their tastes with a modicum of fairness towards the rank and file of the blue team they didn t really eagerly embrace hillary during the primary she just outmaneuvered bernie with the superdelegates and most likely bribed or threatened anyone else even considering running i think everyone else knew the fix was in so why bother dammi it went no further than the debate stage and an explanation for her lack of support by the party would be that the current insiders at the dnc are indifferent to that sort of approach by harris hello or maybe just maybe harris you know sucked as i mentioned in another harris post her giggles gave me the creeps marvel wants woke characters how about a woman villain the diabolical giggler the diabolical giggler she could take a big bong hit and say baby wants to fuck she sort of stumbled out of the gate as i remember when she said of course i smoked pot i m jamaican and then her dad came out and smacked her down totally not ready for prime time it would be easier to swallow this respect for the inherent value of democracy claptrap is these people didn t whine like little bitches every time it doesn t go their way someone has to lose every election if a lower tier candidate can t even drop out of a party controlled primary without it being just wrong then why should i care what the people who get elected come up with because i really don t there was no system suppression of her campaign harris entering the race was widely covered and she was viewed and portrayed in the media as a top contender after the first debate her standing in the polls declined as people got to know her and her record better kamala is taking a page from hilary s failed campaign blame blame blame lousy candidate lousy campaign perfect results twitter has explicitly reserved the right to shadowban under the legalese of limit distribution or visibility of any content on the service ah ha the government would be worse than dorsey how let us know when you can stop using the government if you violate twitter s rules the most they can do is kick you off twitter if you violate the government s rules the most they can do is take your stuff throw you in a cage and or execute you that is how the government would be worse if you violate twitter s rules the most they can do is kick you off twitter this is repeatedly and empirically demonstrated to be untrue and to the contrary it s not clear that if twitter youtube alphabet fb etc collectively decide to ban you that the collusive effort is refused more often than accepted private company this is just fine yes as a matter of fact it is not when they are violating contractual norms which you refuse to actually acknowledge seems like any sane person would stop using twitter then sue them for contract violation you mean sane people who have developed a paying industry from using the tools an industry built from an agreed to implication of free speech that is now violated at whims of a changing contract they have no say in you realize how stupid your argument is right the sooner twitter goes tits up the better twits up let s hear your alternative that doesn t shit on everyone s rights you have heard my alternative you ve completely ignored it because you are a dishonest hack i think twitter should be handled under contract clauses this includes the inability to change terms of service on a whim in no other contractual situation can a single side declare the terms to be changed including for past actions between the two groups twitter has done this multiple times as they have punished people for violations of current tos that occurred prior to the current tos changes you would know this again if you weren t a dishonest hack believe it or not jesse i don t hang on your every word if you mentioned this before i probably forgot it or missed it most of the time you are shilling for team red which is tiresome but let s think about your idea for a moment which has some merit in analogy to private property rights of real property if i invite you onto my property should i be bound by a specific contract with regards to your behavior that i may deem permissible or not i think i ought to retain the right to be arbitrary with regards to what i permit on my property or not of course nap violations and actual illegal behavior excluded if you want to start playing justin bieber songs at my house i think i ought to be able to retain the right to kick you off my property for wanting to play that filthy garbage at my house even if there is nothing illegal about playing justin bieber songs would you agree or should it be the case instead that if you want to play justin bieber songs at my house and in the absence of any specific contractual language between the two of us forbidding justin bieber songs that i should be the one restrained from preventing you from playing those songs at my house gee what a surprise the minute the conversation turns into a more serious direction jesseaz is nowhere to be found if he can t get a cheap insult out of it he s apparently not interested the share owners would just love it if the company unilaterally tied their own hands it s almost like you re not a libertarian at all man mastodon is right over there you can toot instead of tweet it even has better features but god forbid that you act in accordance with your principles and switch to a different service when you can whine to big daddy government instead i think you just wrote more words about kamala than any sane person would want to read i think it s the sex worker angle that drew her attention nice well kamala is bitching about everybody focusing on her past as a prosecutor instead of all the other things she s done and the only other thing she s done is willie brown so what else is there to talk about well done if you like investigative documentaries side splitting comedy vids and hard hitting interviews donate to reason today just for the record these are democratic deplorables she s calling out goddamn i had a from a previous thread goddamit again had a copy paste from a previous thread maybe you should learn to code hey the world needs ditchdiggers too poor kamela the patriarchy strikes again if only there were more female billionaires to rally behind her and push her over the line poor defenseless woman can t possibly compete in the world full of men maybe kamel and hillary could run together that would be quite the ticket and show those patriarchies once and for all until the next time now i wont sleep for a week she can t fuck em all decriminalization in even parts of a city is associated with double digit declines in sexual assault but what of the economic gains to a certain segment of the market brought about by prohibition trump on u s tech companies they re not my favorite people because they re not exactly for me but that s ok i don t care the part outside the quotes is trump s sentiment or the quoter s cutting edge journalism the part outside the quotes is trump s sentiment or the quoter s twitter s today the house judiciary committee considering president donald trump s impeachment plans to hear from four constitutional scholars about the historical underpinnings of the process the country s scholarship to a man has been infected with tds so i question the relevance more like they could only find four mind whores 3 of the 4 have openly called for trumps impeachment before ukraine so non biased authority figures actually i was amazed to turley on the list he s been a harsh critic of the democrat impeachment sham so far either they included him to provide a thin veneer of ideological balance or they re going to use his testimony as an excuse to not send any aoi to the house turley was the only witness allowed from the gop list precisely because he has openly criticized trump this bunch of butthurt feminine professors is not a good look the country s scholarship to a man has been infected with tds so i question the relevance did we go through four historical constitutional scholars about the historical underpinnings of perjuring yourself over a bj with clinton i can t recall the democrats have taken impeachment the nuclear option pulled the core out of it and are tossing it around like a radioactive football i wonder if future impeachments de jure de rigueuer de facto will meet the same standards say like if biden won the bribery impeachment could start just after the oath of office say like if biden won the bribery impeachment could start just after the oath of office if republicans in the fbi aren t already spying on him and compiling dossiers based on foreign intelligence the trump campaign will be starting from the back foot i take it she gets to keep the 10 mil she has left over sounds like a plan and a she will probably have a book tour complaining about why she dropped out she has learned a lot from hillary next she ll blame hillary for poisoning the electorate against cunty women candidates and she ll actually be correct true harris is a cunt she comes across as a cunt she has no skills to create a facade to hide her cuntiness she s a minor league hillary really an impossible task for her thoughts and prayers hear hear pretty much she s queen cuntycringe the campaign failed to sustain either popular or establishment liberal support so the democrats are the bigots and misogynists not even in the

wonder if it had anything to do with a 95 stfu from the commentariate i actually like this gag makes me laugh every time especially when the fortune went up from the previous day and obls explanation on why that s bad me too but it is getting old i guess obl didn t hear that deceased brother david koch left charles 50 billion of his fortune after hearing that charles was seen battling racoons for pizza crusts in the dumpster at the wichita pizza hut incorrect not long after david koch passed away his widow julia flesher koch became the richest woman on the planet by inheriting his fortune none

trump s impeachment plans to hear from four constitutional scholars about the historical underpinnings of the process according to the washington post when holding meetings is the entirety of your job my favorites are the meetings where you discuss when to have a meeting then you get to have a meeting to discuss what you re going to discuss in that upcoming meeting a los angeles police officer left his body camera on while fondling the breasts of a dead woman if he hadn t shot her then he didn t see a reason to disable it necro porn extreme stop and frisk of course harris supporters blame everybody else she s the victim never blame the victim always believe the victim more than two dozen correctional officers in baltimore were charged tuesday with using excessive force on prisoners at state operated jails private prisons must be shut down i love how harris and her campaign staff are calling the democrat electorate party administration and the left of center media racist and sexist for not falling in love with harris as a candidate they are not only chose wrong they are badly motivated if not outright evil for making that choice of course i blame you if it is not your fault then it it must be mine and that cannot be right some comments from leftists on harris leaving at this point we have 7 democrats qualified for the december debate stage and they are all white this is sickening no matter your candidate you have to recognize that going from the most diverse field ever in january to a potentially all white debate stage in december is catastrophic the implicit racism and sexism of electability is deeply damaging to democracy if kamala harris is dropping out today as is being reported that means among other things that no candidates of color are yet slated for the december debate six white candidates have qualified folks that s a huge red flag and we need to talk about it democrats are running on the issues they want a person of color on the stage they just don t want to vote for them all white debate stage in december is catastrophic perhaps to lighten the mood all the candidates could show up in blackface i thought corey booker was still in the race did i miss his inevitable flameout and warren she s a native of something oslo corey hasn t flamed out yet but i hear he s doing the next debate in drag the top candidates for the party of the kkk are all white and they are somehow surprised no matter your candidate you have to recognize that going from the most diverse field ever in january to a potentially all white debate stage in december is catastrophic did they not see the list of candidates for the dem primary last election the republicans had the most diverse field running into the primary in all seriousness there is an argument for some combination of racial and sex discrimination as a contributing factor in harris failure especially when you look at progressive support for other democrats who are also pro law enforcement boot lickers i m not about to cry for the problems of pro law enforcement boot lickers but there are plenty of other bootlicking democrats all over the county from the northeast where large city politics are dominated by the interests of law enforcement to california where democrat voters were perfectly happy to elect kamala harris as a senator in the general election when voters could only pick between two democrats why is boot licking suddenly not okay when a woman of color is involved i suspect the main opposition to charges of racism and sexism in the case of harris has to do with the people who are being accused of racism and sexism because we re talking about democrat voters is not a good reason why racism and sexism couldn t be a significant contributing factor separate from there choices they make based on race and sex there is nothing particular racist or sexist about republican voters racism and sexism are about making judgement about people on the basis of race and that definition doesn t change because the racists and sexists we re talking about are registered democrats either if a significant reason why democrats won t support kamala harris is because of her race and her sex then they are racists discrimination on the basis of race and sex is the definition of racism and sexism no matter how they like to imagine themselves in contrast to republicans there may be merit to that but also kamala harris has no charisma why was she able to win statewide election in california in the senate race we weren t even allowed to vote for a republican they changed the election law so that the two top vote getters in the primaries make the ballot for the general election so california s voters got to choose between one democrat or the other democrat they chose harris over loretta sanchez if she has enough charisma to win against all comers in california she has enough charisma to win nationally she ain t al gore in tennessee this seems to me more about white liberals in segregated communities opining with their racist and sexist hearts the only difference between san franciscans new yorkers and texans is that residents of texas are smeared as racists and sexists for mostly superficial factors like their down home accent the kinds of cars they like to drive and the kind of music they like none of which has anything to do with racism or sexism you ve never seen hypocrisy until you ve listened to someone who spent 750k on a house in north county san diego to get away from minorities decry the supposedly aesthetic marks of racism in middle america not saying you re wrong but harris has less charisma than klobuchar whose face and voice make me want to throw up harris has no personality bo identity don t know how exposed that was in california but it certainly showed with national attention the diagnosis on heels up harris is actually quite simple first nobody is particularly happy about heels up harris sleeping her way up the ladder women don t like that men particularly don t like old squeeze turning on them like horizontal harris did to uptown willie brown men especially do not like that second tulsi the team d frontrunner slayer destroyed heels up harris in the debate the media is avoiding that but tulsi just exposed her hypocrisy for the world to see third heels up harris just doesn t connect to people the nasally voice bitchy demeanor people got seriously turned off by that of course the msm loved her which shows you just how fucked up and out of touch these people actually are too bad really i was hoping heels up would make it to the convention she d have fucked it all up for everyone i would buy a lot of that if we were talking about the results of a general election or the results of a primary in a closed primary state this is about the polling of registered democrats this is about the donations by partisan democrats their refusal to support harris is why she lost the coverage i saw of harris relationship with willie brown was fawning with this piece from silicon valley s hometown newspaper being entirely representative what we re really doing when we rehash kamala harris s love life https www mercurynews com 2019 01 30 the unique harm we cause when we dissect a powerful womans love life 2 the associations you re making are generally made by republicans for the registered democrat who is paying attention to the race or is a donor their reaction to the observation that harris must have slept with brown to get ahead in california politics is you think every woman that gets ahead must have slept her way to the top how dare you you vile sexist i would buy a lot of that if we were talking about the results of a general election or the results of a primary in a closed open primary state ken shultz wish we had a preview button most of my friends are democrats and i haven t heard a single one even talk about harris path to her current position i don t think most people are in as deep as you are ken most i talked to just didn t like her record on criminal justice issues which were exposed during the debate or found her to be flippant and annoying during the debates ken your pointing out that it was essentially a coin flip between two people of differing races a latino and an african american in the state senate race harris assumed she was loved by the voters when in reality it was just pure chance i didn t not vote for either and note in california colorless white people are no longer a majority sacramento is the most evenly racially divers city in the world now a city of 500 000 people where the local economy is dominated by state government is diverse because white democrats in california aren t racists how much of a premium do home sellers charge not to live in a diverse part of greater sacramento i m a market oriented guy and price signals are informative meanwhile for some reason donors and registered democrats who pay attention to the primaries decided to go for other candidates are you willing to look at the national pool of progressives that created this outcome for harris and make the claim that racism and sexism couldn t have been a significant factor because they re wealthy progressives who make donations to the democratic party i m not those progressives are nowhere near as different from people in the rest of the country as they d like to imagine and to whatever extent racism informs the thinking of people elsewhere in the country they do likewise compare the median home prices in north county san diego irvine and manhattan beach on the one hand to the median price of a home in more diverse areas of the state and you ll see how much of a premium progressives are willing to pay to avoid living in area with a lot of diversity nothing is measured by the aesthetics of what we say rather racism is a function of the choices people make and when i see a hundred million progressive racists who are willing to pay a premium to live in a lily white community all over this country i find the argument that couldn t be racist because of the aesthetics of what white wealthy progressives say to be unconvincing i m not saying there wasn t racism when harris was elected we will never know since a colorless person wasn t allowed to run but the state is diverse enough and with there being more latinos than blacks in the state it may not have been racism or maybe pure chance and harris assumed that that chance win was real admiration when it wasn t i would agree on the rest of your point of progressives being closet racist in the rest of the country but here may just be harris unlikable it sounds like you re trying to prove a negative how can any of us know that racism or sexism didn t play a role hmmmmmmmm i m am contesting the argument that we know that racism wasn t a significant factor yeah and i m denouncing the underlying assumptions behind this which has a lot to do with the assumption that racism can t have been a factor in this because democrats can t be racists and i m using real world observations to back that for neighborhoods with a larger non white presence white flight is instead more likely in middle class as opposed to poorer neighborhoods these results not only confirm the continued salience of race for white flight but also suggest that racial white flight may be motivated to an even greater extent in middle class suburban neighborhoods theoretically these findings point to the decoupling of economic and racial residential integration as white flight may persist for groups even despite higher levels of socioeconomic attainment https www sciencedirect com science article abs pii s0049089x17305422 consider the implications if that isn t about the financial associations to the extent that the wealthier the neighborhood in question the more pronounced the drop in white population as minorities move in then what that about if it isn t about racism see my comment below i think we can wrap this into that thread those progressives are nowhere near as different from people in the rest of the country as they d like to imagine as someone that travels a lot of the country including the supposed blue wall states i d have to say that you re wrong there s a lot of cultural variation in the u s way more than you d like to imagine i didn t say there wasn t any cultural variation certainly in terms of aesthetic tastes if people in irvine ca think electric cars are cool and people in texas think pickup trucks are cooler that hardly speaks to the willingness of either group to pay a premium so their children won t go to a school with more minorities or the likelihood that they ll move out of a neighborhood once minorities move in of the 27 891 census tracts he looked at 3 252 experienced white flight which he defines as a neighborhood losing at least 25 percent of its white population between 2000 and 2010 these tracts experienced an average magnitude loss of 40 percent of the original white population whites continue to leave neighborhoods with significant levels of non white residential growth he reports strikingly kye found that relative to poorer neighborhoods white flight becomes systematically more likely in middle class neighborhoods at higher thresholds of black hispanic and asian population presence race not only remains salient in middle class neighborhoods he writes but motivates white flight to an even greater degree relative to those same effects in poorer neighborhoods a few specifics white flight eventually becomes more likely in middle class neighborhoods when the presence of hispanics and asians exceeds 25 percent and 21 percent respectively he writes https psmag com social justice white flight remains a reality because a progressive thinks using racial slurs is embarrassing like picking your nose in public that doesn t mean they won t move out once they feel like too many minorities have moved into the neighborhood it also doesn t mean they won t vote for someone other than kamala harris because of her race people are racist because of the choices they make based on race everything else is most aesthetics so as far as i can tell your argument is that because we can show that some white people are racist we can surmise that some democrats don t like harris because of her race well sure i don t think anyone is claiming that america is totally free of racism of course some people dislike harris because of her race i think the real thing people are saying is that she s blaming racism and sexism for her campaign s failure when there isn t really a ton of evidence to support that claim the claim that is being made by her campaign and various media types is that race and sex are the main factors that drove her decline if you or any of them really subscribe to that line of thinking than the onus is on you to prove it and describe why she was up in the polls in the first place showing that white flight happens based on race is not enough to show that kamala harris had to drop out of the presidential race because of racism if your point was that democrats can be racist and its silly to assume that just because they re democrats they aren t racist against black people i suppose my answer would be gee ken usually you have something more interesting and less obvious to say perhaps it is because the personality that people look for vote for in an ag is different from that of a president ag s are expected to be tough and president s likable if a significant reason why democrats won t support kamala harris is because of her race and her sex then they are racists of course democrats are racists they were racists back in 2008 when they supported obama half black because of his race i m not sure about sexism though but clearly a candidate who is both female and black is a bridge too far for all partisans democrat gop and any others the thing about being the first to do something is that once somebody does it no one else can ever be the first person to do it again trump calls trudeau two faced after video surfaced from the summit this week https www foxnews com media trudeau johnson macron appear to be mocking trump at nato summit in surfaced video of course trump mean black and white faced reminds me of a star trek episode which absolutely could not be made today https www youtube com watch v 3tfdcqspod4 schiff and nadler it s like the ds are trying to lose shhhhhh when your enemy is about to self immolate don t stop them biden said she is a first rate intellect a first rate candidate and a real competitor with great legs to boot he said that right before he stuck his face in her hair and took a deep breath while biting his wife s hand and she is clean and articulate which is something since they tell me she is actually black and her mother s family ran a convenience store in delaware the kamala harris is a cop meme and any criticism of the former prosecutor and state attorney general s criminal justice record while positioning these things as unfair gotchas and maybe even racist and legitimate attacks on hillary were all sexist as bad as a media mindlessly lashing out at a president is one that blindly covers for her this woman s presidency was going to be awful twitter s new terms of service contain some cause for worry if you want to stop worrying about twitter changing their terms of service there s an easy way to avoid that you can always choose not to use twitter on mastodon you can host yourself and write your own terms of service or you can choose from a number of competing nodes with competing terms of service if you like https en wikipedia org wiki mastodon software we don t need the government to protect us from things we choose to do to ourselves and we don t need the government to give us options that are already available it doesn t mean you can t be concerned with a company openly flaunting contractual norms and changing terms of services with vague language that allows them to be advantaged in said agreement with the user who they make money off of i m more worried about things that impact me directly in fact because i don t generally use twitter i m more concerned that the attempt to regulate twitter will impact me in ways that have nothing to do with twitter maybe that s the center of the problem right there i don t need to be subject to twitter s tos if i don t want to be subject to twitter s tos but i will be subject to the laws and regulation some people are pushing to address twitter s tos over my objections and against my will you see the difference there right the officer allegedly flipped off his bodycam and inappropriately touched the woman the recording devices worn by lapd officers continue to record for two minutes after deactivation what an outrageous story how can police equipment not deactivate immediately cold ethel hardest hit wow so jack dorsey and the rest of the lowlife scummy gutter vermin at twitter are slowly making their terms of service a little less dishonest and fraudulent i guess that s something if they really want to be 100 honest they should just say left wing anti american political opinions only welcome here if twitter finally was honest and change their tos to left wing sentiments only i would agree with the sophistry of the but private company folks like baby jeffrey it is weird watching a certain set of sophomoric libertarians defend dishonesty in contracts and advertisement under the fortune cookie mantra of but private company the fact is even with these more honest changes the language is still so vague that it would be thrown out in most contract disputes in normal matters but because the tos sends disputes to california and notably san francisco the judges allow it to continue it is weird watching a certain set of sophomoric libertarians defend dishonesty in contracts and advertisement under the fortune cookie mantra of but private company it s probably because they forget this is literally one of the few legitimate reasons for government existing in the first place i did notice that a lot of people didn t have any problem with the government declaring twitter a government communications outlet though i guess backdoor nationalization isn t a big deal when you have critics to silence i can t say that it s the same people offended over both issues though generally speaking not sure what that says about people so harris is calling her democratic party all kinds of names sounds like one of those jokes where groucho wouldn t want to be a member of any club with standards so low it let him join hey according to harris the ds let white billionaires in the ds want black billionaires too but they keep running away from the plantation no they don t want that they don t want any billionaires to exist to the extent that they want parity they want to bring down the top to be closer to the bottom thus in essence they want to reduce everyone s income down to that of black laborers rather than they want to raise black laborers incomes environmental groups band together to demand action on plastics air polluion from epa a coalition of conservation groups delivered a petition tuesday in san francisco demanding the u s environmental protection agency stop approving petrochemical projects that produce millions of tons of plastic and waft greenhouse gases into the air https www sfchronicle com environment article environmental groups ban together to demand 14879522 php cmpid gsa sfgate result i m sure they all took selfies on their granite encased phones well if the flintstones could have all their stuff made out of rock why can t we harris fans blame billionaires sexists and racists for her campaign s collapse but not russia i guess that s kind of progress she could go the stacey abrams route and simply declare she won the nomination a los angeles police officer left his body camera on while fondling the breasts of a dead woman he was looking for drugs when the chief said search her for drugs he thought he said dugs while supporters and pundits expanded the blame shaming peeps into voting for a tyrant solid plan question what do the new testament the leader of the virginia colony in jamestown the ussr and donald trump all have in common answer if any would not work neither should he eat 2 thessalonians 3 10 kjv you must obey this now for a law that he that will not work shall not eat except by sickness he be disabled for the labors of thirty or forty honest and industrious men shall not be consumed to maintain a hundred and fifty idle loiterers journals of captain john smith in the ussr work is a duty and a matter of honor for every able bodied citizen in accordance with the principle he who does not work neither shall he eat soviet constitution of 1936 the trump administration is set to tighten work requirements for recipients of federal food aid potentially rendering hundreds of thousands of people ineligible for the program by mid 2020 for able bodied adults without dependents u s law limits snap benefits to three months unless recipients are working or in training for 20 hours a week states can waive those limits in areas where unemployment runs 20 above the national rate which was 3 6 in october the new rule requires the unemployment rate to be 6 or higher for states to issue such waivers the rule also curbs the amount of discretionary exemptions from federal work requirements that states can issue able bodied adults without dependents in 2018 represented about 2 9 million people or 7 3 of all snap recipients according to the usda wall street journal december 4 2019 https www wsj com articles trump administration to curb states control of food aid 11575455401 between things like this and trump fighting to cut 772 billion in direct spending on medicaid no president has fought harder to cut spending on socialist welfare programs than president trump yes snap is still a socialist program even if the communists of the soviet union circa 1936 weren t so stupid that they d do what we re doing no president since world war ii has fought harder to cut spending on socialist welfare programs than president trump ken shultz that s what i meant to type military spending has increased under trump congress passing spending first of all but he is granted the power to do so now show us where the authority for snap resides to raise and support armies but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years to provide and maintain a navy to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union suppress insurrections and repel invasions to provide for organizing arming and disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress to whatever extent the military is like a welfare program snap and medicaid are actual welfare programs meanwhile the legitimate libertarian purpose of government is to protect our rights we have police to protect our rights from criminals we have courts to protect our rights from the police we have a military to protect our rights from foreign threats it s certainly possible that we re spending too much on the military that our military is overextended or that our spending on the military is wasteful in various ways however military spending is fundamentally a legitimate libertarian function of government redistributing wealthy by way of snap rent credits and medicaid isn t a legitimate libertarian function of government at all socialism is about a number of things in practice in principle it s about from each according to their ability to each according to their need to whatever extent we cut the tax burden we address the first half and to what ever extent we slash spending on snap rent credits and medicaid we re addressing the part about the redistribution of wealth no president since world war ii has fought to slash social spending more than donald trump newt gingrich fought hard to cut social spending but not as much as trump newt gingrich also wasn t a president and isn t running for president against a gaggle of socialists in 2020 like president trump yeah i know we get it when trump does something good trump gets all the credit when trump does something bad like say sign a bloated spending bill it s always someone else s fault well most would need to admit that even if trump vetoed a spending bill it would still pass so essentially you re bitching that trump doesn t have more power while also saying he s a piece of shit pretty funny chemjeff is so hilarious he thinks people actually take what he says as anything but a joke like i said not his fault the bar is always lower for trump ah i see now as usual your only point is to criticize the die hard trump supporters yet nary a word on the democrats that wrote the spending bill with a veto proof majority yes that seems very impartial i thought the president signed or refused to sign spending bills from congress and the military is the most socialist organization in the us government by far do snap recipients play golf on tax payer funded courses do they attend military military schools visit military hospitals dance to the music of military bands no is the answer and the military is the most socialist organization in the us government by far and yet it isn t even the most funded is there a us government outfit that gets more funding than military is there another us government outfit that features subsidized golf is there another us government outfit that features subsidized golf literally all of them is there a us government outfit that gets more funding than military social security there s no department of social security there is a department of defense which eats up a staggering amount of money yearly which is growing thanks to in part to trump s efforts last i checked there s a social security administration and if you re going to include the entire military budget as one lump aggregate then it s only fair to lump in all the beneficiaries of social security in with their administration but this of course assumes you re at all interested in honesty as opposed to throwing non sequitur molotov s you still have not articulated how trump can stop funding for the dod via a veto proof majority btw there is a social security administration organizational structure of the social security administration the military is more socialist than social security are you sure about that one the military is more socialist than social security clearly so do social security bureaucrats have golf courses constructed for them get subsidized clothing food education housing medical care they don t these socialist benefits are for the military entirely funded by the tax payer consider that the purpose of our military is to provide security for many nations around the world social security only provides for a small subset of that group namely us citizens with a small caveat military funds have been used to build all sorts of things in the name of reconstruction after we bomb a country back to the stone age also military funds go to disaster relief our military is one of the largest disaster relief organizations good thing military spending still pales in comparison to entitlements even after increases only retards compare the two as even approaching the same levels of expenditure but of course that s responding to your absurd non sequitur your statement has nothing to do with anything good thing military spending still pales in comparison to entitlements trump is president it s all good orange doesn t rhyme with other words so coconuts taste better trump is president and it is all good yes in ussr one pretended to work and the government pretended to feed you the tanks they built weren t pretend the tanks they built weren t pretend yeah and why is green but even the soviets in 1936 even the fucking communists wouldn t give able bodied people free food for nothing by 1989 the soviets could scarcely provide food to people with jobs the communists said you had a right to a job progressives circa 2020 want to go much further than that they think you have a right to free food they think you have a right to fruit of someone else s labor the communists saw that as the decadence of the leisure class bourgeois they weren t about to let people sit on their asses and profit from the labor of others capitalism is only different in that it s okay to profit from the labor of others so long as laborers are being exploited willingly capitalists also have a term for people who use the government to get free things in exchange for contributing nothing that s called rent seeking every president since world war ii has been afraid of calling it out for fear of offending the rent seekers and the people in the media who adore them have i mentioned recently that there s an obesity epidemic among the poor in this country and the suggestion that it s unrelated to snap benefits is absurd grape soda is purple purple is a fruit only your modern progressive leftist is so foolhardy as to ignore the past 2000 years of evidence that shows that humans are selfish bastards generally and if you pay them to not work plenty of them will never work probably enough of them in fact to crash whatever system you put in place socialists and communists are probably better aware of that fact than capitalists are i d say why do people think slavery ever existed in the first place because of evilness no it s because it was easier for the enslavers to enslave than to do the work themselves same as it ever was but even the soviets in 1936 even the fucking communists wouldn t give able bodied people free food for nothing because they had full employment there was a desperate need felt by stalin to build the military to face the threat he saw from europe the free food and money doled out by the us under trump is because of less than full employment something that wasn t a problem in the command economy of the soviet union because they had full employment hahahahaha laugh while you can monkey person we re all monkey people and i ll always laugh at the notion of soviet full employment i don t need your permission to do so laughter is the best medicine as long as you don t laugh at the notion of us unemployment i don t know if you consider the soviets to have had full employment it s obvious the united states must also have full employment today if you consider the soviets to have had full employment in 1936 it was pretty close to full employment there is unemployment in the us today and that is why the government under trump continues to hand out free food and money to able bodied americans given that we know for a literal fact that the soviets were never even in the ballpark of full employment your claim must then be extended to the u s who quite certainly has a far lower unemployment rate today than the ussr did at any point in their entire history so you have effectively made the claim that the united states has full employment today just like the ussr did whenever you want to cherry pick a date or time of course you ll understand that if you cite a soviet publication regarding their full employment that you ll be laughed out of the room even modern day russian scholars will laugh at you no one believes that lie except you and stalin apologists although i probably repeat myself on that point given your view on european aggression towards stalin s ussr the russians simply called the unemployed employed as a matter of rhetoric regardless of if they worked at any particular job that s not measuring that s a joke and literal communist propaganda i guess he s classifying standing in line as a job in 1936 it was pretty close to full employment you got a link for that which isn t soviet propaganda the russians simply called the unemployed employed as a matter of rhetoric regardless of if they worked at any particular job it was ken shultz who claimed the soviets of 1936 would never give money or food to people who didn t work if you disagree with him don t hesitate to tell him directly no one should have to choose between having enough food to eat and owning the latest smartphone and a big screen tv no one should have to work for food when i was a kid my 80 something year old grandmother pulled up to this guy carrying a sign that said will work for food she said hop in my lawn needs mowing and i ll be happy to make you a sandwich the bum replied with expletives and i say bum in the technical sense as my grandmother explained to me there s a big difference between a bum and a hobo in her day back during the great depression hobos would come up to your door and they d offer to do some work in exchange for food and the right to sleep in your barn that night they were poor but they were decent if not respectable bums will sneak into your barn to sleep at night and steal a chicken as they leave working for food is the most normal thing in the world i appreciate the urge people feel to help others in need i ve volunteered at soup kitchens myself the snap program isn t saying you can t have any food ever it s saying that if you re single and able bodied then you only get it for three months i can t imagine that giving able bodied people free food on an indefinite basis is genuinely helpful to them in the long run it certainly doesn t make us a better society to provide a moral hazard incentive to stay inactive and do nothing that s 2 9 million people on snap bless trump for even considering this that he wants to do this puts him head and shoulders above the progressive competition she said hop in my lawn needs mowing and i ll be happy to make you a sandwich that was a mistake to tempt a bum offer to fix him a cocktail bums are typically men who ve been discharged from military service and not prospered they spend their time begging drinking and horsing around but they were decent if not respectable hobos are more like indians than normal people trump fighting to cut 772 billion in direct spending on medicaid oh good heavens is this what historical revisionism has come down to it was only two years ago after all trump was at most a passive bystander in the entire obamacare repeal drama of 2017 he said over and over that he d sign whatever congress sent him he didn t fight for anything in fact one can argue that the reason why the entire effort collapsed in the end was because trump didn t show much leadership on this matter https www pbs org wgbh frontline article watch why president trump couldnt close the deal on obamacare repeal the president was not particularly engaged in the policy details that was pretty apparent rep charlie dent r penn tells frontline the president seemed to defer to congress largely and basically whatever you guys pass i ll sign with the freedom caucus holding out the president issued an ultimatum vote yes or he would walk away from the bill when the caucus refused to get on board and ryan delivered the news to trump the president called robert costa of the washington post taking his own party to task i don t need this broken republican party he said if they re not going to really help me if they re not going to get their stuff together costa tells frontline of the phone call what he really wanted was a win he wasn t pushing for an ideological win he wasn t pushing for a political win he wanted a win for donald trump and the republican party failed him blah blah blah lol your post actually underlines what ken said so thanks question could even a republican today win the nomination running on the type of law and order message harris ran on maybe but they would have to have other issues to go with it and they could not run on just that how harris thought she could win the democratic nomination with that message is beyond me what was her law and order message such messages today are usually about illegal immigrants committing crimes not letting chicago style killings migrate to one s own community and getting tough with pedophiles and child porn purveyors did harris run on any of that her law and order message was that she was a former prosecutor she hasn t been in the senate very long that was really her only record to run on i don t know if trump really ran on the type of law and order message harris ran on but i remember trump saying several times in his 2016 campaign speeches that i am the law and order candidate i have to put it in caps because everything trump says in his speeches is in caps today the house judiciary committee considering president donald trump s impeachment plans to hear from four constitutional scholars about the historical underpinnings of the process according to the washington post boooooooring of course since obama is considered a constitutional scholar i m left to wonder if perhaps that label is meaningless judging by them our legal system is entirely fucked i would even admit that it s possible obama actually is a constitutional scholar after all this is no requirement for someone that knows the constitution and what it means to follow it also it s usually considered wise to know your enemy so it shouldn t shock anyone that those who want to destroy the constitution are able to cite it plans to hear from four constitutional scholars about the historical underpinnings of the process sounds to me like they are reaching to find justification other than articles of impeachment themselves when i see that it usually means their main argument is not good could you imagine george bush having a hearing on the historical underpinnings of war in an attempt to justify restarting the iraq war my friend s sister is dropping 12 kilos each 3 weeks she has been over weight however final month she commenced out to take those new nutritional nutritional dietary supplements and she has out of place 40 pounds so far check the internet website on line proper right here http www me2gold com 12 kilos each 3 weeks damn dude that s a lot of cocaine she should seek counseling the neocon case for trump now in december 2019 u s military forces remain in southern syria fighting continues in the north between turkish forces and various syrian factions but in retrospect trump s withdrawal antics look more than a bit like strategic political camouflage and psychological preparation that gave the raid that killed an operational boost trump s withdrawal bombast sent a psychological message to islamic state terrorists the coward americans are going home we don t need to worry about delta force i have sketched two cases where president trump likely employed diplomatic and psychological feints to advance american security interests see trump s withdrawal antics were really just a ruse to trick al baghdadi into a false sense of security so that he could easily be killed trump really has no intention of bringing home our troops and ceasing the endless meddling in places we have no business meddling so stop worrying that somehow your mic stocks are going to take a hit rejoice that trump is a globalist as dedicated to endless war and world policemanning as we are just make sure you don t accuse trump of being all talk and no action of lying or of breaking promises it s just 7 d wizard chess of which trump s a master and you re an ignoramus we should probably have a conversation about money in politics yeah no money stay out of politics dude is right one thing we have never ever ever talked about is money in politics about time that changed speaking about money in politics https www yahoo com news clinton donors charged massive campaign 131442639 html i bet these same people also believe the statement money is power while also believing we should invest more power in the federal government what a bunch of fucking morons prof feldman you were an impeachment skeptic with the mueller report were you not explains why he called for impeachment regularly starting in march 2017 because he was a skeptic harris fans blame billionaires sexists and racists for her campaign s collapse so the good reverend will need to face up to the fact that the democratic party is full of racist sexist billionaires probably should read racists and sexists and billionaires it is not required that they be all three i note that the media is less than concerned about schiff spying on journalist john solomon he took his phone records too violating privacy to protect law seems so fucking noble the dude has spent the last several months telling us that talking to foreign governments to dig up dirt on political opponents is treasonous all while having been caught on tape talking to someone that he believed was an fsb agent from russia with dirt on trump the mind boggles i m happy to not see that permanent smirk on her face anymore discounted from this article is the weak and fanciful financial message most of the dem candidates have and how that will limit enthusiasm for their campaigns warren is having this trouble now and will probably doom her campaign the majority on the left are not people who believe in free everything and at least understand high level finances and can tell that a candidate s multi trillion annual expansion of government service cannot possibly come to fruition stossel pointed out that harris actually have the largest proposed increase even more than bernie the socialist it s hard to take a candidate seriously that is proposing such nonsense if you re wondering whether democrats picked up any introspection since hillary clinton s 2016 loss was chalked up to sexism racism third parties bernie bros and such the signs aren t looking so good said enb waking up from her two year long nap whatever setbacks harris may have faced based on her race and sex she faced none you see that s the joke klobuchar was also a prosecutor who hasn t faced a fraction of that scrutiny biden still leading despite writing the crime bill and pete is up in the polls after his police force killed a black man during the campaign you might not like buttegieg but one of these things is not like the others yeah biden s not like the others you can criticize an old straight white guy but only democrats can criticize a woman and not be called sexist or a gay man and not be called homophobic that s not true harris called democrats racist when she said that is the reason why shes not winning considering the democratic nominee is mostly determined by democrat voters also being a gay white man is no longer a protected class to most democrats gay white men are the white men of the non hetero crowd here is something else kuntala harris had said http groups google com d msg soc culture israel k4ovsdoxglm gdo8uxl1bqaj local law enforcement must be able to use their discretion to determine who can carry a concealed weapon said kamala harris who was then the california attorney general i have always wondered how blacklivesmatter would view this after all according to their narrative cops are just klansmen with badges who habitually gun down unarmed black men how could we trust such people with discretion to determine who may carry a concealed weapon and yet just yesterday she tweeted this today we remember mikebrown and recommit to ensuring truth transparency and trust in our criminal justice system blacklivesmatter so i wonder if any reporter from the network broadcast and print media would ask her any of the following questions if the reason that l ocal law enforcement must be able to use their discretion to determine who can carry a concealed weapon is because they are just klansmen with badges why shouldn t the stormfront white nationalist community also get to decide who can carry a concealed weapon if the reason that l ocal law enforcement must be able to use their discretion to determine who can carry a concealed weapon is because they habitually gun down unarmed black men why shouldn t the crips also get to decide who can carry a concealed weapon is more black men dead or in prison a worthy price to pay to make lawful gun ownership more difficult is making lawful gun ownership more difficult a worthy price to pay to put more black men in prison does some magical guardian fairy turn these klansmen with badges into freedom riders whenever they exercise their discretion to determine who can carry a concealed weapon harris is a billionaire sexist racist who knew i m not sure why we need the digested version of a trump quote from a blue checkmark and her quote formatting was weird she put part of his literal words in quotes the rest out of quotes even though the whole statement was literally what he said here s the whole quote but the techs you know they re american companies the tech companies that you re talking about they re not my favorite people because they re not exactly for me but that s okay i don t care they re american companies and we want to tax american companies phil that s important we want to tax them that s not for somebody else to tax them what he said here may not be considered particularly politic in regards to a subset of american corporations but for the most part i would judge that comment as mostly true i don t really care about what he thinks about the tech companies in fact the tech companies are suffering a bit of an image problem with the democrats too but the rest of his quote is telling he s essentially taking a progressive position on corporate taxation wouldn t you agree can we please please please stop using twitter as a news source but the rest of his quote is telling he s essentially taking a progressive position on corporate taxation wouldn t you agree is he he seems to be saying that foreign entities shouldn t be receiving tax revenue off u s companies as absurd as that might be his comment about wanting to tax u s companies appears to be subservient to this comment about foreign taxation it s word salad but it seems clear enough and we want to tax american companies phil that s important we want to tax them that s not for somebody else to tax them i could easily be wrong but then i don t disagree that twitter is shit for reporting i agree with your assessment completely can we please please please stop using twitter as a news source whenever i see a journalist s articles filled with loads of embedded twitter posts or content consisting entirely of what he said she said on twitter i stop giving a shit about the article i also lose what little respect i had for the journalist that wrote the article can we please please please stop using twitter as a news source but if we did that then mindless cunts like enb would have to go fuck old men for money instead of trawling social media all day like a middle school adolescent and calling it journalism money sexism and racism are at the core of the democrat party what s her complaint if you re wondering whether democrats picked up any introspection since hillary clinton s 2016 loss was chalked up to sexism racism third parties bernie bros and such the signs aren t looking so good yeah i mean everybody knows the real reason hillary lost was because of russian facebook ads right mindless cunt horizontal harris fans need to blame themselves for hitching their cart to the wrong corrupt donkey so democrats run for president to have more money to spend on elections where they have a chance except bernie he likes to buy vacation houses i blame hillary that s all at least hillary could write a book with all the people she blamed harris fans blame billionaires sexists and racists for her campaign s collapse and don t forget whitey he s the root of all evil maybe harris quit because most democrats don t like her yep had nothing to do with her being a lying bitch right she is a shrill angry bitter condescending and childless career technocrat added to that she has the emotional empathy and self awareness of a rock that s why her campaign tanked it s also why hillary romney mccain kerry dukakis and just about every other second banana in the presidential races lost in the last 30 years all successful presidential candidates pass why i call the bus ride test if for some reason you ran into one of them and struck up a conversation on a bus after a few hours you would end up liking them you might not agree on much but you d come out of there thinking they re okay as people that is not true of any of the losers harris fans blame billionaires sexists and racists for her campaign s collapse i didn t know harris was a billionaire too maybe she can sleep with one of the
