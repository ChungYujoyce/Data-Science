apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic hong kong ap it was almost noon on monday when hundreds of protesters outside hong kong s legislature voted to break in watching from the side one protester disagreed they were too few 19 year old daisy chan worried and the police presence was heavy as hours passed thousands more trickled into the plaza and a nearby roundabout the police retreated into the building angry protesters shattered windows with carts sledgehammers and metal barricades top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed chan thought of three protesters who had died and of the hong kong leader s refusal to meet the activists though she didn t want to break in she believed her role was to support the others by 9 p m when they finally pried open a metal security curtain that led inside chan believed nothing could assuage their anger you ve been standing at the entrance for eight hours she recalled shouting at other protesters perched on a fence by a second entrance the police have already retreated if you want to get in if you want to do what you want to do you should get in now chan and three other protesters including two who gave assistance to others outside the building but didn t actually enter told their story to the associated press this week they said years of feeling ignored drove them to desperation in the city of 7 4 million a semi autonomous chinese territory whose independent legal system is only guaranteed for 28 more years and already faces threats they explained why on the same day that hundreds of thousands of others marched in a peaceful protest they were driven to wreak havoc inside hong kong s legislature in scenes that shocked the world now they await the consequences monday was the 22nd anniversary of the former british colony s return to china and the protesters were angry for three weeks they had tried to get the government s attention by blocking streets defacing police headquarters and occupying government offices along with more peaceful protesters they were opposing the government s attempt to change extradition laws to allow suspects to be sent to china for trial but felt ignored that morning hong kong chief executive carrie lam had clinked champagne glasses in a televised ceremony celebrating the anniversary her first public appearance in two weeks her refusal to back down on activist demands and her silence over the deaths of the three protesters turned grief into simmering rage one fell after hanging a banner at least one other in an apparent suicide left a message on a wall asking others to persist in the fight as demonstrators began assaulting the complex chan grabbed futilely at those who rushed to tackle pro democracy lawmakers blocking the entrances she and the lawmakers were worried public opinion could turn against the protesters someone could get hurt chan had been staffing aid stations and handing out food and water all for one goal safety first we knew getting into legco already is high risk chan said using a common name for hong kong s legislative council but they had no hope people trying to get in had one clear appeal which is that there are three people dead already protesters smashed glass and poured into the complex joining others who flooded in from a second breach chan swung into action two weeks earlier during marches in mid june she had formed a resource station team with about a dozen protesters one of many that coalesced in demonstrations and school campuses to help with protest logistics they coordinated on telegram an encrypted messaging app chan wanted to know how to direct her group next she called a hong kong legislator whose name she wouldn t disclose and got floor plans and a warning to leave lawmaker offices and the library untouched chan walked into the complex with another member of her team nick and began scouting the second floor for police she was worried about the safety of other protesters after finding none she shouted orders on a walkie talkie to her team smash security cameras shatter hard drives seize the control room and protect the library which contained priceless historical artifacts destroy what is needed keep what is needed said nick explaining they wanted to minimize damage while making their point and protect protesters from surveillance we attacked only things that are iconic we know what we are fighting for they scouted up to the fifth floor then headed to the control room on the ground floor they stopped by the library and left a note asking protesters to leave it unharmed other protesters tore down portraits of pro beijing lawmakers they spray painted hong kong s emblem black smashed elevators plucked cameras out of ceilings and scrawled slogans calling for free elections you taught me that peaceful protests are useless read one sprayed by the entrance to the council s main chamber political awakening chan nick and two others in the resource station interviewed by ap didn t always think peaceful protests were useless the failure of hong kong s pro democracy umbrella movement which all four participated in changed their minds chan was 14 when she saw violence erupt on her family television screen masked police firing tear gas into crowds of students in september 2014 until then chan had been a regular hong kong schoolgirl she liked baking pastries and dreamed of being a chef her parents ran a grocery store she didn t think much about politics the images of police pepper spraying protesters shocked her i thought it was very insane chan said they were just sitting days later she was on the streets participating in her first demonstration nick who only gave his first name because of concerns about being arrested was a freshman in college his father owned a car dealership enough for a middle class living classmates buzzed about the movement on social media anger at beijing s decision to pre screen candidates for hong kong elections spoke to nick who felt the chinese government ignored the desires of the city s people he hit the streets cutting class and camping out for weeks when the umbrella movement ended with no changes after 79 days they were crushed it showed that even if you play peaceful sitting on the streets the government won t care about it nick said in their point of view you re just a bunch of people sitting on the streets after graduating in 2016 nick found a job as a nurse at a weight loss clinic then one at a call center then another at a pr agency the pay was terrible a little over 1 300 a month in one of the most expensive cities in the world he quit last year and became a freelance photographer shooting weddings and concerts nick wanted to live freely to forget about politics and live his life he dreamed of opening his own artist commune in an abandoned industrial building but he was struggling to survive let alone thrive there s not much hope left in hong kong said nick now 24 you can t afford anything in hong kong we just want a small place as our home but we can t afford it we re desperate year after year they felt the walls close in the disappearance of five booksellers specializing in sensitive topics forbidden on the mainland chinese immigration officers in a hong kong train station the terminus of a new high speed rail link with china a draft law criminalizing disrespect for the chinese national anthem the proposed changes to the extradition laws were the last straw the draft legislation said it wouldn t extradite for political crimes that it was limited to serious offenses punishable by seven years in prison but to nick lam s promises ran hollow i can t trust the government they give whatever china wants how can i trust carrie lam when she says they won t arrest people for political issues he said we all know it s a lie by the time protests erupted again this year their resolve had hardened this time they donned masks and helmets and braced themselves for demonstrations more violent than the umbrella movement it s just very simple says chan in china you don t even have freedom of speech you just speak one thing wrong you will be put in jail can you imagine in 28 years what will hong kong be nobody knows the escape it was almost midnight on monday when chan and nick heard others cry out the police are coming nick wanted to stay and occupy the council chambers other protesters had started building barricades and stockpiling food preparing for a prolonged battle with police but there were too few of them in the chamber the protesters voted to leave chan headed outside to keep watch for officers nick ran from room to room looking for protesters yelling at them police are coming don t be left behind they fled the ransacked building as police closed in and caught a minibus across hong kong s harbor some found rooms in a hostel while others headed home at 4 a m they watched on their phones as lam stepped out for a news conference condemning the break in as an extreme use of violence that stood in contrast to a separate largely peaceful march the same day nick was expecting lam s response what he wasn t expecting was how upset some of the reporters seemed to him one asking lam if she thought she had a place in heaven after ignoring the three deaths he said she brushed off the question they re blaming the protesters for breaking windows nick said but there are three people dead if you put it on a scale i think three lives are more important than three pieces of glass since then the group has moved from one friend s house to another to avoid police while contacting lawyers gearing themselves for arrest the members of their resource station met at a hotel restaurant on tuesday evening and decided to speak to the media yes they were scared yes they might get caught but for five years they felt they had tried everything and concluded the only tactic that worked was force we ve got noth
