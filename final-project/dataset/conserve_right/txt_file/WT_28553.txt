tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap the trump administration plunged into an extraordinary showdown with congress over access to a whistleblower s complaint about reported incidents including a private conversation between president donald trump and a foreign leader the blocked complaint is serious and urgent the government s intelligence watchdog said the administration is keeping congress from even learning what exactly the whistleblower is alleging but the intelligence community s inspector general said the matter involves the most significant responsibilities of intelligence leadership a lawmaker said the complaint was based on a series of events the washington post and the new york times reported thursday that at least part of the complaint involves ukraine the newspapers cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter the associated press has not confirmed the reports top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in

inspector general appeared before the house intelligence committee behind closed doors thursday but declined under administration orders to reveal to members the substance of the complaint the standoff raises fresh questions about the extent to which trump s allies are protecting the republican president from oversight and specifically if his new acting director of national intelligence joseph maguire is working with the justice department to shield the president from the reach of congress trump though giving no details about any incident denied thursday that he would ever say something inappropriate on such a call rep adam schiff d calif the chairman of the house intelligence committee said he was prepared to go to court to try to force the trump administration to open up about the complaint the inspector general has said this cannot wait said schiff describing the administration s blockade as an unprecedented departure from law there s an urgency here that i think the courts will recognize schiff said he too could not confirm whether newspaper reports were accurate because the administration was claiming executive privilege in withholding the complaint but letters from the inspector general to the committee released thursday said it was an urgent matter of serious or flagrant abuse that must be shared with lawmakers the letters also made it clear that maguire consulted with the justice department in deciding not to transmit the complaint to congress in a further departure from standard procedure it s unclear whether the white house was also involved schiff said because the administration is claiming the information is privileged schiff said he believes the whistleblower s complaint likely involves the president or people around him trump dismissed it all virtually anytime i speak on the phone to a foreign leader i understand that there may be many people listening from various u s agencies not to mention those from the other country itself no problem trump tweeted he asked is anybody dumb enough to believe that i would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially heavily populated call house democrats are fighting the administration separately for access to witnesses and documents in impeachment probes democrats are also looking into whether trump lawyer rudy giuliani traveled to ukraine to pressure the government to aid the president s reelection effort by investigating the activities of potential rival joe biden s son hunter who worked for a ukrainian gas company during an interview thursday on cnn giuliani was asked whether he had asked ukraine to look into biden giuliani initially said no actually i didn t but seconds later he said of course i did giuliani told cnn that trump was unaware of his actions i did what i did on my own giuliani said i told him about it afterward later giuliani tweeted a president telling a pres elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects us is doing his job among the materials democrats have sought in that investigation is the transcript of a phone call trump had with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy on july 25 this new situation stemming from the whistleblower s aug 12 complaint has led to their public concerns that government intelligence agencies and the recently named acting director might be under pressure to withhold information from congress trump tapped maguire a former navy official as acting intelligence director in august after the departure of director dan coats a former republican senator who often clashed with the president and the retirement of sue gordon a career professional in the no 2 position maguire has refused to discuss details of the whistleblower complaint but he has been subpoenaed by the house panel and is expected to testify publicly sept 26 maguire and the inspector general michael atkinson also are expected next week at the senate intelligence committee atkinson wrote in letters that schiff released thursday that he and maguire had hit an impasse over the acting director s decision not to share the complaint with congress while atkinson wrote that he believed maguire s position was in good faith it did not appear to be consistent with past practice atkinson said he was told by the legal counsel for the intelligence director that the complaint did not actually meet the definition of an urgent concern and he said the justice department said it did not fall under the director s jurisdiction because it did not involve an intelligence professional atkinson said he disagreed with that justice department view the complaint not only falls under dni s jurisdiction atkinson wrote but relates to one of the most significant and important of dni s responsibilities to the american people the inspector general said he requested authorization to at the very least disclose the general subject matter to the committee but had not been allowed to do so he said the information was being kept from congress these decisions the inspector general said are affecting his execution of his duties and responsibilities illinois rep mike quigley a member of the panel said atkinson said that the complaint was based on a series of events the inspector general s testimony was described by three people with knowledge of the proceedings they were not authorized to discuss the meeting by name and were granted anonymity associated press writers jonathan lemire eric tucker and zeke miller contributed to this report this story has been corrected to s
