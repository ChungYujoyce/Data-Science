ws sunday exclusive interview with the head of the environmental protection agency this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday april 2 2017 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news anchor i m chris wallace congress s investigation into links between the trump and russia gets sidetracked by questions of whether a committee chair is working to help the white house begin videotape rep adam schiff d california there s no question that there is a cloud over the investigation sean spicer white house press secretary what occurred between chairman nunes and coming here was both routine and proper rep jason chaffetz r utah it aposs very mysterious to me though why all of a sudden general flynn is suddenly out there saying he wants immunity i don apost think congress should give him immunity wallace we ll get the latest on what the president calls a witch hunt and what some democrats are calling a cover up when we sit down with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell then in the wake of the gop aposs defeat on health care president trump moves ahead with the rest of his agenda this week rolling back obama climate change policies donald trump president of the united states my action today is the latest in a series of steps to create american jobs and to grow american wealth wallace we ll discuss the president aposs move to revive the fossil fuel industry with scott pruitt head of the environmental protection agency it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive plus president trump attacks members of his own party but the house freedom caucus fights back rep justin amash r michigan it may allow a child to get his way but that aposs not how our government works wallace we ll ask our sunday panel about the growing civil war inside the gop and our power player of the week going even deeper into space unidentified male this telescope is 100 times more sensitive than the hubble wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the white house is fighting back against the investigation into possible links between the trump campaign in russia claiming the press and congress should focus instead on allegations the obama administration conducted political surveillance of the trump team in a moment we ll discuss the fallout with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell but first let aposs bring in fox news correspondent kevin corke with the latest from the white house kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris as is usually the case in washington scandals it aposs the cover up and not the crime that usually ensnares and there are legitimate questions about that with respect to the ongoing controversy over what house intelligence committee chair devin nunes know about possible surveillance of trump aides and how he came about getting that information news you may recall claim to have such compelling information he needed to rush to the white house and tell the president himself but he did that without sharing what he found with fellow members of the intelligence committee which is highly unusual this as fox news has confirmed that nunes received key information from a pair of white house aides calling into question not only his relationship with the administration but his ability to be impartial as this investigation unfolds concerns further complicated by his decision to delay former acting attorney general sally yates from testifying about possible links between russia and the trump campaign hearings that would have included former director of national intelligence james clapper and former cia director john brennan a washington post report you may have heard about suggested the trump administration was behind that delay something the white house strongly denies begin video clip spicer i hope she testifies i look forward to it it was never let s be honest the hearing was never was actually never notified if they choose to move forward great we have no problem with her testifying plain and simple the report in the washington post is 100 percent false end video clip corke chris speaker paul ryan said that nunes told him his source has a whistleblower type information we ll see what that means we don apost know at this point but what we certainly know is that mike flynn the former national security advisor had his rights violated in this saga we ll see if he s able to testify with immunity as time will tell we will see how that all turns out chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks for that joining me now from kentucky to discuss this and much more senate minority leader mitch mcconnell senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen mitch mcconnell r ky majority leader good morning wallace let aposs start with russia you were last month briefed by fbi director comey as part of the so called gang of eight congressional leaders have you seen any evidence of collusion between russia and the trump campaign or any evidence that the obama administration did anything improper in surveilling the trump team mcconnell well chris as you know i asked the senate intelligence committee to investigate all of these allegations senator burr and senator warner are going forward on a very constructive bipartisan basis the only thing i asked them to do is to find out what happened and once they found out what happened hopefully they will be able to a unanimous report and we aposll all know what if anything went on based on these allegations wallace do you worry and obviously we don apost know what went on do you worry though that this continuing controversy is interfering with the president aposs ability to push his agenda mcconnell well it aposs certainly not helpful the president aposs actual agenda has been really quite constructive all the efforts to begin the deregulatory effort we need to get the economy moving again a fabulous supreme court nominee that i know we aposll be discussing later moving it forward on tax reform this is just what the country needs to get the kind of growth rate that would produce jobs and opportunity for the next generation wallace i want to ask you one last question about russia too before we get to the supreme court justice given all of the politics on all sides the continuing controversy why not appoint an independent 9 11 style commission or have the justice department appoint a special counsel so you have a truly non partisan independent investigation that everybody can trust mcconnell it aposs just not necessary based on what we know now we aposve got a bipartisan investigation underway it aposs called the senate intelligence committee senator burr and senator warner had a joint press conference this week i think they clearly laid out that they aposre going wherever the facts take them we don apost need yet another investigation we know the fbi is looking at it from their perspective it aposs being handled appropriately and it will be handled well wallace you have promised that the senate will confirm judge neil gorsuch to the u s supreme court by friday two questions one do you stand by that schedule a friday vote and two do you have the eight votes of democrats so that you can beat a filibuster mcconnell well look judge gorsuch deserves to be confirmed you know unanimously well qualified by the american bar association my counterpart senator schumer once called that the gold standard in the majority 99 percent of the time ninety seven percent of his rulings were unanimous only reversed one time in a case in which he participated by the supreme court president obama aposs former acting solicitor general said there aposs no principle reason to oppose him that aposs why he will ultimately be confirmed exactly how that happens chris will be up to our democratic colleagues i think it is noteworthy that no supreme court justice has ever in the history of our country been stopped by a partisan filibuster ever and in fact the business of filibustering judges is a fairly recent invention ironically of the now minority in the senate the democrats wallace inaudible mcconnell and in particular senator schumer who convinced his colleagues after bush 43 got elected to start routinely filibustering judges wallace let me ask you though some specific questions will there be a confirmation vote by friday mcconnell yes we aposre going to confirm judge gorsuch this week wallace secondly do you have the eight democratic votes as we sit here today to avoid a filibuster mcconnell well i don apost think we know there are democrats who have not yet announced their position i assume chris during the course of the week what you asked me will become revealed by announcements of democrats who have not yet set out what they aposre going to do wallace you say that he aposll be confirmed one way or the other so does that mean if you can apost stop a filibuster that you will go to the nuclear option and change the senate rules so that you can cut off debate with 51 votes and confirm him mcconnell look what i aposm telling you is that judge gorsuch is going to be confirmed the way in which that occurs is in the hands of the democratic minority and i think during the course of the week we aposll find out exactly how this will end but it will end with his confirmation wallace let me pick up on that back in 2013 the democrats invoked the nuclear option to allow a simple majority 51 votes on confirmation of lower court judges at that time you said that was a big mistake here you are sir begin video clip mcconnell you think this is in the best interests of the united states senate and the american people to make advise and consent in effect mean nothing obviously you can break the rules to change the rules to achieve that but some of us have been around here long enough to know the shoe is sometimes on the other foot end video clip wallace now you aposre prepared to do the same thing break the rules change the rules to break the rules and the question i have is i understand you want neil gorsuch on the court but is it worth it because what you aposre basically doing is destroying part of what makes the senate special the need to reach out to a bipartisan majority mcconnell well the answer to your question is of course i was upset about their effort to break the rules in order to change the rules but the rest of the story is when we came to the majority a year and a half later we discussed whether or not we should change it back and i argued against that precisely because the way we ended up was the way the senate had operated on confirmations for 230 years down to 2000 this business of filibustering judges and cabinet appointments is a recent phenomenon even though it was always possible chris to filibuster executive branch appointments it just wasn apost done and the most conspicuous example of that was the clarence thomas nomination he was confirmed for the supreme court 52 48 just for your listeners to know all it takes to get a filibuster in the senate is for any one of the 100 senators to say you have to get 60 votes the most controversial supreme court nomination in history not a single senator not one not ted kennedy not joe biden no one said you had to get 60 votes so even though i very much disliked the way the senate democrats did this in 2013 it in fact it restored the practice the practice and the custom of the senate down to 2000 wallace the government runs out of money on april 28 which means we could have another government shutdown on the 29th which just coincidentally would be donald trump aposs 99th day in office how confident are you that you and congress can avoid a government shutdown mcconnell yes i aposm very confident the two appropriations committees are working on the bills on a bipartisan basis we aposll be talking to senate democrats they will be relevant to this process it will require 60 votes i aposm confident senate democrats are not going to want to shut down the government they used to use that against us all the time and i think it worked pretty effectively for them and i can apost imagine they would want to acquire the government shutdown label wallace but look there aposs some argument they aposll say it aposs you the republicans who could make the shutdown happen there are a number of priorities that president trump and other republicans want that democrats find unacceptable i want to go through a couple of them with you senator one and a half billion dollars to start building the wall with mexico a major defense spending increase and domestic spending cuts and some house conservatives want defunding of planned parenthood question are you prepared to risk a government shutdown over any of those issues mcconnell look we aposre going to negotiate all of those items in the context of this funding bill which will fund the government through september 30 we aposll be debating these issues again for next year aposs appropriations we can start october 1 but we aposll be able to work all that out nobody wants a government shutdown i think the senate democrats know that every time we aposve had a government shutdown situation it aposs been the congress that aposs been blamed and not the president so i would advise president trump don apost worry about them sticking that label on you congress owns the government shutdown brand and there aposs no incentive frankly for either side to go to the brink i think we aposre going to be able to work all this out later this month wallace but just to push on one of them because president trump says he wants that 1 5 billion to start building the wall you would not risk a government shutdown by insisting that be in a spending bill laughter mcconnell what i aposm saying chris is we aposre going to work all this out on a bipartisan basis the democrats will be fully involved in the discussion so will the president we aposll work it out and avoid any kind of catastrophic event wallace senator mcconnell that aposs a helpful note on which to end thank you thanks for your time it aposs always good to talk with you sir mcconnell thank you wallace up next the man behind president trump aposs sweeping effort to roll back obama climate change policies epa chief scott pruitt commercial break wallace a look at nationals park where washington aposs finest have opening day tomorrow for the baseball season but there will be no presidential first pitch as the white house declined an invitation mr trump who once called global warming a hoax signed a sweeping executive order this week calling for regulators to rewrite president obama aposs climate change policies joining me now from oklahoma is scott pruitt mr trump aposs new administrator for the environmental protection agency mr pruitt welcome to fox news sunday scott pruitt epa administrator good morning chris how are you wallace good when the obama epa announced its clean power plan it said that the reduction in carbon pollution would have the following health benefits i want to put them up on the screen by 2030 it said there would be 90 000 fewer asthma attacks a year 300 000 fewer missed work and school days and 3 600 fewer premature deaths a year without the clean power plan how are you going to prevent those terrible things pruitt well chris i think what aposs important this past week is to recognize that the president is keeping his promise to the american people to rollback regulatory overreaches that have been occurring the last couple of years and as you know the clean power plan is subject to a u s supreme court state the steps have been taken by the epa historically they aposve equally been challenged several times with respective co2 regulation and each of those times the supreme court and courts have said that the power that has been used has been an overreach and so the president is keeping his promise to deal with that overreach chris it doesn apost mean that clean air and clean water is not going to be the focus in the future we aposre just going to do it right within the consistency of the framework that congress has passed now i think that aposs very important to recognize wallace but sir you aposre giving me a regulatory answer a political answer you re not giving me a health answer i talked about 90 000 fewer asthma attacks 300 000 fewer missed days in school and work the obama clean power plan called said that carbon pollution from the power sector would be reduced by 30 percent it would be one third lower than it was in 2005 here aposs what the american lung association says half of all americans now live in counties with unhealthy air you talk about all the regulatory overreach but the question is there are 166 million people living in unclean air and you are going to remove some of the pollution restrictions which will make the air even worse pruitt well chris a couple things we are actually pre 1994 levels with respect to our co2 footprint so this country is doing far better than most across the globe as you know also since 1980 we aposve got a 65 percent reduction in those key air pollutants sox and nox and particulate matter and ozone while at the same time growing our economy i think what aposs happened the last several years is that we aposve adapted to and adopted this previous administration aposs views that if your pro jobs and pro growth you can t be pro environment if you re pro environment you can t be pro growth and pro jobs and that simply is not the way we ve done business as a country wallace but sir pruitt now the epa had crosstalk wallace if i may you are talking about these reductions but even with those reductions the fact is that according to the american lung association which would have an interest in this 166 million people are living in unsafe air and if you do away with the clean power plan and boost as the president promises coal production then you re going to make the air even worse what about those 166 million people pruitt chris i think what you are referring to is we have about 40 percent of the country in non attainment right now those key air pollutants under our ambient air quality standards which are outside of the co2 discussion and i agree wholeheartedly that we need to focus our attention at making sure we make progress there in fact that aposs one of the key priorities of the administration is to improve air quality to be on the 60 percent attainment that we see that aposs not been a focal point over the last several years as much as it should be so i think crosstalk wallace and you think and let me just ask and you think that rewriting in effect doing away with the clean power plan is going to improve air quality which you say is a major goal pruitt look look chris i mean i think what we have to keep in mind is that epa only possesses authority that the congress gets it the epa has tried twice to regulate co2 one with the tailoring rule and the supreme court struck it down in the ur decision and secondly the clean power plan that the president introduced in 2015 which is subject to a u s supreme court stay as much as we want to see progress made in clean air and clean water with an understanding that we can also grow jobs we had to do so within the framework of what congress has passed the tools have to be in a tool box the past administration just made it up they re imagined authority on a statute there s a commitment with the new administration to have a pro growth pro environment approach to these issues but also to respect rule of law you talked about many times the regulatory overreach about executive fiat that the previous administration engaged in we can apost continue that process because what happens chris is clean air is not advanced because you have litigation such as the clean power plan you have stays of enforcement against that clean power plan and there aposs no progress being made with clean air and we are also spending money on litigation so crosstalk wallace that goes both ways sir because the fact is you are already in litigation on the attempt to reverse the clean power plan you are already getting sued on that so there s litigation either way let me let me pursue this issue because president trump is going to sit down this week with chinese president xi and for years american presidents have been pushing chinese leaders to improve greenhouse gas emissions to reverse them are you comfortable seeing the roles were reversed this week where it will now be the chinese president pushing president trump to cut down on pollution pruitt look i mean chris it aposs quite when you look at what happened in paris at the paris agreement and paris accord china and india weren apost required to take any steps toward reduction of co2 until the year 2030 that discussion to think that china and india are more committed to the co2 reduction in this country i think is quite quite false wallace well can i crosstalk pruitt as i indicated earlier we are pre 1994 levels and do you know why largely because of innovation and technology hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling because there aposs been a conversion to natural gas in the generation of electricity and what aposs important chris in my view is that utility companies across this country that are generating electricity you ought not have the regulator in washington d c in this instances the epa picking winners and lawyers saying to the american people that we re going to be anti coal anti fossil fuel as we generate electricity that aposs bad for america fuel diversity is very important we have shown leadership as i ve indicated we aposve made great progress with air quality since 1980 we made progress in the co2 reduction side as well at the same time growing jobs and so wallace if i may pruitt we have nothing to be apologetic about as a country and the neither does the president ph crosstalk wallace well i m sorry say that again pruitt we have nothing to be apologetic about as with respect to leadership that we ve shown as a country with respect to these key issues and the president doesn apost either he shown great leadership and pro growth pro jobs and pro environment and we can do both wallace well let me ask a specific question on that you talk about the paris accords which do call for reductions by china and other countries by 2030 and in fact china has already begun reducing its carbon emissions from coal power plants as you well president xi in january said that the paris climate accord should remain enforced as the chief environmental officer for the trump administration can you make the same commitment to the paris climate accords pruitt engagement internationally is very important to demonstrate the leadership that we have shown on this issue with china and india and other nations is very important those discussions should ensue but what paris represents is bad deal for this country we frontloaded our costs china and india backloaded theirs that caused a contraction in our economy look we aposve shown leadership on this issue in the key way chris and we re going to continue that crosstalk wallace sir the point is that the president is more committed to paris than the united states is pruitt but is he more committed in action and deed and the answer is no we aposve demonstrated through the steps we ve taken already the pre 1994 levels because of that technology we can burn coal in clean fashion we shouldn apost have this commitment by the u s government to say that fossil fuels are bad renewables are good the u s epa and the u s government should not pick winners and losers chris and that aposs what happened in the last several years wallace you had a famous pruitt and we demonstrated that leadership wallace i m sorry to rush you along but we do have limited time sir i say respectively you had a famous exchange a couple of months ago actually last month that i would like to play right now begin video cli joe kerner cnbc anchor do you believe that it aposs been proven that co2 is the primary control knob for climate do you believe that pruitt no i would not agree that it aposs the primary contributor to the global warming that we re seeing end video clip wallace mr pruitt there are all kinds of studies that contradict you the u n s panel on climate change says it is at least 95 percent likely that more than half the temperature increase since the mid 20th century is due to human activities noaa that s our own national oceanic and atmospheric administration says there aposs more carbon dioxide now than in the last 400 000 years and noaa says 2015 and 2016 are the two hottest years on record mr pruitt are we supposed to believe that that aposs all a coincidence pruitt no look chris i said to the process in my confirmation process individual senators as well that there aposs a warming trend the climate is changing and human activity contributes to the change in some measure the real issue is how much we contribute to it and measuring that with precision but then also what is the process as far as response what can we do about it the tools in the toolbox to address the co2 issue and you can t just simply from the epa perspective make that up you can apost do with the president did previously with the clean power plan president obama and his administration to simply re imagine authority that aposs why we have a u s supreme court stay against the clean power plan that aposs why president trump is dealing with that regulatory overreach and charting a new path forward to deal with these issues within the framework of clean air act wallace but sir you are kind of sugarcoating what you said you said there i would not agree that carbon co2 is a primary contributor to global warming and the question i have is what if you are wrong what if in fact the earth is warming what if it is causing dramatic climate change and that we as humans through carbon emissions are contributing to it simple question what if you re wrong pruitt look let me say to you co2 contributes to greenhouse gas it has a greenhouse gas effect and global warming as methane does and other types of gases the issue is how much we contribute to it from the human activity perspective and what can be done about it from a process perspective chris wallace but don apost you think the fact that we have these coal power plants belching carbon emissions into the air you don apost think that had plays a role pruitt i think that we aposve done it better than anybody in the world at burning coal clean in a clean fashion the innovative and technological advances that we aposve seen along with natural gas production and generating electricity it all contributed to a co2 footprint that s pre 1994 again we have done better than anybody in the world and growing our economy and also being a good steward of our environment we have nothing to be apologetic about we re going to operate within the framework of the clean air act to deal with these issues and make sure that we advance clean air clean water not just with this respect to co2 but with those key air pollutants under the ambient air quality standard program that we have wallace let me ask you one let me ask you one aposs last question and again i apologize sir because it goes to the whole question of commitment to trying to improve the environment under the president aposs new budget the epa is cut 31 percent that is more than any other agency and i want to put up some of the cuts that are included in the president aposs budget here are some of the 56 programs that would be scrapped great lakes restoration water runoff control for farmers pesticide safety what does that say about the commitment of this administration and you to cleaning up the environment when you aposre making a 31 percent cut in your agency and cutting things like that water runoffs for farmers pruitt well part of part of the issue chris is that over the last several years there has been a lack of commitment to state partnership you know we have state departments of environmental quality across the country have the resources and the expertise to deal with clean water and clean air issues and so renewing that partnership crosstalk wallace are you sure they are going to pick up the slack and might water safety water runoff and pesticide safety and great lakes restoration might that all just go by the wayside pruitt i ve met with several governors in fact within the first week of being on the job i met with 20 plus governors and those governors across the country are committed to pro jobs and pro environment they have to serve their people in those states as well and i will tell you this chris this attitude in washington d c that people in texas and oklahoma and kansas and colorado and the rest of the country don apost care about the water they drink or the air they breathe and are not going to take care of the air and the water locally and states i just don apost believe that that narrative is something we reject and we look forward to partnering with states across the country to achieve good outcomes wallace mr pruitt thank you thanks for joining us please come back it aposs an important conversation and we d love to continue it with you sir pruitt thanks chris wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss the growing russia controversy the trump team says the real scandal is what the obama administration did commercial break wallace coming up the battle to confirm the president s supreme court nominee judge neil gorsuch next week begin video clip sen chuck schumer d ny minority leader if the nuclear option is involved it aposs because our republicans in the senate chose to do so end video clip wallace we ll ask our panel about the threat of a democratic filibuster coming up on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip spicer and it should be very concerned to people that an administration or people in an administration people serving in government who are providing classified information who are given clearance in the trust of the united states government misused mishandled and potentially did some very very bad things with classified information end video clip wallace white house spokesman sean spicer pushing back on reporters questions about the trump campaign and russia saying the real focus should be on the obama administration aposs leak of classified information about the trump transition and it s time now for our sunday group laura ingraham editor of lizette and a fox news political analyst gerald seib from the wall street journal julie pace who covers the white house for the associated press and former national security council staffer gillian turner well laura the president and his team dug in deeper this week on this whole russia scandal and their argument now is that the obama administration surveilled the trump team and then spread that classified information for political purposes is this helping or hurting the white house laura ingraham fox news political analyst well i think they know that as long as this investigation goes on the harder it is for them to push on a number of fronts their domestic agenda foreign policy because i think a lot of folks do believe that the russia focus is meant in part to delegitimize the presidency of donald trump so when sean spicer makes that point i think he aposs right if if grassley s letter that he sent charles grassley sent a letter a few days ago wallace senator grassley ingraham yes senator grassley who you don apost want to tangle with i mean when he when he he s like a dog on a bone when he gets on an issue he sent a letter to the fbi about andrew mccabe who s the number two person at the fbi andrew mccabe s wife received 700 000 in political contributions arranged and facilitated by none other than clinton friend terry mcauliffe and his concern is that all documents that are be preserved all communications better be turned over about what andrew mccabe knew and when he knew it about the unmasking of individuals who were surveilled during the trump transition or during the trump campaign if it turns out at the end of all of this that the fbi and our intelligence agency have turned into partisan political operations with an agenda then republicans and democrats should be very concerned if it all turns out this is just a routine investigation the trump administration will have egg on its face but i have a feeling that we re going to find out a lot more about who was involved in the unmasking and who who had an agenda wallace well speaking about finding out a lot more julie with devin nunes the chair of the house intelligence committee who indicated that he got information about surveillance and unmasking from an outsider take a look begin video clip rep devin nunes r cali chair house intelligence committee sources and methods are are kept very confidential we we invite whistleblowers to come forward question what did you have to go to the white house to brief them shouldn t they be inaudible shouldn t the administration be briefing you nunes the administration i don apost think is aware of this so i want to make sure that i go over there and tell them what i know because it because it involves them end video clip wallace but as the week went on it became clear that officials at the president aposs own national security council inside the white house were deeply involved in this which raises the question are to are the president and his team and devin nunes all working together to protect trump julie pace the associated press and i think it aposs important to note that even before nunes came out and said he had received this new information there were officials in the white house that were telling reporters you should really be focused on the issue of improper unmasking this is where we think the real story is and then suddenly devin nunes shows up and says he aposs received information on exactly that topic look if there is on improper unmasking improper unmasking of trump officials for political reasons wallace you unmasking means identification basically that there was there was surveillance of of people it may have not even been an american it may have been foreigners in fact that s what it s thought and they re talking about americans and they re supposed to say american person one american person two if it becomes clear american person one is donald trump you aposre not supposed to say that pace you re not supposed to say that though if you talk to intelligence professionals they say when you are talking about someone like the president or the president s national security advisor their identity becomes almost impossible to reveal just based on the nature of the conversation if there was improper handling of classified information if it was spread improperly throughout the government that s a real concern but the white house and nunes aren apost doing themselves any favors when they try to cover up how this information is getting into the house intelligence chairman s hands wallace gillian as someone who worked in the national security council both in the bush 43 administration and in the obama administration how unusual for officials in the national security council to get involved in such a partisan actively partisan issue and also for the former national security advisor michael flynn to seek immunity from criminal prosecution in return for testifying and and along those lines i want to point out here aposs what mr flynn and donald trump said during the campaign about the fact that clinton campaign officials got immunity in the e mail investigation here it is begin video clip michael flynn former national security adviser when you are given immunity that means that you probably committed a crime trump and if you re not guilty of a crime what do you need immunity for right end video clip wallace and now president trump is supporting immunity for michael flynn gillian turner fox news contributor yes which the whole situation the whole scenario is highly unusual but i would say this that this story especially with nunes apos involvement it aposs like an onion where every day we re peeling back more and more layers and we could kind of go back and forth for infinity on who checked into the white house when and when they left and who talked to who but at the core of the story remain two issues two national security issues one is the leaking of classified information to include the surveillance issue the other is potential russian attempted interference in the united states general election now both of these issues are very more important than the politics surrounding them by which i mean they both have implications for american national defense and by the way they both spanned two presidential administrations at this point people will push back and say but there aposs no evidence of collusion between the trump campaign team and russia in the in the general election and that aposs fine and that aposs true but i actually argue that that makes an investigation a really thorough investigation about russian efforts more important because it means that whatever they were able to wherever they were able to get to anything that achieved they did on their own isn apost that more compelling wallace well we don apost know that i mean that aposs one of the things and as as fbi director come said in the house hearing he said that he they are currently investigating russia and also the possibility of trump campaign involvement gerry you and i have covered a lot of scandals too many scandals in this town what stands out for you about this one gerald f seib the wall street journal well never a scandal like this i mean this is singular i ve never seen anything like this i think what stands out is the fact that you have basic core intelligence issues being discussed so publicly and so openly either i aposm not sure that aposs in anybody aposs best interest and i aposm not sure it aposs in the white house interest to have it go on for infinity i wonder if the white house wouldn t be better served if the everybody could just turn down the volume and figure out how we re going to get to the bottom of both of these questions surveillance and russian meddling and i think the one thing that happened this week was he got a glimpse that maybe there aposs one place where that can happen and that aposs the senate intelligence committee where you had you know two senators senator burr on the republican side and senator warner on the democratic side wallace the two chairs seib the two chairs the chair and the ranking member come out have a press conference and then an initial hearing in which they look like adults responsible adults an actual bipartisan effort that might answer some of these questions in a way that aposs credible and believable and that maybe will make this all go away eventually wallace eventually seib eventually wallace the emphasis on the word eventually all right we have to take a break here when we come back we ll discuss the president aposs war with the conservative freedom caucus following his defeat on obamacare repeal and replace plus what would you like to ask the panel about the growing divide inside the gop just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip mcconnell we re going to get judge gorsuch confirmed it will be an opportunity for the democrats to invoke closure we ll see where that ends schumer if judge gorsuch fails to garner 60 votes the answer isn apost to irrevocably change the rules of the senate the answer is to change the nominee end video clip wallace senate minority leader mitch mcconnell and democratic leader chuck schumer both showing no signs of blinking in the showdown over the nomination of judge neil gorsuch to the supreme court and we re back now with the panel well laura is our resident supreme court watcher and a former supreme court clerk under clarence thomas and i aposm not taking sides here i m just really asking because it just gets worse and worse and worse is there winning any way out for these just ever more partisan wars and what do you think and i aposm not saying this is the fault of one side or the other about the fact that we re it looks like this week we re going to see a part of the institution of the senate change and turning more into the house where it doesn apost take a bipartisan majority of 60 51 votes a simple majority can decide any nomination ingraham yes well i think mcconnell was right in his point this is a 200 year senate tradition that will be forever changed and chuck schumer i mean i hate to say this during a sunday during lent but he aposs absolutely fraudulent in the way he characterizes this there has never been a partisan filibuster of a supreme court nominee when my former boss was confirmed during all of the controversy surrounding clarence thomas there wasn apost a filibuster he was confirmed and it wasn apost the largest of margins but he was confirmed the vote went forward and he you know he ended up sitting on the supreme court much to the consternation of the left but but this is just this is this is ridiculous at this point wallace but you but i mean look nobody comes into this with clean hands i mean republicans were filibustering lower court judges in the bush administration not in the bush administration in the clinton administration i mean this has gone back and forth ingraham well but this the supreme court nomination process has never gotten to this point where there is a a threaten of a partisan filibuster mcconnell i mean mcconnell is he knows this stuff inside and out and he s completely right the way he characterizes it now i understand that the democrats don apost want neil gorsuch to be on the court i got that but he aposs going to be on the court this in the end hurts chuck schumer this hurts the democrats because if if you get rid of you know this rule this this rule now you will only be able to have 52 justices to to confirm the next nominee that could be wallace fifty one senators yes ingraham fifty one senators and it could be the next opening will come in june wallace well that aposs what i want to pick up on with you gerry as as explosive as this is this is a conservative judge scalia being replaced by another conservative judge gorsuch there is a lot of talk and it s speculation who knows in june that anthony kennedy the key swing vote in the senate might retire and at that point trump is is naming somebody who can shift the balance of the court for three decades seib right and that aposs the argument that some democrats even are using for not invoking letting the nuclear option be invoked this time this is not an appointment that changes the ideological balance of the court this preserves it it s a status quo shift the next one probably won apost be or may not be so maybe you ought to preserve your firepower until then i think the problem right now is there my colleague jess bravin wrote a good piece this week saying there are dueling narratives here the democratic narrative is this is a stolen supreme court seat this belonged to merrick garland it was supposed to be filled by president obama republicans stopped it republicans say there was a national referendum on who should be on the supreme court it was called the presidential election we won this is basically a mandate those two can t be reconciled wallace no that aposs right and as as i say there are no clean hands in this and there s perfect hypocrisy let aposs turn to the trump agenda in the wake of the health care defeat and the first big issue which i talked about with senator mcconnell which is the real possibility of a government shutdown on april 28th julie the president has been attacking members of the house freedom caucus this week at least they re talking about reaching out to senate democrats and house democrats do you have the sense that they have any legislative strategy going forward on this issue the preventing a shutdown or anything else pace no wallace ok gillian pace moving on no look i mean they they talk about a government shutdown and feeling confident that they are going to be able to to avoid that they talk about reaching out to democrats they talk about trying to put pressure on the house freedom caucus but it aposs largely just talk at this point and when you when you look at the democrats there is almost no indication that democrats are ready to start working with this administration on even something like an infrastructure package which in theory should have some bipartisan support and when it comes to the house freedom caucus you you see these guys responding to these tweets from trump they are not feeling the pressure they are not backing away and this has always been a relationship that has been a little odd between trump and the freedom caucus because they may all be outsiders they may all want to shake up washington but the freedom caucus guys come in with a really clear ideology wallace quick quick specific question that i also asked mcconnell is the president do you think willing to shut down the government to insist that funding for the wall 1 5 billion be in the spending bill which democrats say will blow it up pace that is a great question and that i think could be could be a real pressure point here i mean if trump is willing to go for the mat for the wall funding it aposs going to be hard i think for him to get support on on both sides for that wallace and i was going to say you then his supporters will say you promised us a wall and pace you promised us this this is one of the clearest promises of that campaign wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on the growing divide inside the gop we got this tweet from someone known as frank the tank who writes is it really on the divide inside the gop is it really a divide or are they just playing politics as usual at the expense of the people gillian how do you answer frank the tank turner i wallace and i want you to address him by name as you answer turner mr tank is that mr tank this is for you i think whether this started out you know as more politics as usual or is really grounded in ideological opposition is debatable depending on what side of the aisle you sit on but what s clear to people like me who sit somewhere in between is that this has now become a very real divide maybe entrenched in the wake of the collapse of the health care bill i think what we re seeing in the last few days especially is the white house digging in its heels they ve drawn up as you mentioned a kind of a hit list where they re now targeting people individually like representative wallace by by name in tweets turner by name representatives amash meadows sanford there s a few others and what we re seeing on the side of the freedom caucus is they re now gearing up for their future you know what is what is our role going to look like in the tax reform debate what are we going to how are we going to make inroads there so i think again the the origins of this and what the original sin is is kind of obe at this point but the battle lines have been drawn now and i don apost see a way that this is going to improve over the next few wallace and and and as i said to julie the question is is there an end game here does the administration have a game if they re going to alienate the house freedom caucus and not reach out to democrats there aposs a problem thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week nasa aposs new eye on the universe commercial break wallace for the past 27 years the hubble space telescope has been providing answers to some of the mysteries of the universe but now nasa is ready with a new and improved model with hopes to uncover much more here s our power player of the week begin videotape john durning james webb space telescope project size matters when you aposre trying to collect you know light from a distant object wallace voice over john durning is talking about the james webb space telescope a project he aposs been working on for more than ten years when it aposs launched in the fall of 2018 it will be vastly more powerful than the hubble telescope durning this telescope will be 100 times more sensitive than the hubble and so we can see objects that are 100 times more faint than the hubble can see 100 times more distant than the hubble can see wallace and yes part of that is size durning it aposs 21 5 feet across where the hubble was only 10 feet across we ve got seven times the collecting area that hubble did wallace as the webb sits 1 million miles in space it will also have five sun shields because heat distorts images durning this is the area of a tennis court we have five layers of the sun shield and each layer is less than half the thickness of a piece of paper wallace on camera how warm is it on this side of the sun shield and how cold is it here durning it s about 100 degrees fahrenheit on the side where the spacecraft is and the sun is and on this side it aposs minus 400 degrees fahrenheit the sun shield provides an spf of 1 million to the telescope wallace voice over we got a look at the webb in a huge clean room at nasa s goddard space flight center outside washington to get the huge mirror to fit in the spacecraft they have to fold it up like a transformer then they shake it and expose it to deafening noise to make sure it will survive the violence of a rocket launch durning they re checking to make sure that the harder ph hasn apost changed at all after being exposed to that environment wallace on camera what will the webb allow us to see that we can apost see now durning webb will allow us to see is the first stars being formed 13 4 billion years ago wallace voice over what he means is in the vast reaches of space some of the light we see now was emitted from the first stars after the big bang wallace on camera so in effect you ll be able to go back in time you ll see a light that is only now getting to us from 13 billion years ago durning it s very exciting we think we know what we ll see but we are not positive wallace voice over the webb was supposed to launch in 2014 at a cost of 4 billion now it aposs scheduled for late 2018 at a cost of 8 billion but the deputy project manager says it aposs worth it wallace on camera is there one question that you hope the webb will answer durning yes i would love for them to answer that we re not alone wallace life durning life yes wallace voice over for instance durning says the webb will give a much clearer answer whether those seven planets that were recently discovered orbiting another star can support life it aposs all part of what aposs being called our new eye on the universe durning we have pushed the envelope in every area on this project logistics technology science every day you know you wake up and say what aposs going to hit my desk today and we just tackle
