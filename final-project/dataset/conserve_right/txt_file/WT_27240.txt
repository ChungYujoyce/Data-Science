the company s 737 max aircraft this month after major crashes in indonesia and ethiopia over the past five months the whirlwind of negative publicity around boeing could spill over onto mr shanahan during senate confirmation hearings if mr trump nominates him analysts say the acting secretary also would face a withering assault from democrats who would argue that he is using his power to push taxpayer money toward boeing at a time when public confidence in his former employer has plummeted i m not sure he really appreciates what could be ahead said mark f cancian a senior adviser with the international security program at the center for strategic and international studies and a retired marine corps colonel the fact that a boeing aircraft has problems is not his responsibility mr cancian said but telling members of congress that something is an unfair line of questioning doesn t get traction it s about perception it s about grandstanding it s about all of those things before

hopes problematic last week the pentagon s inspector general s office confirmed that it will formally investigate complaints that mr shanahan violated ethical guidelines and tried to push business toward his former employer the department of defense office of inspector general has decided to investigate complaints we recently received that acting secretary patrick shanahan allegedly took

responsibility and ethics in washington first asked for the inspector general to start such an inquiry pentagon officials have denied that mr shanahan has in any way favored boeing and say he has abided by an ethics agreement to recuse himself from any matters involving the company sec shanahan has at all times remained committed to complying with his ethics agreement which screens boeing
