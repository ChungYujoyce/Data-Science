world stephanie grisham received a baptism by fire over the weekend as she accompanied the president on his high stakes trip to asia and threw her body into a fracas with north korean security officials it was an early sign of how grisham a former trump campaign staffer and aide to the first lady might reshape a role she technically didn t start until monday she s taking the job just as

reporters to run past she beckoned them to come forward later she showed other white house officials the bruises she had to show for it it was a brief public defense of press freedom from a white house that has produced few of them though trump staffers routinely advocate for reporters access on international trips grisham s predecessor sarah sanders eliminated the daily press briefing and trump himself has regularly used hostile rhetoric against the press grisham declined to talk to reporters about her actions at the dmz which may have come instinctually for a staffer who joined the trump orbit as a press wrangler on the campaign tasked with shepherding the traveling press pool to events and at times advocating for access but others who ve had the job complimented her response there s always two parts to being the press secretary one is to speak for the president and the other is to help the press and on the latter stephanie could not have had a better stronger first day

of june in asia grisham was largely seen but not heard she had a seat at the table during the president s meetings with world leaders such as germany s angela merkel and saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman but she did not talk to reporters politely declining requests for comment by saying that she was still getting up to speed in the new job her voice was heard publicly just once in a telling moment in seoul in the hours before the president s trip to the dmz trump held a news conference with his south korean counterpart moon jae in and each leader was to field one question from the american press and one from the korean podiums were set up on the side for each leaders press secretary and as per protocol each spokeswoman would announce which reporter would ask the question south
