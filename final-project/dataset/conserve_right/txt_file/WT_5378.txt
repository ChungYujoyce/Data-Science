apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic recent editorials of statewide and national interest from new york s newspapers blame bloomberg not trump for bloomberg news dilemma new york post top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk dec 3 sorry it s just silly to blame brad parscale the trump 2020 campaign manager for the ridiculous position that michael bloomberg has put bloomberg news in parscale announced monday that the campaign won t give bloomberg news reporters credentials for rallies or other campaign events since the agency s editors have declared their bias openly it may opt to engage with individual reporters or answer inquiries on a case by case basis makes sense bloomberg s editor in chief john micklethwait announced that since the company s owner joined the race it won t investigate any democrats running for president but only the incumbent as megan murphy a former bloomberg washington bureau chief noted those rules are staggering and ridiculous that didn t stop dean baquet the new york times executive editor from slamming the trump campaign s move we condemn any action that keeps quality news media from reporting fairly and accurately on the presidency and the leadership of the country huh the campaign isn t the white house and bloomberg has told the world it won t be reporting fairly you d think the times top newsman would understand that publicly saying you won t look into the failings of an entire side of the spectrum is the opposite of fairness online https bit ly 2lifobf mr schiff s impeachment opus wall street journal dec 3 these columns warned that once the machinery of impeachment was up and running it would be impossible to stop and so on tuesday adam schiff released his house intelligence committee report on ukraine that finds president trump guilty of playing domestic politics with foreign policy but it s clear the president s real sin is being the willful undisciplined donald trump voters elected the bulk of mr schiff s 300 page opus is a prosecutorial account of mr trump s four month attempt to persuade new ukraine president volodymyr zelensky to announce investigations into corruption and ukraine s role in the 2016 election it is not a flattering tale and it would make a compelling plank in a 2020 campaign indictment of mr trump s character and poor judgment but mr schiff s report casts himself and his cause as much grander he is adam at the bridge of our republic heroic defender of american democracy his introduction is worth quoting at length to capture his pretensions to nonpartisan statesmanship the decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry is not one we took lightly under the best of circumstances impeachment is a wrenching process for the nation i resisted calls to undertake an impeachment investigation for many months on that basis notwithstanding the existence of presidential misconduct that i believed to be deeply unethical and damaging to our democracy he writes but in the end he heard the call of duty in making the decision to move forward we were struck by the fact that the president s misconduct was not an isolated occurrence nor was it the product of a na ve president instead the efforts to involve ukraine in our 2020 presidential election were undertaken by a president who himself was elected in 2016 with the benefit of an unprecedented and sweeping campaign of election interference undertaken by russia in his favor and which the president welcomed and utilized here mr schiff reveals the real impeachment motivation mr trump never would have won in 2016 without vladimir putin s help but robert mueller failed to prove that so democrats are settling for the lesser melodrama of ukraine an unchained rudy giuliani and joe and hunter biden the details may not add up to much more than mr trump obsessing about what he thinks ukraine did in 2016 but it s all the democrats have the report s summary sentence reveals the weakness of its case with overstatement the president placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the united states sought to undermine the integrity of the u s presidential election process and endangered u s national security yet every president seeks some political advantage in pursuing foreign policy that includes barack obama when he asked dmitry medvedev to tell mr putin to go easy on missile defense until after the 2012 election as for undermining election integrity that was bill clinton when he vacuumed foreign campaign contributions from the riadys and multiple other foreigners in 1996 or hillary clinton in 2016 when her campaign financed christopher steele to spread russian disinformation on mr trump to the media and fbi mr trump in his reckless way asked president zelensky for the favor of investigating joe biden and tried to delay military aid but as senator ron johnson relates in his recent letter that is a more even handed account of events mr trump s attempts were resisted across washington and ultimately failed none of this undermined elections or endangered u s national security because there was no investigation and the aid was never withheld even if aid had been withheld that would merely have put u s policy back to where it was when mr obama denied ukraine lethal military aid for several years until mr trump provided it the starr report laid out irrefutable evidence that mr clinton lied to a grand jury and tampered with witnesses those were criminal offenses the evidence that richard nixon obstructed justice was also clear once the tapes became public by contrast mr schiff s report mentions no specific crime and is full of too many inferences and overbroad assertions to provide a convincing impeachment case this explains why mr schiff s report won t gather a single republican vote and why this impeachment will remain partisan on this score we had to smile at mr schiff s high toned invocation of the founding fathers fear of excessive factionalism he claims to be defending democracy against the power of faction that would dare defend mr trump against impeachment like the president mr schiff lacks the virtue of being self aware online https on wsj com 2yhcett reject ny campaign finance report the auburn citizen dec 1 a politically appointed commission given the power to transform new york state s election law has gone out of its way to minimize public access to its work and that approach has continued with the handling of its final report which as of late morning on saturday had not been publicly released that s a big problem because this report becomes law without action via a special session by the state legislature within 20 days of its release the new york state public campaign finance commission has ignored loud calls from good government groups and political leaders across the spectrum for an early release of this report and a completely transparent deliberations process initially the commission said it would release the report by the wednesday prior to thanksgiving a classic move for any government entity looking to avoid public scrutiny the commission then said it wouldn t make that self imposed deadline and pushed the eta to friday that day came and went without a report the legal deadline comes sunday dec 1 while votes by the commission earlier in november appeared to solidify what the report will call for in terms public campaign financing fusion voting and donation limits it was troubling to hear commission officials last week talk about the delay in releasing the final report because commissioners were making edits were these edits coming from a consensus of the nine person commission if so how were they arriving at it and why weren t these discussions being done in public it s just the latest example of why this approach to campaign finance reform is truly representative government at its worst legislators and the governor kicked their fundamental responsibility of passing and signing laws to a panel of political operatives and that panel has been inefficient and secretive based on that we believe there s only one response that lawmakers should take and that is to return to albany this month to reject the commission s report and vow to take on this work themselves in the 2020 session online https bit ly 35ztyzx immoral doesn t figure into some nations policies the post journal dec 4 during visits to hiroshima and nagasaki japan on sunday pope francis pronounced that the use of atomic energy for purposes of war is immoral he added as is the possession of atomic weapons for many years the roman catholic church seemed to sanction policies by the united states and a few other powers to maintain nuclear arsenals to deter use of atomic bombs by other countries specifically the old soviet union and china speaking in the only cities where atomic bombs have been used in war francis seemed to be disavowing the church s previous stance one wonders if he has ever read of the horrors of firebombing a city as the united states did during the closing months of world war ii in attempts to convince japanese leaders to end the war more people perished in firebomb attacks than in the two nuclear explosions and one wonders whether francis has considered how many more japanese and americans would have died had use of atomic bombs not ended the war in all probability continued resistance by the japanese would have resulted in far more deaths than occurred in the atomic bombings but that was a long time ago what about now should the united states and russia scrap their nuclear arsenals in compliance with the pope s statements how would islamic iran react how about atheist north korea or china surely pope francis understands that the very last thing americans and we suspect russians want is to see nuclear weapons used again but leaders in some other nuclear armed countries view their weapons and missiles to deliver them as means to dominate others immoral is not a word figuring into their policies sadly then the pope s words reflect hope not reality online https bit ly 2peubcu election security should be a shared priority adirondack daily enterprise nov 30 if america is to remain america we need to make sure our voting is what voters believe it to be and not a sham controlled by cheaters as politics has become more of a high stakes game its battlefields these days swirl around its own core mechanism elections u s diplomats have testified in the current impeachment inquiry that president donald trump pressured ukraine to help weaken a 2020 political opponent using hundreds of millions of dollars of u s military aid as leverage this raises the question of where the boundary of politics lies trump and his defenders say he did nothing illegal but the constitution is not clear about that our nation s founders clearly feared foreign nations becoming involved in domestic politics but a certain amount of that has always been with us at what point is it out of bounds it is a slippery slope however and if we aren t careful we will have our political parties actively allying themselves with foreign powers there is reason to fear trump is already engaging in that in defending the president republicans fall back on the centrality of elections they say democrats are just trying to overturn the 2016 vote perhaps not directly though it seems unlikely that the senate will remove trump from office even if the house impeaches him so maybe democrats are mainly doing this as a demonstration to show next year s voters that trump needs to go it s all about winning the next election this compulsive campaigning is exhausting to ordinary americans who would love to see less partisan warfare and more focus on solving common problems but it s also kind of reassuring that the real power in this country the kind would be leaders crave derives from the people s free choice yet if elections are corrupted they no longer drive real democracy serious threats to the fairness of our elections have been widely reported by our federal intelligence agencies and some county election boards have reported attempted hacks the mueller investigation presented alarming proof that russia interfered in the 2016 election to sway voters toward trump although it didn t find enough evidence to prove trump participated in that since then however congress has done nothing to make our elections more secure agents of the russian government mostly focused on propaganda through social media and other internet channels as they previously did to interfere with elections in baltic countries that means people need to be extra careful to scrutinize what they read and to think for themselves simply following the lead of your chosen political party on every issue makes you much easier to manipulate be your own person pick and choose from the cafeteria of ideas but while simple strength of character can go a long way toward bluntingpropaganda both domestic and foreign individuals can t do much to stop someone from hacking into our election computer system and changing the numbers and that kind of outright cheating is probably coming more than in the past if our political party leaders are to agree on anything we would think it would be that the game be played without foreign interference so far though they haven t done much about it after the 2000 presidential election s florida recount debacle congress members of both parties passed the help america vote act which upgraded voting machines so our democracy wouldn t be undermined by bad old technology we mourned losing the reliable and easy to use turquoise lever action voting machines but we were glad other places no longer had to rely on hole punching clunkers likewise after the terrorist attacks of 9 11 congress acted in a bipartisan manner to increase transportation security this involved sacrifices such as ease of crossing the u s canada border which did long term damage to northern new york s economy but it also prevented terrorist attacks now as foreign threats loom again democrats and republicans need to set aside their preoccupations and realize election security is in their and the nation s best interest one way to do it is for the federal government to give money to states to give to local boards of election to shore up security measures a house budget bill would put 600 million toward this and a senate bill would commit 250 million according to the hill newspaper we hope they agree soon on a sufficient amount anyone who tries to block it we have to question his or her motives after all foreign adversaries don t so much want to help one party win as they want the u s weakened by political division meanwhile our state legislature and governor have made numerous election changes this year nearly all of them are focused on increasing voter turnout this is good in general but security should be a priority as well we are fine if some security measures protect against what is typically called voter fraud people voting under other people s names or voting when they are not eligible that obviously is cheating and wrong but it has always been with us and however many people might commit such fraud is a drop in the bucket compared to what one computer hacker could do cyber attacks are perhaps the biggest current and future threat to our democracy foreign nations are unlikely to risk tangling with earth s biggest military but if they can manipulate the u s with cyber attacks and the u s ignores it that s what they ll do we as a people
