the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion president donald trump s u s led coalition in syria to defeat isis the noxious terror caliphate that sprang from the loins of the obama administration s irresolution was brilliantly executed he employed a lean and lethal u s force assisted by our allies fighting the global war on terror gwot and syrian kurds who are seeking to establish some semblance of normalcy for their ethnic group in short order the president s efforts were a stunning success killing or imprisoning legions of isis savages his intervention was necessary eager to fulfil his promise sincerely made to withdraw u s troops from syria the president has been frustrated with the difficulty he has encountered in extricating us from foreign wars moreover he is under pressure from the libertarians in his party who assert that the syrian intervention was not our war in reality isis was and remains inextricably part of the gwot having sprouted from the ashes of al qaeda in iraq aqi indeed aqi itself grew out of the irresolution to intervene effectively with the post iraq war insurgency this compelled president george w bush to surge forces there in 2007 to successfully suppress aqi however when president barack obama took the helm he also demonstrated irresolution by precipitously withdrawing from iraq in 2011 that was a profound blunder iraq wasn t prepared to stabilize itself from emerging terror insurgencies and in that environment isis was born resuming where aqi left off top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the non interventionists who are advising the president on the nature of war seem to misunderstand the world this president faces as he attempts to end the conflicts that have cost us much blood and treasure it is this the multipolar world of today is multi dangerous it doesn t resemble the bipolar one of yesteryear when superpowers the united states and the soviet union could tame the states over whom they had diplomatic military and economic influence our multipolar world is filed with the likes of iran north korea syria and terror organizations including isis al qaeda and the taliban all posing omnidirectional threats to world peace it s also populated with uncooperative nations and leaders indeed even nato allies like the recalcitrant turkish president recep tayyip erdogan who is unpredictable and untrustworthy gone are the days when nations could view wars through the sterile lens of non intervention dismissing conflicts as your war not ours multipolar realities have changed that witness the saudi arabian intervention in yemen to defeat iranian backed terror rebels in southern arabia that has now escalated and threatens war between saudi arabia and iran following iran s attack of a major saudi oil refinery last month the gwot including the state sponsors of terror like iran syria and north korea is a profound multipolar threat and can t be dismissed the president unlike his predecessor defeated isis but the risk he now faces is whether isis will resurface in the wake of america s rapid withdrawal snatching defeat from the jaws of victory turkey s invasion and occupation of northern syria threatens to upend the situation the specter of colliding turkish syrian and russian troops all racing to occupy territory formerly controlled by the u s led coalition that defeated isis is ominous president trump s decision to dispatch vice president mike pence and secretary of state mike pompeo to turkey to secure a ceasefire has bought valuable time to stabilize the situation yet this remains a multipolar challenge that requires more work first the deteriorating 120 hour cessation in fighting needs reinforcement a no fly zone over northern syria would be of value in deterring an escalation of violence between turks and kurds but also meddlesome syrian and russian forces the united states should also deter iran s efforts to expand its militia presence northward as it has throughout the southern regions of the levant bordering our most reliable middle eastern ally israel second the unied states and turkey should implement a demilitarized zone dmz in the 20 mile buffer turkey seeks in northern syria it could be policed by the united nations truce supervision organization untso as they currently do on the golan heights and in southern lebanon or done by a similarly constituted international military coalition moreover a dmz would permit repatriation of syrian refugees in turkey and recently displaced kurds resolving a major humanitarian crisis third sustain a robust military presence in western iraq to crush any isis resurgence in the region fourth president trump should offer to personally broker peace talks between turkey and the syrian kurds people the turks consider terrorists the mutual hostility between the combatants makes crafting a deal difficult but that s reality in a multipolar world finally the president should make clear to non interventionists that they should not equate his withdrawal from syria with hesitation to dispatch and position armed forces when situations require military intervention after all iran north korea and the remnants of isis are lurking about in this multi dangerous
