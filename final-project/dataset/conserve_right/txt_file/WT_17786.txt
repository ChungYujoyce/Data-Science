urged the federal government to quash the proposals in his state and in neighboring washington his rationale outlined in a letter to the defense department the interior department and the army corps of engineers highlights an argument against the development and export of fossil fuels the u s he said should take global responsibility for carbon emissions and any study of environmental effects should examine the worldwide ramifications of using coal and natural gas developing transporting and using coal for energy production in asia will have significant implications for the trajectory of the world s transition to cleaner sources of energy mr kitzhaber said it is imperative that the federal government take seriously its responsibility to make informed decisions and that there be a comprehensive look at the energy environmental and public health impacts of these proposals before the nation commits itself to this path he said foreign markets led by china could soon become the most appealing options for american energy companies dealing in coal environmental protection agency regulations chief among them an effective ban on new coal fired power plants are squeezing the u s market and strangling the fuel that powered the industrial revolution you can see it dwindling away said rep shelley moore capito west virginia republican and co chairwoman of the house of

coal market is in danger of drying up nations such as china and india are using more than ever before and they are looking to american companies to supply it total u s coal exports shot up by 32 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with a year earlier the energy information administration said exports have increased steadily over the past several years in 2009 the nation sent 59 million tons overseas that number shot up to 82 million tons in 2010 and 107 million tons last year according to the american coal council the proposed sites in oregon and washington could double u s coal export capacity but not without a fight as evidenced by mr kitzhaber s letter opponents of coal are no longer content to just lead the charge against the fuel s use at home if it s a conventional fuel they re opposed to producing it they re opposed to consuming it and they re opposed to exporting it said dan kish senior vice president for policy at the institute for energy research they hope to keep it here and keep it buried in the ground despite those efforts the domestic coal market should remain strong for the foreseeable future said coal council ceo janet gellici the most abundant fuel source in the u s coal generates more than 42 percent of the nation s electricity environmental regulations and the resurgence of natural gas could change the equation in the long term but in the
