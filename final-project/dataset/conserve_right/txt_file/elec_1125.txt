allahpunditposted at 11 21 am on may 23 2017 nice catch by the media research center from a broad based yougov poll published last week virtually everyone in a position to know has shot down the theory that russia messed with the vote in november barack obama nope james clapper nope james comey and mike rogers nope it s been rejected over and over and over again by authorities whom democrats should trust force feed a man enough headlines about russia having hacked the election though and all of that melts away yougov asked whether it s true or false that russia tampered with vote tallies in order to get donald trump elected president result they asked the same question in december despite half a year s worth of news developments about what did and didn t happen between trump and russia and not a scrap of evidence that any vote totals were changed democrats are more likely to believe the election was rigged now than they were then to paraphrase rick james motivated reasoning is a hell of a drug want another example yougov also asked people how they felt about james comey in the wake of his firing this is the same guy who was shredded rhetorically by the left for months after his infamous letter to congress about emailgate before the election and whom many democrats demanded be canned for his eleventh hour interference in the political process even liberals who oppose trump s decision to oust comey while the russia probe is ongoing should view comey himself unfavorably due to his role in the election one would think but one would be wrong democrats now favor comey 42 29 while republicans disfavor him 18 57 the two parties preferences are essentially dictated by trump s preferences if you doubt that consider that another poll out today from harvard harris also has comey in positive territory among democrats at 37 27 as recently as last month it was 17 36 you can try to explain the democrats strange new respect for him if you like by noting that the news about his memo broke before the harvard harris poll was conducted between may 17 and 20 and therefore some dems may sincerely have developed a new admiration for comey s integrity over the last week or so problem is the yougov poll was conducted between may 13 and 16 before the news about the memo circulated it s almost certainly partisan tribalism that s driving perceptions of comey whoa canada whoa canada truths truths you tell yourself that you didn t know for sure and you never really saw anything but that s all just rationalization you tell yourself that you didn t know for sure and you never really saw anything but that s all just rationalization he usually keeps busy but not like this he usually keeps busy but not like this i think i m just confused at the insensitivity i think i m just confused at the insensitivity the state has not identified any additional interests allegedly served by the pay to vote system the state has not identified any additional interests allegedly served by the pay to vote system are you better off than you were four months ago are you better off than you were four months ago they defeated a superpower they defeated a superpower demand demand 1 30 pm et 1 30 pm et trending no boat ride for you buddy no boat ride for you buddy they don t even see differences between individuals as having any role to play in success they don t even see differences between individuals as having any role to play in success smells like victory smells like victory
