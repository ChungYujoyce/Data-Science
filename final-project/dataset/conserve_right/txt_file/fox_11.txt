aposm chris wallace president trump takes credit for cooling a trade war with europe and heating up the u s economy begin videotape donald trump president of the united states we have accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions once again we are the economic envy of the entire world wallace but is the spike in our gdp sustainable we aposll discuss that and the president aposs hard sell to the heartland trump we will not let anybody bully our wonderful american farmers wallace with treasury secretary steven mnuchin it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive then the confrontation between president trump and his former fixer michael cohen escalates over taped conversations and claims the president knew about that trump tower meeting with the russian lawyer we aposll discuss what it means for the special counsel investigation with the president aposs lead lawyer rudy giuliani plus getting to the bottom of what happened in helsinki sen bob menendez d new jersey did he tell you what whether or not what happened in those two hours mike pompeo secretary of state yes the predicate of your question implied some notion that there was something improper about having a one on one meeting i completely disagree menendez i didn apost ask you a predicate i asked you a simple question wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about secretary of state pompeo aposs hot seat in a senate hearing all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the gloves are off in a fight between president trump and his former attorney michael cohen the president aposs lead lawyer rudy giuliani will be here later to talk about why the joint defense agreement between mr trump and cohen is no longer in effect but first the republican plan to hold on the control of congress relies heavily on a growing economy one president trump took full credit for on friday the president says the 4 1 percent growth in gdp in the second quarter shows his policies on trade and taxes and deregulation are working but some economists disagree warning these are only short term gains joining us now for an exclusive interview is treasury secretary steven mnuchin mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday steven mnuchin treasury secretary thank you and it aposs great to be here with you wallace let aposs start with the strong gdp numbers 4 1 percent growth in the second quarter and some very bullish talk from the white house begin video clip donald trump president of the united states these numbers are very very sustainable this isn apost a one time shot larry kudlow white house chief economic advisor this is a boom that will be sustainable frankly as far as the eye can see this is no one shot effort end video clip wallace so mr secretary can we count on 3 percent growth in this year 2018 which would be the highest annual rate since the great recession and president trump talked late this week that he could see 8 percent or 9 percent growth is that realistic mnuchin well chris we aposve been very clear since the campaign the president aposs economic plan has always consisted of tax reform trade relief and regulatory relief and we said we were going to achieve 3 percent or higher sustained gdp and that aposs where we are the 4 percent 4 1 was a terrific order but we are very focused on the long term sustained economic growth which our plans have had wallace so do you believe it will be 3 percent this year and going how far into the future mnuchin well chris we can only project a couple years in the future but i think we are well on this path for several years so i don apost i don apost think this is a one or two year phenomenon i think we definitely are in a period of four or five sustained four or five years of sustained 3 percent growth at least wallace as you know some economists say this 4 1 percent figure in the second quarter is more of a blip than a trend i want to put up some of their reasons they point to a surge in farm exports in this quarter before the president aposs tariffs kicked in and they note that the federal reserve projects 2 8 percent growth this year and back to 2 percent by 2020 is the fed wrong sir mnuchin oh chris again you aposve got to go back to last year everyone was projecting 2 percent growth we were projecting 3 percent growth and everybody gave the reasons why we couldn apost get to three and we came up with the reasons and the policies so i think you are beginning to see projections go higher our 10 year projections are at 3 percent and we are comfortable we aposre hitting these numbers wallace speaking of the federal reserve both the president this week and vice president pence today on sunday morning futures rather are speaking out against the fed raising interest rates and potentially slowing growth here they both are begin video clip trump i don apost like all of this work we are putting into the economy and then i see rates going up mike pence vice president of the united states we don apost want policies whether capitol hill or elsewhere that diminish the tremendous energy that we have in this economy today end video clip wallace mr secretary what happened to respecting the independence of the federal reserve mnuchin well chris i think they do and we as an administration absolutely support the independence of the fed and the president has made it clear that this is the fed aposs decision so these are really more just comments saying as interest rates are going up it aposs something that the president has a concern but let me be clear he absolutely respects the independence of the fed and the issue is the market expects interest rates to keep going up so the only question is how far and for how long and we think the fed will be very careful in managing the economy wallace i mean in fact isn apost it responsible as the economy heats up when we aposve had these incredibly low artificially low interest rates when the economy was chugging along at one or 2 percent isn apost it responsible for the fed to increase interest rates mnuchin i think it is in the market expects it the fed has been targeting 2 percent inflation and obviously with 2 percent inflation we have to have at least slightly higher interest rates to manage through that wallace i want to ask you about another potential drag on the economy and that is the drop in some tech stocks especially this week facebook dropped 19 percent on thursday twitter fell 20 percent friday and intel and apple also fell mr secretary are you concerned about investors souring on tech stocks especially those tech stocks involving social media which is i think you would agree have been big drivers of growth in the economy and big drivers of rise in the markets mnuchin well chris i aposve always believed that diversified portfolios of u s stocks are great investments and will continue to be as you can see the market is not efficient the fact that you could have a one day correction of these magnitudes just goes to show you that in the short term the market is not necessarily efficient but i aposm not concerned about this at all and again investors should have diversified portfolios the tech stocks have obviously had an incredible run and you know kind of you look at the nasdaq you look at the s p you look at the dow the markets obviously doing very well wallace let aposs turn to trade president trump announced what he called a quote breakthrough agreement on trade with the european union this week but sir isn apost he exaggerating a bit there were no tariffs removed in his discussions with the european commission there were few specific commitments there was one on soybeans and there was no timetable in fact mr secretary all that the president and the president of the european commission agreed on is to start talking mnuchin well chris that aposs actually not the case and let me just step back for a second these talks started with the president of the g7 saying let aposs have no tariffs no barriers no subsidies those talks continued with the g7 i was at the g20 i met with my counterparts and then when we had the juncker the president of the e u we specifically did go through a detailed discussion we had several hours of kind of negotiating back and forth on an outline of an agreement and now we have the hard work but we aposve said the first step is going to be to resolve the steel and aluminum tariffs and when we do that the retaliatory tariffs will come off but this was also an agreement to reduce tariffs significantly across the board and we have about a trillion dollars of trade so this is a this is a very big opportunity to do things wallace but mr secretary let me give you one example of where the president and the administration makes it sound like there is a deal and the e u makes it sound like there isn apost here aposs what the president said to farmers in iowa this week begin video clip trump we just opened up you aposre up for you farmers if you are not going to be too angry with trump i can tell you end video clip wallace but as soon as he said that the spokesperson for the european commission gave this response quote agriculture is out of the scope of these discussions we are not negotiating about agricultural products mr secretary you are at odds the president is at odds with the european union before the talks even start mnuchin chris i was in the room and we had specific conversations about agriculture and the need to break down the barriers on agriculture and have more opportunities for our farmers we specifically talked about soybeans but we specifically agreed we aposd look at these other markets and it was very clear that our objective as part of this whole agreement is the europeans have to open up more opportunities for our farmers and our agriculture so i can apost comment on their comment this will be an important part of any agreement we reached wallace but let me just ask you directly because this is on the record the spokesperson for the european commission said let me quote it again we are not negotiating about agricultural products so are you right or is she right mnuchin again let me be clear we had specific conversation about soybeans that was step one we discussed other areas and again this is all part of a negotiation it aposs we will have an agreement so it will be in accomplishing agreement we want to drop tariffs and barriers across the board that aposs what we are focused on doing wallace forgive my skepticism and the skepticism of other people on this mr secretary but i don apost have to tell you there aposs a big difference between trade talks and a trade deal here you were in may here on fox news sunday talking about trade with china begin video clip mnuchin we are putting the trade war on hold so right now we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework end video clip wallace but within weeks of your making that declaration on their show president trump announced 50 billion in new tariffs or tariffs on 50 billion worth of chinese goods so you know what looked like a truce one minute can fall apart the next mnuchin well chris you aposre right these are complicated negotiations and these have to be turned into a real agreement that aposs literally hundreds and hundreds of pages so we aposre going to go part by part with europe i was down in mexico last week we had a terrific meeting with the new administration the nafta talks are back on track that aposs our number one priority now to get nafta done we are going to negotiate piece by piece with the e u and you know we continue to have conversations with china and we aposll see where we get but you aposre right these things have to be negotiated because the president is very clear he doesn apost just want talk we need our counterparts to follow through and deliver breaking down barriers and creating better opportunities so that we can reduce our giant trade deficit wallace finally mr secretary in response to farmers concerned about getting hit by tariffs the administration announced this week a 12 billion package in emergency aid i looked back to the record and you have spoken out several times against corporate welfare so when did handouts to farmers become strong good solid conservative policy mnuchin well chris i don apost think these are handouts so it would be one thing if we were just subsidizing markets and that aposs not what we are doing here this is a this is a short term solution to deal with the retaliatory tariffs where you have people who put tariffs which by the way are against wto rules and unfair and targeting our farmers so we are sticking up for our farmers so that they don apost get hurt in these trade discussions these are not long term subsidies for the industry wallace and what do you say to some republican senators who balked at this idea this week and said they need trade not aid mnuchin well we agree with that the focus is trade not aid and that aposs why we aposre focused on negotiating these agreements but again the president is not willing to live with the status quo where other countries have taken advantage of the rules and had free trade here and our companies and our workers can compete fairly and it aposs just not fair that china has complete open access to our markets and we have virtually limited access to their markets and forced joint ventures and we are focused on as we said free and fair trade let aposs take down all the barriers wallace secretary mnuchin thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir mnuchin thank you chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss what the good economic news will mean for republican control of congress come november plus rudy giuliani thinks someone played with that secretly recorded trump cohen tape the president aposs lawyer joins us at the bottom of the hour commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we aposve turned it all around once again we are the economic envy of the entire world when i meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is mr president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy end video clip wallace president trump in full salesman mode touting the news of strong economic growth this spring and it aposs time now for our sunday group jonah goldberg of the national review mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service jonathan swan who covers the white house for axios and fox news correspondent gillian turner jonah how big a deal is this 4 1 percent number gdp growth in the second quarter and is it enough for republicans to hang their hats on as they try to hold onto control of the house in november jonah goldberg national review historically normally you would think it would be and it is a big deal 4 1 is a big number the problem is is that for the republicans are suffering most are among essentially white college educated women in suburban districts they seem to be immune to the boom in the economy and the gender gap is unprecedented for congressional candidates and so the idea that the economy alone is what these women are going to vote for when they are going to be the ones providing the margins of difference whether or not they are going to hold onto the house i think is unlikely and is probably very worrisome to the white house wallace mo there has been a lot of talk about a blue wave this november a big democratic pickup may be control of the house maybe even control of the senate but i think you would agree in the absence of where the economy is always the top issue and when you got strong economic growth when you got historically low unemployment number isn apost that a pretty strong record for republicans to run on mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics public service look first of all we should all be celebrating 4 1 economic growth that aposs a good number a strong number it also would have been the fifth strongest number of the obama administration right the obama administration this is the continuation of economic recovery that began in 2009 and 2010 that strong economy wasn apost enough to save democrats last time it aposs not enough to say it will be enough to say it would save republicans this time i think jonah aposs point cannot be overstated that for a lot of these voters particularly suburban voters where gas prices are going up where they are a little bit more uncertainty around health care add to that some of these working class voters who are getting hit by the results of the tariffs on steel and aluminum who are getting hit by agricultural voters who are getting hit by issues like soybeans there aposs enough economic uncertainty that even with the strong number i think republicans are still facing a headwind wallace let aposs turn to the other big economic story this week and that was the so called trade truce between president trump and his administration and the european commission and the president and the head of the european commission jean claude juncker talked about that so here they are begin video clip trump this was a very big day for free and fair trade very big day indeed jean claude juncker president of the european commission i had the intention to make a deal today and we made a deal today end video clip wallace jonathan you heard my conversation just before the last segment with secretary of the treasury mnuchin what are your sources at the white house telling you about any real dialing down of tariffs with european union jonathan swan national political reporter axios well there is no dialing down of tariffs or intention i mean the tariffs all of remain in place the steel and aluminum tariffs and the retaliatory tariffs and if what secretary mnuchin told you is true which is the white house will only accept an encompassing i think he used the word encompassing deal which includes agriculture well they aposre going to have some problems because every country every bloc of countries has its pet political issues that they don apost want to touch for germany it aposs the cars that aposs why cars weren apost in that agreement they were explicitly excluded non auto industrial goods agriculture a big issue in europe again they are protected industries so wallace and particularly in france they explicitly said we do not want to lower agricultural tariffs swan right so if the demand is we want zero tariffs across everything which by the way was the objective of the ttip negotiations that obama was wallace explain what that is swan ttip was the predecessor to this this was obama the obama administration negotiating with europe for a free trade deal that was the objective you aposve got the objective page zero tariffs on all industries this is basically a narrower version of ttip in the goals and guess what it aposs going to be really hard like any massive trade negotiation so look i don apost have any indication that they are going to withdraw the steel and aluminum tariffs but i do know that the republicans on the hill are putting immense pressure now on the administration quietly because they are worried your whole first conversation about the economy republicans on the hill see the trade agenda as the biggest risk to that for the midterms wallace gillian i mean let aposs take a bigger look at the president aposs trade policy there is no deal with european union in fact talks haven apost even started there aposs no deal on nafta with mexico and canada although there has been a report of some progress in that area and there is certainly no deal in fact relations are tense and have gotten worse with china so how do you see the president aposs trade policy and specifically his policy on tariffs how do you see that playing out gillian turner fox news correspondent so as everyone has now pointed out not a lot of specifics in the deal with juncker but i want to just say that doesn apost mean it wasn apost a valuable exercise the whole exercise of him coming here meeting with the president and doing this joint press conference sometimes conflict resolution 101 tells you that when you have these really contentious negotiations the two sides are really far apart they are not agreeing on anything this battle sort of reaching the tipping point where it becomes a war the best thing to do is to just to agree to agree later on and to a certain extent that was what they achieved coming out of this and i don apost think it was in a worthless thing goldberg there aposs a problem with that in that this entire crisis to the extent it was a crisis donald trump created it right he aposs like a fireman who goes and sets fire so he can then be the hero so he creates this trade crisis and then he talks he backs off from it and we get back to the status quo ante that we had before he created the crisis in the first place i don apost know that there has been anything legitimately productive coming out of this whole chapter even though i do think trump should declare victory at this e u thing so we can move beyond it turner well to be fair they are they did agree to hit pause and not institute an escalation goldberg right turner no more new tariffs crosstalk turner i aposm not saying this follows everybody aposs problems but it is something worthwhile wallace i want to ask you jonathan because the president has been something on a twitter roll today and he just tweeted and i got it up here he said he would be willing to quote shut down the government if he doesn apost get everything he wants on immigration he wants a wall he wants an end to the visa lottery or a change in that he wants an end to the chain migration is he really willing to see a shutdown which would be on september 30th it would be one month before the midterm elections swan so this is i mean i have to say that sweet kind of shocks me and that not much actually shocks me from this president but the conversation i aposve had with his senior advisors as recently as a few weeks ago on this very subject was they were of the impression that they had convinced the president that it was not in his political interest to shut down the federal government six weeks before an election so i don apost know if this is just bluster bluffing that he feels dissatisfied that in the negotiations he aposs had with members of the senate that they haven apost given him more or said to them is going to get what he wants for his wall we all know how angry he was with the omnibus bill the last bill that didn apost give him his wall funding i would still be surprised if president trump shuts down the federal government that close to an election wallace all right panel we have to take a break we aposll see you a little later in the program when we come back michael cohen once boasted he would take a bullet for his boss but now donald trump aposs former attorney and fixer is looking like his biggest enemy the president aposs lead lawyer rudy giuliani joins us next commercial break wallace coming up secretary of state mike pompeo gets grilled on the trump putin summit begin video clip sen robert menendez d new jersey did the president tell you that he discussed relaxing russia sanctions or not yes or no mike pompeo secretary of state the president is entitled to have private meetings wallace we aposll ask the sunday panel about the criticism and prospects for another summit coming up commercial break wallace the confrontation between president trump and his former fixer michael cohen continues to build cohen leaked a conversation with mr trump he secretly taped about hush money for a playboy model trump aposs legal team had experts review the tape for tampering and cohen said he aposll talk to special counsel robert mueller about the president aposs denial that he knew anything about that infamous 2016 trump tower meeting joining me now the president aposs lead lawyer rudy giuliani mayor welcome back to fox news sunday rudy giuliani president trump aposs lead lawyer thank you chris good to be with you wallace i want to start with michael cohen mr trump aposs former lawyer his former fixer here is what you said about him a couple of months ago and the possibility that he might talk to special counsel robert mueller begin video clip giuliani i expect that he is going to cooperate with them i don apost think they aposll be happy with him because he doesn apost have any incriminating evidence about the president or himself the man is an honest honorable lawyer end video clip wallace honest honorable lawyer but now you say cohen is quote your words a pathological lawyer liar giuliani right wallace pathological lawyer a freudian slip a pathological liar who aposs been lying for years so what happened giuliani well here aposs what happened i mean i found out as everyone else did that he was surreptitiously recording his clients which is a disbarable ph offense obviously i obviously if i knew that i would never have said he was a reputable lawyer i aposd have said he was a scoundrel i i found of he not only taped lawyers but he fully intended to deceive because he had a conversation with one of your colleagues chris cuomo in which he made up big show of putting his phone in a drawer cuomo aposs phone in a drawer and said we aposll be off the record no recording he then proceeded to record two hours of that conversation it makes him a total liar i didn apost know that and now i aposve listened unfortunately fortunately from my client aposs point of view to many many hours of tapes and the man is a pathological manipulator liar i didn apost know that i didn apost know him well but i had i knew nothing bad about michael cohen until all of this started to happen in the last couple of weeks wallace mayor how angry is president trump about being betrayed about by a man that he worked so closely with and what does it mean this talk now that the their joint defense agreement is over what aposs the practical effect of that giuliani well first of all the president feels disappointed i think the anger is over you know we aposve we aposve assured him in a very strange way this is a very good development for us because we do have all these tapes and these tapes are completely demonstrating the president did nothing wrong cohen is on record over and over again stating his position it would be hard for him to contradict that now and he aposs done so many despicable things his credibility is not an issue i i the joint the joint offense ph agreement is in effect over because he aposs he aposs making it clear that he aposs going to try to hurt the president we can apost give him information and he obviously isn apost going to give us information that aposs all that existed wallace cohen aposs latest so called revelation is that he reportedly is prepared to tell the special counsel that robert mueller that he was witness to a conversation which president trump knew in advance about the trump tower meeting that that don junior and jared kushner paul manafort were going to meet with a russian lawyer and that contradicts what president trump told the new york times last summer take a look begin video clip unidentified male did you know at the time that they had the meeting donald trump president of the united states no i didn apost know anything about the meeting unidentified male but you didn apost trump it must have been a very important it must have been a very unimportant meeting because i never even heard about it end video clip wallace now the president repeated this week he did not know in advance of the trump tower meeting giuliani correct he did not wallace but let aposs explore this for a moment if i repeat if he did know if in fact he did lie to the new york times last summer when he said he didn apost know is there anything wrong with that giuliani well yes i guess there aposs something wrong with it on a on an ethical moral basis nothing if you got prosecuted for lying to the newspapers or the press my god i mean cohen cohen should go to jail for a thousand years his tapes are filled with lies including the most basic of all he wasn apost recording it but no he didn apost like to them cohen i is a reported this is a leak now so i don apost he may change it cohen you have to pick the day to figure out the story so cohen said that he was present at two different meetings he was present at a meeting with donald junior jared a group of other people in which they talked about the meeting two days later with the russians then he said he was present at a meeting the day of the meeting in the president aposs office in which either donald junior jared or a few people came in and told the president every other participant in both those meetings say it is not true there was no such meeting in advance there was no such interruption if he taped everything else why the heck didn apost he tape this it aposs not on tape and he aposs capable i think unfortunately of doctoring tapes hasn apost done that it would be hard to do that now since we have an expert all over it so it aposs just flat out untrue and what are you surprised he aposs lying i mean i would have been surprised back then but now that i know all this about him it seems to me his default position is to lie he aposs a bad liar because he lies in contradiction to tapes and he lies in contradiction to what i just said is probably supported by anywhere from two to five witnesses wallace and is it fair to say i mean you have not been shy in what you aposve said here that you aposre at war with michael cohen now giuliani i don apost know i don apost think we aposre at war with him you know obviously the real test here is the investigators the justice department and the american public he doesn apost get to decide this case i you know i i should say i feel sorry for him but nobody will believe me he aposs destroyed himself chris as a witness i prosecuted you know 5 000 cases i aposd never prosecute a case on this guy aposs testimony first of all he talks to the press he may be taping me second he aposs contradicted so many times that i mean you began your cross examination by saying which set of lies are you going to tell today michael let aposs go through them now wallace all right let me let me pick up because there was another big development this week and that was the tape that michael cohen secretly recorded a tape a conversation in 2016 that he had with donald trump before the election in which there was a discussion of paying money to buy the rights to the story of karen mcdougal a playboy model who says claims that she had a relationship with donald trump here aposs a portion of that tape begin video clip michael cohen president trump aposs former attorney and i aposve spoken to allen weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up donald trump president of the united states so what do we have to pay for this cohen with funding trump one fifty cohen yes and it aposs all the stuff trump i was thinking about that cohen all the stuff because here you never how where that company you never know what he aposs going to be trump maybe he gets hit by a truck cohen correct end video clip wallace you say that cohen violated attorney client privilege by secretly recording a tape of his own client and then making it public but but cohen aposs lawyer lanny davis came out last night and said well you aposve been talking about the tape and since you talked about the tape you have waived any attorney client privilege giuliani well you aposve got to get the cart before the horse here i mean the reality is they they leaked the tape and then we quite clearly responded which we aposre allowed to do under the court order and the new york times reporters who got the leak have confirmed that which is unusual for them to do that maggie haberman and mike schmidt that leak did not come from us the court order allows us to respond without waiving any privilege well it aposs not my privilege it aposs the president aposs privilege if we have to defend him that aposs exactly what we were doing and it has been very helpful to us because now we aposve been able to put out the whole transcripts which contradicts several things that lanny davis says he aposs almost as bad as cohen i mean he aposs said that cohen didn apost intend to deceive when he did these tape recordings what is it to take a phone put it in a drawer and tell somebody you aposre not recording them if it isn apost an intent to deceive i mean these people tell quentin like lies lies that can be contradicted by tape recordings wallace i want to ask you about this it aposs going to seem a little off topic but i will get it will it will become relevant mr mayor about brett kavanaugh who is president trump aposs nominee now for the supreme court in 1999 kavanaugh said of the case in which the supreme court ordered richard nixon to turn over the white house tapes quote maybe nixon the nixon versus u s case was wrongly decided in a 2009 article kavanaugh wrote this like civil suits criminal investigations take the presidents focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people and a president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president question is judge kavanaugh out right the law giuliani you know i aposve looked at the law and i don apost i really can apost say those are legal opinions those are really just things he aposs saying we don apost see the authority we don apost see i mean i believe that the constitution is clear that the president cannot be subpoenaed or if he is subpoenaed he has a right to challenge it on the grounds that they haven apost exhausted all other possibilities that they don apost have other ways to get the information there aposs a case the espy ph case closest one that you can find he was a cabinet officer and they said he could only be subpoenaed in essence taken away from his duties if there was no other way to get the information so the president would at least have that privilege where he has the complete privilege and therefore can apost be investigated at all i really would have to do more research i mean there aposs a good argument that that aposs the case other law review articles have said that it does exist as the law in most countries the head of state has immunity until after he aposs out of office but other countries it does so that requires more analysis wallace so given the fact that that is judge kavanaugh aposs opinion and given the fact that a legal dispute between president trump and the special counsel might end up before the supreme court would it be useful to have judge kavanaugh be justice kavanaugh giuliani no i don apost know brett very well i just know he aposs a person a very high integrity i was a law clerk to a federal judge i argued in the supreme court and i know that these off the cuff opinions like this when somebody sits down and starts looking at the law as i was just doing he may very well go in the other direction so i wouldn apost count on kavanaugh aposs vote on this this is a question of first impression and the trump situation is very different than the nixon situation so i don apost think we get an edge one way or the other i think the supreme court is about as straight as you aposre going to get in our country and this is going to be a case that they aposre going to have to decide in the first instance and it doesn apost happen if they don apost subpoena him and no president has ever submitted to a subpoena even clinton who was subpoenaed they had to withdraw it before he would testify wallace mayor giuliani thank you thanks for sharing your weekend with us giuliani thanks chris wallace please come back sir giuliani thank you thank you sir wallace up next michael cohen gives increasing signs he aposs ready to cut a deal with the special counsel what would you like to ask the panel about cohen potentially flipping on president trump just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip michael cohen president trump aposs former attorney when it comes time for the financing which will be donald trump president of the united states what aposs that ph what financing cohen we aposll have to pay inaudible trump well we aposll pay with cash cohen no no no no no i got this no no no end video clip wallace a portion of the 2016 conversation between donald trump and michael cohen that cohen secretly recorded about a potential payment for a playboy model aposs story and we aposre back now with the panel jonathan this trump cohen story is part shakespeare part soap opera part kafka from what you hear how angry is the president about cohen apparently flipping and how worried is the president jonathan swan national political reporter axios i can apost speak to his level of worry because it aposs not something that he would project to people that i talk to there he might have that conversation with you know melania or someone like that his anger level is probably 12 out of 10 and if you take rudy giuliani as a vessel for that anger and sort of you know going out and calling cohen a pathological liar et cetera et cetera i mean that aposs a pretty good proxy but as a as as regards how much exposure he has the one thing i will say is people do misconceive michael cohen aposs role in trump world he was this sort of off the books kind of lawyer as you can see from that tape recording but it aposs not like he had full visibility over everything i often see it stated as fact that cohen knows where every body is buried actually he doesn apost he knows where like you know maybe like 20 bodies are buried but but there aposs probably you know whatever however many more it aposs really weisselberg the lawyer who aposs been with trump for decades who actually started working for trump aposs father fred trump who aposs just been subpoenaed he aposs the guy who really has visibility so on the hierarchy of concern he he should be much higher wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from danny thibeaux who writes if cohen is telling the truth how bad could this be for president trump jonah how do you answer danny jonah goldberg national review well it depends what the this is and what what cohen is saying i think you know whether or not you know as you said when you aposre subbing in for special report this week whether or not you lie lying to the new york times is not a crime right but when cohen says that donald trump knew about the meeting in trump tower what that does is and also when we have this stuff about the payments this wipes away a vast swath of the defenses at the white house and its biggest supporters have been making for a very very long time they can apost keep saying things are fake news when the media is not even part of it when it aposs a taped taped interview or a taped phone conversation and it it shrinks the circle of plausible deniability across a vast array of things but at the end of the day it still depends what mueller actually finds and i don apost know that cohen is this is the silver bullet that a lot of anti trump people want him to be wallace let aposs turn to the continued fallout from the trump putin summit secretary of state mike pompeo testified before a senate committee this week and i think it aposs fair to say he got hammered about president trump aposs failure to confront putin at least publicly at that news conference about russian meddling in the 2016 election take a look begin video clip bob menendez d nj ranking member senate foreign relations in his conversation with putin i hope the president laid out the consequences of interference in the 2018 election but i know you can apost tell me that so you actually mike pompeo secretary of state actually i can tell you that menendez oh you want to share that one with me pompeo i can apost no i can apost menendez that one you want to share with me pompeo no senator i can tell you that because the president has disclosed that menendez ok end video clip wallace and it went downhill from there gillian while the trump team is still trying to clean up from what happened in helsinki russian foreign minister lavrov was asked about it this week and i want to i don apost know how you say it in russian but he described the helsinki summit as quote better than super so i aposm not sure that aposs particularly helpful for president trump when the russians seem to be so happy with how it went gillian turner fox news correspondent it aposs not a good sign and i think particularly on the topic of election meddling which was the exchange we just saw back and forth there that is still the administration aposs the weakest spot in the administration aposs apple because whenever you aposve got the secretary of state and the president disagreeing on a on a policy issue it creates a major problem i aposm referring specifically to president trump saying that he wasn apost sure if he was going to take the intelligence community aposs assessment at face value that they that the russians had interfered in the election pompeo said in that hearing a few moments after that exchange that the president did take the intelligence community aposs assessment at face value that aposs a major sticking point on the bigger issue of the helsinki summit he aposs almost having the president aposs almost having a little bit of a barack obama moment remember in 2011 2012 nobody wanted president obama to be talking to the mullah aposs in iran nobody in congress nobody the american people didn apost want this and he wanted a deal and he said i aposm going to do this anyway i aposm going to court iran anyway and i think that aposs what president trump aposs doing now amidst all this blowback he aposs saying i want a deal with putin i aposm doing this wallace mo there was a curious development on the whole putin trump relationship this week because the white house which had invited putin to come for a summit in november which it seemed surprisingly quick john bolton the national security advisor announced that no they aposre going to put it over until at least early next year until as he put it the witch hunt by which he meant the robert mueller special counsel probe is over but then putin announced on friday or saturday he was in south africa that they have invited the russians have invited trump to come to moscow and have a summit at the kremlin i don apost know whether the sequence is that that would be before or after the washington summit but that just makes things even as clear as mud doesn apost it mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public service the president invites putin the russia aposs formal response was ah don apost know this might not be the best timing so the president rescinds the invitation and then the russians say well you know you can always come to us it aposs like putin aposs just sitting there like a cat playing with a toy right he aposs just he aposs he is having the time of his life with this president of the united states when the president and gillian aposs point is right when the president is out there saying that he doesn apost necessarily accept the intelligence community aposs assessment and forced them to backpedal on that and say no i do but then tweets within days that once again that it is a hoax putin is getting everything he wants out of this relationship and that is not a good thing for the united states wallace jonathan does the president still think after all the blowback from helsinki does he still think that he can make progress with putin swan my understanding is yes i mean that aposs what i aposm told by senior officials there that he has always believed that and he still continues to believe that he thinks that he can get a deal in syria i don apost know what the deal looks like obviously the official u s position is they want to get iran as far out of syria as possible whether putin aposs willing to provide pressure i think we should all be pretty skeptical about that the one country that aposs actually quite happy with trump aposs conversations with putin is israel the israelis are actually pretty happy with them having these discussions and they are wanting to push the iranians as far away from their border as possible and of course bibi netanyahu the israeli leader actually has a pretty decent relationship with putin so look i think it aposs going to be very hard both because of domestic politics and you know the general public but also capitol hill these members are now getting pretty aggressive on russia and wanting to sanction them further so i think trump aposs going to have a lot of trouble cutting anything that aposs wallace and jonah we aposve got less than a minute left there was an announcement of a meeting i think it was friday that the president had with the national security council and we were told this was a meeting about election meddling in 2018 and and what surprised me is to the best of my knowledge there may have been other meetings but this is the first one that they had announced one would think that they would have done this some time ago goldberg you would you would and i think that might be in part to provide some political cover because this is going to be a bigger issue and they need some more talking points to push back on it i also think that one of the lessons of the week from the pompeo testimony on down is that there are a bunch of very committed serious people in the trump administration who want to say the real policy is what we aposre doing not what the president is saying wallace well it aposs interesting interesting times inaudible thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the remarkable woman who took these powerful pictures on the front lines commercial break wallace if you ever read the new york times or national geographic or time magazine chances are you have seen her work as we told you last december she takes riveting photographs that bring the savagery of the front lines into your home here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape lynsey addario photojournalist i never consider myself brave i just consider myself very sort of committed to the story and that takes me to places that are dangerous wallace voice over lynsey addario is one of the great photojournalists of the last two decades just listen to where she aposs worked since 9 11 addario i aposve covered afghanistan iraq libya darfur congo south sudan somalia wallace on camera question why addario there are great injustices that go on in war zones and its fundamental for someone to be there to document that wallace voice over darfur 2004 addario there were skeletons across the desert people fleeing for their lives we witnessed villages that had been burned to the ground wallace with u s troops in afghanistan aposs korengal valley in 2007 addario i woke up i put on my night vision took this picture and fell back asleep wallace in pakistan aposs no man aposs land tribal area with the taliban in 2009 for a story that won the pulitzer prize addario if they invite you to their home they will not kill you they will protect you with their lives so we knew that or we hoped that once we got there because we had been invited they would not kill us unidentified female the new york times says four of its journalist reporting on the conflict in libya are now missing wallace but addario aposs luck almost ran out when she and three colleagues were taken prisoner by qaddafi aposs forces in 2011 addario they were about to execute as and we aposre literally at one point i looked over and i saw each one of my colleagues literally begging for for their lives and i remember i could barely speak and i just said please and at that moment a commander came over and said you can apost kill them they aposre american wallace addario and the others were beaten and held for six days but then finally released two months later she went back to work not on the front lines but still in gaza and afghanistan and senegal and by now she was pregnant wallace on camera did your family did your friends did you question what the heck you were doing addario the fact is i was pregnant and i was surrounded by pregnant women and oh my god it was the most natural thing i always feel like i aposm in the wrong place when i aposm here i want to be there when i aposm there i want to be home wallace voice over addario aposs son lucas is now six when she comes home he sits on her lap while she edits her pictures sometimes of war refugees addario and he asks about war and i say it aposs fighting and some people get killed and he said well then mommy can apost you get killed and to me that aposs like how do i answer that because i can apost just lie to him and so i just say i aposll be fine wallace so why does she do it why has she risked her life

being there to travel and take a picture it aposs really about the storytelling about journalism about truth
