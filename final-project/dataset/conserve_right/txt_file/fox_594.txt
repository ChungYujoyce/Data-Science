to enjoy all the benefits of our website in germany and across the west attackers are motivated by tropes of white genocide elite conspiracies andjewish or muslim plots get the new statesman s morning call email nine people died on wednesday night when a gunman attacked two shisha bars in hanau near frankfurt in germany all of the victims had migrant roots mostly turkish as did most of the fiveinjured the 43 year old suspect tobias rathjen was found dead having seeminglykilled his mother too at his flat shortly after the attack demonstrating what german authorities have called a deeply racist mindset he appears to have been the author of a 24 page manifesto littered with conspiracy theories and genocidal hatred proposing among other things the annihilation of a long list of countries in africa and asia the attack is the latest in a wave of terrorism motivated by far right ideology a list including the massacre at ut ya and oslo in 2011 the charlottesville car attack in the us in 2017 shootings at a supermarket in el paso texas and a mosque in christchurch new zealand last year in germany there have been several far right attacks in the past twelve months alone in a speech yesterday frank walter steinmeier germany s president recalled the murder last june of walter l bke a local politician who had supported angela merkel s refugee policies and the attack last october on a synagogue in halle at which only a recently installed high security door prevented a bloodbath it is not hard to see a pattern in the ideology of the perpetrators tropes of white genocide white replacement theory elite conspiracies race war anti feminism and jewish or muslim plots recur again and again in the racist utterances and writings of the attackers they belong to a common ecosystem of extreme hate filled ideas the halle and christchurch perpetrators for example both seemed to have picked up memes and talking points from far right internet chat rooms the hanau suspect s text was more esoteric and unlike others did not reference previous attacks but it echoed conspiracist far right discourse in america the rambling manifesto includes a call for a border wall with mexico and alleges that the cia uses mind control googletag cmd push function googletag display 1x3 this pattern of ideological motivation is sometimesoverlooked in the aftermath of such attacks responsible reporting focuses primarily on the victims rather than giving the attacker the gratification of publicity but where an attacker is written about the language can be unhelpful lone wolf may be an accurate description of logistical autonomy an attack planned and executed without outside help but can falsely imply ideological autonomy the notion that the attacker was not motivated by others ideas calling an act an attack on us all as the hanau shooting has been termed is a well meant call for unity but can downplay the targeted racism behind such attacks on minorities and terming racism a poison as merkel did yesterday is absolutely correct but out of context can imply that racism is a force of nature rather than a worldview to be fought prominent voices on the political far right are only too willing to encourage any blurring away of the far right ideas behind the violence this is neither right nor left wing terror but the mad act of a crazed man tweeted j rg meuthen the federal spokesman of the nationalist populist alternative for germany afd yesterday in many cases including this one the attacker does indeed appear to be deranged but as the germanterrorism expert peter neumann has pointedout derangement and ideological motivation are by no means mutually exclusive it is worth comparing this with the reactions to islamist violence in the aftermath of terror attacks such as those in paris nice brussels and manchester attention has rightly been directed at the ideological eco system from which they have emerged at the process of attackers radicalisation at the mosques and madrassas attended at the trips made to the middle east or north africa at the chat rooms used the result has been a growing consensus that it is not enough to combat the security threat from islamist extremism that societies need also to confront the extreme ideas even when they take non violent forms security measures measures are necessary but we are spending billions and billions of dollars in security measures tony blair told the new statesman last month in the end you ve got to destroy the ideas that is as true of far right terrorism as it is of islamist terrorism anti semitic tropes misogyny racist conspiracy theories and the likeexist not just in the minds of far right terrorists but in those of a much larger body of people willing to promote and share them indeed in a somewhat milder form they can even be tolerated in parts of the political mainstream a report last year by the institute for strategic dialogue noted that white replacement theory the baseless notion cited by the christchurch attacker that migration and differential birth rates are wiping out white western populations has grown in prominence on social media in recent years the report attributes this to the term s explicit propagation by frontline politicians such ash c strache in austria marion mar chal le pen in france and the afd s bj rn h cke in germany and to racist references to an invasion of migrants by leaders such as donald trump and viktor orb n there is ample evidence of western mainstreams turning a blind eye to or tolerating such poisonous ideas take germany for example where the armed forces have long been accused of doing too little to root out right wing extremists in their ranks where earlier this month centrist parties almost established a state government reliant on afd backing and where as the die zeit journalist christian bangel wrote of the ideas behind the halle attack they are ideas which in a slightly less strident form are also discussed on talk shows by some who identify as conservatives and all this in a country that by international comparison is particularly wary of and sensitive to the slippery slope from poisonous ideas to poisonous acts the long term answer to extreme right violence and terror then is the same as the long term answer to extreme islamist violence and terror better security yes but also an uncompromising culture of calling out confronting and defeating the ideas that spark the attacks it is temptingly simple to reduce horrors like the shootings in hanau to guns and evil a case of stopping bad guys before they do bad things but the broader task falls not just on counter terrorism squads but on politicians journalists social media platforms teachers civic leaders and indeed ordinary citizens that task stopping the bad ideas the attack is the latest in a wave of terrorism motivated by far right ideology a list including the massacre at ut ya and oslo in 2011 the
