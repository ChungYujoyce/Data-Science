to enjoy all the benefits of our website the us is trying to catch up with the rest of the world as the president continues toundercut experts get the new statesman s morning call email the united states is already feeling the devastating impact of the covid 19 pandemic at the time of writing there are over 4 000 confirmed cases the true figure is much higher and more than 70 deaths but the crisis will become much worse in the weeks and months ahead the us is ill prepared for a pandemic criticism has been directed at the habitual ethic of individualism people looking out for themselves getting rich by reselling hand sanitiser or insisting that mass gatherings such as concerts and sporting events are signs of freedom and national defiance but individualism is not an inherent trait it is a cultivated one reinforced by decades of political rhetoric that has depicted welfare services such as state funded healthcare or parental leave as foreign and dangerous to the american way of life this is why gripped by a pandemic americans believe they can rely on their own gumption and strength of character to get through it all but this overlooks a more immediate problem the deleterious role of donald trump and his administration the list of mistakes is breathtaking the us did not use the test template approved by the world health organization instead the centers for disease control and prevention created its own the food and drug administration also prevented academic hospitals from developing their own tests to detect covid 19 until 29 february nearly six weeks after the first

similarly minimising the fatal risk of the disease trump had two current examples of how not to contain a pandemic but he failed to heed these lessons as a consequence the us has been far too slow in
