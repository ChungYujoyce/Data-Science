escalates a technology dispute by going ahead with a march 2 tariff hike on 200 billion of imports from china two days of talks starting thursday allow too little time to resolve the war over beijing s technology ambitions that threatens to drag on weakening global economic growth businesspeople and economists say they believe china s goal is to make enough progress to persuade trump to extend his deadline there are few signs of movement on the thorniest issue washington s demand that beijing scale back plans for government led creation of global champions in robotics and other fields china s trading partners say those violate its market opening obligations and some american officials worry they might erode u s industrial leadership top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism

beijing wants to see the threat of additional tariff imposition being removed for as long as possible with minimal conditions attached said louis kuijs of oxford economics trump s december agreement to postpone more tariff hikes while the two sides negotiate expires march 1 the following day a 10 percent tariff imposed in july on 200 billion of chinese imports would rise to 25 percent on tuesday trump said while he is not inclined to extend the march 2 deadline he might let it slide for a little while if talks go well earlier the white house called march 2 a hard deadline companies on both

economy said eswar prasad a cornell university economist who was head of the china division at the international monetary fund chinese officials reject complaints that foreign companies are required to hand over technology but business groups and foreign governments point to rules they say compel companies to disclose trade secrets or share technology with state owned local partners chinese
