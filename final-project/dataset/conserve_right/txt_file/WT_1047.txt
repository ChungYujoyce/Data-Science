apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap the democratic controlled house passed an 8 3 billion measure wednesday to battle the coronavirus outbreak that s spreading rapidly and threatening a major shock to the economy and disruptions to everyday life in the u s the swift and sweeping bipartisan vote was a relative rarity in a polarized washington and came just nine days after the president outlined a 2 5 billion plan that both trump s gop allies and democratic critics said was insufficient the 415 2 vote came after house speaker nancy pelosi beat a tactical retreat on vaccine price guarantees and followed a debate that lasted only a few minutes top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to

house appropriations committee chairwoman nita lowey d n y this emergency supplemental addresses the coronavirus and takes critical steps to protect the american people from this deadly and expanding outbreak the senate is likely to pass the measure thursday and send it to the white house for trump s signature the legislation came together in little more than a week and more than triples trump s request sped along by fears of the outbreak s growing threat trump is sure to sign the measure which has the blessing of top republicans like senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky and top house republican kevin mccarthy of california this moment calls for collaboration and unity mcconnell said it s time to give our public health experts and healthcare professionals the surge resources they

developed with government backed research but manufactured by drug companies be offered at affordable prices pelosi opted to avoid a confrontation that could have delayed the legislation s path

purchase such drugs from manufacturers at fair and reasonable prices to distribute them to those who need it which is the standard applied in earlier crises like the 2009 h1n1 flu outbreak it also would provide more than 2 billion to help federal state and local governments prepare for and respond to the coronavirus threat including 300 million for the centers for disease control and prevention

dan kildee d mich also wednesday top congressional leaders met to discuss what additional steps may be needed to ensure the safety of the capitol complex for lawmakers and staff as well as the annual influx of visitors this spring afterward pelosi said it was a good positive meeting about unity and how we want to protect the capitol and have continuity of operations for the congress asked whether
