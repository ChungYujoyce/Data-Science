apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion president trump was winning the democratic presidential nomination debate in nevada on wednesday until former new york city mayor and billionaire mike bloomberg stopped dodging weaving and apologizing and started punching the debate s point was for democrats and independents to see if they could imagine one of the debaters looking credible against the expected withering fire from the donald this fall and maybe actually defeating the trumpeter on nov 3 no one on that las vegas stage looked remotely like a trump beater

abortions for all including illegal aliens until the is the founder of bloomberg news bloomberg terminals and bloomberg businessweek showed he d had it up to here with front runner sen bernie sanders endless socialism pitch as if reading the minds of nearly every viewer over 40 youngsters who can write on half a postage stamp all they know about socialism flock to bernie mr bloomberg his voice rising said i can t think of a way that would make it easier for donald trump to get reelected than listening to this conversation this is ridiculous finally in the ninth debate mr bloomberg s first a democratic nomination candidate showed the guts to call mr sanders stupid idea a stupid idea we re not going to throw out capitalism mr bloomberg said we tried that other countries tried that it was called communism and it just didn t work applause from the audience that gave mr sanders 78 of vermont his cue we are living in many ways in a socialist society right now we have socialism for the very rich rugged individualism for the poor he said with the patented sanders finger wag that in turn stirred an increasingly fed up mr bloomberg to make the case that he is the only one of the six on stage that ever ran anything really big or for that matter anything at all a trump defeating requisite for democrats i was going to say we maybe want to talk about businesses mr bloomberg who s also 78 i m the only one here i think that s ever started a business is that fair he paused silence on the stage ok mr bloomberg said satisfied he had hammered home his point for 12 years three elected mayoral terms mr bloomberg ran new york city the population of which is greater than 131 of the 232 sovereign nations in the world his stop and frisk policy for all its imperfections and inevitable unfairness at times cut the murder rate but now someone has convinced him that he can t get the democratic nomination without pandering on race so he sounded weak and pandering in apologizing on stage for a policy that wins praise from his predecessor former mayor rudy giuliani who says stop and frisk did make the city safer the man mr bloomberg is chasing is mr sanders who s ahead in 10 out of the 10 latest national polls and has about 25 percent of the vote mr bloomberg is in second place at around 18 percent and rising vice president joe biden 77 ties for second but is falling given current polling state by state the size of each campaign organization and the money available the nomination contest is between mr sanders and mr bloomberg and the rest of the field is background noise the others in effect are running for a miracle but will settle for being tapped by the democratic standard bearer for vice president sen amy klobuchar of minnesota did well and remains the probable top v p pick for mr bloomberg as real time social media posters correctly noted when the debate s opening gun sounded a figure of speech appropriate for the obsessive gun controller mr bloomberg he didn t sound like a potential trump trouncer minutes into the debate sen elizabeth warren 70 of massachusetts lit into him demanding that he release right there on the stage his women employees from their non disclosure agreements again his response was wobbly weak defensive the no tell pacts were voluntary some women may not have liked a joke he told he employed some prominent women in a stage aside to the theater audience ms warren said i hope you heard what his defense was i ve been nice to some women reporters for major newspapers posted that mr bloomberg for all the millions he s been spending on his campaign advertising in the past 10 weeks was turning out to be a flop in person he was in the beginning he came off not as an entrepreneurial titan so much as a weak pip squeak 5 feet 8 inches compared to mr sanders 6 feet mr trump stands at 6 feet 3 inches mr bloomberg did it to himself by sounding defensive something you won t catch the donald sounding like ever only when mr bloomberg stopped trying to follow his aides script and got his blood up did he sound and look like a possible trump thumper in a glorious example of irony tinged with unintended humor mr sanders brought out the best in mr bloomberg we are living in many ways in a socialist society right now we have socialism for the very rich rugged individualism for the poor mr sanders said mr bloomberg turned scowled and called him a hypocrite what a wonderful country we have mr bloomberg oozing sarcasm said the best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses what did i miss here at one point nbc s meet the press moderator chuck todd asked mr bloomberg who is the 12th richest person in the world if he should have earned so much money mr bloomberg no longer defensive shot back yes i worked hard for it and added that he gives a big chunk of it to the democratic party applause from the las vegas audience something else this debate made clear concerns mr biden s drift into irrelevancy mr bloomberg s 63 billion fortune isn t what s sinking the former vice president joe is nor will mr bloomberg s money buy him the nomination if he puts potential supporters to sleep as he did in the first part of the debate wednesday they ll think it means he can t beat mr trump mr bloomberg will have a chance to perform more consistently in another debate on feb 25 in charleston s c it is the last debate before his first and crucial election test on super tuesday on march 3 no matter his 63 billion can t and won t buy him the nomination he entered this race more than a year late all his unprecedented advertising spending gives him is fast catchup on name recognition outside new york the history of all hitherto existing presidential contests shows that winning takes more than money in the 2016 republican nomination race by the time sen marco rubio of florida had dropped out in mid march his campaign had spent 4 million more than mr trump by the time sen ted cruz of texas had suspended his bid he had spent 85 8 million to mr trump s 63 3 million personality policy and a late stroke of strategic genius are why the donald against all expectations was able to give that acceptance speech in cleveland in the summer of 2016 if it s mr sanders who accepts the democratic nomination in mid july in milwaukee mr trump will be assured a second term if mr bloomberg winds up the nominee the betting will still be on the donald but the odds will be less favorable to him and the fall contest will be even more in
