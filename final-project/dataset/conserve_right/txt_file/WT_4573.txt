apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic well of course it did a new study finds that the big three broadcast networks went wild over house impeachment hearings directed at president trump but they selectively ignored significant proceedings associated with former president bill clinton during his impeachment in 1998 yes there s a study broadcast networks nbc cbs and abc have donated 75 hours of free air time to democrats impeachment hearings despite notably poor and consistently shrinking ratings yet during president clinton s impeachment these same networks could not be bothered to carry more than a few hours of independent counsel ken starr s one day presentation of the evidence against clinton on november 19 1998 writes bill d agostino a research analyst for the media research center the hearings against mr trump have fixated the broadcasters top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century nbc s live coverage during the hearings amounted to a whopping 92 1 653 minutes or 27 5 hours of the total 30 hours of testimony cbs ran special coverage for 84 of the hearings 1 517 minutes or 25 hours while abc broadcast 75 1 358 minutes or 22 5 hours the analyst said by contrast back in november of 1998 nbc aired a paltry 26 194 minutes of starr s 12 5 hours of testimony on capitol hill cbs covered 42 of the hearing 314 minutes while abc broadcast 36 272 minutes mr d agostino noted in the past two weeks broadcast networks bumped hours of regularly scheduled programming for hearings featuring 12 hitherto unheard of witnesses many of whom had never even spoken to president trump yet these networks were reluctant to cover starr s testimony back in 1998 even though that hearing relied on a single well known witness with intimate knowledge of all the evidence being presented he said the crafty networks masked much of the events from the public the media heavily downplayed the clinton impeachment hearings as exemplified by an associated press article published on november 20 1998 titled viewers turn off tune in drop out the piece framed the networks choice to carry only sparse coverage of the starr hearing as a service of their viewers mr d agostino concluded
