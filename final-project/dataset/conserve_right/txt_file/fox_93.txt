the entire affordable care act invalid obamacare will remain in place pending appeal and both president trump and democrats are calling for congress to pass new legislation we aposll get to all that a little later but first the president is already dealing with a possible government shutdown that aposs now just five days away meanwhile prosecutors are producing more of the evidence that led former members of mr trump aposs inner circle to plead guilty evidence that implicates the president let aposs get the latest from kevin corke live at the white house kevin kevin corke correspondent chris even for an administration accustomed to seismic shifts in the news cycle it was without a doubt a tumultuous week but few headlines could prove as potentially damaging to the trump white house than those involving former members of the president aposs inner circle begin videotape corke three of whom are facing time in prison for a variety of misdeeds but none involving so called russian collusion former national security adviser general michael flynn faces sentencing tuesday for lying to federal investigators the special counsel aposs office recommending he get no jail time even as it has faced charges that the general was entrapped and inappropriately questioned meanwhile in his first televised interview since being sentenced to three years behind bar the president aposs former fixer attorney michael cohen claimed he repeatedly lied for mr trump over the years and he would set up payments to women to help aid his 2016 campaign a claim strongly denied by the white house trump i will take the mantle of shutting down and i aposm going to shut it down for border security crosstalk sen chuck schumer d n y but we believe you shouldn apost shut it down corke an oval office meeting with leading democrats this week did little to quell fears of a potential partial government shutdown over the president aposs insistence that there would be funding for a border wall something democrats say they won apost pay for a work stoppage that could come in a week in which backers of the affordable care act obamacare consider their next move in the wake of a federal judge aposs ruling that the law is unconstitutional trump that the supreme court upholds we aposll be sitting down with the democrats and we will get great health care for our people let aposs say repeal and replace end videotape corke that ruling by district court judge reed o aposconnor chris does not impact obamacare recipients in the short term but it does set up a potential high court battle and that is a debate white house officials would love to have chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks wallace and joining me now from new york the president aposs lead lawyer rudy giuliani mayor welcome back to fox news sunday rudy guiliani lead lawyer donald trump thank you very much thank you thank you chris wallace let aposs start with michael cohen aposs allegation that president trump directed him to commit a criminal campaign finance violation here first was the president and then mr cohen begin video clip trump i never directed him to do anything wrong whatever he did he did on his own he aposs a lawyer a lawyer who represents a client is supposed to do the right thing michael cohen former lawyer donald trump he directed me to make the payments he directed me to become involved in these matters end video clip wallace question did mr trump direct michael cohen to pay off these two women or not giuliani no the truth is actually what cohen testified to under oath before congress and what he repeated numerous times on surreptitious tape recordings that he made which is that the president didn apost know about this until some time into it he did find out about it and eventually reimburse him but you know this is a hard thing to do but lawyers do this all the time but chris even if it were true it aposs not a crime the payment the payment of money in a situation like this has been covered in the edwards case not only the acquittal and hung jury in the edwards case but the fact that the fec looked at those edwards violations and determined they weren apost violations crosstalk wallace i promise we aposre going to get to that in a minute but let aposs get to the simple fact question of whether the president directed cohen giuliani no wallace to make these giuliani no wallace payments or not cohen says that the president is not to be believed here he is begin video clip cohen the man doesn apost tell the truth and it aposs sad that i should take responsibility for his dirty deeds end video clip giuliani wow wallace mayor mayor giuliani that aposs some lawyer that is some lawyer he was the lawyer in that situation crosstalk wallace but does the president tell the truth or not giuliani the president is telling the truth yes this man is lying now is that a big surprise to you that michael cohen is lying the man got up in front of the judge and said i was a fiercely loyal to donald trump nonsense he was fiercely loyal to him he taped him lied to him revealed the tape and did something a lawyer i aposve never heard ever did tape record his own client wallace but but sir giuliani he sat there with chris cuomo told him he wasn apost being taped showed him a drawer ph and he lied to him and taped him for two hours the man is a complete pathological liar that cannot be believed wallace but sir let aposs let aposs turn to crosstalk giuliani and they aposll never put him on a witness stand they will never chris wallace yes but let me ask you giuliani they will never put him on a witness stand wallace i understand but does the question the real question is the credibility of the president not the credibility of michael cohen giuliani no no wallace let me just finish the president has changed his story repeatedly about whether or not he knew about hush money here is what he said on air force one the president said on air force one this april eight months ago begin video clip reporter mr president did you know about the 130 000 payment to stormy daniels trump no no what else reporter then why did michael cohen make those if there was no truth to her allegations trump well you aposll have to ask michael cohen michael is my attorney and you aposll have to ask michael cohen reporter do you know where he got the money to make that payment trump no i don apost know end video clip wallace the president said he doesn apost know anything about any payments but in one of those tapes that you aposre talking about where cohen surreptitiously taped the president this is back in september of 2016 here are the president and cohen discussing a potential giuliani inaudible wallace let aposs listen to the tape first giuliani sure sure i remember it well begin audio clip cohen i aposm all over that and i spoke to allen about it when it comes time for the financing which will be trump wait a sec what financing cohen well i aposll have to pay trump pay with cash cohen no no no no no no end audio clip wallace so which is it did the president know about the hush money payments or not giuliani chris there aposs an intervening event that you aposre not talking about i know this really well because i got criticized for revealing this when i first came into the case nobody really understood why i was doing it when i first came into the case we went through the whole case the president saw some notes and documents thought about it and i went out and said no there was an intervening conversation after the payments took place and before the revelations you aposre talking about on air force one the president did talk to cohen or to people in between and they arranged to reimburse cohen this was after the payment was made after it was over after the campaign was over wallace but but there aposs crosstalk wallace they aposre talking about a conversation sir in september of 2016 during the campaign the president is clearly aware that david pecker the head of national enquirer had paid off karen mcdougal and they aposre talking about reimbursing mcdougal giuliani well you know that aposs wallace or reimbursing pecker for that payment giuliani but there aposs a there aposs a big difference here that was a that was a conversation he was asked middle of the campaign i was with him back then in the middle of the campaign he aposs working 18 hours a day i wasn apost able to remember a lot of things that happened in september of 2016 he was asked it one time when he sat down with his lawyer and went through it in great detail and saw things that could refresh his recollection we immediately corrected it nobody pushed us nobody found it we found it and we corrected it and i got criticized like crazy for doing it wallace so you aposre saying crosstalk giuliani by the time this came out we all knew wallace the fact i mean the according both to cohen and to pecker the again he aposs the head of or was the head of national enquirer they say they were in a meeting with donald trump giuliani chris chris chris wallace in the summer of 2016 in which giuliani it doesn apost matter wallace they discussed the payment to karen mcdougal giuliani we aposre talking about something that doesn apost matter i mean whether whether it happened or didn apost happen it aposs not illegal crosstalk wallace you aposre moving shells around on me either it happened or it didn apost happen giuliani but that aposs what lawyers do all the time you argue in the alternative i aposm telling it wallace but i aposm asking you for the truth sir giuliani i aposm telling you definitively well i i want the truth too and the truth is yes the tape recorded conversation did take place it exonerates the president the president tells cohen do it by check i aposm sorry i prosecuted thousands of crimes never prosecuted one where they wanted to hide something they did it by check make sure we pay him back they paid him back that aposs what that conversation aposs all about it exonerates him i aposd play that conversation in front of any jury in america and i aposd cross examine cohen in front of any jury in america wallace ok here aposs what you aposre telling giuliani but i but very important cohen did not plead guilty to conspiracy to violate the campaign finance laws if they were going to use him as a witness against anybody you always make them plea guilty to a conspiracy so you can fill the conspiracy in he pled guilty to a singular crime of violating the campaign finance laws not a conspiracy wallace yes but the statement is full of references to individual one who is donald trump here aposs what you told the giuliani it doesn apost matter wallace here aposs what you told the daily beast this week i want to put it up on the screen nobody got killed nobody got robbed this was not a big crime mayor what aposs the threshold between a crime and a big crime giuliani my statement there was about the prosecutor aposs view of it not mine mr swinger ph who wrote that actually corrected that to say that that was taken out of context my point was there was no crime but even if you take the prosecutor aposs viewpoint this prosecutor was appointed both of them right looking at collusion no collusion looking at obstruction crosstalk wallace no no no no no no no no sir this was the southern district of new york this is not has nothing to do with collusion giuliani but now you aposre wallace or obstruction of justice there giuliani now you aposre they aposre part of the department of justice he aposs not being investigated crosstalk wallace i understand it aposs a separate prosecutor i aposm sure i aposm sure when you were the giuliani yes this guy this guy is going back wallace i aposm sure i aposm sure when you were the u s attorney for the southern district giuliani and this guy is going back wallace you didn apost take orders from somebody in washington who had nothing to do with the attorney general you were your own they used to call it a sovereign district of new york sir crosstalk giuliani the person the person in charge of this investigation chris is rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general of the united states he is the boss of mueller and he is the boss of the southern district of new york he aposs the one that determined let aposs move it over here he put it there in the southern district of new york and keeps supervision of it wallace i know giuliani so don apost give me that wallace but they aposre not crosstalk wallace but they aposre not they aposre not working for giuliani there is one justice department yes they are they aposre working for the same rod rod rosenstein aposs going to make the decision not mueller about what to do with this case wallace right and not mueller giuliani and this is a witch hunt they are going back now they aposre going back to 1982 1983 they aposre going through business records my goodness they went from collusion to obstruction no evidence now campaign finance no violation of the law no matter who aposs right about what they said it aposs no violation of the law and now wallace the president i i want to i want to move on you aposre you aposre very a effective lawyer but i aposve got i aposve got to move on sir president trump giuliani you wanted the truth that aposs the truth the truth is it aposs not a violation of the law crosstalk wallace i want i want the truth in a limited amount of time president trump talked this week about whether or not general flynn lied to the fbi here he is begin video clip trump they took a general that they said didn apost lie and they convinced him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal and now they aposre recommending no time you know why because they aposre embarrassed that they aposve got caught end video clip wallace does the president believe michael flynn lied or not giuliani i don apost know if michael flynn lied or not you got two contradictory things you aposve got the fbi saying at the time that he wasn apost lying and then we have no explanation and the guy pleads guilty to lying so i i mean i don apost know what happened in between i do know they treated flynn in a way that came very close to crosstalk wallace i aposm asking a simple i aposm asking a simple question and the reason i ask is i want to put up a tweet from the president a year ago in december of 2017 when he says this i had to fire general flynn because he lied to the vice president and the fbi he has pled guilty to those lies the president a year ago seemed to know that flynn has lied now he aposs not so sure giuliani the president doesn apost know that he lied the president the president crosstalk giuliani but he he knows what you knew at the time the man pled guilty to lying he did wallace no he knows he knows what he knows what flynn said to his vice president giuliani yes but that was a lie but that aposs not a crime wallace well i understand but i didn apost ask if it was a crime i asked whether it was a lie crosstalk giuliani chris chris you aposre going all over the place and you aposre really confusing people look first of all wallace inaudible giuliani you are you are you are you are you are really wallace wait a minute i didn apost ask if it was a crime i asked whether it was a lie and he told the same lie to the fbi and to the vice president and you aposre quite right lying to the vice president isn apost a lie it aposs not very good but lying to the fbi crosstalk wallace is a crime giuliani right and the more important thing about what the president knew or didn apost know because this doesn apost involve the president in terms of him being involved in any kind of conspiracy or anything else it aposs like if it aposs reported that one of my assistants when i was a u s attorney lied to the court how do i know if he did or he didn apost he knows what he reads the man pled guilty to lying wallace ok i got i got one minute giuliani so yes he didn apost know at the time i didn apost know at the time i didn apost know at the time that the fbi had previously concluded he was telling the truth wallace i got a giuliani i didn apost know he had been deprived of a lawyer crosstalk wallace mayor you aposre confusing people laughter giuliani i aposm not confusing people wallace all right let me ask you giuliani the man was railroaded wallace three last quick questions giuliani he was railroaded wallace there are there are reports now that the special counsel is interested again in interviewing the president has his office reached out to you about sitting down for an in person interview with the president giuliani yes there are several unpaid parking tickets that night back in 1986 apos87 that haven apost been explained you know we aposve got to wallace seriously giuliani seriously unpaid parking tickets wallace no no no giuliani it was a movie theater he didn apost pay the proper fee wallace is the special counsel does he want to interview the president giuliani yes good luck good luck after what they did to flynn the way they trapped him into perjury and no sentence for him 14 days for papadopoulos i did better on traffic violations than they did with papadopoulos wallace so when you say good luck you aposre saying no way no interview crosstalk giuliani they aposre a joke over my dead body but you know i could be dead wallace do they want to speak to the president giuliani i do have i do have other lawyer i am disgusted with the tactics they have used in this case what they did to general flynn should result in discipline they aposre the ones who are violating the law they aposre looking at a non crime collusion the other guys are looking at a non crime campaign violations which are not violations and they are the ones who are violating the law the rules the ethics and nobody wants to look at them they destroyed strzok and page aposs texts 19 000 texts wallace mayor giuliani if he had destroyed 19 000 texts they aposd put him in jail wallace mayor giuliani even though they can apost because he aposs the president wallace mayor giuliani giuliani yes wallace thank you giuliani i got a little wallace no listen i love it and please come back to be continued thank you for your time always good to talk to you sir giuliani thank you thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss what a judge aposs obamacare ruling could mean for millions of americans plus what would you like to ask the panel about president trump saying he aposd be proud to shut down the government over a border wall just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump a big big victory by a highly respected judge highly highly respected in texas and on the assumption that the supreme court upholds we will get great great health care for our people we aposll have to sit down with the democrats to do it but i aposm sure they want to do it also end video clip wallace president trump praising the ruling from the federal judge striking down the entire obamacare law and it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume columnist for the hill juan williams julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and marc short former director of legislative affairs for president trump well brit the federal judge said obamacare is invalid because congress has taken out the tax penalty as part of the individual mandate which is the way that it passed through the supreme court in the first place but we should point out the law stays in effect pending appeal what do you think of the ruling and how do you think this plays politically brit hume political analyst well remember this is a trial court judge wallace right hume so this is subject to appeal to appellate court and perhaps on the supreme court i think it aposs an interesting legal argument whether because of the invalidation of the zeroing out of the penalty was the whole law therefore is invalid i think you can hear good legal arguments on both sides of that issue but i think we aposre nowhere near the last of this and because the judge did not issue an injunction that shuts it down as you point out obamacare will remain in place what aposs left of obamacare remains in place for the foreseeable future wallace but how does it play politically given the fact there are certain parts of obamacare that people didn apost like like the individual mandate on the other hand there are lot of parts of it that people did like pre existing conditions hume right wallace and that aposs according to the judge aposs ruling would be out too hume it would be out but it won apost be out now and it won apost be out soon in my judgment so i think the political effect will depend on the actual practical effect and there is no practical effect for the time being wallace all right juan the president and republicans ran in 2016 on the idea of repeal and replace obamacare which they thought was a good issue for them democrats won in 2018 on the argument the republicans want to take away your pre existing conditions so how do you think this is going to cut particularly given the fact as brit hume says it aposs not going to have a practical effect it aposs not going to take effect for some months maybe a year as it goes to the courts juan williams host well i think you can see already this morning republicans are on their heels not really saying much about this while you have nancy pelosi and potentially incoming speaker of the house saying democrats will defend it chris murphy the senator from connecticut saying it aposs a five alarm fire i think clearly democrats see themselves in a position where they are on the offensive with the voters about this if you take away obamacare you know after how many 70 votes by republicans to repeal it didn apost work even with the republican majority chris it aposs not only that you would do away with things like pre existing conditions you would drive up premiums for everybody our health care system would be in chaos so i think that what you get here is republicans right now including president trump who initially tweeted great great are saying we need a bipartisan collaboration here to make health care work that aposs a different tone from republicans and i think it aposs very telling about who is politically at risk here wallace marc you aposre wrinkling your brow marc short former director of legislative affairs under president trump well i think look republicans won in 2010 and 2014 and 2016 in large part on a promise to repeal obamacare and now somehow the media are saying it aposs an albatross on republicans it aposs been a political win for republicans wallace if you look at the polls obamacare has become more popular short and you know why chris because the last two years from 2013 to 2017 premiums went up 105 percent across the country in the last year they aposve gone up 5 percent they used to be 50 percent of the counties in the united states had one insurer and that was it that aposs been fixed all counties now have more than one insurer because this administration has provided more choice for people they have actually helped to stabilize the markets that doesn apost mean forcing people to buy a product they don apost want is a good policy julie pace the associated press but in terms of the fallout from this ruling potentially one thing you aposre definitely not hearing from the republicans after this judge aposs ruling is any interest in going back to the drawing board and starting from scratch if ultimately this move through the court that obamacare fully is repealed you do not have a lot of republicans who want to spend 2019 deep in the weeds on health care crosstalk wallace let me switch i aposll tell you what they aposre going to spend at the end of 2018 on there is the real threat now of a partial government shutdown that would start at midnight this friday here aposs how that played out this week begin video clip trump i am proud to shut down the government for border security chuck because the people of this country don apost want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country so i will take the mantle rep nancy pelosi d calif he is taking full responsibility for the trump shutdown perhaps he doesn apost understand people need their paychecks maybe that aposs not the life he leads end video clip wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the president saying that he would be proud to shutdown the government we got this on facebook from linda rector why is shutting down the government not something to be proud of if it means protecting the country that aposs exactly what we elected the president to do marc juan how do you answer linda and two as a person who until last july used to deal with congress for the white house for president trump what do you think is going to happen will there be a shutdown will they kick it down the can into january short if there were a shutdown it would be different the very previous ones this government has already funded all the men and women serving in uniform it has funded all the entitlement checks it will keep the parts of inaudible so the average american wouldn apost even recognize the shutdown other than the fact that it would be a media story chris wallace wait there aposs about 30 percent of the government that gets shut down and i think 30 to 40 percent of the employees short and every time there aposs been a shutdown every employee has been paid back in full so i think the average person is not going to feel it in the immediate future having said that i still think you aposre going to find a compromise that comes together before the end of the week i think the president has got to look to find ways to fund this out of military construction dollars they aposll create a separate problem later because democrats object to that but last year we secured the first new funding 1 6 billion for the wall in ten years democrats come on your show and say we oppose any funding for the wall they aposve already agreed to it it aposs already 1 6 in this year all we aposre not arguing about is not what they are it aposs how much it costs and it aposs a matter of whether they can notified ph being at 1 6 wallace that aposs an old joke laughter wallace all right let aposs gather here everybody so julie shutdown or not pace i think all signs point to as marc says some kind of compromise i think we aposll have a tense couple of days this is normally how the pattern of these shutdowns play out but both republicans and democrats that i talked on capitol hill last week have very little interest in a shutdown they have very little interest in staying in washington for christmas which is ultimately what this comes down to a lot of times i do think that the president might be itching for a shutdown but i ultimately think he will sign on if there is some kind of compromise that gets some amount of wall funding and he can punt towards the military to see if that aposs another option for building the wall wallace all right let me ask about another issue which is the president on friday afternoon named a acting chief of staff mick mulvaney and it aposs already come out that during the 2016 campaign during a debate right after the access hollywood came out a debate with his democratic candidate this is before he joined the trump administration as omb director he said this begin video clip mick mulvaney acting chief of staff yes i aposm supporting donald trump doing so as enthusiastically as i can given the fact i think he aposs a terrible human being but the choice on the other side is just as bad end video clip wallace well pace here we are wallace do you think that creates problems for mulvaney pace i think mulvaney has been really strategic over the last couple of years he has found a way to work with the president he aposs been very loyal to the president since he aposs taken his job as omb director so much so that trump keeps trying to give him other jobs in addition to chief of staff i do think that it aposs interesting that mulvaney is leaving himself an out by taking on the acting chief of staff role and keeping his job as omb director if this doesn apost work out for either side he aposs got a fallback option within the administration but mulvaney kind of falls into a category like a lindsey graham who was also critical of the president during the campaign even after he became the nominee but has found a way to work with him in office wallace brit after nick ayers turned the president down the vice president aposs chief of staff and then chris christie turned the president down he almost had to name somebody didn apost he this was getting a little embarrassing hume he was like the guy who couldn apost get a date for the prom and he finally got mulvaney who was already on board to join in but mulvaney is a good choice he aposs a very able guy seasoned and experience knows the issues knows the policies knows the government so wallace i aposll say something else he is a happy warrior he aposs a guy who he aposs a positive guy he is also a guy who might come on sunday talk shows which john kelly treated us like the plague hume he wasn apost interested i would add this there aposs some talk that trump doesn apost need to chief of staff he should be his own that is really nonsense because trump needs help from people who really know this town know its ways know the details know the issues and he has been at important time willing to accept advice from those people to his benefit wallace all right panel we have to take a break here but stay right here when we come back as new evidence implicates the president what are the chances democrats will move pursuing impeachment commercial break chris wallace fox anchor coming up the president sounds off on the mueller investigation as his former fixer is sentenced to prison begin video clip donald trump president of the united states nobody except for me would be looked at like this nobody end video clip wallace we aposll get our sunday panel aposs read on how serious the president aposs legal troubles really are next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip trump what he did was all unrelated to me except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal and shouldn apost have been on there they put that on to embarrass me they put those two charges on to embarrass me cohen i told the truth i took responsibility for my actions and instead of him taking responsibility for his actions what does he do he attacks my family end video clip wallace president trump and his former fixer michael cohen taking shots at each other after cohen received a three year prison sentence for a number of crimes including making hush money payments during the 2016 campaign and we aposre back now with the panel julie there are reports and we hear these from time to time the president is more and more consumed by the special counsel investigation especially as former allies like michael cohen and the publisher of the national enquirer are providing evidence against him what do you hear your sources pace so i think it is indisputable that the president is consumed by these investigations you really don apost need any secret sources on this you just need to look at his at his twitter feed he is following the twists and turns of this extremely closely and as people who are close to him get caught up in this he gets more agitated and i think now we are seeing that almost every aspect of his life over the last several years is now under some level of investigation his administration his campaign the inauguration and his businesses and the business piece of this is i think the one that is getting to the president the most because yes being president is part of his identity but actually being this successful businessman is almost more important to him in some ways it aposs how he has defined himself for decades and it aposs his children aposs legacy they are at the top of this at this business and any sign that his business could crumble that past business dealings could be swept up in this investigation is incredibly personal to him wallace marc short i agree 100 percent with julie i think that what aposs unfortunate here is that you have what begins as a special prosecutor focus on collusion in russia and as julie just said it aposs about every part of his life we end up saying instead of investigating a crime we aposre investigating a person and republicans and civil libertarians used to oppose that motion after iran contra then they fell in love with it during the whitewater years because they said it was a land deal but it became something about an affair with an intern and it aposs a problem it aposs a problem where we have prosecutors going all over and i think wallace but how about how about the argument that is made gee we didn apost hear republicans complain about it when it happened to bill clinton short i agree 100 percent i aposm saying i aposm saying republicans as well have been hypocritical on this there used to be a group of strong civil libertarians who would recognize the problem of special prosecutors and probably this is now the what aposs been born of that fruit wallace all right so far the only alleged crime that the president is specifically linked to is not collusion is not obstruction of justice it involves campaign finance violations alleged campaign finance violations here is how democratic congressman jerry nadler the incoming chair of the house judiciary committee responded to that this week begin video clip jerry nadler d n y well they would be impeachable offenses whether they are important enough to justify an impeachment is a different question end video clip wallace brit how persuaded are you that if president trump directed these payments these hush money payments as michael cohen says he did that it was a campaign finance violation on his part a criminal violation and two what do you think of the likelihood that the house and the wisdom of the house proceeding to impeachment on campaign finance violation hume i think it aposs a little hard to imagine a president being impeached for a campaign finance violation most of these violations are handled as civil matters and result in fines and they are you know widespread rampant obama had a the obama campaign had to pay a big fine i don apost i just don apost think the house of representatives even such ardent democrats as jerry nadler will go there the greater worry is that some other charge comes out when mueller finally gets his ore in with his report and says whatever he says and that i think chris raises an intriguing question which is this how far will these house investigations go if mueller doesn apost find something very serious about the president my thought is it probably takes the wind out of their sails but we aposll have to wait and see but on balance i don apost think campaign finance is going to dislodge him wallace when you look at all of this and you know as we say there is still no hard evidence of collusion no hard evidence of obstruction of justice but the wall do seem to be moving in on the president on a lot of fronts hume well i don apost think the mueller report is likely to be to sing the president aposs praises but that aposs not what he needs what he needs is kind of an of a of a report that says you know does not outline some major crime and if that happens i mean i think it changes the atmosphere dramatically both legally and politically because i think it aposs and if he is vindicated on no collusion which is what he aposs been saying i don apost think the i aposve never thought that collusion was the central point of this investigation remember when it started chris it was a counterintelligence investigation with the fbi acting as an intelligence agency to determine what russia actually did and if you go back and look at the letter authorizing mueller aposs appointment it says it mentions that it picks up that investigation and then says he aposs also authorized to find out if there was collaboration between the two that was always a subset of the overall investigation and if it turns out to be a subset with no crime alleged in the final report i think it aposs a huge boost for the president wallace juan williams well i think the democratic base is so inflamed by trump by his behavior overall i think they they would think that democrats weren apost in fact holding up to their constitutional responsivities if they did not consider impeachment so you get the wallace even on campaign finance violations williams well i mean what we what did we learn this week he wants to say it aposs just michael cohen making these outrageous claims because cohen wants a better deal from the prosecutors but in fat we hear from david packer at national enquirer same thing happened we hear from the wall street journal the president was in the room so if potentially he would be an unindicted coconspirator while his president because nobody thinks you can indict the president but that doesn apost mean that you can apost go to the congress and say let aposs look at this and see wallace do you really think that would be wise for democrats to do and this this is speculative williams well that aposs a separate issue that aposs a separate issue wallace ok well that aposs my question though williams ok well if the question was wallace would it be wise for them to do it if that aposs all that there is williams well i don apost think that aposs no and i think that what you aposre going to see and you already see this from by the way jerry nadler but also from nancy pelosi chuck schumer as the say they aposre not interested right now but the base of the party is what i was trying to say to you chris is going to be putting pressure there because they think that in fact democrats had been too docile in dealing with trump and they want they want them to come and have the wallace they want blood williams well because guess what you aposve saw a blue wave 40 seats switch hands and the number you know health care was clearly important but also a check on trump was very important to voters wallace and every indication is everybody keeps saying this investigation is going to be over the end of the year williams i don apost see it wallace i always say pick the over right pace right we we don apost know what else mueller has i think this could go well into next year and really line up with some of these congressional investigation wallace thank you panel up next we sit down with microsoft co founder bill gates head of the gates foundation in the era of america first he worries about a shrinking u s role in dealing with global poverty and public health commercial break wallace the bill and melinda gates foundation is the world aposs largest private charitable fund giving 46 billion in grants since its founding in 2000 and literally saving millions of lives the microsoft co founder came to washington this week to make the case for american leadership and the need for foreign aid in the era of america first when we sat down at the chamber of commerce that aposs where we began begin videotape gates there was a recommendation by the executive branch to make fairly substantial cuts u s aid budget and fortunately the congress took that proposal which would have meant cutting people off from those hiv medicines and they decided to maintain the foreign aid levels wallace your wife melinda recently talked about and i want to quote her directly how incredibly disappointing it is to see u s leadership deteriorating and the view of the u s deteriorating because of some of the egregious things that have been said by this current administration what aposs she talking about gates i hope i know the i think the particular episode there was talking about africa and the conditions in africa in a not in a positive way sort of characterizing the entire continent but in any case wallace your talk about the blank countries gates exactly in the u s engagement in africa and around the world there are many reasons we should maintain that just a pure security point of view alone would justify this level of expenditure now for many people the humanitarian part of it is also there and that part is dramatic and so it is disappointing when it feels like the u s is being short term and the u s is only thinking about its interest in a very narrow way and not being the leader that says now we you know we are going to help these countries get so that they can can take care of themselves wallace the president aposs mantra is america first you seem to be suggesting that in terms of america aposs interests you aposve got to look a long way beyond america first gates well i think that the broad definition of our interests including investing in allies and not viewing every transaction as one that we have to maximize our benefit taking you know world institutions and have them just focus on the united states what we did in terms of the post world war ii institutions has been a fantastic thing that included having a common view of the future with our western allies if you really follow that line of thinking the idea of helping africa of working on an hiv vaccine to stop the aids crisis you just wouldn apost do it and and yet i feel even in that narrow framework of ok i only care about what how u s citizens do even in that framework these institutions these alliances these investments in innovation are overwhelmingly smart things to do wallace since the year 2000 a billion people have lifted themselves from what you define as extreme poverty and you say that the first wave was in china and the second wave was in india before we get to places where the wave hasn apost hit yet what happened in those places gates one of the first things you want to do in these countries is raise agricultural productivity all of the asian miracles even going back to taiwan and japan south korea involved more than tripling agricultural output per person so you could free up that labor and move it into the cities and if you had the right infrastructure educational investment then you aposve got a manufacturing sector of the economy and slowly but surely you aposd get a very large middle class wallace you talk about the successes the waves in china and india and then there aposs africa you say that by 2050 86 percent 86 percent of the extremely poor people in the world will live in africa and in fact 40 percent will live in just two countries the democratic republic of congo and nigeria what aposs holding them back gates they aposre starting at very low levels of infrastructure very low level of property and one of the things that drives those numbers you mentioned is the very high population growth and so they account for double the portions of births you aposd expect by the end of the century the majority of births in the world will take place in africa africa has to demand our attention that aposs where extreme poverty is still tough that aposs where stability is difficult to achieve and you know we aposve got to go after things like these neglected diseases malaria we aposve got to help them with infrastructure it aposs really in terms of our humanity of helping the poorest africa aposs where we aposll be most tested wallace how do you even begin to address these concentrations of misery gates well one of the great achievements in development history was what was called the green revolution where new varieties of the cereal ph crops corn which everyone else calls maize rice and wheat in a period where people thought india would experience mass starvation because the agricultural output went up they were actually able to improve the nutrition even when their population was growing we need to do that same thing for africa wallace it seems that climate change could be the accelerant to all of the bad things in terms of agricultural productivity global health instability extreme poverty talk about that gates yes for a country like the u s that aposs northern you know climate change will change things we aposll have more hot days more forest fires but it aposs not a threat to our survival in africa where you are completely dependent on the rain coming whereas there been in the past about one out of 12 years you aposll have a failed harvest the prediction is that we be closer to one out of four years because of the higher temperature and the the unfortunately with climate change you not only is it hotter but the rain comes all at once or it doesn apost come for long periods of time so if you want to say where are you going to get millions of deaths because of climate change between now and the end of the century you don apost look to the united states yes you aposll have some forest fires and there will be some deaths but the the significant numbers are in these very very poor countries because of the subsistence farming wallace what do you say to those who say it aposs not climate change it aposs weather and that the the man the human component is questionable gates that aposs impressive if somebody can say that out loud the the amount of wallace have you been have you been to washington gates the amount of co2 in the atmosphere is a super measurable thing it aposs important not to over claim what we know because that undermines the whole discussion but the general warming and the mechanism of that warming has to do with co2 and methane emissions that aposs that aposs really not a question wallace i want to talk to you about toilets since 2011 the gates foundation has launched to reinvent the toilet challenge explain one why that aposs so important and two again dealing with the specifics what have been some of your successes and failures along the way gates in many of these poor countries the capital cost of building that sewer it aposs just never going to happen and so the solution would be to instead of using that sewer to have something in the toilet itself which is essentially the processing facility we have ten different universities whose designs we funded so we put in several hundred million dollars and now we aposve gotten it to the point where we have a lot of commercial companies who say ok that approach looks promising now the price of this toilet that does the processing is still ten times more expensive it aposs about you know 10 000 per toilet right now we need to get it into these tough parts the slums of these african cities we need it to be more like a thousand dollars wallace i want to ask about your your old job there aposs something of a backlash here in washington against big tech the growing feeling in washington is that big tech does not do enough to protect users apos privacy and that it shows political bias do you see merit in either of those arguments gates i went through an episode in the late apos90s where microsoft was subject to government investigation wallace we remember gates and so in a way this is in a small way now it aposs less microsoft now but it aposs broad yes the government should be talking to these companies about what they do there aposs nothing inappropriate i was naive i didn apost have an office in washington d c i thought that was a good thing and i even bragged about it i later came to regret that so these i aposm sure these guys are learning better than i did that they need to come back here and start a dialogue and there will be new types of regulations for these companies wallace and you don apost have a problem with that i mean you think that aposs appropriate gates well the notion that there will be privacy regulations that makes a lot of sense the notion that this ability to identify anyone that were going to think about how do businesses get to use that and how does the government use that it makes a lot of sense wallace apple amazon and microsoft are right now jockeying for which is going to be the most highly valued company in the world in terms of market capitalization at the close of the market on friday microsoft was number one at over 800 billion apple 799 5 billion does that give you any pleasure gates you know when i was starting microsoft in my 20s the idea that we could create a company that was you know would beat ibm you know because they were the big monolith and you know we understood software and they didn apost and we believed in these cute small machines to empower individuals and they believed in these big machines it was kind of mythic that we were going to beat ibm by the time microsoft valuation passed ibm which is now you know 15 years ago it didn apost feel like that big of a victory and so you really it aposs really better to define yourself by an aspiration you know can software improve education can software help you know medical care costs in the u s just keep going up dramatically can software play a role there so yes i aposm very proud of microsoft and the vision that software and technology would make a big thing you know it aposs led to the most valuable the five most valuable companies being these tech companies so i do think it aposs an vindication ph of the importance of technology which now is coming with a lot of responsibilities as well wallace bill it aposs an honor to talk to you again g
