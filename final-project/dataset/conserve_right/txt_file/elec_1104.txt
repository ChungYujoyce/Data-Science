national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge we now know michael bloomberg is going to run for president he s turning himself into a pander bear during his three terms as new york city s mayor bloomberg was famous for dismissing politically correct criticism and refusing to apologize for it but there he was on sunday at an african american megachurch in brooklyn saying he was sorry for the stop and frisk policy he used so successfully to break the back of crime and reduce the murder rate in new york city by 50 percent under stop and frisk police officers were authorized to search people if they were suspected of illegal activity while carrying a weapon critics said the practice was disproportionately used against blacks and hispanics after bloomberg left office in 2013 a judge ruled that the tactic had been used unconstitutionally bloomberg denounced the decision of bill de blasio his successor as mayor to dramatically reduce stop and frisk but on sunday and six years after he left office there was bloomberg saying because of the number of stops of innocent people because it had been so high resentment had built up we eroded what we had worked so hard to build trust trust between police and communities trust between you and me and the erosion of that trust bothered me deeply and it still bothers me and i want to

important wrong i got something important really wrong i didn t understand that back then the full impact that stops were having on the black and latino community i want you to know that i realize back then i was wrong and i am sorry bloomberg s retreat is more than a complete reversal of his previous views it s an attempt to earn votes in the coming democratic presidential primaries in which left wing activists exercise disproportionate influence indeed one of those leading left wing activists is cheering bloomberg s mea culpa whatever his motive is i m glad that he s taking this stand al sharpton told the daily news on sunday i think it is an important stance for a man who was a symbol of big city stop and frisk sharpton has previously taken credit for getting both joe biden and bernie sanders to step away from their previous support for anti crime measures but he says speeches full of regret won t be enough to assuage his concerns all of the democratic candidates are going to have to earn that respect have to earn that forgiveness he said from others bloomberg has earned nothing but scorn for his retreat the reign of race based identity politics in the democratic party may now be declared absolute heather mac donald a senior fellow at the manhattan institute who often boosted bloomberg tells me adding the left has never shown that stop and frisk was racist in fact like other tactics in the police tool kit it was directed through objective color blind data to where people were most being victimized and such victimization occurs overwhelmingly in minority neighborhoods driven by minority perpetrators the main argument against stop and frisk by the left is that a bit more than 50 percent of new york city stops were of blacks even though blacks are only about a quarter of the city s population whites by contrast are about a third of the city s population but made up about 9 percent of stops by macdonald says that population is the wrong benchmark for measuring the validity of police actions the relevant benchmark is crime blacks commit around three quarters of all shootings in new york city the victims are overwhelmingly minority whites commit less than 2 percent the police cannot respond to violent street crime without having a disparate impact on minority communities the fault lies not with the police but with the criminals to argue that support for stop and frisk is a form of white supremacy ignores the real issues critics of stop and frisk point out that crime rates have remained low even though the use of stop and frisk has declined some 90 percent from its height in 2011 but mac donald says that demographic changes have a lot to do with that low middle class families in a strong economy have transformed once bad neighborhoods and are exercising social controls to keep crime down plus a lot of criminals have been locked away and are still behind bars other cities aren t so fortunate in other cities that have largely abandoned stop and frisk such as chicago and baltimore crime rates and especially murders have gone up dramatically back in 2014 when he gave a famous commencement speech at harvard bloomberg was thinking about running for president in 2016 as an independent not as a democrat then he took a much braver stance against political correctness universities were becoming places where the forces of repression appear to be stronger than at any time since the 1950s he said today on many college campuses it is liberals trying to repress conservative ideas even as conservative faculty members are at risk of becoming an endangered species diversity of gender ethnicity and orientation is important but a university cannot be great if its faculty is politically homogenous that michael bloomberg is probably gone for the duration of his campaign his anti pc stances no doubt being held in a blind trust the irony is that bloomberg s cave in came just two days after former president barack obama sounded a warning cry to democratic donors meeting in washington saying that democrats risk tilting too far to the left to win elections he cautioned that average voters aren t going to agree with certain left leaning twitter feeds or the activist wing of our party he urged democrats to remember that even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality no doubt bloomberg s political consultants have told him that shifting to the left is necessary if he is to have any chance of winning the democratic nomination but while polls can pick up voter attitudes on issues they cannot always detect shifts in people s opinion of a candidate s character as bloomberg fills in political potholes on the left hand side of his road to the nomination he should remember that his repairs may come at the expense of his reputation as that rare officeholder who did what he thought was right and defended the results if you enjoyed this article we have a
