said chinese officials in meetings with their u s counterparts have refused to explain the pace or goal of the arms buildup defense officials have said adm willard said chinese weapons that pose concerns include a growing arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles including anti ship missiles and advanced radar evading stealth combat aircraft also china is pursuing counterspace and cyber capabilities that can be used to not only disrupt u s military operations but also to threaten the space and cyber based information infrastructure that enables international communications and commerce he said absent clarification from china its military modernization efforts hold significant implications for regional stability the admiral said noting that states in asia along with the united states are becoming alarmed over what he termed new anti access and area denial weaponry china s government insists that the arms buildup is defensive but will not provide details on any of its most advanced weapons on chinese cyber attacks adm willard said a sizable percentage of the large number of attempted computer intrusions detected daily come from china we are defending our networks

in their submarine forces asked about the recent assessment of director of national intelligence james r clapper jr that china poses the greatest threat to the united states adm willard said he
