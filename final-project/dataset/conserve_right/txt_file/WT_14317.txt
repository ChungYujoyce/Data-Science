apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion analysis opinion the booger man is scaring our european friends and relations again the ugly american blundering about the landscape like gulliver on the sauce is back to haunt their timid reveries they thought they saw gulliver in iraq and afghanistan and they recognized him in full in tucson ariz the banging and clanging of public debate particularly over president obama s attempt to impose a welfare state with the gassy bloat held so dear on the continent make europeans teeth itch and not just europeans actually in europe top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed it s the way americans make free with free speech rich robust and occasionally over the top as if they were armed with a constitution that guarantees them the right to say whatever pops into their heads nice or not to many europeans writes simon jenkins of the guardian the tribune of left thinking london folk eager to transform albion into a little england worthy of europe the echo across the atlantic came from a people isolated from the outside world and unable to handle today s social and scientific progress the debate over mr obama s health care scheme was infused with nastiness and xenophobia as if the united states was a land of tribes bred only to hate the outside world and often themselves this is only one man s cranky exercise of envy and ignorance but it s a symptom of fear growing elsewhere in the once robust west where noisy debate and ferocious argument gave birth to the civilization that tamed the jungle of terrors and superstition voices that once might have thundered against the despotism of malicious ignorance now blame the hard bought freedoms of democracy itself for the terrors of the night james e hansen the nasa climatologist who is the source of much of the dubious science on which the global warming scam is based thinks the west should abandon its fossil money democracy and copy the chinese way of regulating debate but we don t need no stinking free speech mr hansen took a junket to china just before thanksgiving and returned with gratitude for the chinese example of regulating democracy he now regards china with none of the hobbles of plain talk and free elections as the best hope to save the world from global warming i have the impression that chinese leadership takes a long view perhaps because of the long history of their culture in contrast with the west with its short election cycle at the same time china has the capacity to implement policy decisions rapidly the leaders seem to seek the best technical information and do not brand as hoax that which is inconvenient mr hansen who obviously prefers the short view would dispense with the freedom of speech that makes freedom of scientific inquiry possible he has not been punished for spreading fear and ignorance as he would be in a culture where being wrong is the way to humiliation and worse he is free to propose as he did in hong kong s south china morning post that because congress won t enact a law to make coal prohibitively expensive china should lead a boycott of the u s economy the united states then would be forced to make a choice it could either address its fossil fuel addiction or accept continual descent into second rate and third rate economic well being mr hansen can expect no knock on his door in the middle of the night to answer for what in china would be regarded as treasonous trash talk nor should he fear any punishment for predicting two decades ago that in 20 years new york city s west side highway will be under water neither mr hansen nor anyone else can water ski down the west side highway yet though mr hansen might urge everyone else to try a few swallows hardly make a summer but such nonsense by a prominent london columnist and a prominent american scientist is exactly the kind of virulent nonsense we heard from certain of our own pols and pundits in the wake of tragedy in tucson free speech mr jenkins writes is a hobbesian jungle it requires a marketplace of rules including rules that maintain fair and open competition just so and here s a set of rules that have worked wonderfully well for more than two centuries congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances this makes everything else possible fearful europeans should try it it works wesley pruden is editor emeritus of the washing
