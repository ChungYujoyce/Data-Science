dicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion though no one in our government speaks in these terms we are decades into a second cold war this time with china unlike the soviet union china is so deeply involved in our economy and brazen in its aggression that our ability to deal with the threats it poses is uncertain there are a dozen reasons for the u s china rivalry all of which are based on the ideological difference between america a free nation and communist china a totalitarian state it was inevitable that as china rose and the soviet union fell the imbalance in global power would result in a second cold war between the united states and china the natural evolution of the new cold war has produced an adversarial relationship from china s pursuit of domination over u s allies such as japan its persistently aggressive cyberwar against us and its aggression in the south china sea top

abortions for all including illegal aliens in 1990 chinese leader deng xiaoping issued his 24 character strategy which centered around concepts such as secure our positions hide our capacities and bide our time and never claim leadership china s current leader xi jinping hasn t descended into the shrillness of nikita khrushchev s we will bury you but has given up the pretense of restraint in claiming china s position as a global power one of the hallmarks of the first cold war was the ideological struggle against soviet communism another was the ever present fear of nuclear war both of those factors are central to the new cold war but seem to be ignored by american leaders since january u s scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine and treatments for the covid 19 virus chinese cyber thieves have been working just as hard trying to steal every bit of information our scientists possess and every finding they make china s cyberattacks are reportedly also seeking to interfere in and sabotage our scientists work at the same time china has stepped up its disinformation campaign to spread the false messages that the virus didn t originate in the chinese city of wuhan and that china is leading the global effort to fight the pandemic the facts of its disinformation campaign and that china sent thousands of covid 19 test kits to other nations most of which were defective established china s record if china claims to have won the race to develop an anti covid 19 vaccine no nation could rationally trust the vaccine s effectiveness or safety while we are fighting the pandemic china s aggressive operations in the south china sea continue its ships and aircraft monitor our freedom of the seas operations there by its military machine and growing presence in the south china sea china means to block our access there and threaten japan and south korea china s ubiquitous involvement in our economy poses its own significant threats including its domination of the u s antibiotics market beyond threat china is finding ways to have americans help create tools of war it could use against us for example dji is a chinese manufacturer of unmanned ground and aerial vehicles which we commonly refer to as drones dji reportedly makes 76 percent of the ugvs and uavs sold in the u s dji s website invites people everywhere to help program their drones to improve their performance one of my closest friends often flies a dji drone with his son the drone s equipment records every flight automatically and funnels data back to dji my friend has seen some of his drone flights on the dji website what s most innovative is dji s offer to its members to help program the drones for 549 you can buy a dji robomaster s1 a wheeled drone that can fight with a mounted gun if you re a computer programmer you can sign up to help reprogram the s1 every programming idea no matter how small is funneled into dji s system instead of 20 people employed by dji to improve the robomaster s performance they potentially have thousands working for free in many nations to improve the drone s aggressive capabilities the dji program is in the python computer language the current language of artificial intelligence development outsourcing ai development through dji is an asymmetric win for china what dji is doing on a small scale china s confucius institute is doing far more broadly dozens of american universities accept the institute s funds in exchange for access to research and chinese control over how the subject of china is taught to counter china we need to combine military deterrence economic pressure and strong leadership from the president to heighten americans awareness of the seriousness of china s threats strong presidential leadership is the sine qua non of countering china on the economic side we need to do whatever it takes to restore our independence regarding medicine rare earth metals and other critical items we need to legally block u s companies from sharing technology with china to even begin to counter china militarily will require new long range naval aircraft and missiles as well as new electronic countermeasure systems and improved defenses against both long range and short range missiles we don t want a war with china perhaps the chinese need a war with us to prove their claim to regional dominance deterrence worked with the soviets it can work with china as well the ancient latin phrase si vis pacem para bellum if you desire peace prepare for war still holds true jed babbin a deputy
