rsecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion on march 14 china completed the transition of its new leader xi jinping with his assumption of the presidency his main power comes as the leader of the communist party and as chairman of its central military commission while trying to project his image as a man of the people his various speeches on the china dream have a definite military overtone even though he professes to continue the peaceful development policies of his predecessor he has launched a well planned campaign to enhance the military force of the people s liberation army in order to give china the capability to fight and win wars such statements undercut the theme that china s military buildup is only for defensive purposes china s unrelenting drive to become the dominant military power in the western pacific continues with its just announced 10 7 percent increase to its military budget this double digit increase takes on added significance when viewed in light of the obama administration s sequestration and previous draconian budget cuts to u s military forces with the continued turmoil in the middle east as well as russia s efforts to revive soviet cold war tactics to test our readiness both militarily and politically it is questionable whether the strategic pivot to the pacific can ever be fully implemented one of the key weaknesses of the pivot strategy is that it does not address china s development of a globally deployable military force and the establishment of nuclear and non nuclear and proxy states such as north korea and iran as richard fisher a senior fellow at the international assessment and strategy center has pointed out such an imbalance has the potential for china to create a number of chinese pivots that could quickly overstress and thus limit or deter u s strategy another element that cannot be discounted is the potential for a large chinese nuclear breakout china has more than 3 000 miles of underground reinforced tunnels for their fixed and mobile strategic weapons in a feb 11 wall street journal article by bret stephens gen victor esin former chief of staff of russia s strategic rocket forces highlighted the stealthy rise of china to a position of nuclear parity with the united states and russia he stated that china may have 850 warheads ready to launch and he estimated china s inventory of nuclear weapons at between 1 600 and 1 800 warheads as compared with the current u s estimate of china having 200 to 400 many reports note the administration wants to reduce u s warheads to 1 000 or fewer gen esin went on to state that he has solid evidence that china conducted a multiple warhead test in july 2012 and a month later launched a new long range multiple warhead capable missile from a submarine any future start talks with russia must recognize china s nuclear inventory clearly we need an immediate shot across china s bow that would have an impact putting anti ship ballistic missiles on u s ships submarines and aircraft could be just such a shot threatening china s navy to show them they will gain nothing by using their fleet against the united states and its allies such a capability could be accomplished in the near term as a relatively inexpensive option while posing a risk to china s ever expanding surface navy the potential impact of introducing anti ship ballistic missiles into our naval and air forces would be significantly multiplied if we could sell such a capability to our allies provided an agreement can be reached with russia to retire the 1987 intermediate nuclear force inf treaty this probably is feasible since according to russia s gen esin if china does not stop expanding its nuclear inventory russia will consider abandoning the inf treaty another action that we can take is to create an asian regional long range sensor network that would provide our allies real time warning of broad chinese military activity for such a network to become a reality we should capitalize on the recent decision to install a second forward based x band transportable fbx t radar in southern japan by placing a similar radar in the philippines we currently have an fbx t radar in shariki japan with a 600 to 1 200 mile range installing an updated 3 700 mile range sbx radar in the philippines would permit continuous missile and aircraft coverage of all nations in the western pacific littoral including china even in this tight budget climate we should find the funding to pursue the development of energy weapons for example a railgun with shotgun pellets flying at mach 5 has the potential to produce a steel cloud which would shred most missiles cruise missiles and aircraft flying through it in tests the railgun has fired artillery size projectiles up to speeds of mach 5 with a potential range of 62 miles such a system would be quite adaptable to a destroyer sized ship clearly we have a number of options that can be brought to bear including selling nuclear submarines to allies such as australia and japan however all our conventional options must be underpinned by a credible nuclear deterrent therefore it is absolutely essential to modernize our nuclear weapons inventory to make our options a reality the obama administration needs to recognize china s strategic objectives and the threat they pose to our national interests and those of our allies and institute programs that pose an unacceptable risk to china top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all
