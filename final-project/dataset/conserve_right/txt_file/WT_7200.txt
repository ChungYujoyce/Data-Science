apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion a sino american war would be a disaster for both nations but recent events have made it a much more real possibility it is extremely unlikely that the united states would start such a conflict but events in china are making it possible that the chinese leadership read xi jinping might try to reunify taiwan with china by force to distract the mainland s population from an increasing string of domestic and foreign failures the fact is that wars tend to have outcomes that those who initiate them do not anticipate rather than an instrument of state policy wars often mutate into something that cannot be controlled if mr xi contemplates a quick taiwanese adventure as a way to relieve domestic pressure the united states would be well advised to convince china s leaders that such a conflict would not be quick painless or economically worthwhile top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time mr xi has suffered several setbacks in the past year the latest of these was the overwhelming election victory of an anti china party in taiwan s recent elections taiwan s president tsai ing wen is wisely not calling for a complete declaration of independence but her party s victory at the polls was a clear repudiation of the manner in which mr xi has implemented the one country two systems policy regarding both taiwan and hong kong that combined with an overall slowdown in china s economy and international condemnation over the handling of the weiger uyghur minority has dimmed mr xi s star considerably many of china s ruling elite have hitched their wagons to that star and further setbacks could convince them that an overseas adventure could distract the masses from internal woes a taiwanese declaration of independence would force military action by mr xi as china views that as line in the sand so far all but the most strident taiwanese separatists have steered clear of outright independence consequently any unprovoked chinese use of forceful reunification would draw international condemnation that would almost certainly damage mr xi s ambitions to match or supersede the current status of the united states as the world s leading power however all bets will be off if mr xi and his cronies see their internal grip on power threatened mr xi s ambition to turn the south china sea and its vital transportation lanes into a chinese lake is also a potential flashpoint this makes u s strategy in the region increasingly critical the last three american administrations have been consistent in their approach to freedom of the seas issues in the area and the trump administration has been firm in its support for pro democracy demonstrators in hong kong but an internal leadership crisis in beijing could challenge that regional status quo consequently the united states needs to ramp up both diplomacy and military readiness in a way that precludes overseas military adventurism as a safety valve for mr xi and company the united states needs to use diplomacy to convince taiwan not to openly declare independence as it will virtually force china into a war but we also need to convince beijing that an unprovoked attack on a taiwan which is trying to maintain the current status quo will be seen as go to war issue for the united states as it will impact freedom of the seas which is a vital u s interest that diplomatic position must continue to be backed up by credible military deterrence perhaps the most coherent thinking on this issue resides in the marine corps and its commandant general david berger mr berger has refocused the marine corps back to its traditional pacific naval orientation and is pushing his service s thinkers to concentrate on how marines can best help counter china s threats to the sea lanes in the western and southern indo pacific region frankly some of our allies in the region are concerned that president trump might sacrifice taiwanese democracy for a greater deal with china that would undermine his keep america great pledge we may no longer need middle east oil but free trade in asia has been one of the lifelines of the american economy since the end of world war ii deterrence is the art of convincing a potential aggressor that the potential use of military force is not worth the potential consequences china needs to be assured that an unprovoked attempt at reunification of taiwan and china by force is risk not worth the cost gary anderson lectures on alternative analysis at george washington university s elliott school of internationa
