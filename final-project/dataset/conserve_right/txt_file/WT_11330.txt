awareness of rights has risen dramatically over the past few years and dissidents are becoming more vocal we want to mobilize the people to stand up and give them the power mr yang said it has not been an easy fight for political dissidents china has no independent judiciary and all courts answer to the communist government china has laws but the government will either ignore or work around

relevant laws long gone are the days of rule by man when a particular human being s will would determine the destiny of the whole nation and its people mr wang said in an e mail china now stresses democratic and scientific decision making on issues that will affect the daily life of the citizens and their personal interests with more say and input from the average people there s of course room for improvement and there s the phenomenon of failure to observe the law and miscarriages of justice he said but china s determination to push forward the process of chinese characterized democracy and rule of law is unswerving mr yang said the movement has had many setbacks the biggest being that the dissidents have won only two cases people may gradually lose their hope and become skeptical of how far this movement can go he said mr yang said instances of lost cases are rampant in fujian for example three people have been tried for attempting to reveal the details of a rape case which was indirectly tied to the police according to mr yang the second ruling had just come down a few days ago for seriously affecting the interests of the state the three have been sentenced to one to three years in prison international media also have followed the fates of several chinese lawyers who took up individual human rights cases including gao zhisheng and feng zhenghu they have been alternately arrested and harassed for their work mr feng is under house arrest in shanghai after returning to china and mr gao has been missing since april each who protests runs some kind of risk we can t say they ll be ok tomorrow mr yang said mr yang added that the setbacks and disappointments are accompanied by a breakthrough every day citing several persistent protesters as examples i m telling the leaders that they need to pay attention to people and they can t abuse us said hu yan one of three chinese citizens who came to the u s in april to petition the united nations every day after being
