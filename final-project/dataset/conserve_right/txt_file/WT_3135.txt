statement that we had been discussing for many weeks sondland recalled his three page update tucked beneath hundreds of pages of sworn testimony from sondland and former ukraine special envoy kurt volker was released by house investigators as democrats prepared to push the closed door sessions to public hearings as soon as next week trump has denied any quid pro quo but democrats say there is a singular narrative developing since the president s july 25 call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy when he first asked for a favor that request which sparked the impeachment inquiry included a public investigation into ukrainian activities by democratic former vice president joe biden and his son and trump s allegations of ukrainian interference in the 2016 u s election rep adam schiff d calif the chairman of the intelligence committee said the house panels conducting the inquiry are releasing the word by word transcripts of the past weeks closed door hearings so the american public can decide for themselves this is about more than just one call schiff wrote tuesday in an op ed in usa today we now know that the call was just one piece of a larger operation to redirect our foreign policy to benefit donald trump s personal and political interests not the national interest pushing back white house press secretary stephanie grisham issued a statement saying the transcripts show there is even less evidence for this illegitimate impeachment sham than previously thought in the transcripts and accompanying cache of text messages u s diplomats are shown trying to navigate the demands of trump and his personal lawyer rudy giuliani who they soon learn is running a back channel u s foreign policy on ukraine it kept getting more insidious sondland told investigators as the timeline went on sondland testified that he spoke with secretary of state mike pompeo about giuliani and pompeo rolled his eyes and said yes it s something we have to deal with in his revised testimony sondland a wealthy businessman who donated 1 million to trump s inauguration says his memory was refreshed by the opening statements of two other inquiry witnesses the top u s diplomat in ukraine william taylor and tim morrison a european expert at the national security council the ambassador initially testified on oct 17 that he did not recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the bidens he told investigators he didn t know that the ukraine firm burisma that trump wanted ukraine to investigate was linked to joe biden s son hunter but in the weeks since a may visit to kyiv for zelenskiy s inauguration sondland and the other diplomats had been heavily involved in ukraine policy and in text messages about what trump wanted as they came to realize the military assistance was being withheld volker and sondland both testified they were disappointed after briefing trump at the white house about the new leader of the young democracy who was vowing to fight corruption at a pivotal may 23 meeting trump went on and on and on about how ukraine is a disaster and they re bad people sondland testified trump holds an alternative view pushed by giuliani that it was ukraine not russia that interfered in the 2016 elections in the u s a theory counter to u s intelligence findings they tried to take me down he kept saying that over and over sondland recalled trump saying trump told the diplomats to work with giuliani on ukraine issues over the time that followed volker and sondland proposed to zelenskiy s top aide andriy yermak that they a draft statement to be issued by ukraine on potential interference with the u s political process at giuliani s urging that statement needed to have an insert at end with 2 key items burisma and the 2016 u s elections it was mr giuliani who said if it doesn t say burisma and 2016 it s not credible because what are they hiding volker testified pressed by investigators sondland testified that it would be improper for the u s to prompt ukraine to investigate the biden family it doesn t sound good the statement was never issued as ukraine refused it volker said he told yermak it was not a good idea questions swirled after a government whistleblower s august complaint about trump s phone call with zelenskiy by september sondland also told investigators trump was in a bad mood and nearly hung up on him when the ambassador asked what it was he wanted from ukraine i want nothing i want no quid pro quo trump said according to sondland i want zelenskiy to do the right thing as house investigators released more transcripts tuesday they also announced they want to hear from trump s acting chief of staff and a top aide to pence reaching to the highest levels of the white house pence spokeswoman katie waldman said the vice president was unaware of the brief pull aside conversation that sondland reported having with yermak she also said pence was unaware of the ongoing back and forth over the statement and that it never came up during his meeting with zelenskiy at a closed door lunch tuesday pence told senate republicans the funds were being withheld over concerns that the europeans weren t contributing enough aid and issues of corruption in ukraine according to a person familiar with the meeting but unauthorized to discuss it and granted anonymity trump says the probe is illegitimate and the administration has resumed its efforts to block the inquiry as two more white house officials an energy adviser and a budget official declined to appear tuesday before investigators even after one received a subpoena meanwhile investigators said they wanted to hear on friday from trump s acting chief of staff mick mulvaney they contend his news conference last month amounted to nothing less than a televised confession of trump s efforts to have ukraine investigate democrats and biden as the white house was blocking military funding trump says he did nothing wrong and mulvaney later walked back his remarks the white house has instructed its officials not to comply with the impeachment inquiry being led by house democrats mulvaney is not expected to appear republicans have been unable to deliver a unified argument against the impeachment probe but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said tuesday he s pretty sure how it all will end mcconnell said he believes trump will stay in the white house i don t think there s any question it would not lead to a removal he said a top trump ally sen lindsey graham r s c told reporters he doesn t plan to read the transcripts calling the whole inquiry bunch of b s sondland closed his addendum to the house investigators saying he may have had a second call with trump but has been unable to obtain phone records and cannot
