tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap try as he might jim mattis can t seem to hide his real feelings about donald trump that the president is leading the world s most powerful nation down a dangerously wrong path mattis the retired marine general who resigned as defense secretary last december in a military policy dispute with trump says he owes the nation public silence while his former boss remains in office yet the comments mattis is making as he promotes his new book suggest a strong if implicit message trump s leadership is diminishing america from the day he accepted trump s offer to lead the pentagon mattis knew his views didn t align entirely with those of the president elect particularly on what mattis considers a central pillar of american global power and influence respect for allies trump often denigrates allies calling them ingrates and freeloaders top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens mattis who spent more than four decades in the marines is a former nato supreme allied commander strengthening alliances was no 2 on his list of strategic priorities as defense secretary behind only his push to restore what he saw as america s eroding military edge nations with allies prosper mattis likes to say while those without them wither trump prefers to largely go it alone america first during his two year tenure at the pentagon mattis was consistently circumspect he shied from news cameras concerned that any utterance could offend his boss or amplify the daylight between the two men on any number of issues to preserve his influence he felt he must hold his tongue nine months after resigning mattis still won t spell out his views on trump even when pushed in recent interviews lined up to discuss his book call sign chaos learning to lead to be released tuesday he is leaving it to others to interpret his dancing around the question he knows many americans would like him to answer does he think trump is fit to lead for another four years you don t endanger the country by attacking the elected commander in chief he told jeffrey goldberg for a portrait in the atlantic that sums up mattis as the man who couldn t take it anymore mattis known as a man who is nothing if not calculating then came as close as he ever has to putting a verbal knife in trump i may not like a commander in chief one fricking bit he said but our system puts the commander in chief there and to further weaken him when we re up against real threats i mean we could be at war on the korean peninsula every time they start launching something a companion concern that mattis has expressed sometimes obliquely is that the political climate in which trump was elected in 2016 has grown even more divisive to the point of endangering the future of what mattis likes to call america s experiment in democracy we all know we re better than our current politics he wrote in an essay for the wall street journal on wednesday tribalism must not be allowed to destroy our experiment thus mattis is sticking with his favorite understated description of a president who defies convention sows confusion and sometimes abandons truth he s an unusual president our president is mattis told correspondent david martin in an interview for cbs sunday morning and i think that especially with the just the rabid nature of politics today we ve got to be careful we could tear this country apart critics say mattis is using veiled attacks on trump to preserve his own legacy after having chosen to serve in an administration that injected politics into the military in ways mattis himself was known to abhor others say he is doing his best to walk a fine line between explaining himself and violating an unwritten rule military officers don t attack a president in office retired marine gen james jones whose long career overlapped mattis s and who later served as national security adviser to president barack obama credits mattis with a high minded approach he always took the high road jones said mattis doesn t take cheap shots in his essay for the wall street journal which was adapted from his book mattis described his view of what makes a good leader which by implication suggested it is not the trump model wise leadership requires collaboration otherwise it will lead to failure he wrote adding a polemicist s role is not sufficient for a leader a leader must display strategic acumen that incorporates respect for those nations that have stood with us when trouble loomed it was that mattis measure of leadership loyalty to allies that triggered his decision to quit last december by then it was only a question of time since trump has begun publicly mocking mattis and mattis had become upset with a growing list of trump decisions including naming army gen mark milley to be chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mattis had recommended another general one day after trump announced he was pulling all u s troops out of syria where they were partnering with local syrians to fight the islamic state mattis tried but failed to change trump s mind so he resigned you re going to have to get the next secretary of defense to lose to isis i m not going to do it goldberg quoted mattis as telling trump trump soon turned on mattis calling him a failure he said falsely that he had fired mattis what s he done for me
