miami fighting for florida and beyond hillary clinton and bernie sanders tangled in an intense debate wednesday night over who s the true friend of american hispanics trading accusations over guest worker programs akin to slavery and the embracing of vigilantes against immigrants they had even worse things to say about republican front runner donald trump facing off just six days before florida gives its verdict on the presidential race clinton faulted sanders for repeatedly voting against a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill he faulted her for opposing a 2007 effort to let people who were in the country illegally obtain driver s licenses had the immigration package passed back then clinton said a lot of the issues we are still discussing today would be in the rearview mirror sanders retorted that he opposed the legislation because it included a guest worker program akin to slavery the debate opened with a question that appeared to startle clinton univision s jorge ramos asked her if she would drop out of the race if indicted over the handling of her email while secretary of state oh for goodness that is not going to happen clinton declared i m not even answering that question the fbi is investigation the possibility of mishandling of sensitive information that passed through clinton s private email server sanders as he has in the past declined to bite on the issue saying the process will take its course he said he d rather talk about the issues of wealth and income inequality both candidates were bedding for momentum after sanders startled clinton with an upset victory in michigan on tuesday clinton stressed that she has a strong lead in the delegates declaring this is a marathon and it is a marathon that can only be carried by the kind of campaign i am running sanders said his michigan surprise was evidence that his message is resonating we are going to continue to do extremely well he said adding that he expects to convince superdelegates who are backing clinton to switch to his column immigration commanded considerable attention for good reason florida is home to nearly 1 8 million hispanics including about 15 percent of the state s democrats hispanic voters have made up about 10 percent of voters in the democratic primaries so far this year and clinton has been getting about two thirds of their votes to about one third for sanders the vermont senator for his part stresses that he s making progress on winning over younger hispanics clinton at one point accused sanders of supporting legislation that would have led to indefinite detention of people facing deportation and for standing with minutemen vigilantes he called that notion ridiculous and absurd and accused clinton of picking small pieces out of big legislative packages to distort his voting record no i do not support vigilantes and that is a horrific statement and an unfair statement to make he said adding i will match my record against yours any day of the week for all the disagreements the overall tone of the candidates was considerably less tense than their sunday faceoff sanders even paused at one point to make fun of his own pronunciation of huge as yuge both found agreement in pointing to gop front runner trump as markedly worse on immigration than either of them clinton mocked the trump s plan for a wall on the mexican border saying he d build the most beautiful tall wall better than the great wall of china to be magically paid for by mexico that she said is a fantasy sanders largely agreed adding his hope that in the immigration debate we do not as donald trump and others have done resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry the candidates squared off soon after a testy debate in michigan on sunday in which they argued about trade and economic issues of particular interest in the industrial midwest with missouri illinois ohio among the states that will be voting on tuesday the candidates returned to a pointed matter they d already argued about three days earlier scuffling over sanders vote against 2009 legislation that bailed out the auto industry among others sanders said he opposed the bill because it also bailed out big banks that had fueled the recession to begin with clinton stressed she d made a different judgment to side with the automakers overall 691 delegates are at stake on tuesday including 99 in florida which awards all its delegates to the winner rather than dividing them up proportionately clinton has won 762 pledged delegates compared to 549 for sanders with 10 delegates from recent primaries still to be allocated when superdelegates are included clinton leads 1 223 to 574 more than halfway to the 2 383 needed to win the democratic nomination benac reported from washington ap writers
