communist party ccp uses facial recognition technology to advance state control through the abuse of power over its own citizens the ccp suppresses those who criticize the party and those of different faiths in the name of decreasing the number of criminal offenses in fact the ccp s means of imposing stricter control over the domestic population goes far beyond this in addition to monitoring the public through the internet especially via wechat qq paypal and other apps the ccp also monitors mobile phones installs chips in id cards and collects dna data every move of the 1 4 billion citizens is under the government s surveillance what s even more troubling is that it has also extended its sphere of influence overseas the chinese communist party started to implement a real name registration system for mobile phone users in september 2013 in addition the ccp has also developed a mobile electronic fence system which allows it to monitor abnormal activities of individuals and groups in targeted populations recently in many provinces communist party officials have even asked people to hand over their mobile devices and install monitoring apps top stories democratic clerk

collect dna samples from the entire population with the plan of establishing the world s largest dna database in most states here in the united states law enforcement officers are only allowed to collect dna samples from people already arrested for committing crimes in china under the ccp s rule however from officials and scholars to students and civilians everyone s dna data can be collected forcibly without prior notice in some parts of china law enforcement agencies have even archived individual dna information along with other biometric information including fingerprints portraits and voice prints according to a report submitted to the ccp s public security dna conference in 2018 a provincial public security department has proposed to link the above data with personal information such as online shopping records and recreational habits according to overseas media reports and investigations including ones by ethan gutmann david kilgour and david matas many people held in prisons and detention centers have even been forced to undergo blood testing on a regular basis zhang lin a well known democracy movement activist was detained by the chinese communist party many times and put in notorious detention centers he said the detention center often gives unapproved blood and tissue tests to prisoners a senior prisoner once told me that the purpose of frequent blood tests is to find matching organs of high caliber for high level party officials if the right one is found then the prisoners will be sentenced to death and the organ will immediately be removed the united states confirmed allegations such as this by passing h r 343 in 2016 to condemn china s practice of forced organ harvesting from non consenting prisoners of conscience in addition to tightening social control using data driven technology the chinese communist party has developed an effective tool of turning the people against each other in recent years with the support from ccp so called non

classrooms equipped with cameras and they face the danger of being reported by students at any time teachers at the same time are also mandated to report students who want to access their right of

broken everyone is like an enemy to each other and an atmosphere of terror permeates the entire society the ccp has never been hesitant to utilize new technology and find new ways to violate the rights of its citizens and help maintain its terrorist rule it has been striving to turn china into an orwellian state fortunately the international community is recognizing its agenda under the leadership of the united states the world is forming a siege to confront it the chinese people will eventually lead a life with freedom and dignity just like people of any civilized country do flora
