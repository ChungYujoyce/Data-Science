back to you wallace mike tobin reporting from odessa mike thanks now to hurricane dorian millions of people from florida to the carolinas potentially in the storm aposs crosshairs now bearing down on the bahamas dorian is gaining strength but where it will hit the mainland and when is still not clear in a moment we aposll discuss the threat and response of acting fema administrator pete gaynor and florida senator rick scott but we began with senior meteorologist janice dean live in the fox extreme weather center with the latest on dorian aposs track janice janice dean senior meteorologist chris the northwestern bahamas has not seen a category five in their history andrew came close back in 1992 but this storm packing 160 mile per hour winds is forecast to slow down not just for a matter of hours but for days so prayers out towards the northwestern bahamas the coast is not clear when it comes to florida and georgia and the carolinas the latest track has this storm weakening a little bit but not by very much and i don apost want you to focus on the center of the cone i want you to focus on all of it because the potential is there as the computer models are switching more westward you are not out of the woods parts of southern central and north florida and then up towards georgia and the coast of the carolinas the track has been very uncertain for days and that aposs what the take home message is not only for florida but for georgia and the carolinas we are talking about a hurricane into friday so this is not just going to be a 12 24 hour thing this is going to be a week long event possibly affecting the northeast as we get into the weekend here are the tropical models the latest and i will tell you they have shifted westward chris so that is not good news i need everyone to pay close attention to your local forecasts and your local officials we are not out of the woods across the southeast coast the u s back to you wallace janice reporting from the fox weather center janice thank you joining us now live from fema headquarters in washington pete gaynor the acting head of that agency mr gaynor i just want to pick up on what janice dean said what are the special challenges of dealing with this storm given the fact that its strength its speed and where or when it aposs going to hit the mainland keeps changing pete gaynor acting fema administrator yes i think janice hit the keyword is uncertainty and we aposve been dealing with uncertainty pretty much the entire time with dorian it aposs going to stall out tomorrow and into tuesday cat 5 160 mile an hour winds surge and i know people are getting tired because this has been a long duration storm and it hasn apost even touched you know florida or the east coast so we want people to you know don apost dismiss this storm we are not out of it life threatening dangerous surge water wind is coming your way take the time now to prepare you and your family wallace yes i want to talk about that because we keep looking at that diagram where it clears the bahamas heads towards florida and then takes a sharp right turn and of course all of this still subject to change even if it doesn apost hit the mainland of florida the east coast but just stays off the shore there what potential damage to florida especially in terms of storm surge gaynor well storm surge is one of the things that we worry about most you know the majority of 90 percent of all weather related deaths come from water flooding surge fifty percent of those deaths are people in cars driving through flooded waters so you aposve got to take this storm seriously i know watches and warnings will be going up here shortly for a lot of the coast of florida and then into monday tuesday wednesday georgia and the carolinas it aposs coming your way take time to prepare now wallace given that this keeps changing and could affect several states how prepared is fema not just in florida which at first looked like it was going to be ground zero but now how prepared are you in georgia and the carolinas gaynor well we are well prepared we aposve been at this for five or six days preparing we aposve been activated in the national response coordination center which you can see behind me we have food water generators staff helicopters ambulances from florida all the way to north carolina wallace dhs decided a month ago to transfer some money 155 million from fema disaster relief to build more immigration hearing sites on the southern border now it now turns out in 2014 president obama did roughly the same thing transfer 270 million from disaster relief to deal with another migrant crisis but florida agriculture commissioner nikki fried put out a statement this week quote the president must be out of his mind if he thinks it aposs a good idea to shift funds out of fema for immigrant detention at the border while a potential then category 3 hurricane bears down on the united states mr gaynor your response to that gaynor we have plenty of money and resources to deal with 2017 and apos18 disaster recoveries and to include response in 2019 this season you know we live with risk every day we assess risk we assess that that 155 million is low risk and it aposs not affecting our preparedness whatsoever for dorian wallace and how much is the president directly involved in this i know he aposs going to be spending time at fema headquarters with you later today but how much is he monitoring this storm gaynor daily hourly if i aposm not talking to his staff we aposre talking to him we did a vtc to camp david yesterday we aposre in his office the oval office a couple days ago the vice president is involved the entire staff is involved he has he has his finger on the pulse wallace one last quick question you have a long history of handling these disasters emergency management in rhode island but this is going to be your first storm as an acting director of fema on the national level just a natural human question any nerves gaynor well i think you know if you weren apost nervous i think you aposd probably you aposre not you don apost have your head right screwed on right so it aposs just not about me it aposs about the 20 000 employees that work for me directly and the entire federal family which is represented behind me so everything from federal ngos our private partners ph state local and individuals this is a team effort success when it comes to response recovery is a team effort i have the full confidence in the team wallace pete gaynor thank you thanks for taking time to talk with us gaynor you aposre welcome wallace joining me now florida senator and former governor rick scott who aposs been at camp david with the president this weekend monitoring the situation in his home state senator as you assess all the data the strength the very slow speed of this storm and the constantly changing track what worries you most about dorian sen rick scott r fla well what worries me is that everybody aposs going to look at that little track right in the middle instead of this sort of cone of uncertainty i mean this thing it can still move right into florida the national hurricane center told me this morning that it has wobbled a little bit further to the west so it aposs been come closer so everybody aposs got to follow this the president i know is focused on it fema has done a good job you can download their app to get information but i aposm that aposs my biggest concern is people are going to think oh i aposm they aposre we aposre off the hook we are not off the hook wallace when it makes that right turn it still could scott yes plus plus we aposve got we aposre going to get storm surge we aposre going to get a lot of rain the closer it gets to florida or into florida we can get more rain that can cause flooding so take it seriously over prepare don apost under prepare wallace what aposs the challenge of evacuation orders when you don apost know where this storm is going and where it aposs going to hit scott this is like matthew a couple of years ago you we had to start evacuating even though it stayed off the coast we got to we had to over prepare because if it turns it aposs too late you can apost get out and so that aposs why i tell everybody to you know have your water seven days your food your medicines but also if you think there aposs any chance you aposre going to have to evacuate do it now and get ahead of the game wallace as governor of florida you you aposre a veteran at this you presided over a number of hurricanes including just last year hurricane michael which hit as a category five in the panhandle catastrophic what aposs your advice to your successor governor desantis who this is his first hurricane as governor scott i aposve been talking to him he aposs got a great team we have great at the state and at the local level emergency management teams you know as governor you need to listen you need to stay ahead of it as issues come up every storm aposs a little bit different the issues are different just react so i aposm i aposm continuing to talk to him and talking to his emergency management team fema i know is down there full time gracia szczech who runs fema for the southeast is down there full time so he aposs got a good team around him i aposm sure you know they aposre all focused wallace one of the reasons it seems that that dorian keeps growing is because it aposs traveling over so much warm water as it heads across the caribbean getting closer now to the florida mainland you have expressed mixed feelings over the years about climate change and about the role that human activity plays but it it sure seems like these hurricanes are getting bigger stronger more intense do you see a connection scott well first off we know the climate aposs changing and then we know our storms seem to be getting bigger i mean just in the in with the last four years as governor i had four of them now we have them my first year out as governor so we don apost know what the cause is but we aposve got to react to it so as governor i mean we put money into dealing with things like sea you know sea level rise more mitigation and and things like that so we aposve got to continue to figure this out wallace as a senator is it a relief not to be in charge not to be at ground zero in charge of overseeing how the state responds to this hurricane or is there a part of you after eight years of doing it that would kind of like to be in the command center running things right now scott well it doesn apost change chris your heart goes out to everybody and you aposre worried about them i mean i always tell everybody you can rebuild your house but you can apost rebuild your family i love my family and and and so you know and i aposm i aposm concerned about people and i aposm concerned are they taking this seriously enough and that aposs not it doesn apost change whether you aposre the governor or the or the senator so in my job my role now is to make sure the federal government does their response that aposs why i went to fema yesterday i aposll be going there with the president today i went to red cross yesterday and their they they both know that they aposre in good in good shape to to do whatever comes around ph wallace and briefly you were at camp david yesterday how involved is the president how often is he getting updates scott i was i was we got updates while i was there we got updates i know we played golf yesterday and got updates while i was playing golf then we had a longer update at 4 00 and we talked about it after that so he was constantly getting updates fema aposs i mean he aposs he aposs been he aposs been speaking to pete gaynor the administrator of fema so i mean he aposs a he aposs a i and i aposve been talking to him every day about it so he aposs very engaged wallace senator scott thank you thanks for coming in today and our thoughts of course go out to all of the people florida georgia the carolinas all of the people in the storm zone thank you so much sir scott thanks chris wallace up next the white house calls former fbi director james comey a proven liar and leaker after a doj watchdog finds he mishandled his memos about the president we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the fallout from the inspector general aposs report plus what would you like to ask the panel about comey not facing criminal charges for violating fbi rules just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip james comey former fbi director i understood this to be my recollection recorded of my conversation with the president as a private citizen i felt free to share that i thought it very important to get it out trump i thought the charges were unbelievably powerful i thought the i g report was incredible but certainly those were very serious charges end video clip wallace former fbi director james comey testifying before congress in 2017 on how he handled memos he wrote about meetings with president trump and the president reacting friday to the inspector general aposs tough findings on comey and it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume charles lane from the washington post former democratic party chair donna brazile and kristen soltis anderson of the washington examiner well in a blistering report the i g said that comey set a quote dangerous example for the entire fbi and then he added this that his comey aposs own personal conception of what was necessary was not an appropriate basis for ignoring the policies and agreements governing the use of fbi records but the i g report also states we found no evidence that comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media so brit to quote a favorite sports show that i like to watch big deal little deal or no deal brit hume senior political analyst pretty big deal first of all the argument that you heard advanced there by mr comey in his testimony in 2017 was utterly dismissed by the inspector general as being invalid and left no doubt ph wallace the idea that this was his hume his material that was not it wasn apost a plausible argument at the time and it was blown up really by this report in addition it aposs worth remembering that the reason why he leaked this information through a friend to the new york times that was the subject of much of this was to trigger the investigation that actually came to pass by the independent counsel by the special counsel robert mueller so there aposve been other questions raised about the progeny of that investigation whether it was legitimately based or not whether there was improper conduct within course of it this only adds to the suspicion that this whole investigation which ended up not finding the collusion that was a big piece of why the investigation was begun was misbegotten from the start so i think it aposs an important piece in this growing clear puzzle wallace donna your reaction to the i g report and especially the fact that basically with the i g found as he did in the hillary clinton case is that james comey decided that his moral order his sense of what was right and appropriate allowed him to just ignore fbi regulations donna brazile former dnc chair well when i read the report what i saw was an individual an employee of the federal government deciding to act on his own to release these reports i mean to his lawyers his attorneys as well as to a friend who leaked it to the media it appears that he got a taste of his own medicine that he issued when he made that big you know speech about hillary clinton using classified information carelessly and so forth look i think at the end of the day he did violate the procedures of his employment it should not be prosecuted i agree with mr barr on that but at the same time mr comey was acting on his own and trying to get this information out which plausibly was a violation wallace we ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on twitter from robin herman who writes and a lot of you wrote in why aren apost they prosecuting james comey can he be sued for his part in destroying the reputation and life of general flynn michael flynn former national security advisor and others chuck how do you answer robin charles lane the washington post well i don apost think there aposs any lawsuit there because by flynn because the prosecution of flynn was going on over here without this activity that aposs talked about in the i g report and they aposre not prosecuting him because whatever he did with the classified information never reached the level of first of all it aposs a very tiny amount i think they were discussing about six words involving a very low level of classification so this president aposs justice department is exercising its discretion not to prosecute that i think what this shows though is looking ahead to future investigations that are still coming down the road by this i g you know i g s tend to issue critical reports they find things because that aposs what they are in business to do wallace sort of like special counsels do lane exactly and so it gives me the idea that this i g is and he was very tough on mccabe and comey in previous reports he might be tough on them in the one that he has forthcoming you know about the whole fisa report wallace well yes i want to pick up on that because there is a lot more to come out the same inspector general michael horowitz has a report we thought it was going to come at last spring it now looks like it aposs going to come out this month although who knows on the origins of the fisa order warrant that allowed surveillance of carter page a former campaign official foreign policy advisor to the president and then you got maybe even more seriously john durham a u s attorney up in connecticut who bill barr the attorney general has specially ordered authorized to look into the whole question of the origins of the trump report is it possible and obviously we don apost know what they aposre going to find out kristen that in the end that the whole russia investigation and all of the issues surrounding it could flip politically and this could end up being a strength positive for president trump and a big liability for democrats kristen soltis anderson echelon insights well throughout this entire process there have been a variety of flips at least in the polls come on things like who believes that james comey is the good guy or the bad guy who believes bob mueller is the good guy or the bad guy this is an issue where depending on who is sort of perceived as being up or down who aposs being supportive of the president or whether something is good or bad for the president the polls tend to move all over the place so i do think in the end i mean president trump has long asserted that he has been under siege from forces on the outside he does this on the economy saying the fed is coming for me politically saying the investigations have come for me and when more evidence comes out suggesting that even pieces of his claims of being under siege may be justified i do think that that has a potential to help them a little politically though ultimately i think voters are making decisions based on other matters not this one wallace but you know you got this interesting situation where more than half of the house democratic caucus is calling for at least an impeachment inquiry if not full impeachment if you get damaging reports that raise real questions about the whole origins of the russia investigation that does kind of embarrassed democrats soltis anderson well even in the absence of that i think there aposs a reason why nancy pelosi continues to say to everybody to hold back on the impeachment thing because every time a democrat comes out and says they are supportive of impeachment republicans are the ones celebrating politically it aposs a dangerous road for democrats to go down and reports like this just pose even further danger to them politically wallace brit we just a little bit of time left and i want to pick up on this question of the decision by bill barr the attorney general not to prosecute james comey now the president on friday said well that just shows how fair bill barr is this morning he doesn apost seem quite so in support of all of that in fact he aposs even retweeting comments from some people on fox news some commentators maybe to chief justice roberts should look into that i aposve got to say i don apost quite know what his role would be and also retweeting a comment that james comey and andrew mccabe are quote dirty cops hume well that aposs you know the kind of thing he says my sense about this is that barr made the decision not to prosecute on this basis because the size of the violation and the amount of material involved as chuck pointed out was very small and i and moreover the report from the i g did not allege that he had leaked classified information to the media and only that he aposd given it to his lawyers well i mean i think that is a violation but it aposs kind of a technical violation so i mean think barr made a wide decision here and it does add to the impression that barr is playing straight on this stuff he wasn apost going to prosecute trump on obstruction of justice he didn apost prosecute comey for leaking and for disobeying fbi rules which is not a criminal violation anyway wallace all right panel we have to take a break here we aposll see you all a little later up next the president imposes tariffs on another 112 billion of chinese goods starting today on this labor day weekend we aposll discuss the fallout with the head of the country aposs largest group of unions afl cio president richard trumka that aposs next commercial break wallace coming up the president faces opposition to his proposed canada mexico trade deal from the head of the biggest u s labor federation begin video clip richard trumka afl cio president we haven apost seen a bill or a trade agreement yet that is actually good for workers and can be enforced by workers end video clip wallace we aposll ask richard trumka how the president aposs trade policy will play in 2020 next commercial break wallace despite pushback from a number of american companies tariffs on more chinese imports including clothes and shoes take effect today as the trade war between the world aposs two biggest economies escalates joining us this labor day weekend to discuss the potential fallout for american workers is the president of the afl cio richard trumka mr trumka welcome back to fox news sunday and happy labor day richard trumka president afl cio chris thanks for having me on and happy labor day to you wallace all right let aposs start with the new trade deal with between the u s and mexico and canada that the president hopes to get through congress this fall here he is on friday begin video clip donald trump president the usmca has become very popular that aposs our deal with mexico and with canada unions are liking it farmers are loving it manufacturers are really liking it end video clip wallace unions are liking it the president says as it stands today do you support the usmca trumka as it stands today it aposs unenforceable and therefore we couldn apost support it we want to get to yes we aposve been working with the trade rep lighthizer to try to get there and hopefully we will wallace what aposs unenforceable about it trumka well wallace supposedly that was one of the big issues they they were going to solve with this trumka it aposs unenforceable on three levels first of all mexico has always used a model an they aposve kept wages artificially low by using a thing called a protectionist contract that aposs where a sham union comes in negotiates a deal with a company keeps wages low nabisco mondelez wallace all right you aposre you aposre getting into the weeds here a little bit but trumka ok wallace so basically trumka so so if if mexico can apost enforce their own agreement their own laws then this agreement will never work because their wages will be artificially low and they will suck jobs and capital out of the united states wallace but let aposs look at some of the features of the deal and i want to put them up according to the trumka there are there are two other levels by the way wallace ok but i but i we we aposve only got limited time here sir let aposs look at some features of the deal according to the international trade commission this deal usmca will create 176 000 new jobs in the u s and the trump administration says labor provisions quote have been incorporated into the core text of the agreement you are meeting this coming week with mexican president lopez obrador if you don apost get what you want from them on these various issues are you really going to block this deal trumka we won apost have any choice because it aposs unenforceable and an unenforceable trade agreement is a windfall for corporations and a disaster for workers this isn apost enforceable if they can apost enforce their laws it doesn apost work this agreement allows either party to stop the appointment of an arbitrator so you and i have a dispute wallace right trumka we can apost come to an agreement we need an arbitrator either party can stop that from happening under this agreement and the third thing is dispute resolution has taken eight to ten years this is not going to speed it up and in the meantime the product that aposs produced in violation of the agreement continues to come into the country we think it ought to be stopped at the border so those are the three levels of enforcement wallace i was going to say congratulations you got your three points in let aposs turn to china you say that the president is right to take on china but he aposs not going about it the right way briefly what aposs your complaint and hasn apost this president done a lot more to take on china than his immediate predecessors trumka he has and i think it aposs it aposs a good thing taking on china unfortunately he aposs done it the wrong way to take on china there has to be a multilateral approach one country can apost take on china to try to dry up its overcapacity because they just send it through to you in other ways so if you aposre going to take on china it has to be multilateral it has to address human rights and labor rights violations it has to address currency rebalancing and it has to have a long term slant towards good jobs in this country that aposs not been the approach unfortunately we hope it becomes the approach but not so yet wallace president trump says that he generally has support from union rank and file that his problem are union leaders he doesn apost mention you specifically but union leaders like yourself who he says are out of touch with their own members take a look at the president begin video clip trump so i aposm going to speak to some of your union leaders to say i hope you aposre going to support trump ok and if they don apost vote them the hell out of office because they aposre not doing their job it aposs true end video clip wallace a lot of union workers a lot of your members did vote for trump in 2016 where are you on the president these days trumka well look he he got 4 percent more of our members then mitt romney did he came to our members and said i aposm going to change the rules of the economy and they believed him and quite frankly i wish he would have changed the rules of the economy unfortunately the rules he aposs changing has hurt them he aposs opposed every increase in the minimum wage he aposs changed the regulation to take overtime away from a couple of million people he aposs proposed a trillion dollar cuts to medicare and medicaid he aposs done all he aposs rolled back health and safety standards towards workers i aposve tried to call balls and strikes with him when he does something that aposs good for workers i say so when he does something that aposs bad for workers i say so and i have to say unfortunately while he may not even know what his administration is doing they aposve done more things to hurt workers than they have to help them and that aposs unfortunate wallace but let aposs but let aposs look at some other parts of the trump record that i think even you are going to agree are i don apost know which is a ball and which is a strike i but that you would say are good and 57 million jobs created on his watch unemployment rate up 3 7 percent workers apos wages up 3 2 percent over the last year you talk about the things that you don apost like haven apost all of those parts of the trump policy benefited a lot of your members trumka actually real wages were down last quarter and they were down last year they aposre being driven by rising health care costs and rising housing costs wallace well according to our stats they aposre up three over 3 percent over the last year trumka not real wages real wages are down because of housing costs and health care and his response to that was to propose a trillion dollar cut to medicare and medicaid to oppose increases into the minimum wage look our members are still waiting for the supposed greatness of this economy to reach their kitchen tables when they do i aposll cheer they aposll cheer and they aposll all support the person who helped get it there wallace ok let aposs talk about the democratic race for president and some of the ideas that democratic candidates are proposing you are not on board with medicare for all you have expressed real reservations about it and the plan that you have supported recently is much narrower you aposre just saying medicare for people going down from 65 to 55 how come trumka we think ultimately you aposre going to have to get to a single payer plan but there has to be a role for the hard fought high quality plans that we aposve negotiated look it aposs just unfair to say to somebody you aposve sacrificed over the last 40 years you aposve given up wages you aposve negotiated a good health care plan and now we aposre going to ask you to take 50 percent of the health care plan that you negotiated if there isn apost some way for us to have our plans integrated into the system then we would have a tough time supporting it wallace you have also expressed concerns about the green new deal saying that as it aposs currently written i mean you support climate change but the green new deal and all the ways in which it would dislocate the economy you say is currently written it would be bad for you members i guess the general question i have is this do you have some concerns that some of the democratic candidates some would say most of the democratic candidates that are still in the race are taking the party too far to the left too changes that are too dramatic and you aposd like to see a more centrist moderate position taken by the democratic party going into 2020 trumka now look the look this economy has not worked for working people for 30 years let me say this over the last 30 years the wealth of the top 1 percent has increased 21 trillion and during that same period of time it aposs decreased from the bottom 50 percent by 900 million workers are being left behind there needs to be massive changes to this economy we need to talk to wall street and support wall street not not i mean main street not wall street when we do that we aposll get behind that candidate are we going to have disagreements with people of course we are but we will see who is going to create an economy that works for working people who is going to strengthen our right to bargain collectively so we can get a fair share of what we produce with our employers and who aposs going to take the wall street dominated point of view that we have right now and change it so that main street gets more consideration wallace mr trumka thank you thanks for sharing this holiday weekend with us and again happy labor day sir trumka happy labor day to you and may i just say one last thing chris i offer my thoughts and our prayers to the victims and the families of the people the shootings in texas and for those in the path of dorian we hope that they aposre safe we hope that they aposre spared from any kind of really ph harm wallace all of us here at fox all of our viewers share those sentiments thank you again mr trumka trumka thanks for having me wallace when we come back while joe biden aposs continuing verbal slipups catch up with him we aposll ask our sunday panel how solid is biden aposs frontrunner status commercial break begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate it aposs the god aposs truth my word as a biden he stood his attention i went to pin him he said sir i don apost want the damn thing do not pin it on me sir please sir do not do that i was making the point how courageous these people are how incredible they are i don apost know what the problem is i mean what is it that i said wrong end video clip wallace democratic frontrunner joe biden recounting a story about a brave u s soldier than having to deal with the fact he got almost all of the details of that story wrong and we aposre back now with the panel well kristen joe biden has had two poor to middling debates i think we aposd all agree he has been dealing with just a flurry of stories about gaps misstatements odd moments yet he continues to lead this field by double digits how come kristen soltis anderson echelon insights he aposs leading the field by double digits at the moment because he aposs a well known figure in the democratic party and an awful lot of democratic voters are saying i will tune into this race once you have narrowed the field down to five six people then i will pay attention but for the moment joe biden he was obama aposs guy i like him i aposm with him but being at only about 30 percent of this democratic field may be enough to sustain him through a contentious nomination process but if he does not wind up winning in iowa or in new hampshire if someone like an elizabeth warren who has a lot of energy whose campaign has seen a pretty good last six months can overtake him i do think that he aposs vulnerable if these gaffes begin to really make democratic voters worry about his potential electability a year and a half from now wallace donna how do you explain the durability of biden aposs lead and the fact that that his supporters continue you know the 30 percent to ignore what aposs been a pretty choppy performance on on the road do can he perform the way he is currently performing and when the nomination donna brazile contributor you know most voters know joe biden they know his character they know his values and i think that aposs the reason why he aposs still steady in the polls but i think you aposre absolutely right if elizabeth warren is able to take him on and our and bernie sanders or elizabeth warren in new hampshire we have a fight on our hands joe biden we know that he will at times misspeak but the the but the bottom line is there aposs no alternative right now it aposs an electability argument that most democrats are using to say that he aposs the one that can beat trump until we can find other candidates who can beat trump joe biden wallace well according to the polls there are three or four of them that can beat trump brazile there are at least four or five of course but joe biden steady support is because people know him he was obama aposs guy but most important they see him as the champion who can defeat donald trump wallace i want to turn to another big subject that week which appears to be the growing likelihood of a deal between the u s at the taliban in afghanistan here is the president on friday begin video clip trump we have very good negotiations going on with the taliban the taliban is saying they aposre going to do things we aposll see if that aposs so we haven apost made a deal yet but we will be bringing it down to about 8 600 end video clip wallace brit first of all the president seems to be giving away all of his leverage because as part of the deal he would go down from 14 000 to 8 600 troops he aposs basically saying we aposre going to do that anyway and in addition the washington post had a story yesterday that said that his hardline national security advisor john bolton is largely being kept out of these discussions what aposs going on here brit hume senior political analyst well one thing what aposs going on is the 8 600 troops i mean there was a time when he was ordering all troops out of afghanistan and many of us thought that that was going to be the end result of these of these conversations and would make some kind of a deal with the taliban and all our troops would come home to people who are worried that the united states will forsake its role in afghanistan and open the place up to become another terrorist haven that that is reassuring news and i think that aposs i think that fact alone is the biggest thing that aposs come out of this week is the acknowledgment that we aposre going to leave a force there of some size obviously shrunk from what it what it has been but i think that was i think that was important wallace chuck the chairman of the joint chiefs general joe dunford didn apost seem quite so comfortable with about that he said now maybe he was talking about total withdrawal but he said i aposm not even going to use the withdrawal word and he said any pulldown of troops will be condition based but this president really does seem to want to get most if not all of u s troops out i mean it is was a big campaign promise in 2016 charles lane the washington post footnote the 8 600 is how many troops that were in afghanistan when trump came into office hume right lane so it aposs really not a withdrawal no of course and general dunford is worried about squandering all the results hard won results on the battlefield but let me talk about polls and maybe this will help explain what the president aposs up to did a little research last night and last and this year pew research found that only 36 percent of the american people say that the war in afghanistan was worth fighting last year they found that 49 percent of adults say the u s has quote mostly failed in afghanistan it aposs not a popular war it seems endless and i think to the extent that the president is eager to get out he aposs got public backing or at least passive support for that idea and i think this is one of those situations where american patience has essentially run out with this endless project and he will be doing something politically popular which let aposs face it controls foreign policy here aposs the risk this all has a little bit of a post vietnam feel to me where we aposre negotiating a deal with the other guy behind the back of the local government that we were supporting there aposs a big problem wallace i just should point that out that all of the negotiations so far have been between the taliban and a fellow named zalmay khalilzad who is the u s envoy there had been no discussions between the taliban and the afghan government of ashraf ghani lane the afghan government is terrified of being left alone with this taliban which just yesterday attacked a big town in afghanistan so there are perhaps political upsides to him for 2020 for the u s and its foreign policy and for afghanistan itself big risk beyond that wallace yes i want to pick up and maybe less politics and more the merits of the deal kristen because what we aposre talking about is that we would take almost not quite but almost half of our troops out and in return all the taliban is agreeing is that they aposre going to renounce al qaeda and that they won apost let them regenerate and that they will talk to the current to the current afghan government but who knows can you trust the taliban what happens if they say we aposre going to renounce al qaeda but not isis which seems to be a growing threat and then of course there aposs the whole question of women because women were completely subjugated under the taliban for years in afghanistan what happens if the taliban roars back in and suddenly we go back to the middle ages anderson this is one of the most heartbreaking pieces of all of this i mean in the new york times coverage of the attacks that you mentioned chuck in northern afghanistan i believe they talked about a colonel who aposs 36 years old and who his role had been to do social media communications on behalf of the afghan government and he has passed away half of his lifetime has been consumed as has anybody who was in their mid 30s half of your lifetime the united states has been engaged in this conflict trying to combat the taliban and their influence in afghanistan the fact that we aposre now 18 years in and still we may be ending this or walking away with the taliban sort of taking a position of they aposre going to we aposre letting them have a role it just it is astonishing to me and heartbreaking that there are going to be women who are going to be subjugated that this is where things will be left hume this is called losing brazile yes hume you know if we completely ultimately abandoned that situation over there partly because it aposs unpopular partly because people are frustrated with it partly because it aposs been going on so long we aposre not likely to appreciate the results and the public won apost either and public opinion on this is likely to turn quite sharply if the scenario that you describe comes to pass wallace well that that that aposs exactly right and you know we aposve put more troops in and we continue to lose so at a certain point maybe you cut your losses it is a really difficult situation thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week iron man cal ripken on the challenge of living up to the family legacy commercial break wallace this summer we aposve been replaying some of our favorite power players from the past year and this spring i had a special experience i want to share with you again begin videotape wallace voice over i did a fundraising event at st john aposs college in annapolis a liberal arts school that has taught the great book since 1696 it was a conversation with cal ripken baseball aposs iron man who broke lou gehrig aposs record for consecutive games played our discussion turned to one of the few things the hall of famer and i have in common we both went into our dad aposs business cal sr was a minor league coach who eventually managed his son for the baltimore orioles and cal aposs son ryan now plays for the orioles in the minors cal ripken jr baseball hall of famer i chose to go into the same business as as my dad and i know that my son chose to go into the same business as me and i think he aposs got it really really bad what were some of the challenges that you had to deal with by having the last name wallace wallace on camera well it is you know it aposs hard to say that it aposs a problem but it is a problem i mean it aposs a nice problem in the sense that you aposre exposed to the business on the other hand you labor and i maybe i had this more than you i think maybe in a sense i aposm more like ryan than you were ripken right wallace because my father was a superstar and you know sometimes people call you mike instead of chris and that kind of or whatever and and and at one point i mean i i certainly dealt with it and at one point and it was well into my career i remember saying to myself you know what you aposre probably never going to be mike wallace but neither is anybody else and from that minute on i was ok with it ripken my son and i aposve tried to i can apost protect him from the last name the expectations have been great you know his whole time when he was 12 years old i aposd go to a tournament in minnesota and i aposd go over there to watch him and i aposm just sitting in the stands watching him play baseball and all the other kids from the other fields come up and then they you can hear them they go ok which one is he you know and then so he aposll go out there and he aposll pop up or do something else and they aposll go he aposs not that good and then they aposll kind of walk away so there was this feeling that happened all the time and so the hard part was i aposm trying to say be you don apost don apost be me you know don apost try to be me you aposre a big tall left handed hitting first baseman you have a certain set of skills but i aposm trying to get that point across to him but it doesn apost resonate and so that aposs why i aposm really interested how did you just turn the screw and say ok i aposm not i aposll just be me wallace thirty years of therapy no no that aposs not true you match yourself against an impossible standard if you sit there and say well am i going to be as good as cal ripken or am i going to be as good as mike wallace and you know as you say part of it is just live your life but part of it is also to realize the standard which you aposre comparing yourself to is almost an impossible standard i mean how many frankly
