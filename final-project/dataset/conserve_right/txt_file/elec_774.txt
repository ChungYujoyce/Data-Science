hours i tweeted that the next polls from utah should be interesting and holy mother of god are they a y2 analytics poll of 500 likely utah voters from oct 10 11 was published this morning and the results are the craziest numbers i ve seen in an already unfathomable election year donald trump and hillary clinton are tied at 26 percent independent conservative evan mcmullin is closing fast at 22 percent gary johnson is at 14 and jill stein s at 1 this in a state where mitt romney received 73 percent of the vote in 2012 and which republicans have won since 1976 by an average of 36 percentage points this is y2 analytics first utah poll this year so we don t have a clean before and after comparison yet as i mentioned in the bottom of this saturday post about the mormon led republican defection from trump two of only three previous utah polls that included mcmullin looked like this dt 34 hc 25 gj 13 em 12 js 1 ot 8 un 8 sept 12 19 tribune hinckley dt 39 hc 24 gj 13 em 12 js 0 dc 2 ot 6 un 7 sept 1 9 tribune hinckley dc darrell castle ot is other un undecided so as i pointed out in august trump was already in an unprecedentedly weak position in the beehive state before this latest evidence of his moral vulgarity surfaced now mormons who make up an estimated 55 percent of utah s population look poised to run screaming from the republican party s standard bearer the y2 survey found that a whopping 94 percent of respondents were aware of trump s sex bragging tape and that mcmullin a utah native brigham young university grad and mormon was competitive despite only 52 percent being aware enough of him to form an opinion in addition according to the deseret news write up mcmullin soundly beats trump among those in the poll who identified themselves members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the campaigns of both mcmullin and johnson are based in utah so this poll will intensify what was already a top regional priority for both the johnson bill weld shop started its latest fundraising pitch yesterday like so a realistic analysis of polling data across the country shows that governors johnson and weld can win 5 or more states by focusing resources in these key purple states johnson is on the ballot in all 50 states plus washington d c mcmullin is on just 11 compared to darrell castle s 24 and rocky de la feunte s 20 in most of those states mcmullin isn t making much of a measurable dent in virginia this week for example he recently registered at 1 percent compared to johnson s 7 but it s also true that his name doesn t always appear on polls and that many of his states are underpolled to begin with i would expect him to pull some votes in idaho a safely republican state with the second largest concentration of mormons plus colorado and new mexico each of which feature 2 percent mormon populations and are easily reachable from the salt lake media market gary johnson meanwhile looks to be most competitive in his home base of new mexico where a recent poll had him at 24 percent plus third party friendly alaska where a recent pre trump tape poll had him at 18 percent he was also beating the spread between clinton and trump in 18 states last time i ran the numbers if either johnson or mcmullin win a state outright it would mark the first such success by a third party presidential candidate since george wallace won five in 1968 with clinton s lead widening over trump of late the drama of such a milestone would lessen but it would be a huge deal either for a libertarian party attempting to cement its status as the third alternative in american politics or for nevertrump conservatives looking to build from the wreckage of a self damaging election there is no doubt that the lp will win the overall bronze in the popular vote but will the conservative alternative sneak past in the electoral college the answer to that question will give us some interesting clues about what post trump politics will look like

gold plated statue in his honor maybe next to the one he s already building electing trump will do more damage to the gop siv i thought you were a huge trump supporter what changed your mind what gives you the impression siv wasn t supporting johnson siv has been one of the most vocal trump supporters around here there are a lot of people around here who basically went with trump couldn t be worse than hillary myself included but siv has been happy to serve as a trump fluffer i m as supportive of trump as a feather pillow having said that he s the best bet for throwing a spanner in the works breaking the machine is my new top priority the rest be damned because until the masses are on their knees and the crooked sob s are swinging by their necks no one is going to give a shit about restoring anything we ve gone beyond the event horizon so returning to a constitutional form of government isn t gonna happen without first to quote tommy saxondale we smash the system someone grabbed his pussy is that better or worse than grabbing its motherfucking leg trying to keep up you can get a better grip on the leg so somewhat better though you could always grip the pussy in the same way you would grip a bowling ball i think it comes down to technique what makes you think he changed his mind he could be supporting trump in the hopes he will damage the gop trump s longest lasting legacy will be the damage to the house and senate gop control caused by his initiation of a stupid party civil war by encouraging his supporters to abstain from voting gop down ballot he s effectively handing control of all three branches of government to canklestein how does chief justice of the united states supreme court william jefferson clinton sound trumptards i think they re hoping that burning down the gop will somehow spread to the democrats the dems are going to be roasting marshmallows over the coals of the gop say goodbye to your gun rights hello to speech codes no it s even worse than that how does chief justice obama sound to you title ix czar chelsea clinton it s a stint she ll do while managing the foundation on the side you know because having either bill or hillary sitting on the board would be a conflict of interest but intermediating it through their only child makes it totes legit sounds like a pathway to looting the academy sweet the intraparty fighting won t last long whatever the outcome i doubt trump s hard core supporters are dedicated enough to maintain recriminations in any further elections if he loses and most republicans haven t turned on him hard enough to draw their wrath anyway most offer measured criticism coupled with mealy mouthed support if he wins the fighting will probably last through the next cycle with him getting challenged in the primaries and by that time he will probably have disappointed his supporters enough that their fire will be gone for an example of the staying power of movements built around a cult of personality just look at millenials that voted for obama stupid party civil war i anticipate a short paragraph in a future american history book detailing this episode as such as opposed to the long sections on the mormon uprising in harry turtledove s alternative history novels there are at least two sides to a war you know hooray gold plated what unsold steaks as in give the entire government over to the democrats with clinton in the white house not sure that s worth celebrating he ll deserve his own pyramid burial chamber if he keeps cankles from being potus i don t care how dumb or whatever anyone thinks trump is there s no way he can ever match the evil of cankles no matter what he does she s the vile spawn of satan in case there s anyone here who s not convinced of that yet they will be before her first term is up there s no way he can ever match the evil of cankles no matter what he does i don t think it s likely but it s certainly within his capabilities my co worker s step sister makes 97 hourly on the laptop she has been out of work for six months but last month her paycheck was 14100 just working on the laptop for a few hours go this website and click to tech tab to start your work http tinyurl com hhwe4zl i call on mcmullin and johnson to drop out and throw their support behind giant meteor robot nixon freshly grabbed pussy abradolf lincler a great public servant can we kick weld off the ticket and put mcmullin in his place that d be great if the lp could take utah you had me at kick weld off the ticket egg mcmuffin oh hell no kang we was freshly grabbed pussy thief oh damn am i guilty of post appropriation or maybe thought appropriation or idea appropriation so much for avoiding a title ix infraction i m gonna grab your pussy so hard me it s depressing to get only one vote every election harambe what are these mormon bitches worried about their magic underwear protects them from any pussy grabbing trump might want to exert there their magic underwear protects them from any pussy grabbing trump might want to exert there that s not how the magic underwear works that would be ridiculous of course it s not that garment it s the carbon fiber chastity belts metal was too heavy and prone to rust i can t speak for most mormons but certainly the fact that trump isn t exactly a paragon of virtue has always bothered a lot of us as for myself a so called anarcho capitalist conservative libertarian i ll vote republican because they are the only viable party pretending to support the constitution and liberty if only the libertarian party would get it s act together latter day saint i decided before trump secured the nomination that i simply couldn t bring myself to vote for a new york liberal democrat for president which rules out both the republican and the democrat nominees i also have reservations with voting for a libertarian with questionable libertarian credentials so i m currently waffling between johnson and mcmullen but there s no way in heck i m voting for trump so if i understand the math properly you re saying that 74 of the voters in utah are voting against hillary clinton why is utah so much smarter than the rest of the country is it because they re mormon more men i ll take a government dominated by religiously absurd outsiders who are obsessed with self sufficiency over california s progressives any day hell this country was founded by religiously absurd outsiders who were obsessed with self sufficiency buying cold beer to go is a pain in the ass in utah and i doubt they ll legalize marijuana unlike all the states around them but other than that you re free to be stupid and ride around without a helmet you can buy and carry a gun and the government isn t about to give you any trouble with that i broke down on the highway in utah over the summer on my bike looking like i d been three days on the road with a bandana tied around my head and four different people stopped to see if i needed help in an hour nice people mormon people all that and 74 of them are voting against hillary clinton too i bet half of the people voting for her are just pissed off at their mormon neighbors for making it so hard to buy cold beer to go i was just there for vacation and i agree with pretty much everything you said also 4 beer is actually pretty nice don t have to worry about waking up with a hangover if you can t get a hangover off 4 beer you re just not slamming them fast enough and you can get beer stronger than 4 there at state liquor stores iirc at the brewery itself or drive over the border to wyoming and stock up they sell the good stuff too it s just that they won t sell it cold i was surprised at how good some of it was i think my all around favorite beer is cutthroat http www uintabrewing com products cutthroat it s only 4 because it s made for the utah market they don t sell it outside of utah the other major ones out of utah are devastator and polygamy polygamy s byline is take some home to the wives devastator is 8 by volume https www wasatchbeers com beers aspx devastator has a burning ram crashing over a mormon tabernacle the label reads if you re going to sin sin big with 8 alc vol and a creamy richness this brew has developed a serious cult following imagine that a cult following in utah lol polygamy was quite good didn t try devastator which makes no sense homebrewing is legal you can make your own rocket fuel if you need to evanston s economy depends on utah s liquor laws liquor laws and gambling laws evanston is like wendover but with more halliburton yokels but they re icky christian fundies with backward views on gays and abortion and therefore must be purged from polite society christian fundies well christian ish i don t know about fundie they keep changing their prophecy to keep up with societal developments historically christians have hated them more than anyone must be purged from polite society isn t that why utah is a thing except they have the most polite society of all the mormons of the 1850s were like the quakers of the 1650s yes i am profound i bet half of the people voting for her are just pissed off at their mormon neighbors for making it so hard to buy cold beer to go naah i lived in utah for four months about a quarter of utah being leftists sounds about right even more so in salt lake city a good friend of mine is a hardcore progressive naturally she works for one of the universities it s easy to be a progressive when there aren t any in power try living in california the reason progressives might not want to live in california why is california over taxed over regulated an expensive place to live with not much in the way of personal freedom bad schools a failing justice system etc etc etc it s because the place is overrun with progressives being a progressive in utah is soooooooooooooooo easy 15 per hour minmum wage doesn t make economic sense but it is social justice governor jerry brown about a quarter of utah being leftists sounds about right even more so in salt lake city and even higher in the avenues salt lake city elected a democrat roman catholic and gay woman and yet slc schools still outperform their blue state rivals at 1 4th the cost per pupil i wonder why salt lake city elected a democrat roman catholic and gay woman and yet slc schools still outperform their blue state rivals at 1 4th the cost per pupil i wonder why i m going to utah for work in a week my mission is to interrogate the natives i ll report back they are into missions so should work out for you utah has the best non resident concealed carry permit with reciprocal rights i strongly advocate that people pursue that license as a non resident interesting they ve always had it in for the us government brigham young actively prayed for destruction of the us government 1857 president james buchanan eager to find some way to distract attention from the issue of slavery finally sent an army into utah to suppress what the mormon s critics considered a full scale rebellion against federal authority oh and about the 19th amendment and women s votes 1869 young secured passage of women s suffrage in utah thereby increasing the number of mormon voters and diluting the political influence of non mormons whom the railroad brought into his domain hahahahah and utah goes to the spook don t vote for a third party candidate it won t make any difference in the long run and will only help trump or clinton win sarc if this prick hadn t jumped in johnson would stand a good chance of taking the state this was less about thumping trump and more about torpedoing the libertarian party mcmullin really grabbed the lp by the pussy mcmullin really grabbed the lp by the pussy johnson i understand the temptation to be hypocritical on that issue but that s what the trump and hillary people have been saying about johnson too well the lp has been around 40 years and the republicans have been around since the 1850s they say the same thing more choices is better unless you re the default choice i guess it s all about electing hitlery nobody cares about the libertarian party you do you stay up late thinking about the libertarian party it makes you soooooooo horny good thing siv got grabbed by the pussy kind of easy when your entire person is made out of pussy there s so much to work with in that comment of course johnson became pretty hard to elect in utah once he said but if you re going to convict me on my motivation for doing that now you re back to religious freedom i mean under the guise of religious freedom anybody can do anything back to mormonism why shouldn t somebody be able to shoot somebody else because their freedom of religion says that god has spoken to them and that they can shoot somebody dead the sort of tbm that can t vote for trump is going to have a heck of a time voting for him after that one and he showed his libertarian bonafides with this on the new mexico gay marriage photographer look here s the issue you ve narrowly defined this but if we allow for discrimination if we pass a law that allows for discrimination on the basis of religion literally we re gonna open up a can of worms when it come stop discrimination of all forms starting with muslims that didn t help him but the kind of people who wouldn t vote for a candidate over that are probably the same people for the most part who wouldn t vote for a pro choice candidate which is a matter of life and death to these voters so likely more important johnson is a libertarian get out http www businessinsider com et 2016 10 hsbc s technical analysis team has thrown up the ultimate warning signal in a note to clients released wednesday murray gunn the head of technical analysis for hsbc said he had become on red alert for an imminent sell off in stocks given the price action over the past few weeks gunn uses a type of technical analysis called the elliott wave principle which tracks alternating patterns in the stock market to discern investors behavior and possible next moves in late september gunn said the stock market s moves looked eerily similar to those just before the 1987 stock market crash citi s tom fitzpatrick also highlighted the market s similarities to the 1987 crash just a few days ago on september 30 gunn said stocks were under an orange alert as they looked to him as if they had topped out and now given the 200 point decline for the dow on tuesday gunn thinks the drop is here if this is true i think the country will suddenly have something more interesting to talk about than grabbing pussy shit what worries me about that is that it isn t infowars or zerohedge saying it it is business insider and they are not relying on some crank who has been predicting a black swan event for the last 20 years it is the head of analysis for a very big and important bank he may not be right but he sure as hell should be taken seriously everybody was screaming about db s 14b fine when the real news was that they were carrying 50t of derivatives on their books 50 fucking trillion one bank i don t care if you re cross betting or not that can wipe out your cash reserves instantaneously if the market moves at all sideways the government has done nothing since the last crash except try and recreate the factors that caused it tarp and dodd frank did nothing except further consolidate banks socialize risk and make the effects of a crash more catastrophic and unlike 2008 there is no more cushion left in the economy for printing money to finance saving their asses when a crash does happen and it will eventually we will have the reckoning that we put off in 01 and again in 08 and it is going to be a nightmare i certainly underestimated the fed s capability to inflate the bubble again at this point yellen is openly talking about buying stocks and corporate bonds it s out of control yep i m not at all surprised that almost no one paid attention but it s still upsetting business insider is a joke you really rely on them for financial information wow just wow this is actually one of the bright spots if a potentially catastrophic economic downturn could ever be termed as one of a hillary presidency since the end of ww2 recessions have happened about every 7 10 years we re right in the window for one to take place and whoever is in charge during the next four years is going to get plastered in 2020 this is probably why the gop establishment and neocons are lining up behind ryan right now they re assuming that once trump gets beat next month they ll be able to position him or even run jeb or romney again as a presidential candidate for the next election and go back to bush style conservatism because the republican rank and file will be drooling over the prospect of beating hillary s ass regardless of who runs or how they govern through 2024 this on a side note maybe we will stop investing in endless foreign wars at that point it s ominous at the moment the ppt is gearing up i have not seen that plunge protection team acronym is a very long time 2009 perhaps i would have thought that with the supreme court on the line multiple undeclared wars a government speeding toward bankruptcy and the erosion of pretty much all of our constitutionally protected rights there would be more interesting things to talk about than grabbing by the pussy but that s just me i guess look letting trump get away with talking like that is why the brock turner s of the world exist if this is true i think the country will suddenly have something more interesting to talk about than grabbing pussy lol can t tell if serious don t stand there with your hand on your ass waiting for that to happen the country has shown over and over that they will ignore things like that in favor of pussy grabbing also there s a new rule on mmfs coming into play this friday their value will be allowed to float instead of being fixed at 1 1 since mmfs are a vehicle for short term cash parking this raises risk and will probably reduce liquidity liquidity reductions tend have nasty effects on stock prices looking at mcmullin s webpage there are several areas of overlap with libertarians tax code regulations debt and entitlements charter schools energy and environment federalism and presidential power 2a areas with partial overlap health care reform poverty trade and jobs areas with no overlap or on which libertarians can t agree military and foreign intervention abortion immigration i m not stupid enough to believe that people might vote for mcmullin because of his policy positions it s much more about not being trump but still belonging to a particular branch of conservative culture but if he does well in certain states then maybe it s time to revisit some old strategic alliances slds and normal caveats about campaign promises vs reality apply the thing about mcmullin is that unlike johnson and stein he is not an honest candidate he is not running to promote a party or set of ideas he is running for the single purpose of dividing the right and giving the election to hillary johnson and stein are trying to win or if not build as much of a base for their respective parties as possible their runs have nothing to do with trump or hillary the greens and the libertarians run candidates every year this guy is nothing like that there are plenty of good reasons to vote for stein or johnson if you agree with them and want the greens or lp to have more of a voice there is no reason to vote for mcmullin other than you want hillary to win and are too dishonest to admit it i m not voting for mcmullin and i haven t followed his campaign closely enough to know if he might actually believe any of what he says or if it really is just a way of giving the never trump crowd a place to go the latter seems pretty plausible but i wasn t advocating outreach to mcmullin rather i m suggesting that the places where he is doing well might be ripe for some moderate libertarian advances this could work particularly well at the state level since the areas of disagreement with libertarians are mostly at the federal level maybe a place like utah could be a launching ground for a particular wing of the lp i know you were not i just find his candidacy to be very dishonest if the people backing him want to start a third party they should do it instead they are trying to sabotage trump and elect hillary in hopes of skulking back into the gop and taking over it is really greaseball shit if you ask me this could work particularly well at the state level since the areas of disagreement with libertarians are mostly at the federal level maybe a place like utah could be a launching ground for a particular wing of the lp the problem with this is that the state parties are independent of the federal parties de jure at least de facto there s some dependency there of course so the state parties are already closer to their constituents than the federal parties leaving less room for an insurgent party to grow even if it might be a better fit for the state than the national version of that state s favored party true consider that mcmullin despite what he said when he announced his campaign on august 8 that he would sue states over onerous ballot access laws in states where he had little time to collect signatures mcmullin has not filed one lawsuits he had very strong potential lawsuits against wyoming and florida states which kept him off the ballot even though he satisfied the requirements mcmullin and the people who put him up as a candidate support the two party system they have no desire to make ballot access easier in any way that may help third parties and independent candidates they have no desire to start another party exactly they are just a false flag candidate hoping to divide the opposition to hillary and it is a direct assault on our democracy you can t have a democracy unless all of the candidates are honest and not just trolling operations set up to deceive people and help one of the other candidates you can t have a democracy unless all of the candidates are honest and not just trolling operations set up to deceive people and help one of the other candidates jeezuz john you can t be serious oh you know because you re a mormon who has fundamental disagreements with johnson s positions but think trump is a sleazebag but where does mcmullin stand on the all important issue of pussy grabbing i find most of these upper class conservative types to be prissy and generally sexually repressed and not in a good way generally sexually repressed and not in a good way is there any good way to be sexually repressed i mean in general not context specific such as while enrolled at a university periodically with bursts where you go crazy and fuck like there is no tomorrow if you are the pool boy do you look down your nose at them yes yes i do do you look down your nose at them yes yes i do if someone posted your photograph to reason would the commentariat reaction be needs more labels yes yes it would out of respect we would insist that some of the labels be misspelled my guess is he s all for it provided all the women involved are all currently his wives sorry but that joke was so easy i could not resist seems like a mormon progressive of the romney mold via a vis the reid but totally behind the power of government to help mankind transform itself yeah i honestly think the guy s got his priorities straight as far as platform goes you don t have to be a libertarian purist to do a lot of good things and his economic policies are definitely good things serious question could mormons get on board with hillary clinton if we thought of hillary as america s first wife would she have to be first wife i mean could she be second wife or even third i was going to say bottom bitch but i feared the only one who would understand that term would be heroic mulatto we need an expert on the appropriate term for the first bitch does anybody here got the contact info for a pimp named slickback bottom bitch i am that expert then i concede the floor i would still like to hear a pimp named slickback give us his thoughts regarding said bottom bitch i d settle for listening to zimos in a pinch he s the only one who watches south park here mcmullin is on just 11 compared to darrell castle s 24 and rocky de la feunte s 20 reason finally mentions darrell castle he ll always be mal to me ha ha i ve mentioned him before though haven t written anything of substance do you have recommendations requests do you have recommendations requests two fifth column episodes a week get some of the women of reason on as guests and let the commentariat rotate through on a 5 minute segment at the end of every episode where we explain why you guys were all wrong at least once a moon have a sugarfree reading get michael hihn to guest host once in a while put ac in charge of an episode once a year spend the rest of the year trying to decode the wisdom contained therein also get kmele to buy us all yeezys kmele is a very rich man he can hook us up easily especially since at least 91 of the commentariat is just tulpa if you re asking me how about an interview of castle and maybe looking at the livestream of the free and equal debate in colorado the commenters have provided plenty of tough questions for him i ve mentioned him before though haven t written anything of substance do you have recommendations requests heh now do you see the squalor we have to live in down here with the squirrels damn the squirrels don t even care if you re welch if you re asking me how about an interview of castle and maybe looking at the livestream of the free and equal debate in colorado best day ever my request please do not write anything about darrell castle thank you when i was going up the stair i met a man who wasn t there he wasn t there again today oh how i wish he d go away matt gets angry when i tweak your darrell castle loving nips eddie and i do not want to anger matt so i learned my lesson goodness i had no idea it was a bone of contention twixt you and matt welch that s kind of awkward i m sorry to be the occasion of unpleasantness if any write about billy murphy jr instead who knew that mormons are such hardcore libertarians this isn t that surprising considering tump lost badly in the primary there say what you will about utah it s nothing if not consistent people who read up on their culture outside of the church fundamentalists generally are it s the evangelicals that want to use the government to impose their will on the rest of us mormons were driven out of new york and missouri in 1859 the federal government invaded and occupied utah especially salt lake city like we invaded and occupied iraq they fought a war against mormons basically the federal government only called a truce when they agreed that the governor wouldn t be a mormon ultimately that s why if you go around southern utah you ll find dixie state university in st george the dixie national forest you ll find them selling confederate flags in the gas stations still anyway yeah being historically persecuted for your religious beliefs makes people distrustful of the federal government and if that weren t enough there s all the end times stuff in the bible mormons tell their members to have at least three months of food on hand at all times many of them store a year s worth of food ain t nothing wrong with being distrustful of government i disagree mormons were perhaps like that a century ago now they just want to be accepted by the mainstream there s an old palaeocon strain of mormon and you see it from time to time in mike lee perhaps but i d say hatch reid and romney are pretty much progressives i don t think that s typical at all reid is from nevada anyway and romney came to power in massachusetts hatch might be more typical but anyway i m not saying they re exactly libertarian i m saying fundamentalists tend to be more doctrinaire in their suspicion of the federal government and its power evangelicals are by definition less doctrinaire it s about feels for them they oppose gay marriage for the same reasons they sing and sway their arms in the air harry reid is a mormon convert his wife made him do it romney of today is like reed smoot of yesterday if you want to libertarianish mormon think jeff flake remember he went to cuba so he converted to progressivism i could care less the pathway i don t recall the last time evangelicals or any religious denomination tried to impose anything through government it s a good fairy tale though and an excellent distraction while progressives very much are imposing their own values on others watch out there s an evangelical behind you that isn t checking his privilege progressives are small e evangelicals yes they are that s where they came from that s the origin of the whole feelings over principle aspect too nowadays they re just on a godless crusade well other than trying to use the government to discriminate against people because they re gay trying to use the government to stop women from aborting fetuses trying to use government schools for prayer and to teach intelligent design in public schools i can hardly think of anything evangelicals have done to try to impose their will on the rest of the american people unless you want to include using the fcc to stop people from watching what they want on television and using the government to stop researchers from doing stem cell research and a myriad of other things i ve even seen splits on vouchers between evangelicals and fundamentalists evangelicals will usually say government money for evangelical schools that s great the fundamentalists often question if we take money from the government does that mean they ll have a say in what we do discriminate against people because they re gay last i checked there was universal agreement about not allowing gay marriage until a few years ago do you think the president is a secret evangelical when he opposed it too trying to use the government to stop women from aborting fetuses doesn t the libertarian party not even take an issue on this do you think they re secret evangelicals too trying to use government schools for prayer and to teach intelligent design in public schools last i checked school prayers was left to local governments until the 1960 s schools should totally be under local control unless of course the local government is run by gasp christians your last point on vouchers is beyond ridiculous the only people i have ever seen oppose vouchers are progressives but keep living in your fantasy you have a lot of cocktail invitations coming your way last i checked there was universal agreement about not allowing gay marriage until a few years ago i m not sure what this is supposed to mean are you saying that because democrats no longer agree with evangelicals on that issue that means evangelicals don t want to use the government to discriminate against gay people no matter how you slice it evangelicals want to use the government to impose their values on other americans it is what it is what you re doing here just looks like a no true scotsman fallacy trainwreck in slow motion or maybe you re trying to say that we re all scotsman doesn t the libertarian party not even take an issue on this do you think they re secret evangelicals too there are legitimate divisions in the lp on this issue those who oppose abortion do so on libertarian grounds that means they re aren t trying to impose their religious beliefs on other people insofar as evangelicals oppose abortion on that basis they aren t trying to impose their religion on other people very few evangelicals are many any such distinction they aren t supporting prayer in public schools for non religiouis reasons either your last point on vouchers is beyond ridiculous the only people i have ever seen oppose vouchers are progressives i didn t say that fundamentalists necessarily oppose vouchers as a program i said they question whether they should accept them i ve seen them do it with my own eyes fundamentalists are wary of letting the government have sway over them on principle evangelicals typically don t have any problem with the government s power per se they just don t want that power to be used against them they think using the government s power to impose their will on other people is a good thing that s what many evangelical voters mean when they call themselves evangelical voters so if someone support something for religious reasons that is terrible should we police people s minds what laws are the religious imposing i have yet to hear of one i understand that you don t like religious people and that probably explains why johnson is not winning in utah so if someone support something for religious reasons that is terrible yes that s exactly what i said either that or i said that when evangelicals try to use the government to impose their religious beliefs on other people they re trying to use the government to impose their religious beliefs on other people it s one of the two p s i also suggested that when some libertarians are trying to protect the rights of a fetus from being violated that it s different certainly not trying to use the government to impose your religious beliefs on other people isn t exactly like actively trying to use the government to impose your religious beliefs on other people is it i understand that you don t like religious people and that probably explains why johnson is not winning in utah you don t know anything about what i think of religious people you know i think evangelicals typically want to use the government to impose their beliefs on the rest of society and that fundamentalists tend to be wary of government last i checked there was universal agreement about not allowing gay marriage until a few years ago do you think the president is a secret evangelical when he opposed it too the notion that the fight over gay rights was limited to gay marriage historically is revisionist nonsense check polls on whether or not people think homosexuality should be legal even today there s a large chunk of the population who thinks it shouldn t be and the numbers were even worse 5 10 20 or 30 years ago and that s the general population what do you think the numbers look like for just evangelicals i guess you ve never heard of mike huckabee two years of food they also have their own private welfare system so they don t have to rely on government which is worth of supporting even if you are not mormon and they do help non mormons they were in louisiana to help katrina victims before the federal government or the state government or any private organization two years not three months utahns utes utahnians utahnites which one are they utahneers according to the mass wild guessing that is wikipedia the demonym for them is either utahn or utahan both of which sound very very wrong as opposed to what michigander the correct noun is utahn there is no such word as utahan and if you are from wyoming the correct noun is ubangies romulans actually their secret leader is mittens king of the romulans duh gosh darn real frickin americans watch your language gos darn authentic frickin americans oh my heck now that s just ignorant the young ones are called ute yoots yutes randy vataha loosers for not supporting trump hard enough if you are from neighboring wyoming you call them ubangies if you are from neighboring wyoming you call them ubangies i know i m late to this party and no one will probably read this but many of us prefer the appellation utahrd i forgot to mention i live here in utah that s actually kind of cool i hope he wins i guess trump will easily win utah i think you re wrong mormons are no different than most religious conservatives and identity is extremely important if for example orrin hatch or mike lee were found to cheat on his wife he might as well resign but of course mormons don t control utah so i guess you re right right just like he s going to win the presidency i think there is a strong chance of electoral vote shenanagans if it is not clear that someone got 270 electoral votes on election night i would not be surprised if mcmullin s backers have not already convinced some republican electors to be faithless electors and cast their electoral votes for mcmullin or possibly someone else in states where it looks like trump will win the popular vote unlike jurors in a trial there is no prohibition to talking to presidential electors about how they might vote and try to get them to change their vote if no candidate gets the 270 electoral votes those few votes mcmullin or someone else gets will be powerful bargaining chips i would not be surprised if the mcmullin backers are trying to get at least 6 faithless electors just in case mcmullin does not win utah and gary johnson does pull it off and get nm s 5 electoral votes that way mcmullin backers can deny gary the third place in terms of electoral votes which ensures gary cannot be considered as a potential presidential pick if the presidential selection winds up going to the house of reps excellent i think hrc will pass 270 with some breathing room so it likely won t matter i suspect you re right should evan mcmullin really be distracting utah voters from gary johnson gary stoned out of his aleppo johnson in no alcohol tobacco or caffiene land s caffiene coffee tea pedant park city utah where do you go skiing gentile the utahns must be baffled not having a clear socon choice for the first time in what seems like living memory do you think ubangies are social conservatives because the born agains don t johnson was never going to win utah they didn t like trump because of his muslim ban and they don t care for johnson because of his complete disregard for aspects of the 1st amendment and america s tradition of religious accommodation you tend to appreciate religious tolerance when your history is littered with literally being butchered throughout half of the country i don t understand why johnson is focusing all his efforts in utah where he is in fourth place rather than in new mexico where he is in second place other than the obvious fact that johnson weld have decided to be junior partners to the democrats winning new mexico might actually throw the election to congress but i don t think johnson actually wants to win anything they also take issue with his love for smoking the pots i believe not to mention abortion people here will point to johnson s stance on accommodation laws because it s at odds with libertarian orthodoxy and i m not saying it s not hurting him at all there but most people for whom that is a dealbreaker will also consider a pro choice stance to be a dealbreaker that s a life and death matter for most of them and thus much more important and the wrong brand of undies the book of mormon demands prohibition and mark twain was curious to know more about their beverage monopoly but at least they re american but this conservative only comes in here to make snide remarks and take cheap shots at all things libertarian they are favored to get the bloody snot beat out of them by the pro choice party at 3 to 1 odds so it s easy to see they d be as desperate as republicans running against truman by now where did you get that johnson is in second in new mexico i also don t think he s focusing all his efforts on utah also they were focusing on utah before mcmullin entered the race largely because trump is uniquely unpopular there for such a red state you re right he is 4 back from trump in new mexico that s still a hell of a lot closer than he is in utah one poll had him 4 back but in others he s been further behind and even in that poll he was about as far behind clinton as he is behind clinton and trump in this poll i think new mexico is one of his top target states i think utah was tempting because trump is a lot more unpopular there for a republican than clinton is in new mexico for a democrat and clinton has a low ceiling there because it s a very red state i think that mcmuffin guy is just running or pretending to run just to draw some never trumpers away from gayjay i am making 89 hour working from home i never thought that it was legitimate but my best friend is earning 10 thousand a month by working online that was really surprising for me she recommended me to try it just try it out on the following website http www netnote70 com as a utah mormon i really cant stand mcmullens supporters flaunting his religious ties as a reason to vote fir him but right now all i care about is keeping utahs votes from going red or blue why doesn t this tool just endorse hillary like his fellow neocons he might as well the idea is to use his religious identity to carve off potential trump voters if he wasn t running enough mormons would probably hold their noses and vote for him to take the state even with the pussy tape out there because i guarantee a lot of mormons for all their pretensions about sexual purity know damn well that many of them aren t exactly sin free on that front themselves mcmullin gives them a church tied excuse to pretend they re changing their vote for righteous reasons and provides them an out from voting for trump or johnson who they don t really like but can stomach more than hillary how do you get a mormon housewife into the shower grease her hips grease the shower doorframe then throw in a twinkie mormons are wealthy and well informed as mystics go mitt was clearly willing to resort to sac bombardments within the us if that would produce a ban on abortion and stricter enforcement of victimless crime laws to raise the resale price of confiscated dope the hypothesis that come to mind is that those worthies simply do not believe trump would nuke denver or nyc over pot or send federal troops into the capitol to change the first three words of the 14th amendment bryce even though samuel s story is unbelievable on tuesday i bought a great peugeot 205 gti after making
