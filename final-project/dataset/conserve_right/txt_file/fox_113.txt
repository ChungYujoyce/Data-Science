roberts fox news host i m john roberts in for chris wallace while president trump fights to fulfill a major campaign promise repealing and replacing obamacare the administration scored victories this week on immigration and upholding the travel ban begin videotape jeff sessions u s secretary of state they aposve been reviewed ph so i think it was a great victory for the president donald trump president of the united states health care is working along very well we can have a big surprise with a great health care package roberts voice over we ll break down the president aposs agenda going forward with marc short president trump s director of legislative affairs it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive on camera then with a growing number of republican senators opposing the party s obamacare replacement plan the president is now considering an immediate repeal and replacement later sen ben sasse r nebraska every republican in the u s senate except for one has already voted for repeal in the past let aposs do that first sen rand paul r kentucky and now you have two bills boom you get it done in five minutes the president seems open and interested in the idea roberts voice over we ll discuss what congress can do to repeal obamacare and get a replacement passed with republican senator rand paul and democratic senator joe manchin senators paul and manchin only on fox news sunday plus the president shifts focus off of the agenda creating a media firestorm with several tweets attacking cable news hosts we ll ask our sunday panel if the president aposs tweets are hurting his agenda all right now on fox news sunday end videotape roberts and hello again from fox news in washington senate republicans have yet to bring their obamacare replacement to the floor for vote some suggesting separating repeal and replacement as two different bills well now a group of senators is calling on leader mcconnell to shorten or altogether cancel the upcoming august recess in order to make meaningful progress on several legislative issues including health care joining us now to discuss the administration aposs agenda president trump s director of legislative affairs marc short and we should point out that this is marc short s very first appearance on any sunday show so we are glad to have you here marc short white house legislative affairs director thanks for having me roberts you are the man who is tasked with being the foot soldier between the white house and congress in terms of getting the president s agenda through where are we really with health care short look john we re getting close the american people know that obamacare is failing they know that insurance rates have continued to skyrocket they know that insurers are fleeing markets and last year alone 83 insurers have left the market people know that this is a dramatic situation roberts so how short it aposs a crisis where we are is the president this weekend is continuing to make calls to members to try to get the senate package across the finish line we believe that our package will help to lower premium cost help provide better quality care for patients and returns the relationship between the patient and his or her doctor without the government being in the middle roberts so when you say we re getting how close are you short well look we ve gone through a long process in the house and got it completed and passed in the house we now are in the senate where there s been obviously a lot of procedural delays in this process we are at the point of scoring two separate bills throughout the course of this recess this week so we hope that we come back the week after recess we ll have a vote roberts let s talk about these two bills because you mentioned this to me earlier in the week you ve got two different bills variations on the same theme that are going to go to congressional budget office for scoring what s in those bills short well so what s in the bill is that it will help to get rid of the individual mandate it will get rid of taxes to make this easier on the american people one thing that raises rates so much john that s really less understood in america is when you aposre on individual exchanges the mandates the federal government puts on are so ridiculous that men are forced to carry coverage for mammograms women are forced to carry coverage for prostate issues it aposs absurd and the american people know this we re going to get rid of many of those regulations and mandates to lower cost roberts what aposs the difference between the two bills that are going to go inaudible short one has an amendment that s called the consumer freedom act that senator cruz and senator lee have offered that will help continue to reduce those regulations and one is being scored without but let aposs talk about the cbo scoring for a second because cbo scoring has indicated when they initially scored obamacare that 25 million people will be on the obamacare exchanges in fact there are only 10 million so when the press reports that 22 million people are going to lose coverage it aposs a ridiculous number of that 22 million seven million roberts but the press has only reported what the cbo says short they reported what cbo says but the cbo credibility should be certainly should be questioned at this point seven million of those people are people that don apost exist they re people that is based upon a baseline that cbo put out in 2014 even though the actual number is way down here there aposs another 7 million people they say will choose to leave the market that they say are losing insurance that aposs not losing that aposs choosing roberts and yet short and take another 4 million people in medicaid and they say that aposs 4 million people who get medicaid today will choose if they don apost have a mandate to leave that aposs 18 million people right there john roberts and yet you keep on submitting these bills to cbo for scoring because i know that s the process but let me ask you about this this idea to repeal obamacare and then replace it at a later date this is something the president even suggested ben sasse of nebraska and rand paul of kentucky are both suggesting it will that even fly because leader mcconnell is saying thanks but no thanks short well look john just in december of 2015 49 current senators as ben sasse has told you 49 of the senators supported repeal and if provided roberts because they knew it would never become law short well i think that aposs a pretty tough messaging to go back to your constituents and say i actually voted for it because i knew it wouldn t become law i think they are pretty committed to knowing how much obamacare is failing the last 15 or 18 months it aposs only gotten worse premiums have only gotten higher in nevada alone two more insurers pulled out this week so now in 18 counties in nevada 14 have no insurer next year it aposs a true crisis and we need to do something about it roberts yet dean heller is saying no way i m signing on this bill short well you know look i think dean heller voted for that repeal effort and the way that we look at is to say if the replacement part is too difficult for pulpits to come together then let aposs go back and take care of the first step in repeal and even those 49 there aposs another member todd young from indiana who when he was in the house voted for the bill too so you have 50 members on record having voted for that recently so that aposs an option and then at that point if you aposve repeal it you can come back with a replacement effort that could be more bipartisan roberts are you concerned though that if you did do it in two pieces you did replace first then you did replacement later that you might end up with repeal and never get around to replacing it short look john we stated in our preferences is to pass the bill the senate has right now that s what we think needs to be done we think that help solve many of the problems americans are facing and there are other legislative vehicles going on at the same time just last week the house passed med now which helps to limit the amount of lawsuits so it helps us to actually lower premiums so there aposs actions going on this is not a one size fits all roberts senator schumer is saying hey come work with us listen to what he said earlier in the week begin video clip sen chuck schumer d ny minority leader i challenge them again invite all of us to blair house the first day we get back from recess if you think we re not serious try us democrats are ready to turn the page of health care when will my republican friends realize it aposs time for them to do the same end video clip roberts marc the president says over and over again that the democrats are nothing but obstructionists we re not going to get a single democratic vote to repeal and replace obamacare there aposs the offer from the senate majority leader short john the senate the president is absolutely right roberts the senate minority leader right short the president is absolutely right they have been obstructionists we ve heard from senators who have said look we know the markets are collapsing we know people are losing insurance it aposs devastating our state i can apost be with you on repeal because that was one of president obama aposs signature accomplishments but we can be with you on replace so if this is the route we go then there aposs that opportunity but it aposs quite just ingenuous i think for senator schumer to talk about getting together when today right now today we had 49 members of our folks that we put up for senate confirmation approved at the same point in obama aposs administration on july 1st he had 179 we have one quarter what senator schumer has often said rather disingenuously is to say it s because we are not getting nominees we have 133 nominees sitting in front of the senate right now waiting to get hearings in order so they can get confirmation so senator schumer might talk about bipartisanship but he has no interest in bipartisanship whatsoever roberts so back to the republicans so we ve got sasse and we ve got rand who are pushing this idea of repeal first replace later yet at the same time you got senator cruz of texas and senator lee of utah who are saying well we aposve got some other ideas and they are trying to process forward are you worried that they ll push it so far to the right that you aposre going to lose a lot of those moderates that you need to have short no not at all we support senator cruz and senator lee s efforts this is similar to efforts that transpired in the house and we think it aposs perfectly appropriate his amendment and so we hope it aposs part of the process and bringing everybody together roberts tax reform the president has been many many times that you need to do health care first so you get a bigger pot of money for tax reform the treasury secretary steve mnuchin says no we can probably do tax reform without doing obamacare reform first which is it and what aposs the timetable for this short john we looked at them both this year that s the bottom line we plan to get health care completed in the summer we looked to move to tax reform in the fall we look to complete it before the end of the year roberts and do you need to do health care reform first short we need to do both john the american people are getting crushed by the obamacare taxes and we need tax reform in this country because we need to get the economy growing again it has suffered for far too long and dismal growth ever since the recession in 2008 2009 what will provide growth is tax relief and we re going to get to it this year roberts one of the big issues is whether or not you do tax reform that s deficit neutral so that after 10 years it can become permanent or whether it aposs more important to do tax cuts first so which part of that is more important deficit neutral or getting the tax cuts short what s most important is get the economy growing so people get back to work roberts so that means tax cuts short that in our mind that means tax relief but there aposs also an idea that senator toomey has put out that suggests that the budget window can be moved from 10 years to 20 years which i think is an attractive option to allow us to do that but we are focused on getting americans back to work and john that aposs why unemployment today because of the many regulatory relief that this president provided it aposs down to 4 3 percent the lowest it aposs been in 16 years roberts i want to ask about the president s tweets because it aposs not necessarily in your wheel house but it does kind of crossed into your area because you ve got have to deal with all those folks on capitol hill who very often are rolling their eyes over what the president tweets and have said mitch mcconnell has said he aposs not particularly fond of it we saw with susan collins and others said about the president s tweet regarding mika brzezinski does he make your job more difficult with what he does short look john i don apost recall during the presidential campaign many members in congress being excited by the president s tweets and he won the campaign congressional approval rating is about 11 percent or 12 percent right now the president knows that he needs to get around the mainstream media to get his story out and part of that story is actually what we aposve accomplished on capitol hill this is the first administration to get a supreme court justice confirmed in the first 100 days since 1881 he signed 42 bills into law to date fourteen of those under congressional review act helped to roll back the burdensome obama regulation roberts so you re saying it s not a problem short it actually helps to now the cra repealing much of that legislation has enabled the economy to save 18 billion in compliance cost we just passed the v a accountability act the president signed and delivered on yet another promise to the american people he signed the omnibus bill that begin to rebuild the military and to build the border wall roberts so despite diverting from his agenda or so it would seem at least in the public view from time to time you aposre still getting done what you need to get done short we re getting done what we need to get done in record pace and the american the president is focused on returning jobs to the american people roberts there s one other thing i want to ask you quickly before we run out of time here and again this isn t in your wheelhouse but it does cross over to some degree this election the commission the presidential commission on election integrity that the president has set up secretaries of state of at least 27 states have said we re not going to give you the voter data that you want because we don apost think that this is a legitimate quest and to some degree some secretaries of state are suggesting that the president is just seeking to legitimize the claim that he made earlier this year about the fact that he lost the popular vote because of massive election fraud what do say to the secretaries of state including some republicans like delbert hosemann of mississippi short john there aposs nothing more important than ensuring the integrity of the american vote one man one vote the vice president of the united states is leading this commission it aposs a bipartisan commission this information is publicly available but wouldn apost be great if the secretary of state were willing to apply and be part of this to ensure the voter integrity of the united states i don apost think that aposs too much to ask roberts well mississippi secretary of state again delbert hosemann has invited you all to jump in the gulf of mexico which at this time of year wouldn apost be a bad idea laughter roberts marc short thanks for joining us today short john thanks for having me roberts and welcome to the sunday show short have a wonderful independence day roberts thank you you too coming up next senators rand paul and joe manchin on where things stand on health care reform in the senate commercial break roberts efforts to repeal and replace obamacare stalled this week when republicans delayed a vote on their plan putting it off until after their return from the fourth of july recess will they have enough votes though to pass the bill in a few minutes we ll be joined by democratic senator joe manchin of west virginia but first joining us now is republican senator rand paul who s among a group of republicans opposing the current bill and has some ideas on how to get repeal and replacement through senator paul good to talk to you this morning let me start off with a tweet that the presidents in earlier which was actually what convinced her to come on the july 4th weekend the president tweeting quote if republican senators are unable to pass what they aposre working on now they should immediately repeal and then replace at a later date the president appears to be listening to you you mentioned this to him on wednesday though your colleague from nebraska ben sasse is also claiming credit for this but senator mcconnell has said thanks but no thanks so will this idea even fly paul well here aposs the problem is i don apost think we aposre getting anywhere with the bill we have we are at an impasse every time you add more federal money more spending for the big government republicans it offends the conservatives so right now this bill which is not a repeal has become the kitchen sink we have nearly 200 billion in insurance bailouts does anybody remember us complaining that obamacare had insurance bailouts we now have codified nearly 200 billion there aposs 45 billion in here for opioids so i mean the bill is just being lit up like a christmas tree full of billion dollar ornaments and it aposs not repeal we don apost repeal the regulations we don apost repeal the subsidies now there are republicans getting so weak kneed they are saying oh we are afraid to repeal the taxes what happened to these people they all were for repealing obamacare now there aposs virtually no one left roberts the president stressed the need earlier this year senator paul to do this simultaneously because there aposs a concern about the continuity of coverage let aposs listen to how the president put it in the press conference in trump tower begin video clip trump it will be repealed and replaced it will be essentially simultaneously it will be various segments you understand but will most likely be on the same day or the same week but probably the same day could be the same hour end video clip roberts he was stressing there senator paul that you ve got to do this if not simultaneously very close together so that you don apost have a bunch of people who end up without health insurance so what would your plans do to address that paul well and i agree when i say separate the bills i think they could still be done concurrently in fact i think the moderates won apost vote for repeal a clean repeal unless they have some other bill going on simultaneously ph so what i ve suggested is audio gap big government spending programs from the repeal let aposs do clean repeal like we promised and i think you can get 52 republicans for clean repeal you can have a simultaneous bill or a concurrent bill that they can call replace and that i think perhaps if it aposs big spending they could probably get democrats to go along with big spending i m not for that but i m saying i want repeal to work and the way you do it is you separate into two bills and you do it concurrently right now you are right senate leadership is not doing that senate leadership is loading the bill like a christmas tree with billion dollar ornaments bubbles you name it they re going to spend money like there aposs no tomorrow on the current bill and try to buy off support that aposs traditional washington but i m asking for something that s not traditional separate the bills roberts well let me ask you this question you just that you are not for spending so you are for repeal so if you do this separately you will vote for the repeal bill and there s no question about that but when it comes to the replacement part of it where is your vote going to go paul well see my idea of replacement has always been replace it with freedom replace it with choice competition expanded health savings accounts buying groups the association health plans that i ve been pushing across state lines where you join a buying group and get a lower price that aposs my idea of replacement so it aposs funny back in january i was pushing repeal and replace because i thought republicans believed in replacing it with the marketplace now i ve discovered that at least half of my senate republican colleagues think replacement means replacement with obamacare light more federal spending and more federal programs i m not for that but i am for repeal and replace i want to expand the amount of people to get insurance at a cheaper price but i would do it through freedom of choice i would do it through the marketplace buying groups across state lines and letting people save more money in hsas and i think the problem with republicans now if they have insufficient confidence in what made america great that aposs capitalism freedom of choice competition roberts as i mentioned your colleague from nebraska senator sasse has suggested that this was his idea as well he sent a letter to the president saying that if the senate does not have a bill by the 10th of july the let aposs go ahead and do the repeal and replace separately and let aposs work through the august recess in order to get this all done would you sign onto the idea of working through the august recess paul i aposd rather get it done even before that in fact i think you could do this in the next three weeks there are other bills out there that are sitting around that have bipartisan support separate repeal and replace audio gap if there are a big government spending programs that offend conservatives like myself put them on some other bill but the thing is is you can apost get conservative votes or you can get my vote audio gap this bill with a bunch of federal spending you know we are supposed to we have a five video gap roberts i m sorry we are having some trouble there with the signal senator paul hang on just a second i think we have you back go ahead and finish your thought there paul we have a 500 billion deficit and we re going to have a trillion dollars next year audio gap for loading up repeal with a lot of big government spending so i think if you want conservative support you split the bills i think you can get almost every member of our caucus to vote for a clean repeal if there is concurrent or simultaneous separate bill that includes some of the things that moderates want roberts and just before we leave we ve got about a minute left senator paul and i wanted to ask you about something you were there in arlington for that horrible shooting which prompted a call for many people in congress to improve the tone of the political discourse give more sense of civility you saw the tweets that the president sent out earlier today unapologetic for it what aposs your thinking on that whole thing about what the president tweeted and how that plays into these calls for greater civility in our political discourse paul i would approach it more generically and say that we d probably don apost need to question our adversaries motives so for example president obama i think wanted to help people more people get health care i think obamacare failed but i don apost question his motives or his goodness as a person in trying to do it in the same tone i think democrats that are saying thousands of people are going to die if republicans pass their health care plan that s so over the top and so goes to sort of painting people as mean spirited or as evil and then you get people who are so crazed by this and obsessed that they ll come to a baseball field and shoot people you know there is a problem and i think we need to both acknowledge we want the same things but we have to argue over which economic system works best does capitalism work best or socialism and let s have those arguments and those are valid arguments but i don apost think we need to question whether each of us believe in trying to fix the system and get more people health care roberts senator paul thanks so much for joining us and we wish her happy fourth of july appreciate you coming on paul thanks roberts as republican senators lose support for their current health care proposal moderates on both sides look for an opening to reach a bipartisan deal joining us now from charleston west virginia is democratic senator joe manchin senator thanks for coming on with us this morning let me start off by asking you do you believe that obamacare is broken and is in danger of collapse as the president so often says sen joe manchin d west virginia well first let aposs start out with happy birthday america 241 years young and still going strong so we ll start off with that john but i think it needs repair we aposve always said that i thought from day one you know the private markets aren t working and then on top of that we can do better through efficiencies by working and educating people that have gotten the expansion gotten health care for the first time and up until that point in time they were using health care basically at the emergency room so we need to show people and teach people and educate people how to use it effectively and efficiently so they don t abuse it and basically we can save an awful lot of money there we just need to work together we are americans we shouldn apost be just democrats or republicans this should be about our country and who we are as a people roberts i ve been told senator by folks who are i think pretty well in the loop that you would like to be a part of obamacare replacement but that you can apost sign on to repeal but how can you replace it if you don apost repeal it first manchin well i never said it repeal or replace i ve said repair you know they didn apost get it right from the beginning there are so many pieces of legislation we don apost get right from the beginning that aposs why we stay in session to keep fixing and making things better the only thing i m saying to president trump and i ve spoken to him many times and he aposs the president of all of america democrats and republicans independents those who voted for him those who voted against him he is our president and i want him to succeed i want him to know that there are democrats that want to work with him but right now they can t even repeal that they can t get 50 votes to repeal it because somebody is getting hurt more than what they aposre willing to sign onto then look at some of us work with us democrats who are willing to meet you in the middle who have always been willing to meet you in the middle i m the most centrist moderate person they re going to find in the senate that s willing to look down and sit down and work on anything in a more progressive manner that basically fixes the problem that we have i ll work with them roberts the president senator says he aposs convinced that there will be no democratic support for repeal and replacement of obamacare even if it makes the system much better than it is now let aposs listen to what he said earlier in the week in cedar rapids begin video clip trump if we went and got the single greatest health care plan in the history of the world we would not get one democrat vote because they are obstructionists they are obstructionists end video clip roberts you heard the president say it and repeat it he says democrats are obstructionists are you obstructionist senator manchin manchin i just i truly respectfully disagree with that statement because i think he knows that i m looking every way i can to work with them and work with this white house and work with this president my president and trying to make things better so i think that was a little over the top and i still am willing to sit down and work with this administration this president and my friends on the republican side and there aposs many more like me that will do the same roberts but senator you might be of a certain mindset but there aposs a lot of mistrust among the republicans in the senate manchin sure roberts who say that there aposs a hidden agenda here by the democrats listen to what senator john thune said about that the other day begin video clip sen john thune r south dakota if we have to negotiate with chuck schumer and the democrats we re going to be looking down the barrel of a single payer system because that aposs what they want to see happen end video clip roberts is that what the democratic senators want to see happen senator manchin is it one size fits all single payer system manchin john i m sure there aposs many democrats that feel that way and there might be some republicans who feel that way i don apost i want the market system to succeed you know if the product we don apost have the product in the markets not matching up we i agree i see that i want to sit down and find the product and the market and get more flexibility hold people accountable and responsible for how they use it if it s being given to them free there are so many things that we can sit down and agree on we have never been asked to get in the room if they aposre not talking to me if they are not saying hey joe what do you think you know then they re not really reaching out so susan collins and some of our dear friends we tried to sit down and meet i think they are determined on making a vote i would say if you don apost have the 50 votes you can get rid of the budget reconciliation they can get rid of this piece of legislation the repeal of obamacare or the affordable care act but when you start replacing it you re back to the process to where we have to work together that aposs why the senate is so much different than the house it aposs not just a simple majority of 51 that means 60 for cloture that means you re going to have to get bipartisan agreement start working with us now i m willing to sit down tonight roberts senator manchin let me move onto another topic if i could you have expressed great concerns about russia manchin sure roberts saying quote russia is not our ally not our friend to treat putin like an ally is wrong the white house announced last week that the president will have a bilateral meeting with vladimir putin at the upcoming g 20 summit in hamburg germany should the president meet with putin is it rewarding him to meet with him manchin oh i don apost think it aposs rewarding i think you should meet with anybody and everybody you can in the world we try to bring the world together but make no mistake the united states of america is the hope of the world if we don apost get it right there aposs nobody who aposs going to step in and take our place when he meets he s going to basically use his style and i respect that whatever that style is to make sure mr putin knows that america will not succeed we will not take a step backwards and we will not allow him to infiltrate and change who we are as a people get involved in our political process get involved in basically telling the people that elected officials are not done legitimately and he wants to be involved and change it through his propaganda machines we re not going to tolerate that and i m sure in the president aposs own way he will he will get that across to him ph i have hope in that roberts you know we saw during the president aposs first overseas trip that there was some skepticism by many european leaders who did not share his optimism about putin aposs policies and intentions where do you come down on that in comparison with the president manchin well i mean everyone has their style i think we are trying to second guess in how i might approach a problem or how one i might approach a challenge we are thinking well the president should follow suit he aposs got to find out what successful as long as we know it aposs about the greatest country that the world has ever known the united states of america we are americans he aposs not going as a republican president he aposs going as the president of all of the united states of america and the strength of who we are the people that we are the military the intelligence that we have the commitment that we have for freedom and human rights all of these things are so precious to us that aposs what he has to convey and i m sure that he will but also the strength of america is who we are as a people and he ll convey that also roberts yes one one quick question just before you go manchin sure roberts as you know kate s law passed the house it had the support of 24 democrats in the house there aposs some question as to whether or not it will pass the senate you have supported the idea in the past manchin sure roberts can kate s law pass the senate manchin i think it can i think we can get the votes we have to have eight eight democrats voting with our colleagues on the republican side hopefully we have those eight that are willing to stand up and and and look at this in the most i think a most protective way but a most respectful way and i think we ll get there roberts can you see any reason why people would vote against this manchin well everyone has i you know this is the most beautiful country i ve said this before if you were born in america you hit the jackpot if you came here and become a legitimate citizen a legalized citizen you ve hit the lottery roberts yes manchin we want to give that lottery hope and everybody buys that ticket they re still looking for that roberts yes manchin we ve just got to make sure that we protect ourselves and keep ourselves as safe as possible i understand that and i want to make sure that we find that balance but we re not going to tolerate people that are harboring people that aren apost here for the right reason and that aposs really what this is all about roberts senator manchin we ve got to run but thanks so much for joining us happy fourth of july to you manchin hey happy fourth to you happy birthday america roberts thank you so much up next we ll bring in our sunday group to get their take on where the senate goes with health care from here and reaction to president trump aposs big wins on immigration this week plus what would you like to ask the panel about the senate aposs plan to repeal and replace obamacare just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip roberts coming up the white house defends tweets the president made this week attacking cable news host begin video clip sarah huckabee sanders deputy white house press secretary the american people elected somebody who aposs tough who s smart and who s a fighter and that aposs donald trump end video clip roberts we ll ask our sunday panel if the president aposs recent tweets hurt his agenda next commercial break begin video clip sen mitch mcconnell r ky majority leader because we can all agree obamacare status quo is simply unsustainable and unacceptable we have to act and we are end video clip roberts that s senate majority leader mitch mcconnell this week defending the senate aposs push for repeal and replace it s time now for our sunday group kimberley strassel of the wall street journal is with us marie harf former state department spokeswoman gerald seib from the wall street journal and charles hurt is the opinion editor for the washington times we should point out that while you all were coming in the studio joe manchin was still on the line off camera he said he believes that the president should work together with democrats on health care and if he can apost get a deal that way then go ahead and do it unilaterally what do you think of that idea marie harf former state department spokesperson well i think that something that affects one sixth of our economy should be bipartisan and that aposs not a fantasy right now i think roberts but will democrats work with him harf it it depends on what it looks like roberts i mean inaudible harf well it depends on what it looks like if if you did what chuck schumer asked and said bring all these democrats in start back at the beginning here and not just push forward this repeal and replace that they have now i do think that you could get some democrats at the table i do roberts ys well manchin said that he would come to the table and he aposs probably the most moderate harf i believe joe manchin would yes roberts but i mean is schumer really interested in doing that charles hurt the washington times not to mention i we ve seen no evidence whatsoever that any other democrats would actually come in and operate negotiate in good faith and i and i honestly did i you know i was we were back there watching the clip that you played of schumer and that you can apost help but kind of laugh hearing schumer say that but i do think it aposs a smart negotiating tactic for for donald trump as someone who is not keen on any of these republican health care bills i d rather just the obamacare fail it aposs it s probably a smart negotiating tactic for him to say look if if republicans aren apost going to deal with me then i ll deal with democrats because obviously that will become that will be a something that aposs even worse than the republicans are coming up with roberts obviously this was a big topic on social media this week we ve got some questions in thebeesknees writes on twitter is it possible to split the bill in two as rand paul suggests or just pass a repeal now and replace later kimberly is it possible kimberley strassel the wall street journal it s a very bad idea look at when you listen roberts why is it a bad idea strassel well because what rand paul aposs interest is in here and some conservatives is simply being able to say that they passed a repeal bill because that aposs what they promised the american people but what we all know is that that would lead to another catastrophic turn in the market and he made very clear in that interview that you just had with him that he has no interest whatsoever of working on a replace bill and that would be the risk if mitch mcconnell went this way is yes you get repeal you get an even bigger mess and then you have no incentive whatsoever for any of the conservatives to come on board and pass a fix roberts because when it comes to spending rand paul said i m against increasing spending he wants to do it all through market driven practices strassel he aposs not interested in helping with this roberts but it the other question that we have gerald and i want to pull up here is from michael p mulhall how much political trouble are either the trump administration and or the gop in if the senate and house are unable to reform the aca obamacare gerald f seib the wall street journal well you know i think this is the question republicans are grappling with over the fourth of july recess is the political pain of doing nothing greater than the political pain of voting for something that aposs not terribly popular because that s really where they are right now roberts the president says that it s political gain if you do nothing because it will collapse in 2018 if you do well in the congressional races seib yes if right except that the question is who owns obamacare at this point do the democrats own it because they created it or do the republicans own it because they aposve been in charge for six months and you know i don apost know the answer to that question but they don apost either but i think that is really the on a political level not a policy level that aposs really where republicans are which is more painful to do nothing and be blamed for that or to vote for something that s not popular and know that you ll be attacked for having done that strassel look i think one thing that gets forgotten here is as gerry says some of this isn t popular some of it is hugely popular look if you break it out there are three big aspects of this bill the question is are you going to pass something that has real pro growth tax reform in it you have something that s going to be the first major entitlement reform that we have ever experienced since the great society fixing a program modeling it on very successful reforms that we ve had out in the states and fixing the individual insurance market so the harf these positions don t easier with time i mean the closer we get to the midterms i think it will be a hard case to make to the voters that with eight years to come up with a replacement they haven apost been able to do it let aposs pass repeal and we just need to give them a little more time i don apost think that that aposs believable to a lot of people and could throw the markets which are already in turmoil into even greater uncertainty which is part of the problem roberts the insurance industry agrees with you on that that the ok so the health care scenario is still up in the air but the the president did get a couple of victories earlier this week when the partial immigration ban at least was re implemented let aposs listen to what the president said about that last night at the kennedy center begin video clip trump we cannot allow this terrorism and extremism to spread in our country or to find sanctuary on our shores or in our cities we want to make sure that anyone who seeks to join our country shares our values and has the capacity to love our people end video clip roberts charles was this a victory for the president at last partially because the supreme court will take up this case on a broader level in the fall hurt oh i think a monumental victory for him not only in a short term but also in the long term in a larger sense because this is what his campaign was largely about this is what kicked off his campaign this is what defined his campaign and it shocked everyone it shocked even republicans and he got accused of all sorts of things of being you know xenophobic and racist and all this kind of stuff and he plowed on through and wound up beating everybody and so yes i think it aposs a it s a huge victory for him roberts would you concede that harf i think it aposs a victory but here aposs my question the administration aposs rationale for this was that it was temporary and they needed 90 days or 120 days to put in new vetting procedures we re way past that and by the time the supreme court takes it up we ll be even further past that so i think the question is roberts but you could also say though that the president didn apost have the force of leverage of this immigration ban during that period to make these countries inaudible harf fine but that s the question we all need to ask that as this goes forward are you putting in place that new vetting or is this defacto becoming permanent that i think will be a problem strassel but this case had become about something much more than this travel order this has become about whether or not you were going to allow a he federal judiciary to usurp the powers of the president the separation of powers and of congress and this was a victory more than anything for the constitution roberts a couple of other things too gerry the president was running on and it passed the house where kate s law and then the sanctuary cities law the question is can those pass the senate i asked manchin he seems to think kate s law at least seib kate s law probably can i think there were 24 democrats that voted for that in the house and that aposs a sign i mean these days that s actual almost bipartisanship i think there were only three house democrats who voted for the sanctuary cities i don t think the sanctuary cities gets through the senate i think kate s law could and you know that would ultimately be a victory for the president but i think sanctuary cities is a long shot in the senate democrats have enough leverage roberts all right we ve got to leave it there but when we come back president trump takes the twitter continuing his battle with the media singling out the hosts of the msnbc morning show we ll bring back the panel to discuss the president aposs tweets and their impact commercial break begin video clip trump the dishonest media will never keep us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf of our great american people it will never happen end video clip roberts president trump last night continuing his assault on what he calls the dishonest media and we re back now with the panel the president also tweeting at length yesterday about his use of social media saying my use of social media is not presidential it aposs modern day presidential make america great again is it really modern day presidential or is it over the top hurt i m in the camp that believe it s modern day presidential in a way and i think a lot of times donald trump aposs detractors have you know confused they don apost like his style and they don apost like the way he looks they don apost like the the he doesn t like they don t like his style and so much of it is a modern sort of think that is appalling and people don apost you know maybe you don apost like it but the fact that he represents that and the fact that he is in that sort of inaudible doesn t i you know i think a lot of people get their anger at that confused with him roberts the president also tweeted last night he said quote the fake and fraudulent news media is working hard to convince republicans and others that i should not use social media but remember i won the 2016 election with interviews speeches and social media i had to beat fakenews and did we will continue to win gerry he aposs laying down a marker right there saying i aposm not stopping seib well no that aposs the message from last night i aposm not stopping but you know is it productive you know and it s not use of social media it s the tone of social media that s the issue and by the way there have been a whole series of things that went well for the administration in the last two weeks the veterans administration bill significant case law sanctuary cities we talked about a minute ago almost no attention paid to the fact that mosul basically returned to iraqi control isis is almost out there was almost no attention paid to any of those things largely because of this phenomenon we aposre talking about i why is that beneficial to the white house i think that s the question it s not use of social media strassel right seib it s use of social media to what end strassel right roberts one of these days i hope to ask the president what his cost benefit analysis is before he sends out these tweets or maybe he doesn t have one i m not sure but seib well but roberts but let aposs take a look at the one that really kind of ramped this whole thing up earlier this week when he was taking about the msnbc morning show hosts i heard poorly rated morning joe speaks badly of me don t watch anymore clearly he does then how come low i q crazy mika along with psycho joe came to mar a lago three nights in a row around new year s eve and insisted on joining me she was bleeding badly from a face lift i said no you would think after the hew ph and cry that that provoked that he would leave it alone but he came back yesterday and said crazy joe scarborough and dumb as a rock mika are not bad people but they aposre low rated show is dominated by their nbc bosses too bad strassel yes well it s sort of what gerry said is what are you using this for ok putting some attention on a media that is actually not doing a very good job in many ways of covering the trump administration is totally legitimate we ve had resignations at cnn we ve had retractions and corrections and i think that that is something worthwhile but if you re going to instead use it to just humiliate people i think that there is a confusion sometimes in the president aposs mind between he doesn apost want to fall into this category of bowing to politically correct society that aposs fine but that seems to suggest that you can apost both do that and have some measure of civility harf right strassel when you re talking about other people it is in fact actually possible to do both harf that s right strassel we do it right here on the stage right now harf and when you re president you should try and do both and when he s tweeted about cnn something like 435 times and about afghanistan 36 it aposs what gerry was saying there are real issues we are grappling with in this country we have men and women in uniform overseas dying fighting for our country and the president spends his time and energy on this i think it shows voters and world leaders that there aposs something about him whether it aposs the viciousness or the pettiness or the impulse control that he doesn apost seem to have that makes him them question has governing and that is a problem beyond you know whether we all like twitter or not roberts but the fact that during the campaign at least gerry that there wasn apost much of a filter between here and here or here and here was what his supporters loved about him seib well that s true and they still do and there aposs no doubt that the certain segment of the of the country that thinks yes it aposs about time somebody said all of these things but but you know there aposs a there s something here that aposs not new which is this the idea that white houses try to use whatever social media or newest media phenomena is available to go over the heads of the president it aposs not new i mean i ll date myself here i came to town when ronald reagan was president and they tried to make an art from out of going over the heads of the press so that aposs fine that s the way the game is played roberts yes seib that aposs not the issue and i think those things get confused roberts and there aposs no question too that the president is at war with certain aspects of the media one of those being cnn a couple of years ago he was on wrestlemania and he clotheslined vince mcmahon well he just tweeted a new video that he made of that watch this video clip roberts and there s the president beating up cnn instead of vince mcmahon hurt yes and i think i think a lot of the people that dislike donald trump the most probably don apost watch pro wrestling but a lot of roberts well it s all you were talking about when you came in here was this new tweet clever or not hurt yes but oh i think it yes i mean it s it aposs right down the middle it s it s hitting his base but but going back to the thing that that gerry said and i i i think that there is room for criticism here about the fact that he it is a distraction from his successes but this is what i think the frustrations that that trump and his supporters feel is how much coverage would he get for those successes strassel right hurt and because of that roberts why don t we find out harf right cross talk hurt but but history has showed that he that the media doesn apost give him credit for a lot of those successes roberts let me just jump in here for a second if you want to know how this all plays with his supporters take a look at this from the kennedy center last night begin video clip trump the fake media is trying to silence us but we will not let them because the people know the truth the fake media try to stop us from going to the white house but i m president and they re not end video clip roberts yes he got a lot of cheers for that so clearly he s got a lot of people on his side in this war against the media strassel look the only outfit out there that is got far lower approval rating than donald trump is in fact the media and so training come roberts yes he s at 40 we re at 36 strassel trading information training his inaudible is not necessarily a bad idea it s the manner and the method in which you do it and the words you use roberts one more quick word we ve got ten ten seconds left harf and why so we tolerate behavior in a president that we wouldn apost tolerate from small town mayors or ceos or our own families i just think maybe call me old fashioned here i think we should hold him to a higher standard roberts all right and this discussion no doubt will continue thanks panel we ll see you next sunday up next our power player of the week honoring america aposs fallen with 24 musical notes commercial break roberts it aposs become a tradition here that we profile a man who created his own special program to make every day at a memorial day for our fallen heroes once again here aposs chris wallace with our power player of the week begin videotape tom day bugles across america when you aposre playing it it aposs only 24 notes but it aposs so meaningful to that family chris wallace fox anchor voice over tom day is talking about playing taps at the funeral of military veterans and he should know he s the founder and president of an organization called bugles across america wallace on camera all told how many funerals have you done since you started bugles across america day two hundred thousand wallace really day in ten years right wallace voice over it started back in 2000 when congress gave every vet the right to a funeral with military honors including two uniformed officers to present a flag and play taps the problem was the military only had 500 bugler so they sent someone to play a recorded taps on a boombox or an electronic device inside a bugle tom day who played in the marines in the 50s didn apost like it day i call it stolen dignity that these veterans can apost get live taps when we are out there ready to perform live taps wallace so he started his organization recruiting 400 horn players within a year day now we have 6 270 horn players and we re doing 2 200 funerals a month wallace it aposs become quite an operation that day runs out of his basement near chicago families can go on his website to ask for a bugler a message is sent to every horn player within 100 miles of the funeral day gives away bugles and helps with uniforms while he gets support from foundations he runs a deficit every year wallace on camera how do you make up for the shortfall day i kind of make it up myself wallace 15 000 to 20 000 a year day probably ten you finished your last of the 24 notes you put the horn down and the flag has been presented then the family comes over the kisses the handshakes these families there is nothing no amount of money could ever buy the feeling that i get from the family once i ve finished the 24 notes wallace voice over with soldiers killed in iraq and afghanistan plus 1 800 veterans of world war ii dying every day there is a flood of military funerals day who is 69 says he wants to keep going until he dies then leave his organization in solid shape to carry on day i want every family to have live taps at that going away presentation of their veteran and it kind of tells the marine who are regarding the gates in heaven live taps we re going
