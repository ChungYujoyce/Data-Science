ion of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion there is no question about north korea s drive to achieve intercontinental ballistic missile capability the objective is clear to be capable of launching a pre emptive nuclear attack against the united states of course with pyongyang s multiple ballistic missile launches into the sea of japan it was not only a signal to japan but to the united states as well clearly such actions are destabilizing however what is more destabilizing is our failure over the past two decades to address this threat in any concrete manner further we should never forget that north korea is the off site laboratory for iran s nuclear weapons program for more than 25 years we have tried to negotiate with one of the world s leading state sponsors of terrorism and our reward is a nuclear missile armed north korea economic sanctions have been a complete failure primarily due to the support provided north korea by china russia and iran in the darkest days of the cold war we were always under the threat of a pre emptive intercontinental ballistic missile attack launched by the soviet union with the soviet union we believed we were dealing with a controlled rational leadership but with north korea s kim jong un we are faced with an unpredictable sociopath with a paranoid personality complicating matters is the fact that north korea s destabilizing actions are being carried out under the protective umbrella of china which like iran is using north korea as its proxy to further its political objective of achieving hegemony throughout the western pacific secretary of state rex tillerson s recent trip to the far east made it very clear that the obama policy of strategic patience is over and that all options are on the table china predictably replied that more talks should be conducted naturally the undercover holdover agents from the obama administration at the state department also favor non threatening economic sanctions and more non productive discussions top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots my response to the more talks crowd is that china and north korea must demonstrate they are serious about negotiations by reducing their nuclear missile threat for example pyongyang s kn 08 and kn 14 mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles which can target washington d c ride on 16 wheel transport erector launchers tels made in china these launchers were covertly made in china by the sanjiang special vehicle corp of the china aerospace science and industry corp casic surreptitiously shipped to north korea and revealed in an april 15 2012 pyongyang military parade therefore since china claims they want a denuclearized peninsula it must take back its tels as a precondition for any talks according to japanese reports there are eight tels recalling these tels is key since it is what gives north korea the mobility to launch a surprise nuclear attack against the united states regardless of what china agrees to we need to move ahead with our plans to protect the united states and our allies from the threat of an attack from north korea three years ago rick fisher and i discussed in a washington times op ed the possibility of creating an asian nato at that time we thought it was premature since many asian states preferred to cooperate militarily with the united states on a bilateral basis further long standing enmities between many countries prevented the building of a formal intra asian military alliance however with continued aggressive actions by china in both the east and south china seas plus the expanding nuclear threat from north korea this proposal should be revisited as a first step for countries willing to participate initial communication links could be established with our facilities on guam a small planning staff should also be established even prior to the establishment of a formal alliance japan could also send a very positive signal by modifying article nine of its constitution such a modification would authorize the establishment of a national defense force ndf and the prime minister would be its commander in chief such a change would permit the ndf to defend japan s sovereign territory from a foreign attack and would also facilitate japan s participation in an asian nato defensive alliance as well as other international peacekeeping operations such a move by japan would clearly raise the level of deterrence other actions we need to take on an expedited basis are as follows upgrade our totally inadequate anti ballistic missile abm system currently we have no capability against hypersonic maneuvering warheads fortunately there is a software that has been tested with an 90 percent plus kill effectiveness that needs to be installed now in all current abm systems including the aegis sm 6 system which would completely neutralize china s anti ship ballistic missile harden our electric grid against an electromagnetic pulse emp attack we cannot overlook the fact that north korea has two satellites kms 3 and kms 4 currently orbiting over the united states if these satellites are nuclear armed they could carry out an emp attack we must be ready to neutralize these satellites to restore strategic balance we need to reinstall tactical nuclear weapons on our deployed submarine forces in the western pacific it also must be made very clear that if north korea launches a nuclear attack the nation will no longer exist implementation of the above actions will not only send the appropriate message to our adversaries but reverse a long decline in our deterrent capability james a lyons a retired u s navy admiral was commander in chief of the u s pacific fleet
