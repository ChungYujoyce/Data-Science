tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn newsmaker interview jericho west bank the palestinians outspoken resistance to u s mediation in the middle east peace process is justified because president trump broke a promise two years ago to avoid any moves before announcing his blueprint that unfairly favored israel according to longtime chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat administration officials dispute the claim but the palestinian diplomat in an interview insisted that mr trump told him explicitly in a private meeting that the administration would not take any unilateral actions that may preempt or prejudge issues between us and the israelis see also trump pressures arabs to pay for peace in stealth build up to middle east deal of the century speaking at the palestinian negotiating office in jericho mr erekat said the president made the pledge in may 2017 over lunch at the white house he promised and said i ll give these negotiations 12 months mr erekat said why did you break the promise mr erekat asked rhetorically asserting that mr trump undermined the prospect for renewed israeli palestinian talks last year by abruptly moving the u s embassy to jerusalem and recognizing the contested city as israel s capital he also decried the administration s decisions to end decades of funding for the u n relief organization for palestinian refugees and to close the palestine liberation organization s office in washington mr erekat let out a dispirited moan when asked whether he is even remotely optimistic about the anticipated u s peace plan being formulated by jared kushner mr trump s son in law and senior adviser along with middle east envoy jason greenblatt he then launched into a story of how he asked the administration during mr trump s first year to set me up with the israelis but that his hope for an honest broker in washington dissolved when it became clear he was being ignored mr erekat 63 best known for his role as chief palestinian negotiator in the breakthrough 1993 oslo accords said tension with the white house spiked with the decision announced in late 2017 to relocate the u s embassy previous administrations had come in promising to take the step but held back for fear of its impact of the negotiations and on the lack of support from allies mr erekat said he warned trump administration officials including mr kushner repeatedly that the embassy move would spark a sharp palestinian reaction i looked jared in the face and i told him if you do this you will have disqualified yourself from any role in the peace process mark my words and this may be the last meeting you would ever have with any palestinian official mr erekat recounted he said the exchange occurred during a visit to washington in november 2017 during which mr kushner started shouting at me telling me that i don t understand what s going on in the region and the things around me i told him well then the best seat for me is to be a student teach me said mr erekat who recounted that mr kushner responded don t be sarcastic so i said to him don t make me sarcastic mr erekat said he replied i said to him do you know the real threat on arabs arabs do you know the real threat on israel israel do you know the real threat on iran iran said mr erekat he was shouting and i responded by telling him things that he did not like further and further despite u s wealth military might and diplomatic clout in the region mr erekat said he told mr kushner this will be the last meeting with any palestinian officials mark my words mr kushner flatly disputes the exchange ever happened this conversation did not occur obviously a senior white house official in mr kushner s office told the washington times it is completely untrue mr erekat stands by his account not only did it occur he said but it also soon fit a pattern of condescension that was followed by the shuttering of the washington plo office because in the u s government s words the plo has not taken steps to advance the start of direct and meaningful negotiations with israel to the contrary plo leadership has condemned a u s peace plan they have not yet seen and refused to engage with the u s government with respect to peace efforts and otherwise the administration said in a statement at the time again mr erekat said the facts show otherwise look in 2017 we held 37 meetings with president trump and his team he said in every single meeting i asked jared or should i say mr kushner and mr greenblatt to set me up with the israelis in direct bilateral negotiation in the end he argued at the time it s getting palestinians and israelis together to deliver the decisions required to make peace it s not you it s not europeans it s not the chinese u s officials argued that all the past approaches had failed and it was time to try something new mr erekat recounted but the point is that they said i refused to engage with the israelis well in every single meeting i requested them to set me up with the israelis unconditionally and they refused mr erekat said he warned that the trump white house has undermined the peace process by making israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu believe washington can deliver me by pressuring me twisting my arms by starving me by closing my schools by closing my hospitals the end result here is people like me are really not relevant in palestine anymore and the peace camp also no longer exists in israel he said that he added increases the odds of a security meltdown because the vacuum between palestinians and israelis is filled with blood washington s moves mr erekat said have only accelerated a growing hard liner shift in israeli politics against recognizing palestinians as worthy of rights or fair negotiations we re headed toward a deeper apartheid system than the one that existed in south africa he said there is no right and no left in israel there is a competition between who will implement apartheid in a way that the world will accept which is
