federal immigration detainers people like johnson put criminals and illegal aliens before the citizens of chicago and those are his values and frankly those values to me are a disgrace mr trump said i want eddie johnson to change his values and change them fast with his risk of impeachment rising the president also turned to actor jussie smollett of chicago who was accused last winter of staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself and blaming it on trump supporters mr smollett was indicted on multiple charges of disorderly conduct though the charges have since been dropped then you have the case of this wise guy jussie smollett who beat up himself the president said to uproarious laughter from the police chiefs and he said maga country did it that s a hate crime and a real big scam
