tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn minneapolis star tribune aug 16 regulators lawmakers should act quickly after illnesses linked to vaping minnesota s failure to raise the tobacco e cig age to 21 looks even more irresponsible top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the intense medical care required for four minnesota teenagers who developed severe lung illnesses linked to vaping is stunning among the interventions extensive hospital stays sometimes in the intensive care unit and sometimes requiring intubation to help the young patients breathe after discharge ongoing monitoring is needed to determine if the illness leaves lasting lung damage all of this in young people who should be in the prime of their lives and their health up to 50 cases of similar lung injuries have now been reported in e cig users across the nation with an alarming number in young adults health officials have stopped short of saying vaping which involves inhaling nicotine vapor from an electronic e cig device is the cause but they ve been unusually pointed in their remarks policymakers in minnesota and elsewhere are grossly negligent if they fail to note that directness and act upon it we have no leads pointing to a specific substance other than those that are associated with smoking or vaping dr david d gummin professor and chief of medical toxicology at the medical college of wisconsin said in an aug 14 new york times story in early august health officials in gummin s home state reported that 11 teens and young adults had required hospitalization for vaping associated lung injuries in addition to nicotine the vapor may contain other chemicals that irritate or damage lung tissue there are now four more confirmed cases in wisconsin with 15 additional illnesses in a broader age range under investigation there cases also have been reported in illinois and investigations are underway in new york indiana and california so far the number of hospitalizations is relatively small but that is of little comfort given vaping s embrace by adolescents and young adults former u s food and drug administration commissioner scott gottlieb rightly called e cig use in young people an epidemic from 2017 to 2018 there was a 78 increase in current e cigarette use among high school students and a 48 percent increase among middle school students gottlieb said in 2018 the widespread use leads to this disturbing deduction about vaping related illnesses this is just the beginning of adverse health reports said dr richard hurt a retired mayo clinic tobacco addiction expert in an interview with an editorial writer hurt also warned that there could be other damaging health effects that don t show up for years or even decades gottlieb merits praise for grasping vaping s risks far ahead of the curve he took serious steps to stem e cigs use in young people one key move banning e cig products such ones that produce candy or fruit flavored vapors in many retail settings unfortunately gottlieb resigned march 5 no permanent replacement has been named a situation that president donald trump needs to swiftly fix gottlieb s successor must be committed to carrying on his e cig campaign state lawmakers also need to act raising the tobacco and e cig purchase age from 18 to 21 would be a logical first response it s important to note that all four of the minnesota young people who became ill are teens moving the purchase age to 21 would protect older teens from getting hooked on nicotine and keep e cigs out of the hands of even younger users who might rely on friends to buy the products for them the minnesota legislature considered but failed to pass a measure bumping the purchase age to 21 that looks particularly irresponsible as these illnesses come to light the measure should be reintroduced and passed early next session giving lawmakers time to consider other consumer safeguards against a product whose serious risks are just starting to become clear st cloud times aug 17 reversing the tone of politics won t come from leaders the level of political rhetoric in the united states today is in the sewer and it s mostly our the citizenry s fault yes high ranking politicians at every level of government do on occasion lob verbal molotov cocktails out into the air we breathe yes the political parties twist talking points into memes with the most polarizing language and images imaginable until they outdo themselves next week yes the extreme right and left wing propaganda news sites and radio talk shows sometimes spread blatant lies to advance their agendas even if that agenda is simply to become highly rated stars in their own micro universes they do all of those things because they know those messages work and will be shared we fall for it spreading those messages far and wide and not to mention completely for free but we hold all of the power to do what the sensible middle and even the extremists say they want to have reasoned debate of the issues americans disagree on the fact that we now communicate largely by shouts jeers hats t shirts memes bumper stickers and expletive laden social media comments is rooted solely in our acceptance and participation because it s funny or made us feel powerful we the public started playing in the mud which means we can stop u s rep tom emmer r minnesota was well criticized for going light on his constituent outreach earlier in his term since changing his ways and scheduling more town halls he has commonly been met with crowds that apparently want to punish him with yelling finger pointing and jeers don t think we believe deference should come with the job of being an elected leader elected means we are the bosses but good bosses don t berate because they know it rarely works likewise when political arguments online become fact free volleys of orange clown and killary no one is really listening no one is being convinced we re just wallowing in muck that damages the collective conversation when a comedian poses with a prop severed head of the president or when a meme depicts that president as a hangman on the gallows with the caption i m ready for hillary we are getting our jollies from incitements to violence side note if the word snowflake or phrase he was asking for it just popped into your head you re part of the problem the message is simple if we want a better political climate we have to make it have a beef with an elected official write a letter to the editor or the lawmaker s office make a sign picket organize tell others about it without all caps a photo with words on it or hey maybe even vote or volunteer for a campaign to be clear we adamantly support the american right to disagree with any elected or appointed official even loudly even disruptively but when vitriol is the only tool on the workbench we can t build a staircase into the light so let s stop sharing that fact free meme don t buy that rope tree enemy some assembly required t shirt how about no name calling we could even stop casting the other side as evil because well mostly they re not let s think for ourselves then speak for ourselves in a way that could genuinely advance a point of view isn t that what all the yelling is about the free press of mankato aug 18 reckless plan to gut endangered species act why it matters the endangered species act has the clear support of americans and attempts to gut it are dangerous the endangered species act signed into law by president nixon in 1973 is arguably one of the least controversial laws on the books a series of polls in recent years has shown incredible bipartisan support at least 85 of americans in favor of it yet there has been growing attempts by republicans to gut the act and president trump administration last week made a reckless attack on it more than 1 200 species that are endangered and near extinction are protected as are nearly 400 species listed as threatened if trump s plan to rewrite how the act is administered survives court challenges it will make it harder to protect threatened species and to protect habitat that endangered and threatened animals need the endangered species act is the reason minnesotans and other americans can now see bald eagles in plentiful numbers it helped restore the number of grizzly bears which are still on the threatened list the minnesota state bee the rusty patched bumblebee also benefits from its threatened listing the act requires that decisions to list an endangered or threatened species must be based on science with no reference to potential economic effects if an animal is listed trump s new rules would direct that a cost benefit analysis be done during the listing process the administration says the economic information would be informational only but it is undoubtedly aimed at giving corporations and developers more ammunition to oppose protections the endangered species act also prohibits anyone from killing or harming endangered species threatened species have always had that same protection unless the fish and wildlife service made special allowances to the contrary trump s rules would allow the killing of threatened species unless fish and wildlife specifically writes rules protecting some of the animals listed that is a foolish change in policy that would only increase the risk that animals listed as threatened would soon become endangered the center for biological diversity which supports protections for endangered species found that in the 1990s and early 2000s there were only a few bills introduced in congress each year aimed at chipping away at the endangered species act but in the first two years of the trump presidency republicans have introduced well over 100 changes to try and gut protections the courts may halt the administration s attempt to weaken the act but congress can and should use its oversight powers to stop the rule changes gop lawmakers from many states that have seen the benefits of the act and who listen to their constituents should help form a bipartisan coali
