trump supporters and anti trump supporters can go back to their corners because the cook political report just threw a wet blanket on republicans as we prepare for battle against the clinton political machine yes voter turnouts are high in the gop primaries but the map simply favors the democrats by over 100 electoral votes chris cillizza of the washington post penned a pieceabout the doom and gloom facing republicans the democratic nominee this fall will if past is prologue start with a 140 electoral vote lead over the republican nominee the democratic nominee needs to win only 28 additional electoral votes to get to 270 and be elected president now for some more math if hillary clinton wins the 19 states that every democratic presidential nominee has won since 1992 and florida she is president simple as that or if she wins the 19 states and takes ohio new mexico and nevada she s president or if she wins the 19 plus iowa new hampshire and ohio you get the idea there are lots of plausible paths to 270 electoral votes for the democratic nominee now let s do the same for republicans give donald trump the 13 states that every gop nominee since 1992 has won not a total sure thing for trump by the way and give him the five states the republican nominee has claimed in five of the last six elections and the seven states that have voted for the republican nominee four times since 1992 add them all up and you get 219 electoral votes that means trump or ted cruz or whoever needs 51 more electoral votes to win give trump colorado florida and nevada three of the four swingiest states over the past six presidential races and he still only gets to 263 electoral votes by now we should all be reaching for a bottle of bourbon in some cases several bottles as we say goodbye to america under a clinton white house the supreme court is bound to swing to the left for the next generation obamanomics survives more or less for another term it s the death of the country moreover both trump and cruz s paths to victory as cillizza noted are rugged and both men certainly don t have the charisma and gravitas at this point to swing enough undecideds and independents into the republican fold yet it does show that even without trump this was still going to be a hard year for republicans given the map the northeast plus california alone gives the democrats a leg up yet things could change if hillary is indicted for mishandling classified information then the whole election changes at the same time let s say sen bernie sanders beats hillary for the nomination over the news of her indictment he still beats cruz and trump handily even more depressing is that one could look and see how unappealing trump and cruz are to the wider electorate given that a disheveled democratic socialist who is also a mile wide and an inch deep on policy is able to beat both of them let s say hillary dodges a bullet on the indictment there s no doubt democrats have an enthusiasm gap this year the core of the democratic party isn t enthused by her or straight up doesn t like her but if trump or cruz wins the republican nomination it could boost democratic turnout by default a large swath of democratic voters may not like hillary but they re not going to sit and let trump and cruz take the white house on the other hand the number ofrepublicans who say they re not going to vote for trump is going to dwindle i find it hard to believe that the most hard core conservatives with a deep antipathy for clinton are going to stay home it s akin to people who said if bush was re elected they d move to canada no such thing happened en masse i m willing to roll the dice that the republican base will come out for whoever wins the nomination in cleveland this july but we sure have to scale the political equivalent of everest to clinch a win still there is a path to victory with trump the frontrunner as ed mentioned in his column for the week in february albeit he also said it s not an easy one alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
