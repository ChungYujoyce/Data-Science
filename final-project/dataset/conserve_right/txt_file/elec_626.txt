magic eight ball that is always wrong americans fed up with eight years of a sluggish economy and a growing disconnect with their leaders in washington voted tuesday to send businessman and political novice donald trump to the white house guaranteeing one of the biggest shakeups in political history wins in pennsylvania and wisconsin gave him enough projected electoral votes to defeat former first lady former senator and former secretary of state hillary clinton whose quarter century in washington and the long list of stumbles including a scandal over a secret email server made her anathema for too many voters mrs clinton had been seeking to make history as the first woman to win the white house but instead the 70 year old mr trump made history of another sort becoming the first person elected to the top job without having held a high government office or military command top stories gall and nerve val demings rips trump for trying to capitalize on biden you ain t black comment oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens you are not going to die from covid 19 his victory upends a washington establishment that voters said had lost touch with folks back home and is a searing rebuke to president obama who had pleaded with voters that his hope and change agenda was at stake in this election mr trump powered his campaign with a simple mantra to make america great again and he vowed to live up to that charge as president saying he would rebuild the country s inner cities improve care for veterans double economic growth and forge alliances with other nations willing to work with him we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us he said we will seek common ground not hostility partnership not conflict after running a brash and eccentric campaign that his critics called divisive he struck a note of openness and conciliation wednesday morning in claiming victory it is time for us to come together as one united people he said i pledge to every citizen of our land that i will be president for all americans mrs clinton did not speak and in fact her campaign manager john podesta had earlier signaled she wouldn t concede the race but as the numbers came in her path to victory eroded and she made an about face making a call to mr trump recounting the call mr trump said he congratulated her on the campaign and on her time in government hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country he said republicans shed seats in the house and senate but will still keep majorities in both chambers giving mr trump a head start on his agenda obamacare would be among the first targets democrats predicted while mr trump would be under pressure to build the border wall he made a staple of his campaign he ll also get the chance to nominate the next supreme court justice vindicating republican senators decision to block mr obama s pick for nearly a year this was a primal scream on the part of a lot of voters david axelrod the architect of mr obama s 2008 victory said on cnn as mr trump racked up win after win mr trump flipped a number of states mr obama won and rebuilt most of the coalition that powered president george w bush to wins in 2000 and 2004 he added wisconsin and pennsylvania to the gop tally but ceded virginia which went democratic for the third straight election the map turned out to be surprisingly close to what mr trump had predicted over the last few months with the gop proving competitive in rust belt and midwest states where he said the obama economy was failing exit polls also proved to be drastically off base tuesday predicting mrs clinton and democratic senate candidates would win races that they ended up losing by wide margins analysts said mr trump tapped into white voters across the country who had felt ignored by washington politicians and who turned out en masse to make themselves heard still it wasn t clear how much of a honeymoon mr trump would enjoy voters in both parties were decidedly unhappy with what one man in pennsylvania called a terrible choice of candidates those walking out of the polls were far more likely to be voting against someone rather than enthusiastic about their own pick i think donald trump is an idiot pam lamonaca a 63 year old caregiver said as she voted in delaware county pennsylvania mrs clinton sparked similar discontent i just don t trust hillary clinton she s not honest said jane ginsberg 53 a housewife with four children i trust him more my instincts tell me that perhaps most surprising was that mrs clinton s chance to make history as the first president was not on voters minds and even hurt her with at least one pennsylvania voter i m a woman and i don t think any woman belongs in the presidency it s too heavy a load there s too much emotions said fran dicrescenza 78 men don t have those emotions she said mr trump was too rough around the edges but she ended up pulling the lever for him hoping he ll follow through on his pro life promises i would love to see a woman president believe me but not her said dee cleary 60 a medical billing worker who cast her ballot for mr trump at an education center in the philadelphia suburbs in delaware county perhaps sensing the direction of the vote early on mr obama urged voters to accept the outcome remember no matter what happens the sun will rise in the morning and america will still be the greatest nation on earth the president said in a taped message broadcast on twitter for buzzfeed but the financial markets were not sold on the president s optimism dow futures plummeted nearly 500 points at 10 p m as mr trump s chances seemed to be revived mr trump s victory will be seen as a massive rebuke of mr obama who carved out a forceful but controversial path as president refusing to work with congressional republicans on a host of issues even as the gop made gains on capitol hill instead mr obama flexed his executive powers attempting to grant a deportation amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants and to control u s greenhouse gas emissions through regulation mr trump ran against that approach promising to work with congress and to rescind many of mr obama s executive actions beyond that however it s unclear what mr trump s agenda will be he said he would try to renegotiate trade deals and would strive for a massive tax break but said he won t touch medicare or social security benefits leaving the major drivers of government debt in place he also vowed a massive infrastructure building program said the country would impose extreme vetting on visitors from countries connected to terrorism and would halt syrian refugees how much of those can clear congress remains to be seen seth mclaughlin dave boyer and ben wolfgang contributed to this article copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here
