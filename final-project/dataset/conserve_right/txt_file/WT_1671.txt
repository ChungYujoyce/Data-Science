apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion president john f kennedy famously observed during a gathering of nobel prize winners i think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent of human knowledge that has ever been gathered together at the white house with the possible exception of when thomas jefferson dined alone and so it is again with president trump s daily assemblies at the white house featuring some of the world s leading public health experts epidemiologists business leaders and economists clearly mr trump listens carefully to his panels of experts and clearly these experts often clash top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender one of the funniest and most ridiculous displays of media idiocy during this whole wuhan pandemic came over the weekend when one beltway revered blog breathlessly reported that there was a major disagreement in the situation room down in the bowels of the white house between government doctor anthony fauci and trump economist peter navarro over the effectiveness of the anti malarial drughydroxychloroquine in combating covid 19 you mean the very same disagreement over hydroxychloroquine that plays out in plain view every single day among mr trump s team out in the rose garden and in the press briefing room and in the press news flash breaking news hold the presses situation room anonymous sources administration official background never in the history of the world has such a serious global threat been met by such a ridiculously unserious press i guess we should just be glad that it wasn t yet another breathless breaking newsflash about how some racist trump administration official anonymously told reporters that the wuhan virus originated in china luckily mr trump has the great wisdom to float above the nonsense except when he impishly delves into the media fracas to tune up some idiot reporter just for the giggles strictly speaking these displays are rarely constructive but boy they sure are entertaining instead mr trump mostly sticks to his assembly of experts but he should do so with extreme caution because while his assembly of expert advisers may be the most extraordinary collection of talent and human knowledge since thomas jefferson dined alone in the white house none of them jefferson included has the finely honed political instincts of mr trump alone despite all the caterwauling and hysteria mr trump is absolutely right to be questioning his medical experts on the wisdom of shutting down the american economy to fight this pandemic it doesn t make mr trump or anyone else a nazi or evil for weighing the costs and benefits of every federal action and edict during these unprecedented times in fact the very instincts that got mr trump elected in the first place are precisely the instincts he should fall back on for dealing with this crisis first there is an evil empire in this world and just as mr trump identified during his campaign it is china the communist country lies about everything disappears political opponents and has a long term strategy for destroying america every decision mr trump makes going forward should be about curtailing china s influence in the world and delivering america from reliance on the country second free trade in the world is great and all but there are limits selling america s soul for cheapest goods possible from china is one thing when we are talking crappy plastic trinkets it is an entirely different matter when we are talking about american security such as the manufacture of drugs face masks and medical gear president trump should immediately establish long term contracts with american companies to manufacture anything deemed vital to national security finally borders matter they always have mattered but unbelievably both u s political parties have been in competition to see who can abandon america s borders the fastest if we have learned nothing from the wuhan virus it is that our borders must be enforced exactly as mr trump promised when he got elected charles hurt can be reached at emailprotected or charleshurt o
