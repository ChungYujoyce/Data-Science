national review transgender student s bathroom access case returns to court apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound trump s grotesque tweets sessions says trump s anger over russiagate recusal is not all unjustified but stands by decision brexit architect cummings defends decision to travel amid lockdown nrplus member article t here s some good news on the coronavirus front we re not out of the woods but maybe we re no longer headed deeper in the cdc s director says we re nearing the peak daily death counts after climbing for some time seem to have leveled off at around 2 000 though these data are often revised as more deaths are reported the much watched university of washington model says we re a few days past the peaks of deaths and hospital usage estimates of the virus s reproductive number in the u s from the london school of hygiene tropical medicine are headed toward one the magical threshold beneath which the problem starts to decline rather than spreading further nothing much can change immediately because holding steady isn t great it s a sign that the severe measures we ve put into effect are controlling the virus not beating it in the coming week or two though we ll hopefully see deaths decline and the reproductive number go below one and that means it s time to start thinking of the next steps that situation will put us at a crossroads there s a lot of uncertainty about how many covid 19 cases are asymptomatic and never detected but with only 550 000 or so known cases in a population of 330 million we can be pretty confident that a very low percentage of the country has survived the virus and gained some immunity this means that if we simply go back to life as it was before the virus will start spreading again but at the same time the calculus changes the longer we try to force the country to stay cooped up the more damage we do to the economy the more resistance the lockdowns will provoke and the worse the cost benefit calculations will start to look and subsequent waves of the epidemic might be weaker than the first one both because some share of the population will probably be immune and because immunity will be concentrated among the people with the most social contacts my admittedly subjective guess is that mass lockdowns can last at most about month longer until mid may if cases and deaths indeed start to decline rapidly americans are not going to stay home unemployed while the hospitals are empty and medical staff are furloughed for lack of work we have to start opening up soon and we have to do it intelligently there are numerous plans to do so ezra klein has a good rundown over at vox but they all rely on a fairly straightforward selection of tools my view is that we should aggressively pursue all of them at once both federally and at the state level until it s clear which are delivering the most bang for the buck i don t know about you all but i m getting impatient locked up with three kids under the age of six and i don t want the virus to start spreading again and force us back to square 1 either it s time to unleash american ingenuity on all fronts at once jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist https cdn jwplayer com v2 playlists xtkmeukk contextual true search contextual recency 30d ph 2 function if function typeof jwplayer var jwp jwplayer document queryselectorall jw player container div jwplayer 0 null if jwp var episode jwp getconfig playlist 0 var pubdate new date episode pubdate 1000 var prelimmonth pubdate getutcmonth 1 var month prelimmonth length 1 prelimmonth 0 prelimmonth var prelimdate pubdate getutcdate var date prelimdate length 1 prelimdate 0 prelimdate var finaldate pubdate getutcfullyear month date var title episode title var labelmapping c3 nationalreview c4 null c6 null ns st st national review ns st pu national review ns st pr title ns st ep title ns st sn null ns st en null ns st ge news ns st ia 0 ns st ce 0 ns st ddt finaldate ns st tdt null jwp on ready function ns streaminganalytics jwplayer jwp publisherid 23390304 labelmapping labelmapping get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
