 for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion more and more on the issue of impeachment house speaker nancy pelosi and her house democrats are so far out over the tips of their skis that they remind me of vinko bogotaj mr bogotaj is the 22 year old slovenian ski jumper whose spectacular ski jump crash became the iconic image showing the agony of defeat in the video montage used to open the old tv show abc s wide world of sports after the release of the transcript of the july 25 phone call between president trump and ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky nancy pelosi and house democrats are crashing downhill at full skull breaking speed mr bogotaj himself would be proud top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties virtually everything democrats told us about this phone call turns out not to have been true it began you will recall with the allegation that the president had promised something to mr zelensky then that allegation morphed into a reverse promise that mr trump had threatened to cut off u s aid to ukraine if mr zelensky did not do what mr trump demanded mr trump had referenced former vice president joe biden s name eight times it was reported none of these things it turns out is accurate the transcript reveals no quid pro quo no commingling of offers or threats with asks instead the transcript of the 30 minute phone call reveals that president trump used the name biden a total of three times not eight once in reference to former vice president joe biden s son and twice to mr biden himself over a total of two sentences about two thirds of the way into the phone call reads the transcript the other thing there s a lot of talk about biden s son that biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general that would be great biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it it sounds horrible to me that s it yet democrats continue to press forward with their official impeachment inquiry said speaker pelosi wednesday morning before she had even read the transcript the fact is that the president of the united states in breach of his constitutional responsibilities has asked a foreign government to help him in his political campaign at the expense of our national security as well as undermining the integrity of our elections that cannot stand he will be held accountable no one is above the law in mrs pelosi s view asking the new ukrainian president to investigate what happened in 2016 is help to the trump re election campaign and that is a breach of his constitutional responsibilities what rubbish this is only news because mr biden is running for the democratic nomination for president if he were not running now there would be nothing at all remarkable about an american president asking a new ukrainian president to look into what may or may not have happened years ago mrs pelosi says no one is above the law i agree but no one is below the law either should the fact that mr biden is now running for president be allowed to shield his previous activities from investigation mr biden never should have done what he did in 2016 in the first place once his son accepted a paid position on the board of directors of a ukrainian company mr biden should have been conflicted out of having anything to do with ukraine instead he traveled to ukraine and threatened to withhold a billion dollars worth of u s aid if the ukrainian government did not immediately fire the very prosecutor who was investigating his son s company and then later bragged that he had succeeded in having that prosecutor fired i don t know if joe biden s son did anything wrong in ukraine but i do know you d have to be blind not to see the conflict of interest in the former vice president doing what he did to think that no one should investigate that because he is now years later running for president is absurd democrats claim that president trump believes himself to be above the law the truth is the exact opposite it is the democrats not president trump who believe they can act in their own interest with impunity mr biden never should have traveled to ukraine let alone threatened to cut off aid to ukraine after his son started taking money from a ukrainian company next year the voters will render their verdict and i ll wager democrats will be disappointed again jenny beth martin is chairman of tea party patriots citi
