ted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic until his arrest in april 2011 chinese dissident artist ai weiwei walked a careful line in flouting the government without pushing past the point of what the chinese courts call incitement to subversion of state power how this was possible is a bit of a mystery mr ai s two decades spent as a leader in china s art world focused almost entirely on the incitement to subversion of state power first through energizing and stimulating underground artists and eventually by engaging the implacable machinery of the totalitarian state as a kind of found material for his own art it s possible that chinese authorities found him to be more of a curiosity and a potential ally than a real threat top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century mr ai spent some of his childhood in a re education camp because his father the poet ai qing fell out of favor with the revolutionary government in the late 1950s while most big name chinese artists boast academy training mr ai charted his own path through the chinese art world he left china in the early 1980s to study in new york as one of the first chinese students permitted to do so in new york he photographed the squatter riots in tompkins square park as gentrification was beginning to change the character of the east village and the bowery he fell in with a group of artists who were experimenting with performance art mixed media video installations and other emerging styles he watched the tiananmen square uprising unfold on american television but according to evan osnos china correspondent for the new yorker it was the iran contra hearings the spectacle of a government publicly and systematically airing its own dirty laundry that truly revolutionized mr ai returning to china in 1993 mr ai was a leader in a group of artists that disseminated their work in underground and illegal books yet mr ai maintained enough favor with the authorities to merit a commission to design the bird s nest stadium for the 2008 beijing olympics this perhaps more reflects tensions within the upper reaches of the chinese bureaucracy than mr ai s attempts to accommodate the regime when the olympics were under way the artist denounced the policy of evicting poor city dwellers many undocumented rural migrants to make space for development tied to the games in one famous mobile phone photograph that went viral on the internet mr ai extends a middle finger to the stadium he helped design alison klayman s documentary provides an ideal vehicle for meeting mr ai because so much of his recent work is done on video he comes across as earthy driven plain spoken and boisterous more than willing to trade taunts with policemen and others in china s vast security apparatus in the aftermath of the sichuan earthquake in 2008 that killed more than 70 000 people mr ai launched an effort to ascertain the true death toll of the students who were killed in schools in large part because of shoddy construction in the course of this project mr ai was assaulted by local police while traveling to testify in the trial of activist tan zuoren who had asked people who lost children in the quake to set up a victim database mr ai documented the assault as well as his quixotic efforts to press charges against the police and then to file a civil lawsuit mr ai also was quick to discover twitter as a means to disseminate his message of individual freedom of expression and to publicize his own willingness to put himself on the line in his struggle with chinese authorities while china now has strict rules for microblogging platforms such as twitter mr ai was for a time able to use it to mobilize followers to engage in whimsical but potentially revolutionary stunts freedom is a pretty strange thing mr ai says once you ve experienced it it remains in your heart and no one can take it away it s not just the idea of freedom but the raw energetic thing itself that surges through mr ai s work while mr ai s optimism and will are wonderful to behold it appears that the cracks in the system that let him launch a successful international career are being filled mr ai currently is under a form of house arrest as one chinese observer says in the film if the government was afraid of someone it wouldn t be the government anymore title ai weiwei never sorry credits directed by alison klayman rating r for language running time 91 minut
