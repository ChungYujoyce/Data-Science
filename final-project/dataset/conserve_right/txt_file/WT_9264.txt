apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap china s official death toll from the coronavirus pandemic jumped sharply friday as the hardest hit city of wuhan announced a major revision that added nearly 1 300 fatalities the new figures resulted from an in depth review of deaths during a response that was chaotic in the early days they raised the official toll in wuhan by 50 to 3 869 deaths while china has yet to update its national totals the revised numbers push up china s total to 4 632 deaths from a previously reported 3 342 the higher numbers are not a surprise it is virtually impossible to get an accurate count when health systems are overwhelmed at the height of a crisis and they confirm suspicions that many more people died than the official figures had showed top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the undercount stemmed from several factors according to a notification issued by wuhan s coronavirus response headquarters and published by the official xinhua news agency the reasons included the deaths of people at home because overwhelmed hospitals had no room for them mistaken reporting by medical staff focused on saving lives and deaths at a few medical institutions that weren t linked to the epidemic information network it said as a result belated missed and mistaken reporting occurred xinhua quoted an unidentified official from the city s response headquarters as saying deaths outside hospitals were not registered previously and some medical institutions reported cases late or not at all the official said a group to review the numbers was established in late march it looked at data from multiple sources including the city s hospital and funeral service systems and collected information from fever clinics temporary hospitals quarantine sites prisons and elderly care centers the review found 1 454 additional deaths as well as 164 that had been double counted or misclassified as coronavirus cases resulting in a net increase of 1 290 the number of confirmed cases in the city of 11 million people was revised up slightly to 50 333 questions have long swirled around the accuracy of china s case reporting with wuhan in particular going several days in january without reporting new cases or deaths that has led to accusations that chinese officials were seeking to minimize the impact of the outbreak and could have brought it under control sooner a group of eight medical workers including a doctor who later died from the virus were even reprimanded and threatened by police after they tried to alert others about the disease over social media chinese officials have denied covering up cases saying their reports were accurate and timely however the u n s world health organization has come under criticism for defending china s handling of the outbreak and u s president donald trump has suspended funding to who over what he alleges is its pro china bias trump s blaming of china came after he initially showered praise on chinese president xi jinping for the country s response while largely dismissing the risk it posed to the u s at the start of the outbreak china proceeded cautiously and largely in secret emphasizing political stability experts estimate more than 3 000 people were infected before china s government told the public about the gravity of the situation which officials had concluded six days earlier the risk of sustained human to human transmission was also downplayed even while infected people entered hospitals across the country and the first case outside china was found in thailand as trump and other u s officials and lawmakers started blaming china for the outbreak chinese officials sought to shift blame back to the u s it might be us army who brought the epidemic to wuhan foreign ministry spokesman zhao lijian tweet
