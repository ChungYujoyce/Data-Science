the bbc recently put it between russian president vladimir putin and chinese president xi jinping president obama and virtually all other western political leaders declined mr putin s invitation to

the sino russian entente in april both moscow and beijing see the world going through an epochal change away from u s domination and toward a freer global order that would give china more prominence and russia more freedom of action he wrote they also see the process of change gaining speed mr putin and mr xi sparked talk of a major change in bilateral relations in april 2014 with the announcement of a 30 year 400 billion deal to sell russian natural gas for the first time to china followed by the announcement in november of plans to build a second major pipeline to bring russian oil and gas to chinese customers going deeper at the time some portrayed the deals less as an alliance than a desperation move by mr putin who is facing international isolation and economic sanctions from the united states and europe over the clash in ukraine and russia s annexation of the crimean peninsula but this year has brought a string of signals that the rapprochement between the two capitals is going much deeper those moves include in march russia s state owned airplane manufacturer announced the production schedule for a joint venture with commercial aircraft corp of china to build a long haul wide bodied commercial airliner by 2025 with the bulk of the 13 billion project coming from china in april china became the first foreign customer for the advanced s 400 anti

any other country mr geng used the same briefing to harshly condemn the far reaching u s japanese defense pact signed by prime minister shinzo abe on his u s visit this week what kind of impact will it have on world and regional peace and stability to beef up the u s japan military alliance and expand their defense cooperation to the whole world mr geng asked according to an associated press report that is a question that needs to be asked by all sides analysts caution that past predictions of a closer moscow beijing axis have proved to be overstated dating back to the days when the soviet union and mao zedong s people s republic of china clashed repeatedly and even fought a brief but bloody border war in 1969 russian strategists openly fear that moscow would be relegated to a junior partner in any alliance given china s rising wealth and economic clout but carnegie s mr trenin said the warming may prove more significant because neither side has other obvious major allies as they seek to expand their clout and challenge the u s designed global order in asia and europe mr putin and mr xi he added have the incentive clout and job security to move an alliance forward from its new levels reached in 2014 the relationship between moscow and beijing is likely to move forward in a number of key areas he wrote in lieu of a greater europe from lisbon to vladivostok a greater
