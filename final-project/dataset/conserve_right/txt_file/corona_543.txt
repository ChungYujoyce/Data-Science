national review despite the potential of a pandemic that could crater the global economy it s a relief to know that china s communist rulers are focusing on the important things the latest brouhaha between china and the united states unfolded last week when beijing expelled three wall street journal reporters in retribution for an opinion column entitled china is the real sick man of asia it was the first time since 1998 that a foreign reporter has been kicked out of china as a regular contributor to both national review and the wall street journal i can only dream of causing such an international incident speaking engagements by the dozens would await me alas unlike at nr occasionally headlines at most newspapers are not written by the authors as it was in this case and my own wsj piece later that week on how wuhan s coronavirus could cause a second revolution to emerge from that city the first being in 1911 causing the overthrow of the qing dynasty was given a suitably non offensive title the title struck a bell with me of course the phrase sick man of europe was first applied to the faltering ottoman empire in the late 19th century having everything to do with assessing turkey s weak internal politics and nothing to do with racism it s a pithy moniker so it s been applied to other countries including apparently china itself during the 19th and 20th centuries as the qing disintegrated and the country plunged into warlordism and civil war until mao zedong s sanguinary victory in 1949 i haven t gone back to any contemporary sources to find just how common it was if at all to refer to china as the sick man of the far east as they would have put it back then and yet history aside i felt the phrase was somehow connected with something i had written long ago sure enough google instantly picked out an essay i wrote in 2009 forforeign policy entitled the sick man of asia i was over a decade ahead of the times i racked my brains trying to remember the names of the american journalists who had been expelled due to my callousness of how many times i had been denied a visa and of the diplomatic strategy the u s government adopted in response to the crisis i had caused nr s afternoon roundup of the day s best commentary must read analysis oh wait silly me my the sick man of asia article wasn t about china at all it was about japan subtitled we ll miss japan when it s gone the piece lamented tokyo s then paralyzed political system and fading regional role much of which has been turned around by current prime minister shinzo abe by the way sadly my excoriation of japan s weaknesses caused no vapors amongst the leadership in tokyo noforeign policy reporters were kicked out of japan no diplomatic demarches followed nor was i declaredpersona non grata by the foreign ministry there was no online backlash no calls for my head nor for me to be thrown off twitter indeed not much of a reaction at all how different when it comes to the world s most populous and some say strongest nation how pathetic the spectacle of a government imposed by force on more than one billion people with an extraordinary millennia old culture whining like a petulant child over an eight word headline or over a batman comic book cover or a tweet by an nba manager as hundreds of millions chinese hide from the coronavirus as over a million muslim uyghurs are kept in concentration camps as beijing directs cyber and human espionage operations to strip the world of its industrial secrets and personal information china s communist leaders going into conniption fits over a newspaper headline says it all revealing just how little legitimacy they have and how less capable they are in dealing with the world than the supposedly conservative and ossified japanese but maybe that s because japan is a democracy and largely respectful of press freedom unlike china s thin skinned authoritarian dictators perhaps they even more than the wsj headline writers know just how weak dare i say sick their system is get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
