tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap president donald trump is misrepresenting the conclusions of special counsel robert mueller s russia investigation claiming vindication from a summary of the mueller report after attacking his work for months as biased unreliable and illegal he describes attorney general william barr s summary of principal conclusions from mueller s report as a total exoneration but barr s summary quotes specific text from mueller that makes clear the report does not put the president in the clear top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the mueller matter capped a week that saw trump go on an unusual tangent a sustained and bitter dressing down of the late republican senator john mccain he accused mccain of failing his fellow veterans staining public policy and trying to make trouble for him in the russia probe he widely mischaracterized mccain s record in the process a look at his claims and the facts russia investigation trump no collusion no obstruction complete and total exoneration tweet sunday trump there was no obstruction and none what so ever and it was a complete and total exoneration remarks to reporters sunday sarah sanders white house press secretary the special counsel did not find any collusion and did not find any obstruction ag barr and dag rosenstein further determined there was no obstruction the findings of the department of justice are a total and complete exoneration of the president tweet sunday the facts it was not a total vindication mueller s exact words in the report as quoted by the attorney general say otherwise while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him the summary by barr notes mueller did not draw a conclusion one way or the other as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction setting out evidence for both sides and leaving the question unanswered barr wrote in the summary that ultimately he decided as attorney general that the evidence developed by muller was not sufficient to establish that trump committed obstruction of justice barr s summary also notes that mueller did not find that the trump campaign conspired or coordinated with russia to prove a crime mueller must generally meet a standard of proving an offense beyond a reasonable doubt the summary did not clear the president of improper behavior regarding russia but did not establish that he was involved in an underlying crime related to russian election interference mueller said in a passage from the report quoted by barr the four page summary gave the bottom line only as he and his deputy saw it mueller s detailed findings remain confidential at least for now trump on mueller i know that he s conflicted and i know that his best friend is comey who s a bad cop remarks wednesday at the white house the facts though james comey succeeded mueller as fbi director and though they served together in the bush administration the men are not known to be social friends there is certainly no evidence as trump has repeatedly suggested that they are best friends trump on the mueller report it s sort of interesting that a man out of the blue just writes a report remarks wednesday the facts mueller didn t wake up one day out of the blue and decide he wanted to write a report it s mandated under the regulation that spells out the grounds for his appointment and duties as special counsel trump on the formation of the special counsel investigation again i say a deputy because of the fact that the attorney general didn t have the courage to do it himself a deputy that s appointed appoints another man to write a report remarks wednesday to reporters at the white house the facts the attorney general at the time jeff sessions didn t lack courage in the matter he lacked standing he recused himself from anything to do with the trump campaign s interactions with russia because his work for the campaign placed him in a potential conflict of interest it then fell to deputy attorney general rod rosenstein to decide whether to appoint a special counsel and he did mueller sent his report to the attorney general on friday mccain trump i gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted i didn t get thank you that s ok we sent him on the way remarks wednesday at the army tank factory in lima ohio the facts trump did not give a funeral for mccain he did sign off on the military transport of mccain s body but the venues and arrangements were the responsibility of others and thanks were conveyed at the time mccain family spokesman rick davis cited the trump administration the white house the defense secretary and department and the military district of washington for their combined effort on logistics we really thank them for coming together very quickly and pulling together all of the federal resources he said mccain s family made clear that trump was not welcome during the weeklong cross country ceremonies that the senator had planned himself instead mccain invited former presidents george w bush who defeated mccain during the 2000 gop nomination fight and barack obama the democrat who defeated him in 2008 to deliver eulogies on the value of pursuing goals greater than oneself trump went golfing and was uncharacteristically quiet on twitter during the washington events trump asked why he is criticizing a dead senator who can t defend himself when they ask me the question i answer the question but you people bring it up i don t bring it up fox business network interview broadcast friday on mornings with maria the facts this is false trump has been assailing mccain without any prompting by the media he tweeted a week ago about last in his class mccain who wasn t last in his class after a tweet about stains on the late senator s record and after extended opening remarks in the speech at the army tank factory on wednesday trump abruptly segued by telling his audience a lot of people are asking because they love me and they ask me about a man named john mccain he went on to devote nearly 800 words to criticisms of mccain trump mccain didn t get the job done for our great vets the vets were on my side because i got the job done i got choice and i got accountability remarks at tank factory the facts what trump got done was an expansion of the choice program achieved by mccain and sen bernie sanders co authors of legislation giving veterans the choice of private medical care at public expense if they have to wait too long for veterans affairs department care that legislation was signed into law by obama not trump mccain didn t rest after the law was enacted he fought to expand the program and achieved that too in his last months congress approved the expansion in may and trump signed the legislation in june it s named after three veterans who served in congress one of them is mccain it s called the john s mccain iii daniel k akaka and samuel r johnson va maintaining internal systems and strengthening integrated outside networks act of 2018 trump well you better love me i kept this place open that i can tell you opening line in speech at tank factory the facts he may have a plausible case to make that he has kept the plant open it was at risk of closing during the obama administration and trump achieved a large increase in military spending last year trump did not mention the formal name of the act he signed that increases the military budget it s called the john s mccain national authorization act in honor of the senator s efforts to support military capability as well as higher pay for troops which the law provides trump signed the law aug 13 and did not credit mccain then either the senator died aug 25 trump john mccain received a fake and phony dossier did you hear about the dossier it was paid for by crooked hillary clinton right and john mccain got it he got it and what did he do he didn t call me he turned it over to the fbi hoping to put me in jeopardy remarks at tank factory trump so it was indeed just proven in court papers last in his class annapolis john mccain that sent the fake dossier to the fbi and media hoping to have it printed before the election he the dems working together failed as usual tweet march 17 the facts trump s chronology is incorrect mccain did not present then fbi director james comey with a copy of the memos compiled by former british spy christopher steele until december 2016 after the election according to a deposition from a mccain associate david kramer fbi officials had access to steele s research on trump before the election as they referred to it as part of an application for a secret search warrant of trump associate carter page trump often claims falsely that special counsel robert mueller s russia probe was based on the dossier that probe examined russian interference in the 2016 u s presidential election and possible coordination with the trump campaign the fbi s investigation actually began months before it received the dossier of anti trump research financed by the democratic party and clinton s campaign the fbi probe s origins were based on other evidence not the existence of the dossier there is no evidence that mccain provided the dossier to the news media and while mccain famously racked up demerits and earned poor grades at the u s naval academy in annapolis maryland he ultimately graduated fifth from the bottom of his 1958 class not last economy trump we ve created more than almost 6 million jobs since the election and if i would have said that to the fake news during the campaign they would have said he exaggerates including almost 600 000 manufacturing jobs remarks at tank factory the facts he s not exaggerating on job creation but that record is not all his and it s not remarkable the economy created about 6 million jobs in the roughly two years before the election then again in the roughly two years after by counting since the election he s taking credit for jobs created in the last months of the obama administration the country has added 466 000 manufacturing jobs not almost 600 000 since trump took office trump everyone said you couldn t do it couldn t bring back manufacturing jobs we re bringing them back beyond anybody s expectations remarks at tank factory the facts it s hard to show that manufacturing has been brought back there are now 12 8 million jobs in u s factories below the 13 7 million just before the recession started and far below the roughly 17 2 million in 2000 just before china joined the world trade organization and gained greater access to the u s market trump and we just came out another chart we just came out with numbers the economic report of the president 3 1 percent gdp the first time in 14 years that we cracked 3 right that s pretty good 3 1 the press tried to make it 2 9 i said it s not 2 9 what they did is they took odd months remarks at tank factory the facts it s a fiction that 2 9 percent growth comes from a calculation based on odd months it comes from a traditional measure of gross domestic product comparing growth in the size of one year s economy with the previous year s that measure shows 2 9 percent growth but there s another way to measure which trump goes by because it looks better he is citing a comparison in the size of the economy in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017 that shows 3 1 percent growth some economists consider this measure to be a legitimate way to look at growth if not the usual way but when comparing quarters from one year to the next trump is wrong to say that growth hasn t cracked 3 percent in 14 years in 2015 the second quarter was up 3 8 percent from the year before trade trump on the world trade organization we re doing even better with wto we re winning cases all of the sudden because we never won cases now we re starting to win cases because they know my attitude if they don t treat us fairly we get out fox business network interview broadcast friday the facts it s not true that the u s always lost trade cases adjudicated by the world trade organization before trump the u s trade representative office announced in september 2016 a decisive wto victory in a case that the u s said had cut its solar exports to india by 90 percent because of that country s domestic content rules the office said the obama administration had brought 23 cases alleging unfair trade practices to the organization and won all of them that had been decided by that point trump on mueller s report on his russia investigation i want to see the report and you know who will want to see it the tens of millions of people that love the fact that we have the greatest economy we ve ever had remarks wednesday to reporters at the white house before mueller sent the report to attorney general william barr on friday the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the greatest in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 9 percent last year a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump and growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 independent economists widely expect slower growth this year as the effects of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes veterans trump instead of waiting in line for two days two weeks two months people waiting on line they re not very sick by the time they see a doctor they are terminally ill we give them choice if you have to wait for any extended period of time you go outside you go to a local doctor we pay the bill you get yourself better go home to your family and we got it passed we got it done remarks at tank factory the facts as he does routinely trump exaggerated what s been accomplished with his expansion veterans still must wait for weeks before they can get private care outside the va system the program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside va if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles 65 kilometers to a va facility under new rules to take effect in june veterans are to have that option for a private doctor if their va wait is only 20 days 28 for specialty care or their drive is only 30 minutes but the expanded choice eligibility may do little to provide immediate help that s because veterans often must wait even longer for an appointment in the private sector last year then secretary david shulkin said va care is often 40 percent better in terms of wait times compared with the private sector in 2018 34 percent of all va appointments were with outside physicians down from 36 percent in 2017 the va also must resolve long term financing because of congressional budget caps after the white house opposed new money to pay for the program as a result lawmakers could be forced later this year to limit the program or slash core va or other domestic programs also key to the program s success is an overhaul of va s electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of medical records with private physicians a process expected to take up to 10 years va secretary robert wilkie has said full implementation of the expanded choice program is years away 2016 election trump i got 306 electoral votes against 223 that s a tremendous victory i got 63 million more i got 63 million votes remarks wednesday at the white house the facts he did not have as lopsided a victory over democrat hillary clinton as he suggests trump did indeed win nearly 63 million votes in the 2016 election but it was fewer than the 65 million for clinton who won the popular vote after racking up lopsided victories in big states such as new york and california according to election data compiled by the associated press clinton however lost the presidency due to trump s winning margin in the electoral college which came after he narrowly won less populous midwestern states including michigan and wisconsin as is typical trump also misstates the electoral college vote the official count was 304 to 227 according to an ap tally of the electoral votes in every state associated press writers eric tucker christopher rugaber kevin freking jill colvin and
