just the name of a television show by tradition one cabinet secretary is closeted away at a secure undisclosed location to ensure continuity of government in case disaster strikes while government leaders attend the speech agriculture secretary sonny perdue was last year s designated survivor but trump s choice this year could be limited by the number of acting secretaries in the cabinet only senate confirmed secretaries and natural born citizens in the line of succession to the presidency can assume control of government in a crisis that means acting defense secretary patrick shanahan acting attorney general matthew whitaker acting interior secretary david bernhardt and transportation secretary elaine chao can t fill the role of designated survivor chao is a naturalized u s citizen

themes that inspire both sides to applaud for instance who s against unity both trump and georgia democrat stacey abrams who will deliver the rebuttal have used that idea to preview their remarks democrats running for president nearly a dozen democrats who dream of succeeding trump serve in congress they will be sizing up the president and one another as well watch the body language among the democratic contenders who s talking to whom who gets or gives a hug or a kiss whose heads are bowed in hushed conversation also watch their body language toward trump cameras will be trolling the audience and the presidential dreamers know it to see if they can be caught responding with an eye roll or head shake democratic rebuttal senate democratic leader chuck schumer chose abrams to deliver the rebuttal in a nod toward the black women who anchor the democratic party doing so elevates her among democrats as the leaders woo abrams to run for the senate in 2020 abrams also will provide a contrast with trump who has a history of making racially inflammatory remarks abrams is filling a role that for others has proved thankless and generated brutal reviews republican sen marco rubio s
