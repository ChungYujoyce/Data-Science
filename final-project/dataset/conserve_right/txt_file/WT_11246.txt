allies that share the basic values of human rights democracy and the rule of law and to recognize that the two countries will continue to work together to realize international peace stability and prosperity in a press conference japanese cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said the speech would have great significance in that it will demonstrate the strong u s japan alliance to the world can t forget history ms thompson said she hoped mr abe would take advantage of the april 29 speech to address the atrocities japan committed during world war ii which resulted in hundreds of executions for war crimes and a nuremberg like trial of surviving regime figures in tokyo the podium is symbolic in many ways it was here that fdr said after the attack on pearl harbor by imperial japan a date which will live in infamy ms thompson said no country can avoid responsibility for its history japan cannot run from their world war ii history we see this as an historic moment not just for japan but the rest of the world japan needs to open the door and shed light on their dark chapter by doing so i believe the world will in turn see them as the great nation they want to be in a letter to the senate and house veterans affairs committees the american defenders of bataan and corregidor memorial society said congress should not allow mr abe to speak at the capitol unless he agrees to acknowledge japan s actions during the war the group also criticized mr abe s remarks on japan s world war ii actions his past statements rejecting the verdicts of the tokyo war crimes tribunal that serves as the foundation of the 1951 san francisco peace treaty with japan trouble us ms thompson wrote in the letter we want congress to only extend the invitation to prime minister abe to speak at the podium of roosevelt and churchill if they are assured that he will acknowledge that japan s defeat released the country from the venom of fascism and the inhuman goals of a criminal regime mr abe challenged the convictions of japanese wartime leaders at the tokyo tribunal during a legislative session in october 2006 he stepped down from office in 2007 but returned to power in 2012 in 2013 mr abe sparked outrage in china south korea and the u s when he visited a war shrine in japan that honors about 2 5 million japanese who have died in wars including several who were convicted by the tokyo tribunals of class a war crimes for which many were hanged afterward mr abe told reporters that he did not intend to offend anyone by visiting the shrine there is criticism based on the misconception that this is an act to worship war criminals but i visited yasukuni shrine to report to the souls of the war dead on the progress made this year and to convey my resolve that people never again suffer the horrors of war he said according to the guardian mr abe will address congress just a few months ahead of another speech commemorating the end of world war ii he is set to travel to china in august to give a statement to mark the 70th anniversary of the conflict s end in her letter to congress ms thompson said she hopes mr abe will use his address to show american veterans remorse for his country s conduct the american pows of japan and their families have paid a high price for the freedoms we cherish what they ask in return for their sacrifices and service is for their government even after 70 years is to keep its moral obligation to them they do not want their history ignored or exploited they do not ask for further compensation what they want most is to have their government stand by them to ensure they will be remembered that our allies respect them and their american history preserved ms thompson wrote mr abe is scheduled to arrive in the u s on april 26 and will meet with president obama on april 29 he will spend eight days in the u s with stays in washington from april 27 to april 30 and will visit boston s
