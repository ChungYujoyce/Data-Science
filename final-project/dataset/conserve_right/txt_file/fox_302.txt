to enjoy all the benefits of our website history shows that when leaders are forced to take emergency action power tends to be relocated to small and opaque groups get the new statesman s morning call email the worst defect weak republics can have is to be indecisive so that all their decisions are taken out of necessity and if any good comes to them it comes through force of circumstance rather than through their own prudence machiavelli s words seem especially apposite today as governments around the world are accused of dithering before the coronavirus threat indecision followed by hurried adaptation seems the rule in europe this applies not just to national governments but to the supranational institutions of the european union to whom many have looked for a decisive response yet whose actions can still seem painfully slow it would be easy to blame failures of leadership but in many respects the problems are structural power in the eu is divided across many hands and supranational authorities can only do so much without the backing of leading member states even in the case of economic policy where the european central bank and eu commission have shown a willingness to deploy significant powers they can rarely act alone as machiavelli also noted republics based on the diffusion of power across multiple sites tended to work in slow motion since no council nor any magistrate can undertake anything alone for in many instances they need to consult one another and time is wasted in coming to an agreement leave the eu out of it one might say it was not designed to deal with public health emergencies so inertia is only to be expected but there is a risk in such contexts that moving too slowly leaves eu leaders feeling pressured to act decisively nonetheless ultimately in ways that are hard to monitor or constrain there have after all been many calls for stronger european level action to tackle the coronavirus one of the striking and generally welcome features of this crisis so far has been the widespread enthusiasm for political intervention this translates first and foremost into renewed interest in state planning but it is combined with calls for stronger cross national coordination and supranational even global authority arguably with good reason yet one thing we have learnt from more than a decade of eu crisis politics is that when leaders are moved to take urgent action in the absence of existing authority structures power tends to be relocated to small groups and exercised informally and opaquely since eu procedures can be cumbersome and demanding
