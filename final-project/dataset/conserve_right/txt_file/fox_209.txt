iveness of new york lockdown in question reaction and analysis on the five billy joel might call it a new york state of ingratitude as the empire state and america s largest city endure covid 19 their most powerful democrats ooze a truly revolting lack of appreciation for those who have helped their constituents survive this ongoing microbial attack rather than say thank you gov andrew cuomo new

if you don t have a health care crisis in your community please come help us in new york now gov cuomo said march 30 americans heeded his call on april 2 he announced that some 21 000 health care workers from coast to coast rushed in to aid their countrymen on the hudson these are beautiful generous people cuomo said and new yorkers will return the favor cuomo just returned the favor we re not in a position to provide any subsidies right now because we have a 13 billion deficit cuomo said tuesday we are in dire financial need consequently out of state medical personnel who earned wages back home while volunteering their talents for at least 14 days must pay new york state tax on such income albany also expects full compliance with its dense tax paperwork that morning mayor de blasio was customarily crass every day president trump resembles more and more herbert hoover the president who ignored the great depression who didn t care to put america back on its feet who has been now remembered in history as someone who failed at the most basic responsibility which is to protect the people he serves de blasio said de blasio called president trump a former new yorker who seems to enjoy stabbing his home town in the back and while demanding a federal bailout of gotham s bloated books de blasio added i ll give him another chance to show that there s a beating heart there de blasio also used grotesque language april 19 while begging trump for taxpayer dollars are you going to save new york city or are you telling new york city to drop dead the remarkably self absorbed de blasio seems unaware of the niagara falls of assistance that team trump cascaded into new york city the reliably partisan and relentlessly embarrassing de blasio should thank team trump for this
