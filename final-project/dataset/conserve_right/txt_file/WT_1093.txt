apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump enjoys a historically strong job market decent economic growth relatively low gas prices a surging stock market fewer combat deaths of u s troops and fewer inmates in federal prisons all in all he has a good story to tell voters particularly when compared to his predecessors yet as he enters his fourth year in office a reelection year his approval ratings trail those of presidents barack obama and george w bush at this point and oddsmakers say he s at best a 50 50 chance to win a second term top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century it s a riddle that bedevils the president s advisers and gives encouragement to his political opponents who feel he s poised to become only the second president in the last four decades to fail to win re election for some there s an easy answer he s gotten a raw deal from a press unwilling to give him a fair shake it is very difficult to overcome the constant attacks by the media on the president and the total discounting all this good news it is really frustrating said rep virginia foxx north carolina republican i don t blame the president for being frustrated and i am frustrated too that we have done so much and neither he nor the republicans in the congress get any credit for it mr trump has ground to make up as he looks to election day he won in 2016 despite getting fewer votes nationwide just as mr bush did in 2000 but mr bush went into 2004 in far better shape at the three year mark of his presidency his approval rating was 58 5 according to real clear politics average of polls that was a net 14 9 positive rating mr obama won his first election by a significant margin meaning he could lose some of his voters and still win re election at this point in his presidency he had a 46 average approval rate which was a net 2 3 negative mr trump is at 44 5 according to real clear close to mr obama s but net is 7 5 negative because more people solidly disapprove of him than did of his predecessor a white house official conceded to the times that mr trump s polarizing behavior takes a toll on those numbers he s a new yorker and that means by birth by inclination by action by training whatever the other 300 million americans that don t live in new york are not going to like him the official said by contrast people seemed to want to give mr obama the benefit of the doubt that was true even on the international stage where he had been awarded the nobel peace prize by this point in his term the white house official put that in context pointing out that yasser arafat designated a terrorist won the award in 1994 the official said the peace prize was emblematic of the different treatment the previous presidents got compared to mr trump it s not so much that the media s against him it s that it s a steady downpour and no matter how many umbrellas you have you re still going to get wet the official said just how good are mr trump s numbers gas prices adjusted for inflation are only slightly higher than they were 20 years ago the stock market is up more than 45 the federal prison population which three years into the obama years was surging past 215 000 is down below 150 000 inmates mr trump is nearing 7 million more jobs the federal reserve does say that manufacturing has been weak denting the president s claim that he would revive that side of the economy the fed said the president s tariffs are a reason for manufacturing s weakness income inequality is also up though median household income has fully bounced back from the great recession the census bureau said last year in decades past the surging stock market and solid job gains would likely have meant another term for whichever party held the reins at the white house but the economist says that link has been severed over the last decade sending academics scrambling to rethink their models one of those academics is alan i abramowitz a political scientist at emory university who uses models to project elections in a column for the university of virginia s center for politics he said last week that growing partisan polarization means voters even if they re enjoying better finances are not automatically going to give the guy in the white house another go besides he said democrats don t see the economy as positively as the rest of the country and give mr trump less credit for it sen sherrod brown an ohio democrat who pondered taking on mr trump himself but ultimately decided not to join the field of candidates said that s exactly how he sees it i think he doesn t have a good story to tell i think it is an administration marked by corruption for himself and his family and friends he said he said mr obama deserves credit for the economy and if mr trump helped it along it was only by blowing a huge hole in the budget i would think papers like the washington times would be concerned about the deficit but i know the wall street journal and conservative media never care about the deficit if it is a republican president and do if it is a democratic president mr brown said mr trump has indeed expanded piled up debt adding 3 254 trillion over three years mr obama has him beat however with 4 596 trillion added in his first three years rep eliot engel new york democrat said the economy looks good from the top down but average americans don t necessarily feel the benefits so there are a lot of complicated factors i m trying to be as fair as i can be that go into this i think that the american public opinion is very much in flux right now mr abramowitz said mr trump can win re election and much depends on who his democratic opponent will be but mr trump s record won t help the more the campaign and the election revolve around the president s record and performance the better the chance that
