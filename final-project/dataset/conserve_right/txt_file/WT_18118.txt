apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic asat missile defense china used a top secret sc 19 anti satellite asat missile in a test last year against a target missile as part of a missile defense system that remains shrouded in secrecy the asat missile was fired against a new medium range missile and details were disclosed in a state department cable made public recently by wikileaks that included an outline of a diplomatic protest note to beijing about both chinese weapons programs top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches the cable provides the first detailed u s assessment of what defense officials say is a major strategic advancement in china s military buildup it reveals that china s anti satellite system was developed for use not only against satellites but is part of a larger strategic missile defense system defense secretary robert m gates offered to hold strategic talks with china on missile defenses as well as space nuclear and cyberweapons during a recent visit to beijing the offer was rebuffed by china s defense minister who said only that it would be studied defense officials and private specialists said the cable further highlights official chinese government duplicity in opposing u s missile defenses and promoting an international agreement to limit weapons in space at the same time it is secretly working on its own space weapons and missile defense programs details of the chinese sc 19 test are not expected to be included in the pentagon s annual report to congress on the chinese military that was due march 1 but remains under review by the obama administration chinese state run media announced the january 2010 test in a two sentence statement that made no mention of the use of the sc 19 the sc 19 s first successful test destroyed a chinese weather satellite in january 2007 resulting in thousands of pieces of debris in orbit that remain a threat to both manned and unmanned space flight the current u s strategic missile defense has no direct capabilities for shooting down satellites however the navy modified a ship based sm 3 anti missile interceptor to shoot down a falling u s satellite in 2008 chinese embassy spokesman wang baodong repeated the comments of a foreign ministry spokesman who said the 2010 test was defensive in nature and targeted at no country the u s intelligence community assesses that on 11 january 2010 china launched an sc 19 missile from the korla missile test complex and successfully intercepted a near simultaneously launched css x 11 medium range ballistic missile launched from the shuangchengzi space and missile center the state department cable said little is known about the css x 11 which could be an extended range variant of the css 7 short range missile u s missile warning satellites detected the launches and the intercept some 155 miles in space but detected no debris the cable said an sc 19 was used previously as the payload booster for the january 11 2007 direct ascent anti satellite da asat intercept of the chinese fy 1c weather satellite the cable said previous sc 19 da asat flight tests were conducted in 2005 and 2006 this test is assessed to have furthered both chinese asat and ballistic missile defense bmd technologies the cable said the u s government in its protest would not disclose that it knows china s asat and missile defense programs are linked the draft demarche demanded to know the purpose of the test and whether it is part of a missile defense system whether china plans to deploy missile defenses for its forces and territory what foreign forces is china planning to target with the missile defenses and whether china tried to limit space debris the protest note also said that if asked by the chinese about u s objections to anti satellite tests they should state u s concerns voiced at the conference on disarmament and at the united nations are still valid and reflect the policy of the united states china apparently gave in to u s and international pressure and since january 2007 has not conducted another asat test mark stokes a chinese arms specialist with the 2049 institute a think tank said the missile defense system was significant the space intercept test conducted last year further demonstrates advances that china has made in its ability to track and engage targets in space whether satellites or ballistic missiles mr stokes said john tkacik a former state department china specialist said he was surprised that the pentagon did not disclose the link between the missile defense test and china s anti satellite system all we got last year was assistant defense secretary chip gregson vaguely saying that the u s was seeking an explanation mr tkacik said we have since been stiff armed by the chinese in every proposal we ve made to sit down and discuss rules of the road on space and strategic weapons but the obama people apparently are trying to play down china s bmd capabilities mr tkacik said the obama administration was so overly focused on arms talks with the russians aimed at reducing nuclear arsenals that it neglected u s missile defenses and ignored china s advances in that weaponry we have to start taking china s space capabilities very seriously he said the chinese have a dozen academies filled with world class space and missile scientists they know what they re doing and they have unlimited funds to do it with honors next step capt owen honors the officer who lost his carrier command for making raunchy onboard videos is asking the secretary of the navy to withhold action on any punishment until a proposed board of inquiry finishes it work last week adm john c harvey who commands fleet forces recommended that the secretary censure capt honors such punishment would end the aviator s career and possibly lead to a demotion but the investigation on which adm harvey acted is not necessarily the last one when he fired capt honors last january as skipper of the uss enterprise he also recommended that the officer be released from the navy it is now up to the navy personnel command to decided whether to hold an inquiry at which capt honors would show why he did nothing wrong and can remain on active duty adm harvey recommended censures for three other officers but not what is called detachment for cause as he did capt honors adm harvey did not relieve any other officers of command or recommend that any others be relieved of command said his spokesman cmdr chris sims therefore he could not make a recommendation that anyone be detached for cause if there is a board navy secretary ray mabus should delay a censure decision because the inquiry may find the officer did nothing wrong capt honor s attorney charles gittins told special correspondent rowan scarborough captain honors provided a personal letter to the secretary of the navy requesting that the secretary not impose a letter of censure because administrative actions including a recommendation for a fact finding adversarial board of inquiry hearing have not been completed and premature action runs the risks of inconsistent determinations mr gittins said wmd terror several terrorist groups including al qaeda continued to seek nuclear chemical and biological weapons according to an annual cia report to congress the so called 721 report after the fiscal 1997 intelligence authorization law requiring it stated that a number of the 33 foreign terrorist groups on the state department s list previously expressed interest in one or more of the weapons of mass destruction capabilities we continue to be concerned about al qaeda s stated intent to conduct unconventional attacks against the united states the report said while counterterrorism actions have disrupted al qaeda s near term effort to develop a sophisticated wmd attack capability we judge the group is still intent on its acquisition no carrier to libya the chief of naval operations told a senate hearing tuesday that the obama administration has not ordered the u s military to move an aircraft carrier close to libya usually one of the first u s reactions to a regional crisis like the civil war in the oil rich north african state under questioning from sen john mccain arizona republican and ranking member of the senate armed services committee adm gary roughead was asked during a committee hearing about u s capabilities for using electronic warfare against the regime of col moammar gadhafi adm roughead said u s navy ea 6bs deployed on the uss enterprise aircraft carrier strike group currently in the red sea would be needed to jam soviet era libyan air defenses are there plans to move it mr mccain asked at the present time the plans are for her to remain in this central command area of operations sir adm roughead said there is no order issued to do that no sir adm roughead said he is hesitant to predict the outcome of the fighting there i think it s still a very uncertain period that bears watching he said and then as some of the thoughts are discussed and debated i believe at least from a military perspective that looking at what some of those details may be ahead of time is very important the issues such as a no fly zone what are the restrictions on use of force what are the basing and the access that might be required and i think all of those need to be sorted through asked later about imposing an air exclusion zone over libya adm roughead said doing so risked launching a conflict one of the things that in addressing a no fly zone is to suppress or destroy any of the air defense systems that could put friendly forces at risk he said so that s the first element i believe of entering into a no fly zone is likely combat operations on libya so in talking about a no fly zone there are some precursor steps that have to be taken sen jim webb virginia democrat said he is opposed to the u s military getting involved in libya we all know that military commitments however small or easily begun and in this region particularly very difficult to end history shows that the former reagan administration navy secretary said this is a region full of surprises and i for one am of the opinion it s not a good idea to give weapons and military support to people who you don t know and when it comes to the opposition in libya we don t know them bill gertz can
