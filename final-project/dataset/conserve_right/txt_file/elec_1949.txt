delray beach fla mitt romney s first debate bounce has evaporated and president obama once again has taken a slim lead in the washington times zogby poll released sunday night though the survey showed mr romney s backers are far more energized about him than the president s backers are about their candidate mr obama leads 49 7 percent to 47 3 percent over mr romney the republican nominee with 3 percent undecided just as striking however is that mr obama s air of inevitability is slipping with 49 percent saying they expect him to win re election the first time that number has dropped below 50 since august another 38 percent say mr romney will win that 11 point gap is down from 22 points two weeks ago and down from 27 points in late september top stories coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history russian fighter jets intercept u s navy patrol aircraft over mediterranean purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni mr romney s backers are far more enthusiastic 71 percent say they are backing him because he is the best candidate in the race among the president s supporters 56 percent say he has earned re election the rest say they are backing mr obama because he is a democrat or because he is the lesser of two evils this is a mixed bag said john zogby the pollster who conducted the survey the president has joined the american public in terms of anxiety and uncertainty over the next 21 2 weeks no one knows including him whether he s going to keep this job or not adding libertarian party nominee gary johnson and other third party candidates into the mix doesn t change the race much mr johnson collects 3 percent of the vote and others get less and mr obama still leads mr romney by 2 percentage points mr obama was seen as the winner of last week s second presidential debate 42 percent to 28 percent over mr romney according to the 80 percent of likely voters who watched at least part of it but the debate didn t move the needle much about 6 percent said it swayed them toward mr obama and 7 percent said they moved toward mr romney the third and final debate will be held monday at lynn university in boca raton fla and will focus on foreign policy mr romney and mr obama took the weekend off from the campaign trail to practice the president headed to camp david and mr romney staked out space in delray beach just north of boca raton where he found time to officiate the coin toss for a beachfront football game between some of his staffers and a few reporters covering the campaign walking back from the game mr romney declined to answer a reporter s question about whether he would be willing to hold one on one talks with iran s leaders something a new york times report this weekend suggested mr obama is ready to do the white house

libya last month is sure to come up in monday s debate in last week s debate mr romney accused mr obama of not spotting the terrorist roots of the assault quickly enough but voters by a 44 percent to 40 percent margin sided with mr obama who said he mentioned terrorism in his first speech after the sept 11 attack still 29 percent of voters blame the white house for mishandling the situation another 16 percent blame the state department 5 percent blame the pentagon and 3 percent blame congress a full 30 percent said nobody was to blame and that the attacks weren t mishandled while the rest weren t sure where to place blame voters were split on two other major issues from last week s debate they were inclined to side with mr romney who charged that mr obama has overseen a drop in oil and gas production on federal lands by a 29 percent to 21 percent margin though another 31 percent said both are partially correct on the key issue of mr romney s tax plan however voters sided with the president who said the republican s math doesn t add up by a 49 percent to 41 percent margin in the previous poll by the times zogby taken two weeks ago voters were evenly split on that question 44 percent to 44 percent mr romney has proposed reducing all tax rates by 20 percent including those at the highest income tax brackets but said he would eliminate some tax loopholes and deductions to recover the money under his plan he said the top 5 percent of taxpayers would continue to pay 60 percent of all income taxes mr obama has taken to calling the plan a sketchy deal and campaigning on saturday in st augustine fla vice president joseph r biden said there aren t enough ways for mr romney to make his plan work there aren t enough loopholes mr biden said adding that mr romney and his running mate rep paul ryan have refused to give any details about their plan republicans say the only way to close the deficit is to cut spending and expand the economy to produce more revenue not to raise taxes president obama has only said that he wants to tax his way out of it romney campaign adviser kevin madden said sunday on cbs face the nation the times zogby poll of 800
