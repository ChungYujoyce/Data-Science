apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the white house national security council staff is being downsized sharply in a bid to improve efficiency within the policy coordinating body by consolidating positions and cutting staff a second unspoken thrust of the overhaul is a hoped for end to what many critics see as a string of politically damaging unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information leaks of president trump s conversations with foreign leaders and other damaging disclosures likely originated with anti trump officials in the white house who stayed over from the obama administration according to several current and former white house officials white house national security adviser robert c o brien is leading the nsc reform effort he revealed in a recent interview with the washington times that 40 to 45 nsc staff officials were sent back in recent months to the agencies where they originally worked with more likely to be moved out top stories hydroxychloroquine

limits on churches we remain on track to meeting the right sizing goal ambassador o brien outlined in october and in fact may exceed that target by drawing down even more positions said nsc spokesman john ullyot under president obama the nsc staff mushroomed to as many as 450 people mr o brien plans to cut the staff to fewer than 120 policy officials by early next year the downsizing will be carried out by consolidating positions and returning officials to agencies and departments such as the cia the state and defense departments and the military mr o brien noted that the nsc had a policymaking staff of 12 in 1962 when president kennedy faced down the soviet union during the cuban missile crisis during the 2000s and the george w bush administration the number of nsc staff members increased sharply to support the three front conflict in iraq afghanistan and the war on terrorism however it was during the obama administration that the nsc was transformed into a major policymaking agency seeking to duplicate the functions of the state and defense departments within the white house the nsc staff became bloated during the prior administration mr o brien said the nsc is a coordinating body i am trying to get us back to a lean and efficient staff that can get the job done can coordinate with our interagency partners and make sure the president receives the best advice he needs to make the decisions necessary to keep the american people safe in the obama administration nsc officials wielded enormous power nsc staff members were known to telephone commanders in afghanistan and other locations in the middle east with orders a violation of the military s strict chain of command said military officials familiar with the calls i just don t think that we need the numbers of people that it expanded to under the last administration to do this job right mr o brien said weaponized leaks the national security adviser did not address the problem of leaks from the white house or nsc staff mr trump s supporters said some parts of the nsc staff appeared to have been weaponized against him early in his administration officials held over from the obama administration are suspected of leaking sensitive details of mr trump s telephone calls with foreign leaders after mr trump s election in november 2016 and continuing through the spring of 2017 a series of unauthorized disclosures to news outlets appeared to come from within the white house several of the leaks involved publication of sensitive transcripts of the president s conversations with foreign leaders rep devin nunes california republican and former chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence said this year that he sent the justice department eight criminal referrals related to the leaks including those related to mr trump s conversations with the leaders of mexico and australia former white house strategist steve bannon said efforts to weed out the obama holdovers was a priority early in the administration the nsc had gotten so big there were over 450 billets said mr bannon adding that he and others tried to remove the obama detailees from the white house we wanted them out he said and i think we would have avoided a lot of the problems we got today if they had been sent back to their agencies the house impeachment of mr trump had its origins with an obama era holdover widely reported to be a cia detailee to the nsc staff the whistleblower filed an official complaint in august saying he had learned secondhand that mr trump s telephone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky involved discussions of former vice president joseph r biden and his son hunter the cia detailee was among the more than 40 officials returned to their agencies another controversial figure on the nsc staff is army lt col alexander vindman who testified against the president during a house impeachment hearing that he was concerned by what he heard on the president s call to ukraine another nsc official tim morrison testified that col vindman was suspected of leaking sensitive information to the press something col vindman later denied the house voted along party lines to impeach mr trump on dec 18 on charges of abusing the office of the president and obstruction of congress a senate trial is pending former nsc staff member rich higgins said the nsc was set up to implement the president s policies through command guidance flowing from the oval office to the nsc and then to the various agencies and departments removing obstructionists under previous trump administration national security advisers the communication flow was usurped as the priorities of senior officials along with those of outside departments and agencies were placed higher than those of mr trump himself mr higgins said the result was a foreign policy that oscillated and pitted trump s voters against what appeared to be a calcified bureaucracy mr higgins said the privilege of serving on the nsc staff was abused by those who took these positions in a willful attempt to obstruct the president s and his voters agenda mr higgins said mr higgins praised mr o brien for eliminating those obstructing mr trump s foreign policy desires from the nsc staff and re orienting the council s mission he called it an important first step now the national security adviser needs to address as he is able to support the coup attempt against the president with all elements of power and to take immediate steps and implement safeguards and precautions to make sure this abuse of our intelligence judicial apparatus never happens again mr higgins said mr o brien told the times that another change he put into place was regular meetings of the nsc principals committee the heads of key security agencies and departments and the deputies committee made up of no 2 officials nsc principals include mr trump vice president mike pence secretary of state mike pompeo treasury secretary steven t mnuchin and defense secretary mark t esper army gen mark a milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff acting director of national intelligence joseph maguire and cia director gina haspel are also nsc members we have time carved out of the calendar every week for principal committee meetings so that we can really make policy across the interagency and ensure that the president is getting the best advice possible mr o brien said we want to coordinate that policy and so far i think we have had a lot of success the security adviser denied critics claims that he has sought to add political appointees to the nsc staff officials picked for senior posts were selected from within the nsc staff and from other agencies longtime nsc asia director matt pottinger was picked for deputy national security adviser along with middle east director victoria coats a second deputy director the nsc executive secretary matthias mitman is a career foreign service officer who came from the state department and worked with mr o brien when he was special presidential adviser for hostage affairs another state department official andrew peek fills the post of senior nsc director for russian affairs so we re putting together a very professional solid management leadership team so far it is going very well morale is high at nsc mr o brien said the 40 to 45 officials who returned to their agencies were sent back because their tours of duty ended or their positions were eliminated as part of the reorganization mr o brien said part of the downsizing also involves consolidating positions most detailees to the nsc will spend no longer than a year in the white house when they return to the department of state or defense or homeland security they will be better foreign service officers better military officers better homeland security officials because they spent time here at the white house he said we are all serving here for a relatively short period of time the nsc should not be a career position that is not how it was designed and that is not ho
