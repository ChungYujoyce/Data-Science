 sign in politics is war but some republicans just don t get it manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion republicans are going to dominate the midterm elections but it would be a foolish gamble to count on them to win the 2016 presidential contest why is that democrats are now a party of the left no more john kennedys no more joe liebermans that means they are driven by ideology and not the pragmatic outlook that used to be the two party norm ideology soon disconnects you from reality which is why democrats will lose in november that s the downswing during the upswing though ideological passion provides a sense of mission and hope that can win over gullible majorities in 2008 when barack obama promised to turn back the tides and fundamentally transform america he took enough of the american people with him to become the 44th president of the united states it was a baseless deceptive empty headed hope that made him seem the answer to so many unfounded prayers mr obama was a lifelong anti american radical and a world class liar he was not going to lead americans into a post racial bipartisan future as he promised it has taken years for a majority of the american people to realize that top stories australian researchers see virus design manipulation oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens gall and nerve val demings rips trump for trying to capitalize on biden you ain t black comment republicans will win the midterms because six years of radical policies have brought this country low the worst economic recovery since the great depression the worst unemployment and greatest expansion of people on the dole an ongoing disaster to the health care system the destruction of america s borders and a global power vacuum deliberately created by a leftist commander in chief which has been filled by the greatest threat to american security since the onset of the cold war accordingly in this election cycle the american people are fed up and they re going to turn out the party responsible that is just this round though and there are two years until the next one a lifetime politically speaking mr obama is not an aberration but a culmination of what has been happening to the democratic party during the last four decades if mr obama is prepared to lie to conceal his real agenda so is the leadership of the democratic party sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts a longtime advocate for america s retreat has suddenly emerged as a hawk on the islamic state as has hillary clinton who presided over america s catastrophic retreat while mr obama struggles to make the two sides of his mouth look like one both ms warren and mrs clinton rush to disassociate themselves from his cowardly retreats you can expect the democrats to reposition themselves on many other fronts as well going into the 2016 election you can count on republicans to stay positive to emphasize policy and above all not to hit the democrats where it hurts you can also count on democrats to do just the opposite because they always do mike tyson once said everyone has a game plan until you punch them in the mouth democrats have a massive punch in the mouth for republicans and it s always the same punch republicans are painted as racists sexists homophobes anti poor people selfish and uncaring note that this is a moral indictment it defames the character of republicans like the corporate predator and dog abuser mitt romney the only answer to an attack like this is to attack democrats with an equally potent indictment of their moral character for example democrats are actually the party of racists supporters of the lynch mob in ferguson mo controllers of america s inner cities enemies of poor black and hispanic children trapped in the public schools they control and so forth no republican to my knowledge has ever called democrats racists yet the latter send their own kids to private schools while denying children who are poor black and hispanic the right to do so how racist is that al sharpton is the president s chief adviser on race republicans will never lay a glove on him for these obscenities i have just published a book take no prisoners the battle plan for defeating the left using these principles i m not holding my breath that any republicans will listen though they are too intent on telling positive stories proposing workable policies and pretending that people will give them a fair hearing despite the fact that their opposition is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to portray them as racists women haters and enemies of the poor how difficult is it to understand this if you are perceived by voters as racist or even just selfish and uncaring they are not going to have the same interest in your policy advice as mr romney found out in 2012 here is what republicans need to understand to win politics is a street war and there are no referees to maintain the rules and the ones that infrequently pop up such as cnn s candy crowley during one of the last presidential debates are there to bury you attack your opponents before they attack you attack them with a moral indictment if well executed it will win the day and remember that even if you fail to do this to them they will certainly do it to you you can count on that david horowitz is the author of take no prisoners the battle plan for defeating
