tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn support for beginning the impeachment process against president trump has surged over the last week and yet voters aren t quite sure the president has done anything illegal even more confounding is that voters still give mr trump among his best job approval ratings since he took office in january 2017 it s an odd dichotomy that pollsters labored to explain and it could go a long way toward determining whether house democrats ultimately take the next step of drawing up articles of impeachment against the president top stories trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the latest survey from cbs news on sunday showed 55 of americans support house speaker nancy pelosi s move last week to launch an impeachment inquiry after new allegations that he sought to rope ukraine s government into investigating democratic presidential candidate joseph r biden but only 41 say the president has broken the law with what he did gop pollsters say those numbers are likely inflated against mr trump cbs polled residents rather than likely or even registered voters the categories that matter when it comes to whether an issue has power at the ballot box still there s little doubt the reluctance to contemplate impeachment which long reigned in polling has turned into a willingness to consider it morning consult politico s tracking survey late last week after the revelations found 43 say it s time to begin up from 36 just a week earlier support among democrats grew by 13 percentage points to about four out of five but so did support among independents who just a week ago were decidedly opposed by a 13 point margin now they are in favor 39 to 36 even among republicans support for impeachment has grown though at 10 it s still not much of a factor matt mcdermott a democratic pollster said mrs pelosi s reluctance to back impeachment had kept a lid on public support now her embrace has brought democrats and some independents along not to be cliche but voters are motivated by leaders who lead he said they want to feel that they re making the right choices politically these types of cues from political leaders are important and explain why we re already seeing perception shifts around impeachment following the support of a formal inquiry by house leaders he said particularly worrying for the gop was the rise in support among independents he said republicans had expected independents to balk at impeachment but there s no sign yet of such a backlash republican pollsters questioned the sampling decisions of some of the new polls but also said they re not surprised nor worried by the new impeachment support gop pollster michael mckenna said the impeachment question is essentially now the equivalent of asking whether mr trump should be reelected he said there are still some voters who view impeachment seriously but this near to the start of voting in democratic primaries for most the impeachment question is about whether to retain mr trump in office rather than a look at whether he s guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors they may as well when you ask about impeachment ask president trump yes or no mr mckenna said this is all about the campaign jim mclaughlin a trump campaign pollster points to a survey he did earlier in september before the latest impeachment developments that asked whether voters wanted to see congressional democrats focus on impeachment or legislating two thirds said legislating he said that s a good place for mr trump to be and it s showing up in those job approval numbers which are higher than they ve been since the immediate days after he took office in 2017 in national polling mr trump is at about 45 maintaining the level he s been at since a bump after his state of the union speech mr mclaughlin says his surveys are even better we ve consistently had him about 47 48 job approval he said that rising approval spurred democrats to go for impeachment he also said there could be an element of preemption in that democrats are worried about what the justice department s investigation into the obama administration s handling of the 2016 election will show and impeachment is a preemptive strike once they saw the president s numbers going up they said we gotta do something so they made this thing up he said he predicted the impeachment push will serve to unify republicans heading into 2020 consolidating mr trump s backers the millions of dollars the trump campaign raised in the hours after democrats announced their impeachment inquiry was the first tangible sign of that in cbs s poll 59 of republicans said mrs pelosi s move makes them want to defend mr trump but a surprisingly strong 34 said they re looking to see what develops just 7 suspect mr trump of wrongdoing alex swoye
