wallace voice over we ll ask our sunday panel what will happen to the dreamers all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington we begin with breaking news north korea has conducted its most powerful nuclear test today it claims to have exploded a hydrogen bomb much more powerful than the five atomic bombs it has tested since 2006 in a moment we will have a exclusive interview with treasury secretary steve munchin a member of the president aposs national security council but first let aposs bring in chief white house correspondent john roberts with the latest john john roberts fox news chief white house correspondent chris good morning and the real concern here if the pictures out of north korea are to be believed that this could be a thermonuclear warhead capable of being mounted on top of an intercontinental ballistic missile the national security adviser h r mcmaster talked with the south korean counterpart about an hour after the test and the president tweeting this morning quote north korea has conducted a major nuclear test their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the united states and the president also putting more pressure on china tweeting quote north korea is a rogue nation which has become a grave threat and embarrassment to china which is trying to help but with little success earlier last month when the first u s detected new preparations for another nuclear test the president raised a lot of eyebrows when he threatened north korea with what sounded like military action which the president later seem to indicate may have made a difference in north korea aposs behavior listen here begin video clip trump they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen kim jong un i respect the fact that i believe he is starting to respect us end video clip roberts since president trump said that he thinks that kim jong un may be starting to respect the united states in august the 22nd north korea has fired a bunch of smaller missiles in the sea of japan fired an intercontinental medium range ballistic missile over japan and now this missile test president trump tweeted again today that talking with north korea is not the answer writing quote south korea is finding as i ve told them that their talk of appeasement with north korea will not work they understand only one thing no word from the president on what that quote one thing is but i think it aposs only fair to say chris that the white house has been pursuing in terms of north korea policy has not been working either chris wallace john roberts reporting from the white house john thanks for that joining me now treasury secretary steve mnuchin who is a member of the national security council mr secretary i know that you have spoken with the president this morning what is his reaction to the news that north korea has tested another bomb they say a hydrogen bomb but certainly its most powerful explosive in its 10 12 years of testing steven mnuchin secretary of treasury well good morning i did speak with the president and it aposs clear that this behavior is completely unacceptable we aposve already started with sanctions against north korea but i m going to draft a sanctions package to send to the president for his strong consideration that anybody that wants to do trade or business with them would be prevented from doing trade or business with us we are going to work with our allies we ll work with china but people need to cut off north korea economically this is unacceptable behavior wallace does that mean when you talk about a new trade sanction package that we re going to be much tougher than we have been so far on chinese financial institutions chinese companies mnuchin well we re going to strongly consider everything at this point and again i will draft a package for his strong consideration that would go as far as cutting off all trade and other business and this behavior is unacceptable and if countries want to do business with the united states they obviously will be working with our allies and others to cut off north korea economically wallace i know it aposs early at this point mr secretary but first of all do we believe the chinese reports that this was not an atomic bomb but a much more powerful hydrogen bomb did our intelligence community believe they have that capability and i also want to put up a picture that the north koreans put out yesterday and it shows kim they said expecting what they believe they say was a nuclear warhead to be put on a ballistic missile do we believe they have not only the hydrogen bomb capability but also the miniaturization to put a warhead with that kind of a weapon on a missile mnuchin chris i can only say that our intelligence community has been doing an amazing job on this and on other issues i obviously can apost describe or discuss some of the things that you aposve asked me but i can say the intelligence community has done an incredible job wallace president trump and john roberts just reported this put out a tweet today saying that the north koreans only understand one thing i wonder in your conversation with the president did he explain what that one thing is and the president has been talking about warning north korea not to reach a tipping point which would unleash the fire and fury of the u s are we getting closer to that tipping point mnuchin well chris what i would say is the president made it clear this isn t the time for just talk this is time for action that this type of behavior is not acceptable and our objective has been and will continue to be too denuclearized the peninsula that these types of tests are not being part of the world community wallace but does this put us closer to you talk about sanctions diplomatic efforts does this put us closer to a military response sir mnuchin again chris i think the president made it clear that he will consider everything but we are not going to broadcast our actions and you know we ll continue to look at all our options but my focus right now working with the president with others to make sure that we put additional economic sanctions we work with china and others china has a lot of trade with them there aposs a lot we can do to cut them off economically much more than we aposve done already wallace finally i want to ask you about another economic question in this regard there are reports that president trump is considering pulling out of our free trade agreement with south korea one is is that true and secondly why would he consider doing that at a time when we need to work with south korea to face the threat from north korea mnuchin well chris the president has made clear that when we had trade deficits with countries we re going to renegotiate those deals in the case of south korea we obviously provide a lot of military assistance and others and what we re doing to protect them and the president has made it clear that we want a better economic deal but there aposs been no decisions made other than renegotiating that trade agreement at this point wallace secretary mnuchin thank you and we will see you a little later in the program to discuss the president and his agenda thank you for now sir mnuchin thank you wallace now to hurricane harvey the big story at this point is life after the storm hundreds of thousands are still displaced by last week aposs flooding many still living in shelters president trump and the first lady visited the area yesterday meeting with victims of harvey fox news correspondent peter doocy is in houston peter peter doocy fox news correspondent chris texas displaced by high water are already doing with red tape but president trump sought to cut through it yesterday by trying to resolve a dispute one evacuee said he was having with fema begin video clip unidentified male inaudible trump where are they where are they get him up get him up here unidentified male ok yes sir end video clip doocy as the president handed out hotdogs and played with kids at the nrg center s mega shelter his education secretary betsy devos was nearby her department will also needs new students for 12 000 students in houston alone hud secretary ben carson was there too his department will soon need to find temporary housing for many of the 43 000 texans who fema says have sought shelters since harvey hit from the shelter the presidential motorcade travel to first church to help load water and food on vehicles bound for flood victims in need and the president who was asking congress for almost 8 billion in emergency funding also repeatedly applauded the federal relief efforts thus far begin video clip trump then it s a long time i mean we are talking about they say two years three years i think that you know because this is texas you ll will probably do it in six months i have a feeling here cheers and applause end video clip doocy but the water is still rising and part of west houston near the addicks and barker dams where as many as 300 residents remained last night in a mandatory evacuation area so the power company is going around this morning cutting off service to those homes trying to encourage everyone that lives there and hasn t left you to get to safety chris wallace peter thank you joining me now is texas governor greg abbott governor welcome back to fox news sunday gov greg abbott r texas thank you so much chris wallace now that the floodwaters are beginning and i emphasize beginning to recede what aposs your biggest concern right now abbott well first again in that area just mentioned we re concerned about rising water we have rising water still in the beaumont area and other parts of the state of texas that we need to still to be involved in the search and rescue process but then the rebuilding process and this is where the long haul begins i was in houston yesterday with the president we could go from neighborhood to neighborhood to see how all these homes are digging out pulling everything out of her house sheet rock flooring et cetera and now we get into the long process and this is where we come to the part where congress plays a role the president has indicated that he aposs asking for more than 7 billion as a down payment on this we need congress to step up and pass this and help texas rebuild but i want you to know that texans themselves and in fact people across the country are helping us do that through a fund that we have run by the state of texas called rebuildtx org that s rebuildtx org wallace i want before we get to congress and that s certainly an important part of this equation how toxic are the floodwaters that are still around how serious is the pollution and perhaps toxic pollution from some of these chemical plants and will that be a continuing health hazards sir abbott well chris in any type of flood especially any type of hurricane based flood there are going to be issues about contaminated water it could involve chemicals it could involve waste people need to be very cautious as they go through the rebuilding process understanding that the water has been contaminated separated from that you aposre talking about chemicals they could be from waste sites in the greater houston area the epa is monitoring that the epa is going to get on top of that we are working with the epa to make sure that we contain any of these chemicals harming anybody in the greater houston area or any other place wallace i take your point about the fact that texans are going to help themselves none of us are surprised by that but i want to get your latest estimate on how much money you think that you re going to need from washington and what do you think of the president aposs initial request from congress of 8 billion abbott chris understand this and that is both the geographic area and the population affected by this horrific hurricane and flooding not just in houston but also in the beaumont area is far larger than the population and geographic area of katrina katrina cost if i recalled more than 120 billion now when you look at the number of homes and businesses affected by this i think this will cost well over 120 billion probably 150 billion to 180 billion what the president has done now is make an initial request before the end of this funding cycle to get things up and running that request as i understand is over 7 billion and i think congress understands this is a down payment on something that would cost far more understanding again this is far larger than hurricane sandy that i think was around 40 billion to 50 billion and so we have a long road to hoe if we re going to rebuild the fourth largest city in the united states as well as the entire geographic region wallace couple of questions about the president aposs trip yesterday you were with him in the houston area one i assume that you have you are too smart to not have pressed him on the amount of money that you re going to need did he have a sense or did he make any commitment we re talking about more than 100 billion and secondly take us behind the scenes what struck you about his interaction with the people of houston abbott well first the president both did and has made a lot lettuce specific commitments basically he has told me and he s acted upon what he said that whatever texas needs texas is going to get we made several specific requests yesterday and before yesterday the president has granted as it concerns the larger funding of course that aposs going to be something the president has to work with congress on yesterday i got to tell you that the president was warm and compassionate and caring we made several stops first at one of the large relocation centers at nrg center which is right next to the houston texans play and he would work at a play area with young kids and would hold young kids and kiss them and hug them and support them second we fed lunch to people who are evacuees at this location and then third we went a church where volunteers were providing services to our fellow texans and i got to tell you chris what our fellow texans are doing helping each other out these are the real heroes of this whole process and that process can be aided if people can go to rebuildtx org and help out wallace finally governor i want to ask you about the related issue the president is going to announce on tuesday what he aposs going to do about the daca program texas has the second most dreamers of any country any state in the country second only to california i know you have when you were attorney general opposed his obama aposs executive orders what do you think about the possibility of the president ending at the daca program putting these dreamers at risk of deportation particularly those right now in the houston area who you are just trying to help out and recover from the flood abbott well chris we need to recognize that this is really a symptom of a larger problem that remains unresolved we wouldn apost have this whole issue about daca if congress would step up and pass immigration reform and do so in working with the president we will continue to have challenges like this that lasted until both the congress and president step up and pass comprehensive immigration reform wallace did you ask discuss daca with the president yesterday i know you had a lot go ahead abbott i spent a lot of time talking to the president not just yesterday but in his prior trip and over the phone i got to tell you that what the president s talked to me about exclusively is his compassion and commitment to helping texans dig out of this hurricane and as a result issues like daca and other related issues never came up wallace governor abbott thank you again this is the second time we aposve met like this thanks for your time sir we ll stay on top we promise of how folks in your state are doing in the days ahead abbott please do thank you so much wallace up next we ll drill on how harvey will affect president trump aposs agenda here in washington treasury secretary steve mnuchin joins us again to talk about that commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway at downtown houston where the sun is out but much of the city is still flooded more than one week after hurricane harvey made landfall it aposs not just residents of texas who are digging out from harvey here in washington the president and congress will be working for years on how to pay for disaster relief and long term recovery and that could have a dramatic effect on the trump agenda rejoining is now treasury secretary steve mnuchin to talk about his day job mr secretary thanks again steven mnuchin secretary of treasury thank you chris wallace let aposs start with the effect of hurricane harvey on the nation aposs finances the white house is asking congress for 7 8 billion in immediate aid plus another 6 7 billion within weeks ahead of the house of freedom caucus mark meadows says he does not want to see that disaster aid tied to a bill to raise the debt limit can you guarantee him and others that that won apost happen mnuchin no i can apost quite the contrary the president and i believe that it should be tied to the harvey funding our first priority is to make sure that the state gets money it is critical and to do that we need to make sure we raise the debt limit so if we if congress appropriates the money but i don apost have the ability to borrow more money and pay for it we re not going to be able to get that money to the state so we need to put politics aside and we re going to be urging congress to get both of those things done as quickly as they can wallace but i just want to make sure because this is new news as they say there aposs talk that the house is going to take up that s almost a billion dollars in disaster relief this next week you aposre saying that you want to see a clean debt limit without any other spending cuts tied to that disaster relief mnuchin i do that is our priority at this point we need to put politics aside we need to make sure that we can get to texas the appropriate amount of money to rebuild the state it is absolutely critical and the president is committed to making sure that the states have the money that they need wallace and again just to pin this down if the debt limit isn apost raised will that interfere with the relief effort mnuchin it will prior to harvey i think you know i ve said we have enough funding to go through the end of september and had urged congress to focus on this before that period of time but with harvey it s moved the situation up earlier and without raising the debt limit i m not comfortable that we will get the money that we need this month to texas to rebuild and i think as you know that aposs our priority we need to help the people in texas and we need to get that done wallace i want to ask you about another part of the immediate agenda president trump threatened recently that he would be willing to shut down the government if he didn apost get money as part of a government funding bill to build the wall or begin building the wall the government runs out of money on this september 30th with harvey with the disaster relief with all these top priority to help the people in texas at least for now is that threat to shut down the government over the border wall is that out the window mnuchin chris i can apost really comment if it aposs out the window or it s not out the window and again i know the wall is a huge priority to the president and we want to make sure that we get money for that i would say the president and my first objective right now is for the people of texas and make sure that we get the funding to do that so that aposs what we re focused on this week and we ll be meeting with leadership of both parties to work on that wallace you aposve got a lot of top priorities but your long term top priority right now is tax reform the white house is pushing out that the president made a new push last week but in terms of details the administration seems to be going backwards and i want to ask you about that sir here aposs what you laid out in april a 15 percent corporate tax rate individual tax brackets of 10 25 and 35 percent repeal the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax eliminate or at least reduce tax breaks for the wealthy but keep the deductions for home mortgages and charitable contributions mr secretary are all of those elements still in the president s tax reform plan mnuchin chris i don apost think we aposve been going backwards at all as a matter fact i think we ve made a lot of progress and as you know i ve been working on tax reform with the president for over the last year and a half starting on the campaign we did two economic speeches both in detroit and new york when we were thinking about this during the campaign and now as president this is also one of his biggest priorities to create economic growth so we d been working since january with the leadership in the house and the senate we want to make sure we have one plan not three plans the objective is to get this passed and get it to the president aposs desk this year we aposve gone through lots of details the plan is still similar to what you aposve described that we put out in the one page but we aposve been working with the house and the senate going through lots of complicated details they re beginning to socialize it with the members and i look forward to seeing a bill this year signed on the president s desk wallace are you insisting because the president didn apost say this in his speech in missouri this past week are you still insisting that this will be revenue neutral that it won t add to the deficit that if you lower rates you ll also take away some deductions or tax breaks to pay for it or could this just turn into tax cuts and if so given what you just heard from governor abbott about 100 billion 150 billion 180 billion in federal money need for harvey won apost this blow a hole in the deficit mnuchin well chris the president has been very focused on the national debt and concern that it s gone from 10 trillion to 20 trillion that aposs a big concern of ours so we want to make sure we can pay for things but the way we re going to pay for things is with economic growth the difference between 2 percent and 3 percent is trillions of dollars of revenue to the government so i think we may be in a situation where the administration believes we ll get more economic growth than perhaps the models that come out of congress but we ll be working with them on that and i think now more than ever it aposs too early to tell what the economic impact of harvey is but now more than ever we need to make sure we pass tax reform regulatory relief and trade negotiation so we create a 3 percent or higher gdp in this country and rebuild what we need to rebuild wallace just to bottom that up though sir i you aposre certainly not indicating that this bill will be revenue neutral in terms of what money the treasury loses in through lower tax rates and what it gains from fewer deductions mnuchin well again what we aposve said is we believe in dynamic scoring and under our growth models at the treasury this will pay for itself and again we may not get full credit for that there may be short term impacts on the deficit but we re very we want to be very careful in paying for this with growth but we also need to boost the economy we need tax cuts and tax reform now wallace i ve got two more questions i want to try to squeeze in here and we ve got a couple of minutes mr secretary president trump said this week that cutting the corporate tax rate will primarily benefit workers here he is begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for americans it aposs time to give american workers the pay raise that they been looking for for many many years end video clip wallace but sir independent experts including your own treasury department say that shareholders people who own stock get they are 75 percent to 85 percent of the burden from higher corporate tax rates and that if those corporate tax rates are lowered that they will get 75 percent to 85 percent of the benefit not the workers mnuchin chris most economists believe that over 70 percent of corporate taxes are paid for by the workers and the fact that the treasury department i think it was eight or 10 years ago put out a piece otherwise i don apost believe in that our current economic team does not believe in that there is lots of economic research we need to create a business tax system that s competitive we have one of the highest tax rates in the world we tax on worldwide income there s 3 trillion to 5 trillion sitting offshore and the president and i are completely focused on creating something that aposs good for american workers that will create american jobs and bring back american manufacturing and we have to be competitive that aposs something that people understand and just as ronald reagan did tax rate from 30 years ago the president is focused on getting it done now wallace ok one last question less than a minute i want to turn to daca and its impact on the economy because this week some 400 business leaders sent the president a letter saying if the 780 000 dreamers who now work are put at risk of deportation the economy will lose 460 billion plus 24 6 billion in social security and medicare taxes briefly sir would ending daca forgetting the other aspects of it would ending daca hurt the economy mnuchin chris i think this is a complicated issue there s a lot of important issues that are on the agenda this week as it relates to immigration the president is very focused on legal immigration as you said this is a complicated issue and something i m sure the president will consider carefully as it relates to the economic impact i am less concerned about the economic impact we ll make sure that we have plenty of workers in this economy we want to put more people back to work there aposs a lot of people that left the workforce and our objective is to bring them back into the workforce wallace secretary mnuchin thank you thanks for joining us good to talk with you and thank you for doing double duty for us today sir mnuchin thank you chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss north korea aposs test of its most powerful nuclear bomb yet and what the u s can do about it commercial break wallace coming up president trump set to decide this week whether to end the daca program begin video clip sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary the president aposs been very clear he loves people and he wants to make sure that this decision is done correctly end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what will happen to the dreamers commercial break begin video clip rex tillerson secretary of state we aposre going to continue our our peaceful pressure campaign as i have described it working with allies working with china as well to see if we can bring the regime in pyongyang to the negotiating table with a view to begin a dialogue on a different future or korean peninsula and for north korea end video clip wallace secretary of state rex tillerson last week here on fox news sunday pushing for a diplomatic solution to our standoff with north korea will today aposs apparent test of a hydrogen bomb change that policy it aposs time not to bring in our sunday group the head of heritage action for america michael needham marie harf a state department official in the obama administration jeff mason who covers the white house for reuters and former republican congressman jason chaffetz who aposs now a fox news contributor well congressman let me start with you your reaction to what seems to be a dramatic escalation in north korea aposs nuclear program what they are saying is their first test of a hydrogen bomb jason chaffetz fox news contributor it is an escalation and we aposre going to have to ramp it up and we aposve tried everything from sending in dennis rodman to boosting up the military presence but i think a lot of focus has to go to japan go on on china the the secretary earlier in this program talked about new sanctions with anybody doing business with north korea well the main trading partner with north korea is china and it will be very interesting to see how far this administration takes those types of sanctions but china has the most vested interest in making that change there but it aposs hard when more than 1 trillion of our united states debt is owned by the chinese that puts us in a very precarious position wallace yes marie i want to pick up on that with you as a veteran of the state department your reaction to what has happened today in north korea and to be fair your president and george w bush and bill clinton all tried and they have all failed to stop north korea from pursuing its nuclear ambitions marie harf former state department spokesperson that aposs right and north korea has shown that no amount of international isolation has has dissuaded them from pursuing this program so many administrations have tried there are no perfect options there aren apost even really great ones but two things i think are important the president needs to be very clear that right now is not the time to renegotiate the south korean trade agreements now is not the time to threaten them wallace why not harf because we need to stand shoulder to shoulder with them we need to focus on the real threat here which is north korea and to be fair the south korean trade agreement aposs a pretty good one the president aposs tweet this morning about appeasement when he basically said the south korean government was wrong that is breaking news already in seoul this morning we aposve already seen reaction out of there this is the time to stand squarely with our allies because as i said there are certainly no good military options we had to make it clear to north korea that if they do anything like attacking the u s that their regime will be destroyed and i think the president has to walk a fine line in doing that wallace and what do you think of secretary mnuchin and he had just gotten off the phone with president trump harf that aposs right wallace saying much tougher sanctions and much more targeted on china harf absolutely sanctions have to be a key part of this strategy here but they have to be combined with other things like making sure missile defense keeps getting better and better making sure the south koreans and the japanese have what they need to defend themselves and making clear to north korea that this is not acceptable and making sure the american people understand the real threat here not an expiratory rhetoric cycle that we aposve seen before but being very clear eyed about it michael i want to bring you into the conversation a bunch of things here to talk about the north korean test the word from secretary mnuchin a new sanctions regime and also this question of is this the right time to possibly pull out of our free trade agreement with south korea michael needham ceo heritage action for america yes we need a full sanctions and pressure regime we need ballistic missile defense we need secretary ph sanctions on china if they aposre not willing to participate that types of sanctions that were in place on iran previous to president obama aposs unadvised iranian deal were far tougher than anything north korean has been under so the president isn apost saying isn apost accurate when he aposs saying that north korea is more isolated than any other country ever has been i do agree now is not the right time to pull out of the korea free trade agreement that aposs an important free trade agreement it benefits farmers and ranchers across america but the same is also true of south korea south korea and president moon had talked about restarting the kaesong industrial complex this was a joint south korea north korea industrial complex that was started about 20 years ago it was it was the expansion of it was stopped in 2006 after a nuclear test it was pulled out of in 2016 i think if american and korea are going to stand side by side we should stay in our free trade agreement but i think it would be a big disaster also for south korea to reopen the kaesong industrial complex wallace jeff i want to to a certain degree this all feels like groundhog day to me that the clock is waking up you know is ringing at six in the morning and i aposm hearing i got you babe again you know we how many times have we seen that there aposs a north korean missile test or a nuclear test we huff and puff we talk about military options we talk about sanctions we talk about pressure in china you aposve been covering the white house now for what nine years everybody back to bill clinton has tried it it never works jeff mason reuters yes that aposs right i mean bill clinton actually during his presidency agreed on a package of giving 4 billion in energy aid to north korea that ended up not happening president obama asked south asked his military to work together with south korea to prepare for a potential attack george w bush called north korea the axis of evil or part of the axis of evil so you aposve heard rhetoric like this you aposve heard words from president and now of course you have president trump really raising his rhetoric up in terms of talking about fire and fury the question is will any of that matter and where is it going wallace and what aposs the answer mason well the answer is we had to see what happens with north korea and see what happens with china president trump has certainly working very hard to build a relationship with president xi of china but he aposs shown increasing frustrations with the fact that that relationship is not paying off and you know was there as they aposre deciding whether or not to put more sanctions and economic pressure on china as secretary mnuchin said you have to also wonder if that aposs going to alienate a very key partner chaffetz but i i don apost i don apost think sanctions would ever work i don apost think the president of north korea cares about its his people he is only focused on obtaining nuclear capability wallace ok let me interrupt for a second congressman because we aposve been talking around this the one thing we really haven apost discussed is a military option is there a realistic credible military option chaffetz i hope we never get to that point but i do think the focus of the world has got to be with china because north korea aposs trading partner is china and if china is not going to live up to the obligation to help what they did under the u n i mean i was very pleased with what nikki haley and the u n was able to to achieve but china has really got to be the focus here harf and the but the cost of even a perfect first military strike the cost of that would be so appalling in terms of casualties not just in south korea and japan but costly to american service members who are still serving over there the cost of a military option would be astronomical none of which i think we aposve thought through wallace all right we have to take a break here but when we come back the president is set to announce his decision for daca this week what will happen to the hundreds of thousands of dreamers in the u s plus what would you like to ask the panel about president trump aposs response to harvey just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump what are you building inaudible end video clip wallace president trump meeting yesterday with victims of the destruction left by harvey in his second trip to texas this week and we aposve back now with the panel well we asked you four questions for our sunday group and on the issue of the president aposs response to harvey we got this on facebook from paige williams she writes what are the differences between how trump responded to harvey versus past presidents and their biggest disaster jeff how do you answer page mason well the president got some criticism rightly or wrongly on tuesday for not showing enough empathy but when he went on tuesday to texas he didn apost go into the middle really of the disaster zone because it was still being worked on there was still a lot of response going so what he did yesterday was meet with some of the victims you know do some of those things that presidents do and help put some aid into trucks and a church you know it aposs comparable but there will be people who say it aposs not it aposs not the same wallace but forget the presidential optics at the moment because in the end it doesn t matter very much mason yes wallace in terms of fema and in terms of aid on the ground what aposs your sense of how the federal response is going mason so far it seems like the federal response has been very positive i mean the the there aposs been very little criticism coming from the state where it aposs actually affecting or which has actually been affected you had government governor abbott on your program earlier he aposs been very complementary unlike katrina where clearly aid wasn apost getting there fast enough this response appears to have been very rapid wallace also we have to say because the first responders are the state and the local government mason right wallace texas seems to have done a much better job than new orleans and louisiana did mason absolutely wallace michael they aposre i have a feeling i aposm going to get to a negative point right now because the news that secretary mnuchin made earlier in the program is he said we want any disaster aid and they aposre talking about 8 billion this week linked to a clean debt limit bill because we aposre not going to be able to provide all that disaster aid billions of dollars unless we have raised the debt limit your reaction to that needham yes i didn apost really understand why he thinks the two things need to be linked everybody agrees that we should get the 15 billion of real emergency relief that aposs necessary out to texas i talked to mark meadows yesterday wallace chairman of the house freedom caucus needham chairman of the house freed caucus conservatives in the house are tied to that i think that exploiting this hurricane of people who lost their house houses to allow business as usual in washington of getting an 18 month increase to our nation aposs debt limit passed of continuing to spend money that we can apost afford that we don apost have makes absolutely no sense if there aposs some sort of technical reason that it in order to get 15 billion out it would be very very small a couple billion dollar increase of the debt limit is necessary then of course nobody would have that but i just completely disagree with secretary mnuchin that in order to deliver relief to the people of houston to the people of texas which we and louisiana which we obviously want to do that an 18 month increase of our nation aposs debt limit is necessary it makes absolutely no sense wallace but he clearly was pushing that line today and he a couple of times invoked president trump to make it clear that the president wants a clean debt limit tied into disaster relief you say you aposve been talking to the head of the house freedom caucus will they oppose that needham you know i well i think they will first of all if there aposs a clean debt limit increase it doesn apost matter what it aposs attached to you have to go back to kind of first principles why is it that 100 years ago america voluntarily decided to put a debt limit on ourselves and we said it makes sense to have a smoke alarm in our fiscal house and when that smoke alarm goes off everyone agrees we need to raise the debt limit but you should also start taking the types of steps that are necessary to make sure that our children and grandchildren don apost suffer under debts that they can apost afford to pay wallace well not only is that going to be a big issue here in washington this week what aposs going to happen with disaster relief another big issue is the president is going to announce his decision on daca during the campaign candidate trump promised to end the daca program which protects hundreds of thousands of so called dreamers from deportation but as president he aposs made it clear he is struggling with this take a look begin video clip trump daca is a very very difficult subject for me i will tell you to me it aposs one of the most difficult subjects i have because you have these incredible kids they shouldn apost be very worried they are here illegally they shouldn apost be very worried i do have a big heart end video clip wallace now congressman chaffetz the president has said he is going to announce what he aposs going to do on daca on tuesday which is also the day that ten states are saying that they are going to file suit against the government because they claim daca as an executive order is unconstitutional but a lot of republicans starting with your own former house speaker he aposs still the house speaker but you aposre a former congressman paul ryan says that he shouldn apost end daca is ryan and are those other republicans wrong chaffetz well the president has a mandate based on the election to lock down that border get rid of the reward incentives to be here illegally and reject amnesty i do think the president based on my conversations with people on the hill the last 48 hours or so i think what the president is going to do is give a window of opportunity for congress to actually do something on immigration reform over a six month period that aposs my best guess as to what aposs going to happen i don apost think you aposll see him clearly just cut it off the very next day you know later this week i don apost think that aposs going to happen and i think the president does have a big heart and it is difficult to deal with somebody who was brought here as a two year old but the president had also campaigned on the idea that we aposre not going to provide rewards and incentives i do think it will be an impetuous to luis gutierrez and other members on the democratic side of the aisle to the table to know that they aposre going to have to actually work in a bipartisan way to try to achieve some of the things that the president has gotten elected on wallace well let me make sure i understand what you aposre suggesting say that we aposre going to end daca but give a six month window for congress to do something and of course the obvious question then is would funding for the border wall be part of that deal chaffetz well again i it has to get they have to get the funding for the border wall it aposs a modest amount it aposs less than 2 billion out of a 4 trillion budget i do think the president will get that money but i also think you aposll see a continued resolution that will punt some of these really tough decisions down to later in december i i wallace let aposs ruin our christmas and new year aposs chaffetz yes wallace let aposs do that chaffetz yes yes wallace marie i want to bring you in because look people can disagree with the merits of protecting the dreamers whether it creates an incentive whether it aposs amnesty on the other hand there certainly is a legitimate argument that president obama acted illegally unconstitutionally and doing this by executive order and it should be better done by congress harf well and the courts i think are going to take they have been looking at it and they will continue to i get nervous relying on congress right now to fix anything because they aposve shown themselves incapable of being able to pass anything major even though they control both the house the senate and the white house look there are 141 000 daca recipients just in texas to bring together harvey in texas for a second these are people we aposve seen stories there aposs a houston area paramedic who aposs been saving lives of people who is a daca recipient getting rid of this without a plan to replace it as the congressman talked about congress you know may fix it it seems to me to just quite frankly be mean and i hate to use that word but it seems mean it also is bad economics you ask secretary mnuchin about that during your interview with him and he kind of wavered on that because there are studies that say if you kick out all these people we will lose billions and billions of dollars in revenue chaffetz but if the democrats thought this was such an imperative when they had the house and senate and the presidency guess what they didn apost do anything with it president obama harf that was a long time ago chaffetz president the president obama didn apost do anything on this it fell wallace selective memory harf it aposs been a while chaffetz two ph months before a presidential election that aposs the reality of it harf well let aposs all put our hopes in congress to actually get something done on this point mason there is a reason that businesses are pushing the president not to do this harf that aposs right mason i mean there is definitely an economic piece to this that that the president is clearly considering and that business and republicans and democrats are involved ph wallace i got 15 seconds how would you feel if he did what congressman chaffetz is suggesting i aposm going to stop daca but i aposll give you six months to fix it needham we need an immigration policy that makes sense for over 320 million americans not for small segments of the of sympathetic groups wallace thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power play of the week the blue angels flying high and inspiring pride commercial break wallace pride professionalism precession as we told you in may those are the watch words of this military unit and they are our power player of the week begin videotape ryan bernacchi blue angeles commanding officer we aposre focused on that very precise control of the airplane and flying it to the very best of your ability and you aposre thinking out ahead ok what aposs next and what aposs next and what aposs next wallace voice over ryan bernacchi is commander of the blue angels the navy aposs precision flight squad troop he aposs in the number one jet leading his teams through intricate maneuvers at up to 700 miles per hour with the planes sometimes just 18 inches apart the blue angels were in the area to perform at the u s naval academy and we got to go inside their operation wallace on camera is there a lot of talking going on while you aposre up in the air bernacchi there is a lot of talking as the leader i aposm calling a cadence for every every turn every pull every power change if we aposre just going to turn left it aposs as simple as coming left and on the go all the six sticks will move in unison coming further left a little pull inaudible and when all that gets going we call it we call it it gets fuzzy because it will it will just takes on this rhythm you aposre feeling the fuzz chris yes wallace i aposm feeling the fuzz bernacchi yes it aposs something it aposs it aposs it aposs crisp but it aposs it aposs electric wallace voice over admiral chester nimitz started the blue angels in 1946 with f 6 hellcat prop planes to keep up interest in naval aviation after world war ii now they fly f 18 hornet aposs in dozens of shows each year for more than 11 million spectators from a cloudy naval academy to a crystal clear san francisco bay bernacchi i always was going to be a pilot wallace on camera why bernacchi the blue angels wallace voice over bernacchi used to go with his dad to shows in the bay area every summer bernacchi i was that kid and i wanted to fly wallace now he has a nickname bernacchi they call the flight leader boss the wingmen will talk to me and they aposll go hey boss you know and that aposs the way the way it works and then we do it on the ground as well wallace at the end of the show the blue angels do a maneuver called a loop break cross all six planes headed straight up then in six different directions and then back to the center point bernacchi at about 800 knots closure so just under 1 000 miles an hour and deploys it as a sweet ph when we we put all that together that that that synergy and you feel that fuzz and you get it you get it going and it aposs really really it aposs it aposs sweet but it aposs very very intense wallace bernacchi who aposs flown combat over iraq and afghanistan compares it to operating off an aircraft carrier and he says that aposs the mission of the blue angels to represent their fellow service members who are on the front lines bernacchi it aposs about the navy and marine corp they aposre forward deployed they aposre they aposre providing us with our freedom and that aposs the real work we makes people feel something and and it aposs that pride it aposs the pride this country has in our sailors and marines and we just bring it and display it in a way that people can connect with and they can they can see and feel and touch and that i think is the value of the blue angels end videotape wallace the blue angels are traveling the country through november if you get a
