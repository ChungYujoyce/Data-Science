re invisible a ghost mayor writes new york post columnist michael goodwin maybe you are following the advice of the late joseph campbell who urged all of us to follow your bliss running for president is apparently your bliss and i salute the clarity of purpose however as abraham lincoln also told us a house divided against itself cannot stand he was talking about america and slavery but the same principle applies to individuals no person can succeed with divided loyalties mr goodwin continues the job you were hired to do twice and for which you are paid a handsome sum plus free housing is a casualty of your bliss it s on the back burner if it s on the stove at all mentally and emotionally you ve checked out of city hall on your best days you are going through the motions it s not good enough and it s not right the columnist continues civil service workers have a term for it retiring in place the phrase refers to someone who doesn t want to do the job but doesn t want to give it up either in effect someone who wants to get paid for not working someone who is ripping off taxpayers that s you you should at least admit you re cheating on us mr goodwin observes and about that salary
