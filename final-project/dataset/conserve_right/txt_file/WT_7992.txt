work but that he is excited about the prospect we don t comment on future products so i try to sidestep a bit he said with respect to 5g i think we re in the early innings of deployment on a global basis we obviously couldn t be prouder of our lineup and are very excited about our pipeline as well and wouldn t trade our position for anybody mr cook noted that generally i think what s important when you think about 5g is to look around the world at the different deployment schedules and some of those look very different perhaps than what you might be seeing here he said in terms of the price i wouldn t want to comment on the price of handsets that aren t announced industry analysts predict the next iphone 12 will be sold 5g ready follow bil
