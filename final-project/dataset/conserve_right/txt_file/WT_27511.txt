general assembly in new york dismissed the development as a continuation of the witch hunt see also top house republican pelosi impeachment inquiry empty gesture congressional republicans called mrs pelosi s move an empty gesture because democratic committees already said they were acting under the rubric of impeachment they said mrs pelosi s announcement didn t change anything what she said today is no different than what s been going on said minority leader kevin mccarthy california republican if mrs pelosi s move didn t break any legal ground it did signal a major shift among democrats with dozens of members rushing to climb aboard the impeachment train this week in the wake of reporting that mr trump tried to rope ukraine into boosting his political fortunes hours before mrs pelosi s announcement the president authorized the release of an unredacted transcript of his july 25 phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky he said the transcript will disprove democrats suspicions that he threatened to withhold 391 million in military aid from ukraine unless its president agreed to investigate the role of mr biden s son hunter in a ukrainian natural gas company how can you do impeachment and you haven t even seen the phone call mr trump said the president predicted that the move will backfire on democrats and be a positive for me our country s doing the best it s ever done they re going to lose the election mr trump told reporters top democrats said the phone transcript alone won t be enough to spare mr trump they also are demanding that the administration turn over to congress a whistleblower s complaint against him pertaining to his reported attempt to shake down the ukrainian president simply to release the transcript is not going to come close to ending the need of the american public and the congress to see what actually happened said senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat he led the senate to approve a resolution tuesday demanding that the complaint be turned over to congress republicans joined in that call even though allies of the president pointed out that the unidentified whistleblower a national security employee wasn t listening in on the phone call and apparently got the information secondhand the white house was preparing to release the whistleblower s complaint and the inspector general s report about the complaint politico reported tuesday evening rep mark meadows north carolina republican tweeted that amazingly democrats now say the whistleblower complaint is more important than the transcript of the phone call folks the whistleblower wasn t on the call mr meadows tweeted they think a secondhand account of the call will tell you more than the actual call mr trump acknowledged that he did discuss the bidens during the call but said the transcript will prove he did not ask ukraine s leader for any political favors he said he withheld the military aid from mid july until sept 11 because he was trying to persuade european allies to contribute their fair share to ukraine s defense against russia there was never any quid pro quo mr trump said i said hold it up let s get other people to pay i think that other countries should be paying also i wanted to get other countries mrs pelosi though said the president s confirmation of the call was a betrayal of his oath of office betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections rep adam b schiff california democrat and chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence said the whistleblower at the center of the controversy is looking to testify before his committee as soon as this week although the committee was still working to finalize a hearing he told reporters that it would be behind closed doors the trump administration reportedly has dropped its objection to the whistleblower s testimony in wilmington delaware mr biden said mr trump s stonewalling would likely leave democrats with no choice but to start impeachment proceedings he said the impeachment of mr trump would be a tragedy of his own making this is not the conduct of an american president mr biden said it is the abuse of power it undermines our national security it violates his oath of office and it strikes at the heart of the sworn responsibility of the president other democratic presidential candidates who were reluctant to call for impeachment proceedings reversed themselves tuesday they said they now believe mr trump went too far by trying to pressure ukraine on capitol hill democrats who were agitating to begin impeachment proceedings said mrs pelosi s announcement was a watershed moment speaker pelosi is telling us that we re full steam ahead and the country will be with us if they aren t already rep jamie raskin maryland democrat told reporters it s not clear what changes with mrs pelosi s announcement house judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler new york democrat has been telling courts for two months that he has been conducting an impeachment inquiry his committee is looking into mr trump s personal business dealings and retracing the trail of special counsel robert mueller who said there could be reason to believe mr trump tried to obstruct justice in the investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election mrs pelosi said she is directing mr nadler and five other committee chairmen to continue their work under the umbrella of impeachment inquiry rep james a himes connecticut democrat and a member of the intelligence committee one of the six panels mrs pelosi said is operating as part of the inquiry said he figures they will forward all of their findings to mr nadler who as judiciary committee chairman would lead any impeachment proceedings still some lawmakers said the investigations aren t enough based on what they have seen they said the house should skip the inquiry stage and draw up articles of impeachment impeachment is the equivalent of a political indictment and can be approved with a majority vote in the house if articles of impeachment are approved then the senate holds a trial it takes a two thirds vote in the senate to convict and remove the president senate majority leader mitch mcconnell kentucky republican signaled that the senate isn t about to follow mrs pelosi s lead he said democrats have made a rush to judgment it simply confirms that house democrats priority is not making life better for the american people but their nearly 3 year old fixation on impeachment he said public counts showed that an overwhelming majority of house democrats support beginning impeachment and polling shows democratic voters are with them republicans and independents have consistently dismissed the idea of impeachment in surveys democrats had been expecting that flashpoints such as the release of the special counsel s report this spring mr mueller s testimony to congress in july and testimony by former top trump aides over the past few months would sway the public yet polling hasn t changed a reuters ipsos poll released tuesday night showed that 37 of americans think mr trump should be impeached down from 41 in the same survey a month ago the polling was conducted after reports about the ukraine controversy surfaced mr trump on tuesday insisted the real malfeasance belongs to mr biden and his son who earned about 3 million from the ukrainian energy company as vice president in 2016 mr biden threatened ukraine s leaders that the u s would withhold 1 billion in loan guarantees unless they fired the nation s top prosecutor whose office had been investigating the gas company mr biden and other obama administration officials said they sought the prosecutor s removal for failing to pursue corruption not to take any heat off hunter biden mr trump said in a twitter message that the transcript will show his call with ukraine s president was very friendly and totally appropriate no pressure and unlike joe biden and his son no quid pro quo the president tweeted this is nothing more than a continuation of the greatest and most destructive witch hunt of all time mr zelensky who is scheduled to meet with mr trump wednesday on the sidelines of the u n conference said tuesday that he respects mr trump and wants the unceasing support of the u s mr zelensky said he expects his meeting with mr trump will be very warm the president pointed out that the money was released to ukraine after a two month wait as far as withholding funds they were paid mr trump said they were fully paid i want other countries to put up money people called me and said let it go and i let it go a search of the white house website doesn t reveal any summaries or readouts of phone calls made by mr trump with foreign leaders last summer in which he discussed further payments for ukraine s defense the president said tuesday that similar to his complaints about nato members not paying their fair share for the common defense of europe other european allies should be contributing more to protect ukraine from russian aggression we paid the money mr trump said but very importantly germany france
