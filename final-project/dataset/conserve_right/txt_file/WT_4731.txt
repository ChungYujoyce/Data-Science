apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the navy seal who shot osama bin laden during the may 2011 raid at his compound in abbottabad pakistan has his own opinion on a case that threatens to tear apart his former service and further strain ties between president trump and his military chiefs robert j o neill sides with mr trump in an extraordinary battle of wills over military justice and a commander s prerogative saying in an interview he believes edward gallagher should be able to retire as a chief petty officer and with the prized trident pin signifying his membership in the elite seals unit mr o neill said he believes chief gallagher had been the victim of a vendetta by military bureaucrats and some members of the navy criminal investigative service better known as ncis top

advance their own agenda but while defense secretary mark t esper and joint chiefs of staff head gen mark milley have signaled they re ready to move on and mr trump again defended his intervention in a trio of war crimes cases there was no sign monday that controversy or the underlying problems that sparked it have been resolved mr trump showed no signs of having second thoughts in a session with reporters in the oval office monday mr trump said he intervened to stick up for the warriors as opposed to what he characterized as the obama administration s leniency for deserter sgt bowe bergdahl and former soldier chelsea manning who was convicted of military espionage i think what i m doing is sticking up for our armed forces mr trump said i will stick up for the warriors with the navy facing performance budget and morale problems mr esper seemed anxious to get past the gallagher case i want the seals and the navy to move beyond this now and get fully focused on their warfighting mission mr esper told reporters at a hastily announced press briefing inside the pentagon that may be easier said than done however although assigned to different seal teams mr o neill was an east coast guy while chief gallagher was assigned to units on the west coast mr o neill said the two have become friends since the war crimes allegations were first raised he s a great guy he s a poster image of what a seal should be mr o neill said i d go to war with him tomorrow he doesn t believe the accusations that gallagher had committed a string of illegal killings during multiple tours in combat if you re pulling that killing unarmed civilians you re going to get yanked mr o neill said chief gallagher was known as a demanding leader within the seal community i heard a lot of the younger guys thought he worked them too hard they had a different work ethic mr o neill said and they weren t quite ready for the reality of war although mr o neill said a lot of the rank and file members of the navy seal community backed mr trump s clemency move others have criticized the president s decision to intervene aggressively in the military justice system and overrule military officials pushing to rein in what they see as increasing indiscipline in the ranks passionate letter complicating the push to move on is the detailed and passionate resignation letter of navy secretary richard v spencer who challenged mr esper s narrative that he was fired for going around his boss to try to cut a deal with the white house on chief gallagher mr spencer insisted he resigned because he could not support the reasons behind mr trump s actions i cannot in good conscience obey an order that i believe violates the sacred oath i took in the presence of my family my flag and my faith to support and defend the constitution of the united states mr spencer wrote and mr spencer has his own supporters it makes no sense that mr spencer was fired for upholding the rule of law and a war criminal gets to stay in uniform retired vice admiral michael franken said mr franken is now running to unseat sen joni ernst iowa republican former nato commander and navy adm james stavridis warned the pardons could have a chilling effect on special forces willingness to report when they see illegal behavior that is tragic because in the end what separates us from our opponents on the battlefield is our willingness to follow the rule of law he told the associated press the decision to ask mr spencer for his resignation was not specifically about the gallagher case mr esper told reporters monday he spoke with army and navy leadership weeks ago about the war crimes cases of chief gallagher army 1st lt clint lorance and army maj matthew golsteyn a former green beret everyone agreed mr esper said that the best plan was to recommend allowing the military trial system to continue to its natural conclusion we also recognized that the commander in chief has certain constitutional rights and powers that he is free to exercise as many presidents have done in the past mr esper said mr esper said he only learned about mr spencer s white house back channel from an official there this proposal was completely contrary to what we agreed to and contrary to secretary spencer s public position he said he and gen milley were completely caught off guard by this information and realized that it had undermined everything we had been discussing with the president mr esper said he didn t know how mr spencer would have arranged for the panel of senior non commissioned officers in the seal community to guarantee chief gallagher would have kept his trident pin no matter the outcome i asked and never got an answer mr esper told reporters gisele donnelly a military analyst with the american enterprise institute said she also worries how the case will reflect on mr esper s reputation in washington people are going to say that former defense secretary james n mattis would never have stood for this ms donnelly said adding she worried the case will only drag the military deeper into partisan politics they re being treated more or less as just another interest group she said there is a real concern about lowering the quality of the civil military relationship the firing of secretary spencer does have some strong support from capitol hill senate armed services committee chairman james inhofe oklahoma republican said the president and mr esper needs to have someone in that position they can trust it is no secret that i had my own disagreements with secretary spencer over the management of specific navy programs and i look forward to receiving and considering a nomination for the next secretary of the navy as soon as possible mr inhofe said in a statement but rhode island sen jack reed the ranking democrat on the armed services panel and an army veteran said mr trump was guilty of inappropriate involvement in the military justice system the white house s handling of this matter erodes the basic command structure of the military and the basic function of the uniform code of military justice mr reed said dave boyer contributed to this
