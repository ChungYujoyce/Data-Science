for his first postelection trip he tellingly settled on asia a region he has deemed the region as crucial to u s prosperity and security aides say asia will factor heavily in obama s second term as the u s seeks to expand its influence in an attempt to counter china china s rise is also at play in myanmar which long has aligned itself with beijing but some in myanmar fear that china is taking advantage of its wealth of natural resources so the country is looking for other partners to help build its nascent economy obama has rewarded myanmar s rapid adoption of democratic reforms by lifting some economic penalties the president has appointed a permanent ambassador to the country also known as burma and pledged greater investment if myanmar continues to progress following a half century of military rule but some human rights groups say myanmar s government which continues to hold hundreds of political prisoners and is struggling to contain ethnic violence hasn t done enough to earn a
