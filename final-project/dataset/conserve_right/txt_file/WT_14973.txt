 flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic china isn t content playing a critical role in the u s economy by gobbling up chunks of the national debt now the global powerhouse is exporting some of its most popular films to american theaters courtesy of amc entertainment the theater chain is showing aftershock the highest grossing film in the asian nation s history and not in traditionally subtitle friendly art houses but in multiplex theaters alongside hollywood blockbusters it s part of an exclusive deal between amc entertainment and china lion film distribution the pact will bring up to 15 chinese films per year to american theaters to be released on the same date in both countries also contrary to the usual practice of releasing foreign language films in the u s months after their home country release and or screening at american festivals top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens aftershock uses two devastating earthquakes the 1976 tangshan quake and the 2008 sichuan quake which killed about 250 000 people and 70 000 people respectively to frame a tale of a young mother forced to make a sophie s choice type decision regarding the safety of her two children after a san francisco bay area opening last month the film expanded recently to 23 amc screens in eight u s markets with sizable chinese american populations including two venues in the d c area the amc hoffman center 22 in alexandria va and the amc loews georgetown 14 in the district the sprawling epic earned more than 100 million in its homeland and will be the country s official selection for best foreign language film at the 2010 oscars the film is being shown with its original chinese soundtrack and subtitles in english and chinese chinese films traditionally reach u s shores via independent theater houses such as the landmark theatres chain the amc gambit could change that pattern while extending china s cultural reach sean phillips executive producer of yahoo movies called it a bold and calculated move for foreign movies such as aftershock to bypass traditional art house venues it s a totally viable experiment for amc aftershock is a movie that already has great popularity and was made with care and quality mr phillips said some audiences even non chinese audiences might be interested in films like this amc boasts the kinds of resources that mom and pop indie theaters often lack they have control over what trailers go up in their chains if they really wanted to dedicate some of their promotional real estate they can make it happen he said amc president of programming robert j lenihan said in a statement that the deal is similar to others that the company struck with bollywood and latin american based films the theater chain did not respond to messages from the washington times for further comment the film was not listed at box office mojo making it hard to tell how well aftershock is doing a sunday afternoon show in georgetown had in addition to a times reporter just three viewers in the theater still members of the small audience said afterward that they enjoyed the film michael cullingford 70 and his wife suying 55 were at aftershock at their daughter s suggestion mrs cullingford was in china during the 1976 earthquake in tangshan and experienced that time in china s history firsthand the couple said it was a very good movie and showed the strength of family mr cullingford added that its representation of china was very accurate very truthful and very realistic john landers 23 who was in china during the 2008 sichuan quake heard about the film through a couple of friends and had been anticipating its release he said he enjoyed the film but had been expecting more of a disaster film than a drama but i prefer dramas anyway the film review aggregation site rotten tomatoes lists just two reviews of aftershock both positive still of the 287 registered rotten tomatoes users who rated aftershock 87 percent did so positively leonard maltin host of maltin on movies with reelzchannel and longtime critic at entertainment tonight said american audiences have had a taste of chinese films courtesy of such popular hong kong talent as director john woo and actors jackie chan and chow yun fat the reverse is also true regarding the wests impact on asian directors and let s face it hollywood films have exerted a degree of influence on filmmakers around the world there s certainly cross pollination mr maltin said whether that s creating a more universally palatable type of moviemaking i don t know what s far more certain is that times are tough for films not that aren t remakes or reboots the audience for foreign language films sadly is not growing it s been shrinking for a number of years said mr maltin noting that films such the oscar winning british indian co production slumdog millionaire remain the exceptions doug jones associate programmer for the los angeles film festival said he wonders whether amc can reverse behavior patterns regarding foreign film viewing in the u s many ethnic and religious communities have settled on their own distribution models to see films from their homelands mr jones said be it through private screenings or online downloads that step of going to a theater to see chinese films has gone away for a number of years he said mr jones called it shrewd for chinese film companies to seek entry into american movie theaters saying one way the international community can learn about a given culture is through its film exports in that sense a series like this could provide a great opportunity to get a sense of what is on the mind of your typical chinese filmgoer mr jones said what do they respond to the new film deal could be another way for china to expand its cultural interests abroad this years blockbuster remake of the karate kid was shot in china showed the country s natural beauty and cast its cultural traditions in a positive light joseph tse hei lee a history professor with pace university said the chinese government has been encouraging its industries to expand in recent years to globalize their own culture the government wants to expand its cultural soft power said mr lee though he suggested that this could backfire the leaders of those cultural industries took advantage of the permission to do their own thing he said making art that doesn t always align with the pro government agenda mr lee found aftershock s criticism of contemporary chinese politics impressive but others found some of the film s content troubling the film doesn t explore the maoist government s lack of infrastructure at the time of the 1976 earthquake nor does it mention china s refusal to accept foreign aid at the time mr lee said directors such as mr woo who have worked within the hollywood system to make movies like face off and broken arrow are eager to bring what they ve learned back home last year mr woo released a traditional period sword epic red cliff that he made in mainland china to u s filmgoers though unlike aftershock it showed mostly in u s art houses mr woo is trying to train the chinese to use the latest computer graphics to make dramatic war scenes as they re done in the u s mr lee said it makes it easier for american audiences to accept good quality chinese movies andrew entzminge
