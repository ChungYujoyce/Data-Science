tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn ottawa ontario ap vice president mike pence said thursday that president donald trump is a great friend of the canadian people and that the u s canada relationship has never been stronger less than a year after trump assailed canadian prime minister justin trudeau in unprecedented attacks on america s longtime ally pence was in the canadian capital hoping to build momentum to pass a new trade deal with canada and mexico but after pence left to return to washington trump tweeted that he is slapping a 5 tariff on all mexican imports to pressure the country to do more to crack down on the surge of central american migrants trying to cross the border the move could put the trade deal in jeopardy top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump just recently removed u s steel and aluminum tariffs on canada and mexico clearing a roadblock to a north american trade deal that his team negotiated last year the trade penalties were a sore point in relations that reached a low last summer when trump called prime minister justin trudeau weak and dishonest after the canadian hosted group of seven summit of major industrial nations president trump and i believe the relationship between the united states and canada has never been stronger and that is a reflection of his leadership and your leadership pence told trudeau pence later said at a news conference that trump is a great friend of the canadian people nelson wiseman a political science professor at the university of toronto called pence s comments laughable canada like the europeans and the japanese is waiting trump out calculating reasonably that a new administration will be more grounded and consistent wiseman said i don t expect trump will ever again be in canada as president so much for strong relations the new trade deal signed in november by the leaders of the three nations is meant to replace the north american free trade agreement the pact needs approval from lawmakers in each country and several key u s lawmakers and canada were threatening to reject it unless the tariffs were removed democrats in washington now want stronger enforcement of labor standards and they oppose a provision that protects drugmakers from competition pence insisted that the trade deal will win approval this summer the trump administration triggered the process thursday for submitting a bill to congress that would implement the president s new trade deal with canada and mexico by today s action we give evidence of president trump s determination to see the united states congress consider and approve the usmca and approve it this summer pence said the notification sent to house speaker nancy pelosi and other congressional leaders riled democrats trudeau said the talks with pence focused on the ratification process but trudeau also raised the issue of women s rights in the u s where several states have enacted anti abortion measures pence is a well known opponent of abortion i highlighted to the vice president that there was a significant amount of concern among canadians on the new anti choice laws being passed in a

apparent attempt to pressure canada to release chinese huawei executive meng wanzhou she was arrested dec 1 at the request of u s authorities during recent u s china trade talks the canadians cases

strongly about the canadians and is renewing a call to release them but many analysts have said the support has been largely muted the prime minister and i spoke about it extensively today pence said pence expects trump will meet with chinese presidentxi jinping at the g 20 summit next month in japan and that the u s will continue to urge beijing to release the canadians even while they deal with trade talks with china i expect the issue will come up again at the g 20 pence said pence urged canada to exclude huawei equipment from their next generation wireless networks known as 5g the u s claims huawei is legally beholden to china s ruling communist party which could order it to spy on their behalf we consider huawei incompatible with the security interests of the united states of
