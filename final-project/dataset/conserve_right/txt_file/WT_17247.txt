apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic seoul south korea chinese president xi jinping s arrival thursday in south korea for a summit simultaneously snubs nuclear armed north korea bolsters an already booming trade relationship with seoul and sends washington and tokyo a message of beijing s growing influence south of the korean demilitarized zone while there were smiles and pomp for xi s arrival in the south north korea welcomed the leader of its only major ally and crucial source of fuel and food with a flurry of recent rocket and missile tests the latest on wednesday meant to make clear its anger at being jilted for its archrival pyongyang s military on thursday threatened more missile tests xi s choice to meet with south korean president park geun hye over north korean leader kim jong un upends the practice since beijing and seoul forged diplomatic ties in 1992 of chinese presidents choosing to make pyongyang their first official destination on the korean peninsula photos with seoul visit china leader sends message north the trip highlights beijing s interest in nurturing trade and diplomacy with seoul and shows its aversion to pyongyang s destabilizing pursuit of nuclear weapons beijing entangled in hostile territorial disputes across asia may see an opportunity to boost its influence with the rare neighbor that feels generally positive about china while also further driving a wedge between u s allies seoul and tokyo in some ways the budding closeness between xi and park echoes much older patterns in east asia when china exercised a relatively benign hegemony over many of its neighbors said john delury an expert on china and korea at seoul s yonsei university the two day summit marks park s fifth meeting with xi since she took office early last year chinese foreign ministry spokesman qin gang urged reporters not to over read xi s decision to visit south korea before the north but many in china see the visit as not only a remarkable departure from the past but also a sign of a budding friendship between the leaders money has long been the focus of the relationship between china the world s second largest economy and south korea the fourth biggest economy in asia they are in talks on a bilateral free trade agreement china is south korea s largest trading partner and seoul says two way trade topped 220 billion last year that s larger than the combined value of south korea s trade with the united states and japan in economics the relationship is as good as it gets the korea times said in an editorial this week there s also a shared distaste for japan s more assertive military ambitions and for what beijing and seoul see as an attempt by tokyo to obscure its brutal history in both countries in the last century managing security matters and more specifically north korea s pursuit of nuclear bombs and the long range missiles to carry them has always been trickier china is seen as having unusual leverage with hard to read north korea and is often pressed to do more to force change they fought together in the 1950 53 korean war against the united states south korea and their allies more recently north korea has repeatedly looked to china for diplomatic cover when the united nations has taken up north korean nuclear and missile tests and its much criticized human rights record analysts don t think xi will abandon north korea entirely as long as seoul remains loyal to an alliance with washington that has shielded the south from north korean aggression and allowed it to build its impressive economy china also worries that too much pressure on pyongyang could cause a north korean collapse that would push swarms of refugees over the countries shared border bitterness still lingers in seoul over chinese reticence to criticize what a seoul led international investigation said was a north korean torpedo sneak attack on a south korean warship that killed 46 in 2010 still the worries about north korea have helped draw seoul and beijing together officials in seoul now expect china to take strong action over future provocations especially if pyongyang conducts what would be its fourth nuclear test as it moves toward building an arsenal of nuclear tipped missiles that could reach the united states for its part south korea wants relief from the perpetual north korean threat scott snyder an asia specialist at the council on foreign relations wrote this week that there s also a desire for beijing s acquiescence to seoul s leading role in shaping the parameters for korea s reunification china wants stability and a unified stance against japan it also has pushed for a resumption of the six nation north korean nuclear disarmament talks that it hosted until their last session in late 2008 xi s visit to seoul will test close u s ties with south korea and japan that beijing believes have been used to check its rise said koh yu hwan a professor of north korea studies at seoul s dongguk university it also tells pyongyang that it could lose chinese support if it sticks to its nuclear ambitions they will not feel good about this koh said
