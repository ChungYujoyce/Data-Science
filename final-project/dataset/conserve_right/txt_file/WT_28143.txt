tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn former fbi director james b comey s motives for briefing president elect trump on the democratic party financed dossier included that mr trump might offer up evidence that would help the bureau s probe into the republican s campaign and russia a justice department report says after his now infamous meeting with the president elect at trump tower on jan 6 2017 mr comey immediately briefed the probe s supervisors in washington on a secure video conference those briefed would have included fbi agent peter strzok who started and headed the operation and vowed to stop mr trump in private texts the public narrative for the one on one is that mr comey wanted to alert mr trump on the dossier s allegation that he engaged with prostitutes in moscow in 2013 mr comey had learned through his press office that cnn was preparing to report on the dossier the public later learned that the discredited scandal sheet was written by british ex spy christopher steele who was paid by the democratic party and the hillary clinton campaign top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century but the fbi s decision to confront mr trump with the dossier had a far more serious motive according to justice department inspector general michael e horowitz in his 83 page report released last week the run up went this way since july 31 2016 and perhaps before that the fbi was investigating whether the trump campaign conspired with the kremlin to interfere in the 2016 election by computer hacking and social media information warfare mr comey s inner circle saw his meeting with mr trump as a chance to gain information from the candidate himself for crossfire hurricane as the probe was code named mr comey s closest aides deputy director andrew mccabe general counsel james baker chief of staff james rybicki and those supervising crossfire hurricane which would seem to include mr strzok huddled to set strategy witnesses interviewed by the oig office of the inspector general also said that they discussed trump s potential responses to being told about the salacious information including that trump might make statements about or provide information of value to the pending russian interference investigation mr horowitz wrote mr comey subsequently memorialized the meeting in what the ig report dubbed memo 1 mr mccabe who was fired by the fbi for allegedly lying to investigators for a previous ig report urged the creation of memo 1 because mr trump might misrepresent what happened immediately after the trump meeting mr comey began writing memo 1 at the fbi s new york field office he gave his aides and the crossfire hurricane team a briefing on what mr trump had said the ig report said mr comey classified his memo 1 as secret the report doesn t say what specifically he told his team mr trump fired mr comey in may 2017 in his memoir a higher loyalty mr comey does not say that he was hunting for crossfire hurricane evidence when he gave mr trump a five minute dossier briefing he also didn t disclose that he briefed the crossfire team minutes later when he arrived at the fbi field office the trump meeting s main purpose was to tell the president elect about the intelligence community s findings on russian election interference director of national intelligence james clapper a barack

since the tower meeting the dossier took on tremendous importance in what republicans allege was a conspiracy at the fbi with clinton operatives to bring down mr trump house republican investigators found that bruce ohr an associate deputy attorney general became a messenger for dossier allegations beginning in august 2016 mr ohr began to funnel information to the justice department and the fbi

weissmann who would join the staff of special counsel robert mueller a clinton campaign lawyer also briefed the fbi this means mr comey s aides were awash in mr steele s allegations against mr trump and his colleagues as they plotted the tower meeting by then the fbi s crossfire hurricane team had used the dossier to obtain at least one yearlong wiretap on a trump campaign adviser in the end none of mr steele s election conspiracy allegations proved true republicans call the document a hoax fed to mr steele by kremlin intelligence figures and spread around washington by clinton operatives overall mr horowitz concluded that mr comey violated justice department rules in handling memos he wrote for the record on his meetings with president trump mr comey provided one memo to a friend with
