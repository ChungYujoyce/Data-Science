to enjoy all the benefits of our website the pandemic is forcing us out of our routines individually and collectively get the new statesman s morning call email it is not clear precisely which twisted 19th century scientist first thought of blanching frogs but he lives on in the pantheon of metaphor we all know the fable one placed in cold water and heated up will cook to death one thrown into boiling water will jump out some changes are too gradual for us to notice in other words but a sudden shock can spur us to act modern societies are gradually heating up sorts of places full of mechanisms for putting things off infinite experiences with which to busy ourselves rather than doing or pondering things we would rather not have the time to do or ponder i have taken to using trello a list making app to sort things i have to do into different time horizons primarily because of the ease with which it allows me to lift a colourful little tile from one column and drop it with a satisfying plink into next month s list or the one after that so it is with societies as a whole which tend to prioritise acute problems over chronic ones those that really gnaw are the ones that no government will serve long enough to win re election for solving the nagging problem with the unpopular remedy the global challenge for which responsibility is too diffuse the gradual structural shift that is obviously taking us to a bad place but is just too gradual and structural the water gets hotter but we frogs choose not to notice enter coronavirus the pandemic is forcing us out of our routines individually and collectively across the world millions are getting used to different living and working arrangements and more limited circles of movement experience and social contact plenty claim they are using the lockdown to weed that garden read that novel or unpack that one last box from a move years ago some may even be telling the truth my windowsills are now full of little pots sprouting the first shoots grown from long neglected packets of tomato seeds aside from such mundanities some people will be prompted by the jolt to take genuinely major life decisions to quit jobs say or move elsewhere on 24 march the deputy chief medical officer for england jenny harries suggested that dating couples who did not want to spend the lockdown apart might wish to test the strength of their relationship by moving in together for its duration on the other side of the ledger divorce rates are reportedly spiking in china as married couples cooped up for weeks are allowed back out more serious still are the realities that the virus is forcing us to face collectively in ageing societies the lockdowns are bringing a reckoning with the numbers of old and vulnerable people living on their own slowly spreading epidemics of loneliness about which there have been few proper national conversations but now en masse people are checking in on their neighbours to ask if they need a phone call or some shopping doing or getting older relatives set up with mobile phones and video calls i would not be surprised to learn that for some lonely folks the last weeks have been the most social for years in the uk the pandemic has also exposed the crisis of social care the desperate need for prison reform the instability of life in the gig economy and most of all the failure to establish a lasting adequate funding settlement for the nhs crucially as it provides the necessary shot of adrenaline the virus has made those failures scary to voters and politicians similar

societies abilities to transform industrial processes and lifestyles to cope with emergencies and dislocations and to curtail certain short term freedoms for the long term good such matters would have made most of us citizens and leaders impossibly queasy even a few weeks ago now perhaps we can at least begin to pay attention to them like a frog in a pot suddenly noticing the heat modern societies
