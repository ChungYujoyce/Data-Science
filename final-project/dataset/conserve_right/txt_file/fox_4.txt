what impact the special counsel aposs findings will have on the 2020 campaign and our power player of the week taking advanced medical treatment for children to places where it doesn apost exist unidentified female our motto is heal a child change the world wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington after more than 22 months special counsel robert mueller has completed his investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election but what did he find and how much of his final report will we see we aposre going to drill down on that and we have new fox news polling out today on the 2020 election and what you think of the mueller investigation we aposll get to politics later but first the special counsel aposs report in a moment we aposll speak with the chair of the house judiciary committee jerrold nadler and the top republican doug collins but we begin with kevin corke at the white house on where things stand right now kevin kevin corke correspondent chris a working weekend here in the nation aposs capital for the attorney general bill barr and his deputy rod rosenstein as the two men pore over the principal conclusions of the mueller report with the hopes obviously of delivering a summary of that report by day aposs end but even before seeing barr aposs summation congressional democrats are demanding more begin videotape corke a carefree stroll with his wife appeared to be special counsel robert mueller aposs reward following a 22 month long probe into the president his associates and the trump 2016 campaign trump there was no collusion there was no obstruction everybody knows it it aposs all a big hoax corke now it aposs up to attorney general bill barr to summarize the report aposs findings as he spent hours saturday sifting through the conclusions drawn by the special counsel he did so knowing there would be no additional indictments news held by the president aposs supporters as vindication of the president aposs long standing position still congressional democrats insist the full report be made public including his underlying evidence which ultimately could spark a battle between capitol hill and the white house over executive privilege and the justice department over precisely what lawmakers have a right to see rep adam schiff d calif if necessary we will call bob mueller or others before our committee corke this is the latest fox news poll found that 52 percent of those surveyed say they approve of the mueller investigation an overwhelming majority 80 percent think the report ought to be made public end videotape corke that same survey chris found that just 21 percent of those questions thought that the report would have any impact on changing their minds about the mueller probe 41 percent in fact said it would have no chance of changing their minds at all chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thank you now let aposs bring in the chair of the house judiciary committee jerrold nadler congressman welcome to fox news sunday rep jerrold nadler d n y good morning wallace attorney general barr says he will provide quote the principal conclusions of the mueller report to you and two other top members of congress have you been given any advance notice as to when specifically and how detailed that summary will be nadler as to how detailed no as to when in the letter he wrote to us on friday he said maybe as early as the weekend and that aposs all we know wallace do you expect the white house to get a review of the summary before you do for any executive privilege issues and would you have any problem with that nadler i certainly hope that does not happen and i certainly do have a problem with that this is an investigation of the white house of the president of the people around them for alleged misconduct in various different ways and for subverting the constitution in various different ways as we know from the nixon tapes case which the supreme court decided 9 0 executive privilege cannot be used to shield wrongdoing and certainly they should not get an advance look at the report the report should go public in its entirety and see what the chips fall wallace let aposs do a little tea leaf reading on the little bit we know now the justice department says that the special counsel is not recommending any new indictments that means that no one will have been or has been or will have been charged with collusion with the russians and president trump clearly couldn apost do that himself so in effect isn apost it a logical assumption that the special counsel did not find any criminal collusion with the kremlin nadler well the all we know is that the special counsel what we think we know is that the special counsel is not bringing criminal indictments for collusion there are other investigations going on which he has farmed out to the southern district of new york eastern district of virginia and they may or may not we do know remember in plain sight of a lot of collusion we know for example that the president aposs son and his campaign manager were present in the meeting with the russians to receive information which they were told in the invitation was part of the russian government aposs attempt to help them in the election we know that the campaign manager give targeting data political targeting data to an agent of the russian government wallace but nadler we know a lot of things and maybe it aposs not indictable but we know there was collusion the question is to what degree and for a purpose crosstalk wallace excuse me that aposs the point i was going to make jared kushner was not charged for that paul manafort wasn apost charged don jr wasn apost charged so it would seem that there was no criminal collusion among them so it would seem to clear the president wouldn apost it on that issue nadler no it would not the washington post has a story today which says that in counterintelligence investigations because of the way they are done and because of way counterintelligence works very often they do not lead to criminal prosecutions but we these are additional reasons we have to see the report the entire country the public needs to see the entire report so we can see what the special prosecutor says about these questions right now it aposs very speculative wallace ok you aposve made it very clear that you want to see not only the report but all of the underlying material all of the investigative material here aposs what deputy attorney general rod rosenstein said last month begin video clip rod rosenstein deputy attorney general if we aren apost prepared to prove our case beyond reasonable doubt in court then we have no business making allegations against american citizens end video clip wallace mr chairman given how upset democrats were in 2016 when then fbi director james comey said he was not going to recommend charging hillary clinton but then that laid out the case against her why should attorney general barr make the same mistake if he aposs not going to bring a case against donald trump and lay out all the information against him nadler there aposs a fundamental difference the justice department believes normally that aposs a very good rule if you don apost have enough evidence to charge someone with a crime you shouldn apost sully their name however the justice department believes that as a matter of law the president no matter what the evidence can never be indicted for anything simply because he is the president if that is the case then they can apost hold him accountable and the only institution that can hold the president accountable is congress and congress therefore needs the evidence and the information once you say that a president cannot be held cannot be indictable the matter with the evidence as a matter of law to then follow the principle that you can apost then comment on evidence or publicize is to convert that into a cover up wallace well i want to pick up on that you say if the attorney general does not turn over everything to the special counsel that aposs a cover up which is a pretty charged phrase i mean couldn apost it just be that he reads the regulations differently than you do that it aposs not a cover up of a crime and secondly i understand they aposre going to be two differences of opinions here what are you prepared to do to get all the information you want nadler well again if the president cannot be indicted because as a matter of law then the only way a president can be held accountable is for congress to consider it an act if warranted and congress can only do that if it has the information and for the department to take the position that we are not going to give information because he aposs not indicted like a normal person is not indicted because of lack of evidence is equivalent to a cover up and subverts the only ability to hold the president accountable and the president more than anybody else cannot be above the law as to whether we will use subpoenas we will if necessary we as you know put out a lot of document requests to people we are getting a good response on that not from the white house but from a lot of other people and we aposll use subpoenas if and when we think we have to wallace you have made it clear that your committee is going to keep investigating the president regardless of what is in the mueller report you just recently sent out a document request 281 people and entities for information but if the special counsel and i understand this is speculative if the special counsel after two years basically does not find criminal activity obviously you say they aposre not going to charge them with a crime if they find no evidence of criminal activity by the president after this long investigation on collusion or obstruction of justice how do you think the american people will react to house democrats continuing to investigate the president for the rest of his time in office the next two years i understand why it might be good politically nadler i don apost know if i don apost know wallace keep him under a cloud but is it good for the country sir nadler i don apost know if it aposs good politically or not and i don apost know if it will take the next few years but what i do know is that the job of congress is much broader than the job of special counsel the special counsel was looking and can only look for crimes we have to protect the rule of law we have to look for abuses of power we have to look for obstructions of justice we have to look for corruption in the exercise of power which may not be crimes they may be but they may not be crimes we have a much broader mandate and we have to exercise that mandate to protect the integrity of government and protect the integrity of liberty and the country wallace as you will know there are some republicans who believe the real scandal here is the bias the misdeeds overreach by the fbi by the justice department by the special counsel do you have any intention of investigating them sir nadler well when the republicans controlled the judiciary committee and the oversight committee in the last two years there was an extensive investigation of that and nothing relevant was found yes it turns out that some fbi agents have political opinions that they didn apost like the president other fbi agents love the president but the inspector general found that no actions were taken that were influenced by political opinions you know it aposs against the law for the fbi or any other government agency to inquire as to the political opinions of people you aposre going to hire as a head check so no i don apost see the necessity for any further investigation it is part of a sustained attack by the administration and its allies on the integrity of law enforcement agencies the fbi special prosecutor for the last two years to try to undermine the integrity and the credibility of our law enforcement institutions and that aposs something that aposs very damaging to the country and one of the things that we have to rectify let me add again regardless of whether the special prosecutor finds crimes we know certain things the public knows certain things we know that the president asked the fbi director to go easy and to stop investigating some of his close associates like michael flynn we know that the president fired the fbi director because he wouldn apost give him the personal loyalty he demanded and because as he put it to nbc news of the russian thing we know that a lot of the president aposs closest associates his campaign manager deputy campaign manager national security advisor have been indicted and convicted of various crimes and we know the sustained attacks on our law enforcement institutions these are very dangerous to the rule of law and we have to try to rectify it wallace so and i aposve got about 30 seconds left what you seem to be saying is whatever is in the mueller report not saying you aposre going to do it but that impeachment is still on the table nadler it aposs way too early to talk about impeachment or not we have to look at as i said our mandate is not to impeach the president or anything like that our mandate is to defend the rule of law and to vindicate our constitutional liberties and to buck up the institutions that have been weakened by the attacks of this administration the institutions that we depend on for our democratic form of government so we have to look into abuse of power we have to look into obstructions of justice and that we will do and we aposll see where it goes we aposll see where the facts take us wallace chairman nadler thank you thanks for your time we aposll stay on top of what your committee does now nadler thank you wallace up next reaction from the top republican on house judiciary congressman doug collins commercial break wallace a senate democrat says the wrap up of the mueller investigation is not the beginning of the end but just the end of the beginning joining us now from atlanta the top republican on the house judiciary committee doug collins congressman welcome to fox news sunday rep doug collins r ga good morning chris good to be with you wallace to what degree i understand it aposs very early to what degree do you think what we have heard so far about the special counsel aposs report clears the president especially the fact that there aposs been a decision made it not only not to indict the president but also not to indict for instance on issues of collusion any of the top people around him collins i believe it goes to what we aposve been talking about for the long time what the president has been saying from the beginning that there was no collusion what we have so far and the indications out of the department of justice that there aposs no more indictments i aposm waiting to see the conclusion that bill barr is going to give us hopefully as early as today as we see those then we can actually show to the american people what the investigation meant and how far it went and also the fact that now we can hopefully begin to move on in these to your cloud of an investigation in which a lot was gone into to prove the president now we are saying that the collusion is not and now we can move forward wallace you say move on you just heard my interview with your chairman jerrold nadler he makes it clear he intends to keep investigating not only other issues but also to keep investigating collusion obstruction of justice all of the issues the special counsel was looking at collins well that aposs all they have obviously we aposve seen on the first two months of this congress they really don apost have a policy agenda they have an agenda against the president they have an agenda to try to win 2020 and so what we aposre seeing is is they think that they can go into the judiciary committee or any other committee and have a limited budget limited subpoena power limited staff and go up against an investigation that lasted 22 months had unlimited power unlimited subpoena power had plenty of investigators and they think they can find something more than what they did then i think they are sadly mistaken and i think the american people will see through that wallace what about the argument that you heard from chairman nadler look the special counsel has his role we have we the democrats the congress has its role which is different and broader collins i think it might just be a different what he aposs saying if he keeps going by the rule of law and they aposre different for purposes if mr nadler is saying that our committee is supposed to be a paintbrush that just simply tries to taint the presidency and paint the presidency with doubt and innuendo then i would disagree with that that aposs an abuse of power that aposs not something the committee ought to be doing and i think we also have to respect what the department of justice and mr mueller has been doing if we do that then the american people can see we are respecting the will of law wallace now as we were just talking about democrats are demanding not only the release of the full report but also all underlying materials you have said the same thing but you have added this phrase that you want to see it all released quote to the maximum extent permitted by the law what do you think are the limits permitted by the law collins well the limits no chris i think that aposs a great question i think the american people deserve to understand it aposs amazing to hear my chairman say that he wants everything out there well i would ask my chairman does it include classified information which has never been released to the american public would it include 6 e which is grand jury information things that are normally never released to the public outside really outside of a special order from the court would he want to do the things that you know would actually get into ongoing investigations i think the problem is that the democrats and my chairman have a problem they thought that this report was going to show something they can impeach the president on that is not seemingly going to happen now they have to figure out some way around that and i think when you understand that for him to make a broad statement of what they want released that aposs not fair to the american public and we believe they are trying to taint what is coming out by not saying what should not come out to the public because of what i aposve just listed wallace but you know there are other areas besides grand jury testimony classified material democrats say the president is any unique legal position they say on the one hand that the justice department regulations they don apost release information on people they aposre not going to charge but also the department regulations say they can apost charge the president so you know there is as i say this kind of self contradictory basis there isn apost it legitimate to argue that even if there is damaging information to the president that does not rise to the level of an indictment that it should be turned over to congress to take a look at collins well it aposs not the department of justice aposs job to give chairman nadler and house judiciary or any committee on the house or the senate for that matter you know what they want to do to go off on a purely partisan investigation to lead towards impeachment let aposs also understand clearly these were findings that have not been made yet there was been no findings that that was the reason that you couldn apost indict a sitting president the reason why there aposs no more indictments coming forward let aposs be honest with the facts and say probably with the facts showed was that there was no collusion let aposs go to the logical choice that nothing happened it was sort of amazing to hear the chairman say things that we do know again basically when you talk about collusion was happening meetings were happening that all of this was going on again to simply sully what they have been called the best investigation around and not to touch the mueller investigation when it comes back not what they want now they aposve decided that they can just try to go around it and draw implications so that others can doubt it that aposs just wrong wallace congressman collins president trump tweeted and called mueller investigation a witch hunt something called the trump twitter archive says that in his presidency he has tweeted that phrase witch hunt 183 times but let aposs look at what the mueller investigation has found his team indicted convicted or got guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies his former national security advisor pleaded guilty so did his former fixer his former campaign chairman was convicted and a long time advisor roger stone faces charges of lying to congress congressman collins i agree that there has been no action and apparently will be no action taken against the president by the justice department but would you agree that this was no hoax collins i think what the president was saying was is since he was elected there have been calls for impeachment and every kind of investigation and i think that what he was lashing out was saying look this is not we won election and he won the election in many opinions fair and square doing what people do to win recollections going to convince people to vote for him and visit every state in the union and not skip states what we see here though is an investigation which people who lied were held accountable people who were investigated are now being held under the rule of law at what point does that not make the investigation any less valid in the sense that they did what they saw on others but also found that in their main core of the collusion or investigation or obstruction they are seemingly coming to the point that the president and those around him had nothing to do with this the other charges except for those indicted with the russians which will probably never see in court in the united states that is the core finding at least if what we aposre seeing so far remember that report and those findings are still coming out and we aposll see but at this point the president has been proved right i think he was obviously frustrated during this time and rightfully so as this report seems to show wallace but michael flynn was convicted of lying about his dealings with the russians michael cohen was convicted of lying about his dealings with the russians roger stone has been indicted for allegedly lying about his contacts with wikileaks which got information from the russians don apost you find that again not saying that this proves anything about the president but don apost you find it curious that three people so close to the president allegedly or have been convicted of lying for their dealings with the russians collins i think it just shows you had three people who chose to lie to investigators when nobody told them to lie to investigators as far as anything has been pointed out when you have people lie to the investigators when you have people lie to the fbi department of justice then there aposs going to be consequences to pay for that to go into the reasons why they chose to lie is simply something that you aposd need to ask all three of them we still need the larger picture which the democrats want to just paint the president with with these others is the simple fact that at the end of the day if this report comes back as it seems to be coming back that there was no collusion on the president or the part of the campaign then that is the part that we need to take and move from here why people lie chris that aposs a discussion for them and their lawyers and why they chose to do that wallace and i aposve got about 30 seconds left what do you think the reaction of the american people is going to be if the house democrats as intended seem continue investigations for the next year or so collins i think it aposs going to play badly for em but if that aposs where they choose to make their case to the american people that they deserve to be in power in the house then that aposs something that they aposre going to have to concentrate on we aposre going to continue to concentrate on one of the greatest economies that we aposve seen in years we aposre going to concentrate on the fact that deregulation works and i think if they want to go down this path we aposre going to meet them with strong resistance because there is a certain time that this is just a rabbit chase that they are wanting to go on a fishing expedition and we will be meeting that as it comes up surely the american people will see through political stunts like that wallace i like rabbit chases as well as fishing expeditions laughter wallace congressman collins thank you thanks for joining us today please come back sir collins chris look forward to it take care wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the legal and the political fallout from the mueller report commercial break wallace coming up democrats call for the release of the full mueller report plus all related materials from the investigation begin video clip schumer the american people have a right to the truth the watchword is transparency end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel how much information congress should get next commercial break begin video clip trump let it come out let people see it that aposs up to the attorney general we have a very good attorney general he aposs a very highly respected man and we aposll see what happens schumer the president himself has called without qualification for the report to be made public there is no reason on god aposs green earth why attorney general barr should do any less end video clip wallace president trump and senate democratic leader chuck schumer seeming to agree the full mueller report should be released to the public and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz columnist for the hill juan williams former democratic congresswoman donna edwards now a columnist for the washington post and former republican congresswoman barbara comstock i was thinking with three former members of congress we could form her own committee here and hold hearings congressman chaffetz from the information that you have and it aposs pretty sketchy but what we aposve heard so far about the mueller report as we await the summary and then whatever else more we aposre going to get over time what do you think we can say about president trump aposs actions his and his jeopardy down the line to impeachment jason chaffetz contributor i think impeachment is a ridiculous notion at this point if the mueller probe with everything they have and all the resources and by the way we need to still read the report but they have no more indictments coming and not a single person in relation to actual collusion it aposs really kind of ridiculous to even be talking about impeachment and if the democrats continue to overreach if they continue with this power grab to try to delegitimize the president i think america turns that out they keep screaming wolf wolf wolf and then they it ends up that they have nothing what adam schiff and others promised that they had seen personally under the guise that they had classified information and they got to see things other people didn apost and they aposve got nothing at this point wallace congresswoman edwards donna edwards d md former congresswoman well the president does a lot to delegitimize himself but i think that what democrats are calling for and frankly what the american people want is for the full report to be released so that they can get the benefit of the of the investigation and see what really went on and the fact that the there are no more indictments does not exonerate the president of the united states and we have to see that report we don apost know for example wallace well explain why does why doesn apost it exonerate edwards well because we don apost know for example that the reason that the president himself wasn apost indicted is because robert mueller was following a long standing department of justice precedent and that there may have been in fact conspiracy on the part of the president there may have been obstruction of justice on the part of the president and of course mueller wouldn apost indict what he would do is write a full report that the congress needs to see that the american people need to see so that we can make a judgment for ourselves and i aposm not going to prejudge what aposs in that report but we need to see it wallace well i agree with that but i take your point when it comes to obstruction because that could be something just involving president but the president couldn apost collude with russia by himself there would have to be other people involved and and the people frankly that a lot of us were wondering about like jared kushner like paul manafort like don junior none of them were indicted and they aposre not protected from being indicted so wouldn apost that seem to indicate that there wasn apost collusion edwards well i don apost know and robert mueller i think his mandate one was very limited but he may have made a decision that he aposs going to put put what happened in the report and then allow the political process the constitutional process to play out with respect to what happens next i don apost know but we need to see the full report the american people deserve it the american people are asking for it and the congress unanimously passed a the house passed a resolution 420 0 to release the full report release the underlying data and let us see where that leads wallace congresswoman comstock you know it hasn apost just been the 22 months of the mueller investigation because the fbi investigation started in july of 2016 so this has been going on in terms of investigating the president and the trump campaign and ties to russia for almost three years now so and again obviously we aposre we aposre talking before we get a lot of information but the fact that there are have are no indictments on collusion not only not of the president but any of the people around how much does that put the president in the clear on that issue and what do you think about the idea and we heard it from chairman nadler house democrats are going to keep investigating barbara comstock r va former congresswoman well as a former justice department official also i really have a lot of confidence in how bill barr the attorney general is handling this i thought the letter was just perfect he made clear he aposs going to work both with bob mueller and rod rosenstein who aposs staying on a little bit longer to go through this process so what i feel like we need to now let this process go forward let people actually read this i know the polls indicate people are already going to have their opinions and it aposs not going to be changed but i think it aposs important that we do read this and i think it aposs important that we really look at it with fresh eyes and not you know the inherent bias that everyone brings in from a partisan standpoint and we are very fortunate i think with bill barr being there right now he has a national security background a white house staffer background he worked at the white house also and when he was attorney general he appointed independent counsel aposs himself so i think he aposs going to look at this with fresh eyes and and i am confident that it aposs going to be transparent and we aposre going to get to see it wallace juan do and you heard this from congressman collins do democrats run the risk of a backlash if they continue to investigate assuming that the report doesn apost show a smoking gun with regard to president trump i mean i guess what i aposm asking is do you think there might be a sense if after the mueller investigation is over there you know basically and obviously we have to read it there aposs no there there or not much there there are people going to say leave the guy alone let aposs run the country juan williams political analyst well i think the president aposs going to encourage a backlash of sorts because he wanted it as leverage to shutdown the congressional investigations specifically the one jerry nadler talked to you about this morning chris but i think you have to understand that the president was trying to shut down the mueller investigation at times i mean he was making the case it aposs a witch hunt there aposs a deep state here the fbi is corrupt cia everybody the you know the mueller team is filled with democrats they aposre not going to be fair on friday i think he said to our colleagues maria bartiromo whose rod rosenstein he didn apost get any votes to ask somebody to investigate me there shouldn apost be a report so that kind of undermining is going to go forward but i think you have to understand i think the american people will understand congress is an equal branch of government they have a right to act as a check on the executive and to have these investigations the question is whether or not you are doing so with a political motive which is to prevent the president from functioning if that aposs the case there will be i think a legitimate backlash but right now if you look at the american people they think mueller was a legitimate investigation and congress has a right to check this president chaffetz but but that aposs exactly why democrats won apost be able to accept this mueller has all the credibility in the world and there are no indictments no we aposve got to read it wallace i aposve got to say and i just want to put this out there you say he has all the credibility in the world you realize the president for two years has been saying williams yes he has no credibility wallace exactly the opposite edwards he has no credibility chaffetz no but if you look at the polling of what the american people believe the president will walk out of this stronger than ever politically because now with this behind him and no indictments and no collusion exactly what the president said polar opposite of what the democrats and adam schiff have been saying i do think though 90 days from now there is going to be an inspector general report that could be very damning about the highest echelons within the fbi and what they were doing and i think that is that may have the most consequences williams but congressman but congressman just looking at what we aposve seen so far i don apost think anybody at this juncture would say oh this was a witch hunt look he aposs just throwing out indictments left and right to the contrary it seems as he aposs exercised some restraint chaffetz how did it how did it originate how did they go to the fisa court and get you know inaudible wallace well wait wait no no no no no i aposm not going to yes we aposre not going to go there edwards look but their wallace it originated it originated because donald trump fired james comey edwards that aposs right comstock and it aposs important wallace and and then he said to lester holt chaffetz and that democrats wallace and then he said to lester holt on nbc it aposs the russia thing williams he sure did comstock but then it aposs important to note he wallace well wait i want to hear the congressman chaffetz no but it the the president wallace that aposs why that aposs why there was a special counsel chaffetz that every single democrat in this town wanted to fire james comey he had rod rosenstein it absolutely wallace yes but they didn apost fire him because of his involvement in the in the russia investigation chaffetz the president got a a memo from rod rosenstein to actually do the wallace oh please he aposd already decided chaffetz come on yes please wallace he aposd already decided to do that he aposd already decided he was up at bedminster the weekend before chaffetz he has a constitutional opportunity and duty to do that wallace that aposs a different issue but he he fired him because he said because of the russia thing edwards he said because of the russia thing look chaffetz no i i think you play back that tape you even had brit hume i think put out a tweet saying i went back and watched this williams no come on edwards come on look jason come on all of the the american chaffetz roll the tape edwards the american people saw the tape we played it over and over wallace we played the the tape has been playing since may of 2017 he said russia thing was part of it chaffetz the president but he has a constitutional duty an wallace you keep switching the argument congressman chaffetz no i aposm not he he can fire him and i aposm saying that democrats were all in favor of that as well comstock it aposs important to note he can apost inaudible fired him because of russia wallace all right you aposre just eating into the next segment i we aposll argue during the commercial you want to get those special scanners we have to take a break here but when we come back the race for the 2020 democratic nomination we have a new fox poll on where the candidates stand against each other and against president trump commercial break begin video clip sen bernie sanders i vt d presidential candidate it is absolutely imperative that the trump administration make that report public as soon as possible beto o aposrourke d presidential candidate republicans and democrats should do whatever they can to make sure that their constituents the american people can read that report end video clip wallace two of the leading democratic candidates bernie sanders and beto o aposrourke wasting no time calling for the release of the mueller report as democrats jockey for position on the campaign trail we have brand new fox news polling out today on how they stack up against each other and against president trump begin videotape sanders we are going to transform this country wallace democratic voters are starting to sort through a field that may reach 20 candidates or even more and at this point name recognition seems to be the biggest factor joe biden and bernie sanders are in the top tier in our polls with kamala harris and beto o aposrourke in the next group followed by cory booker and elizabeth warren trump democrat lawmakers are now embracing socialism wallace for all the president aposs talk about democrats moving far left the party aposs primary voters say they aposll be practical fifty one percent say it aposs more important to back a candidate who can beat mr trump while 36 percent say they will support the one they like the most when it comes to policy sen kamala harris d calif presidential candidate which is why i support medicare for all o aposrourke some will criticize the green new deal for being too bold wallace two thirds of democratic voters say they aposre very likely to back a candidate who supports medicare for all more than half back a 70 percent tax on income over 10 million but other ideas like the green new deal in reparations and abolishing ice are supported by a third of democratic voters or less trump i aposd love to have biden i aposd love to have bernie i aposd love to have beto wallace president trump says he can apost wait to face the top candidates in our fox news poll but if the election were held today registered voters say they would pick biden by a margin of seven points sanders also wins and warren and harris trail narrowly all three of them within the margin of error end videotape wallace congressman edwards what stance out for you in that fox poll edwards well the democrats are being very clear about the objective and the objective being to defeat donald trump they want to choose a candidate that they agree with but they want somebody who can go toe to toe and beat and beat this president and i think that that you know it aposs rare that you see democrats are acting in such a very sort of pragmatic way in terms of their their thinking but that aposs what this year has brought and also i think a lot of people don apost even know these candidates that aposs really what stands out for me in this poll and that aposs why it aposs important to go through this primary process and i aposm looking forward to joe biden jumping in wallace congressman comstock let aposs look at the field of democratic candidates at least the front runners put it up on the screen here are the top six in the fox poll and as we said biden and sanders obviously enjoyed a big advantage in name recognition but would you say that those are the six front runners now that the democratic nominee is likely to be in that group comstock i do think so and i think i was a little surprised by the practical approach of the democrats who are sort of going with their head more than their heart because what we aposre seeing on tv and in congress often is this lurch to the left but certainly we haven apost seen biden in yet but i think it comes down to it aposs all about pennsylvania i think and people have realized that the guy you know who always likes to talk about scranton has an edge in a very key state for the president i think you aposre going to see any of these candidates are not going to do what hillary clinton did and not go to michigan or wisconsin so i aposm a little surprised by the practical approach but i think that is i think it aposs likely they come through there but these others have been very undivided the fact that joe biden who has been fairly vetted over the years from all his campaign and the president the way they stack up there that has to be encouraging to the democrats but as these others come on you know people like beto who you know a lot of bizarre stories there i think the the psycho shower scene is certainly going to we were talking about it before that that that is kind of lost me how you can think that aposs a funny thing to play a joke on somebody with that and some of his other things so i do think we aposre going to lean interestingly enough two 70 year old men biden or bernie and we aposre not going to wallace closer to 80 actually comstock yes wallace then there is a horse race whoever the democratic nominee is against president trump and let aposs take a look at that pole as you can see there biden beats the president by seven points sanders beats him slightly but sanders warren and harris are all within the margin of error with the president juan look let aposs be honest this is ridiculously early we aposre a year and a half before but what does that tell you about the chances democrats have whoever it ends up being of beating donald trump in november of 2020 williams well i think it aposs going to be a tough race and i think anybody who thinks anything else is really in a fantasy you know what you see there by the way i think is evidence of name ideas you pointed out but keep in mind there have only been five presidents i think in history who have not won a second term donald trump not only has the bully pulpit he has the bully twitter and so he aposs out there and he sets the media agenda he aposs going to comment on every democratic debate he aposs going to be putting down nicknaming candidates but i would keep in mind that you also have it very clear here 60 i think it aposs more than two thirds of democrats want joe biden in the race they know who joe biden is because of name id he aposs going to have a tough race by the way on criminal police criminal crime reform in the apos90s anita hill testimony all that is going to come up and going to challenge him with the left wing of the party but when it comes to the policy issues that you highlighted chris things like medicare for all it aposs overwhelming the american people want these things when it comes to things that are deemed socialist by president trump these are not winning issues so there aposs lots there for the democrats to have hope about but it aposs not going to be an easy race comstock but the democrats are talking about things like getting rid of the electoral college and packing the court instead of a lot of these you know people want to talk about jobs and education and you know things like infrastructure and they aposre not talking about that so i think that aposs a inaudible wallace let me let me let me bring in congressman chaffetz who is i was going to make some joke about chaffeting ph at the bit but all right so 2018 was not a good year for the republicans i understand donald trump wasn apost on the ballot but suburban women went against him minorities went against him young people went against him or went against the party independents and he kept saying he was on the ballot how concerned are you when you see i understand it aposs early biden seven points up a number of these others neck and neck i mean doesn apost it indicate not that he aposs in trouble necessarily but it aposs going to be a tough race chaffetz well i would remind you that president obama had a worse far worse midterm election than donald trump did but donald trump is a unique person he has this dynamism he can draw these crowds he can talk directly from his heart i don apost see anybody on that list who has the authenticity and the dynamism that donald trump has in order to win an election when 30 of the 50 states went with donald trump and you combine that with a thriving economy world peace that i think is moving in the right direction i think donald trump does have the upper hand certainly is the incumbent wallace i i want to ask you we aposve got about two minutes left congressman edwards there aposs talk that biden is going to get into the race probably next month and that there aposs also talk the concerned that he aposs not going to have big grassroots excitement at that he is an older guy he aposs going to be close to 80 if he aposs elected president and it may be early on he would name a running mate like stacey abrams younger women minority do you think that aposs a good idea or do you think in fact it only is a sign of weakness gee i got to prep myself up here edwards well i aposm not going to say who he aposs going to name but i actually wallace no i don apost mean stacey abrams but the idea of a running mate edwards no but no but i aposve been i aposve actually been quite an advocate early on i think you know months ago i said i thought that that would be a great strategy for him because i think that it also signals to people where the future of the party is and lays the groundwork for a team that aposs going to run and challenge donald trump it would be unconventional but i think it would give him a lift that you know is needed in this kind of multicandidate field even with joe biden and i don apost think it aposs a sign of weakness in fact i think it demonstrates his strength and his belief that he can carry a ticket that can win in states like pennsylvania and michigan and wisconsin comstock but it aposs the ted cruz strategy that we carley fiorina that didn apost work i think it is a sign of weakness and it aposs also reagan in apos76 tried to do it and it didn apost work so it doesn apost have a history of working i do think chaffetz and none of the other people are actually planning to become the vice president and so i think he becomes even more of a target williams but remember the number one goal for democrats beat comstock beat williams donald trump and any strategy right there i think you will find people buying into it and it aposs why they aposre such interest in a fairly establishment candidate like joe biden wallace all right thank you panel we aposve only got about 18 months more to chew over all of this and i can apost wait see you next sunday up next our power player of the week working to save children in places where hope is running out commercial break wallace it aposs every parent aposs worst nightmare your child needs major surgery but now imagine you live in a part of the world where doctors and hospitals are not equipped to treat the problem here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape susan rickman ceo world pediatric project our motto is heal a child change the world these are amazing kids and they deserve as a basic human rights to have access to advanced health care wallace susan rickman is head of the world pediatric project which sends medical teams to 12 countries in central america and the caribbean to treat children with serious health problems rickman nine out of 10 people in the world have no access to surgical care and when you look at the countries we work into it aposs almost 10 out of 10 children that don apost have access to pediatric care unidentified male get a prosthesis for that wallace doctors and nurses volunteer to spend a week treating as many kids as they can in their specialty unidentified male the fibula there and there aposs no tibia bone unidentified male fix the hurt ph see what they sound like rickman if it aposs an open heart surgery team that goes down like to our honduras they do about eight open heart surgeries in a week if it aposs a plastic team going down it may be 50 cases that they do by the weeks wallace doctors like jeffrey lukish a pediatric surgeon at children aposs national health system in washington who aposs been volunteering for wpp for seven years dr jeffrey lukish children aposs national health system to go into an environment where children are so very needy and would be without surgical care and be chronically in pain it is a wonderful experience wallace but sometimes a child aposs problems are too serious to be treated in their country rickman at the end of the week they can look at a child and say i couldn apost do you here but bring you up to one of our facilities ph in the united states i can return you as a healthy child unidentified male that aposs a large inaudible defect wallace maccoll hall ph from the island of st vincent was 12 years old when doctors saw him he was flown to st louis to one of wpp aposs 17 partner hospitals to have open heart surgery that will let him lead a full life wallace on camera you say the biggest challenge is to build trust in these countries why is that such a challenge rickman because i think there aposs been a lot of distrust earned in these countries with groups that have gone in and have not stayed wallace voice over wpp started in 2001 and the numbers are impressive fifty five medical teams travel to the region each year treat some 2 500 children and fly 100 more back to the u s over the last 18 years they aposve cared for 13 000 kids the funding comes entirely from private donations but that doesn apost tell the full story wallace on camera you raised 5 million last year but you provided 25 million in services how does that work rickman because of our doctors and our nurses you know donating and giving of their time we have medical supply companies that are giving us hundreds of thousands of dollars of supplies for us to take down without our surgical team wallace susan rickman has been part of wpp since the start she says there aposs nothing she would rather do rickman i think anytime that you can
