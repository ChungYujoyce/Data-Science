istration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic iran facilitated the movement of al qaeda terrorists through its country including september 11 2001 attackers and for years was a critical channel for money and arms according to the 9 11 commission report and internal osama bin laden documents experts say the late qassem soleimani surely knew of and directed the terror partnership since he has headed since 1998 iran s quds force it is a u s designated terrorist organization and an arm of the islamic revolutionary guard corps which dominates iranian society on jan 3 maj gen soleimani was killed in baghdad by a u s drone missile attack on his car on orders of president trump there is strong evidence that iran facilitated the transit of al qaeda members into and out of afghanistan before 9 11 and that some of these were future 9 11 hijackers said the commission known formally as the national commission on terror attacks upon the united states top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk osama bin laden called iran our main artery for men and money michael rubin a middle east scholar at the american enterprise institute said none of this would have happened without gen soleimani s blessings qassem soleimani was the second most powerful man in iran after the supreme leader mr rubin told the washington times he didn t just run overseas operations and those involving iranian relations with terror groups he formulated and developed them there was not a single operation of any significance which he did not approve if not oversee this extends backwards not only into iran s support for proxies in lebanon iraq syria and yemen but also to its ties to al qaeda mr rubin added simply put the 9 11 hijackers never would have been able to train in afghanistan had it not been for soleimani s support and iranian free passage the same holds true for iran s subsequent safe haven to senior al qaeda operatives in irgc bases inside iran al quds creates and aligns with other terror groups in the region training financing and directing them as it is today in iraq the 9 11 commission s 2004 report paid close attention to how bin laden s terrorists moved in and out of afghanistan its headquarters in an alliance with the now ousted taliban regime its report said iranian border officials were under orders not to stamp the visas of al qaeda travelers one commission source was tawfiq bin attash known as khallad who bombed the destroyer uss cole in 2000 khallad and other detainees have described the willingness of iranian officials to facilitate the travel of al qaeda members through iran on their way to and from afghanistan the report said for example iranian border inspectors would be told not to place telltale stamps in the passports of these travelers such arrangements were particularly beneficial to saudi members of al qaeda two other commission sources were the jailed khalid sheik mohammed the 9 11 master player and an associate ramzi bin al shibh ksm and binalshibh have confirmed that several of the 9 11 hijackers at least eight according to binalshibh transited iran on their way to or from afghanistan taking advantage of the iranian practice of not stamping saudi passports the report says they deny any other reason for the hijackers travel to iran the report said that evidence didn t show that iran knew of the pending attack on the world trade center and targets in washington but it also called for the government to investigate this link further the commission also said that al qaeda terrorists received training from hezbollah the iran created terror army in southern lebanon which works closely with gen soleimani there is more evidence of an iran al qaeda working relationship it is found in millions of pages of documents seized by navy seals when they raided bin laden s pakistan hideout and killed him in may 2011 the papers show iran was a vital safe passage for al qaeda members to move in and out of the pakistan afghanistan region with many on their way to kill americans in iraq gen soleimani was particularly active in 2005 11 sending his quds operatives into iraq to train shiite militia members like the ones operating in iraq today on how to target and blow up u s troops the u s says gen soleimani was responsible for 603 american deaths and thousands wounded in a letter to abu ayyub al masri leader of al qaeda in iraq in 2007 bin laden warn him not to attack iran for its assistance to shia militia some of whom fought masri s terrorists you did not consult with us on that serious issue that affects the general welfare of all of us bin laden wrote masri who had made public threats we expected you would consult with us for these important matters for as you are aware iran is our main artery for funds personnel and communication as well as the matter of hostages masri was killed in 2010 by u s troops he was succeeded by abu bakr al baghdadi who fled to syria and founded the brutal islamic state terror army once u s troops left under orders of president barack obama isis invaded iraq taking swaths of territory in northern and western iraq mr trump who approved the strike on gen soleimani also ok d the army delta force raid in november that resulted in al baghdadi s death by suicide bomb iran helped al qaeda in other ways it provided a home for one of bin laden s sons saad and for said al adel an al qaeda military leader under indictment for the 1998 bombing of u s embassies in east africa the u s killed saad in a 2009 air strike the picture adds up to two organs of terror shia iran and sunni al qaeda cooperating in their shared hatred of the untied states that supports the conclusion that bin laden s relations with iran s dictatorship were convoluted a mix of cooperation competition distrust and opportunistic collusion james phillips a heritage foundation middle east expert said
