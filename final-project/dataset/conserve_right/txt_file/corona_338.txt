a simple well proven powerful way for president trump to reverse the current economic debacle and produce an american economic miracle president trump on the campaign trail showed that he has the right instincts to unleash prosperity spoiler alert i prescribe the gold standard praised by trump on the stump to achieve this will trump follow those instincts this is the first of a three part series presenting the case for why the gold standard is the compelling option to quickly restore american prosperity it explains why and how the president can direct national economic council director larry kudlow to definitively set the american economy on a renewed path of sizzling job creation and equitable prosperity what is the alternative economist john maynardkeynes once told asaturday evening postreporter who in 1932 asked whether anything like the great depression had previously occurred yes it was called the dark ages and it lasted 400 years if the political authorities will make the simple but correct policy response this downturn could prove a blip the alternative is what i have elsewhere called a little dark age this column does not address the public health issues about which i lack expertise to paraphrase james carville it s about the economy sweetheart there is only one person now with sufficient authority equipped to accomplish what needs to be done donald trump trump capably advised bylarry kudlow uniquely has both the power and the insight follow along trump could outperform franklin d roosevelt who facing the even greater catastrophe of the great depression defied the conventional wisdom and although only temporarily see below got the engines of commerce roaring again trump like fdr who enjoyed pitting his advisors against one another is not intimidated by experts trump has the disposition to do what the late great jfk s chief economist walter heller advised congress in 1985 rise above principle and do what is right the power of good

modicum of economic security to people who had none it had little to do with boosting the economy tucked away however in this whole motley baggage as a last minute amendment to the agricultural adjustment act was one step that succeeded beyond anyone s wildest expectations in getting the economy moving again this was the temporary abandonment of the gold standard and the devaluation of the dollar while widely seen even by fdr as going off gold he did no such thing it was a recalibration of the badly defective interwar gold standard an obscure but toxic monetary conference held ingenoa in 1922knocked the pins out from under the pre war classical gold standard while preserving the facade this flimflam later called the triffin dilemma caused general commodity prices to float up by 50
