pyongyang s first successful long range missile test according to a western intelligence official the state department sent a diplomatic protest note to china after the dec 12 launch that placed a non functioning satellite into orbit the message to beijing from washington was blunt do more to rein in north korea or the united states will sharply increase military cooperation with asian allies including japan and south korea top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning the obama administration as part of its lead from behind strategy had placed responsibility for halting the north korean missile test on china arguing it is in beijing s interest to maintain regional stability by stopping the launch however china failed to head off the launch which was the second test this year of what the pentagon is calling a long range missile known as the taepodong 2 a chinese delegation visited pyongyang in early december in what u s officials assessed was an attempt to persuade the regime of kim jong un not to conduct the test the delegation however either did not press the north koreans to stop the launch or simply traveled to pyongyang to make it appear that china was responding to u s government concerns china state television reported beijng s regret for the launch the day of the test adding that if every country does the same the world will be turned upside down the failure to stop the launch highlights china s continuing covert support for north korea whose military leaders remain closely aligned with china s communist ruled military the relationship between the people s liberation army and the korean people s army has been characterized in typical chinese fashion as close as lips and teeth those ties do not appear to be changing under the new regimes of chinese leader xi

conducting an underground nuclear blast after a long range missile test one official said there were no signs that a nuclear test is imminent and there was no increased activity at the kilju test facility in the mountains in the northeastern part of the country official assessments are that north korea could conduct another nuclear test with little preparation south korean officials according

deployment of a third long range anti missile interceptor base on the east coast survived the house senate conference this week if the bill becomes law the obama administration will be required to build the new site at one of three locations in the eastern united states by the end of 2015 the third ground based interceptor site is opposed by the pentagon because it is thought to upset plans for the less capable europe based missile defense plan that the administration has hoped so far unsuccessfully would mollify russian opposition to u s and allied missile defenses missile defense specialists however say the administration s european defense plans will not be effective in countering growing missile threats now it appears congress agrees a house armed services committee statement said the third base is needed to respond to rising ballistic missile threats from states like iran the third interceptor base is in addition to bases at fort greely alaska and vandenberg air force base calif rep michael r turner ohio republican and chairman of the house armed services subcommittee on strategic services said passage of the missile defense provision highlights congressional opposition to administration cuts for missile defenses the planning and study for an additional u s missile defense site is welcome news because it signals agreement that it is time to put the missile defense of the homeland as our top priority mr turner said adding that north korea s recent missile test was a warning that we can no longer afford the administration s disregard of homeland missile defense earlier this year u s officials familiar with missile defense plans said two possible locations for the third site are loring air force base maine a strategic base that was closed in 1994 and

committee of which mr kerry is chairman most reports about kiriakou s recent conviction for violating the intelligence identities protection act note that he worked for mr kerry as a senior committee staff member dealing with counterterrorism and detainee issues kiriakou pleaded guilty oct 23 to one count of violating the law by disclosing the name of a cia officer to a journalist the statement of facts in the case reveals that after kiriakou disclosed the identity of the undercover cia officer the name was disclosed to lawyers representing al qaeda terrorists in the u s military detention center at guantanamo bay cuba the cia officer had been an interrogator and kiriakou was part of the lawyers plan to use possible disclosure of the identity of cia interrogators in their legal defense during tribunals kiriakou is seen by supporters as a victim of overzealous anti media prosecutors but intelligence and security officials said his role in the disclosure of cia officers to al qaeda terrorists was not whistleblowing he is a real bad actor said one official senators who have campaigned against intelligence leaks are expected to question mr kerry about hiring kirakou during any future nomination hearing cia anger at kirakou was reflected in a statement by then cia director david h petraeus who said the prosecution marks an important victory for our agency for our

issue with president obama s nuclear policies for the first time in the history of u s nuclear policy the president has placed nuclear disarmament and non proliferation rather than nuclear deterrence atop the u s nuclear agenda however the senator said treaties and unilateral actions on nuclear disarmament will not address nuclear dangers and are troubling u s allies dependent on nuclear power we should think very carefully therefore before we contemplate any changes to long standing u s nuclear deterrence policies or pursue further reductions in support of the president s disarmament agenda he said we absolutely cannot know for certain that fewer numbers of weapons will make us safer mr kyl also warned against russian efforts to limit u s missile defenses calling it one of the greatest challenges we face today the united states cannot allow russia to dictate to us limits on the capabilities of u s missile defenses he said if they could be effective against a russian launch so be it that s what it means to protect americans from potential threats if the russians argue that they pose no possible threat then our missile defense
