up here cnn has been accused of an egregious misreading of the data used in a recent report claiming 68 percent of americans say they need a coronavirus vaccine before returning to normal life cnn published an article monday that declared in its headline 68 of americans say a vaccine is needed before returning to normal life citing a new survey it cited two new gallup surveys but didn t link to either of them cnn promoted the story with a tweet using the same statistic cnn ignores tara reade s call for joe biden to drop out of presidential contest nicholas grossman an international relations professor at university of illinois responded with a column headlined no 68 of americans do not think a vaccine is needed before returning to normal life grossman first points out that the term normal life is unclear and confusing for readers regardless of whether or not the data is accurate cnn finally covers larry king clip which biden accuer s mother purportedly alludes to daughter s sexual assault does it mean a return to pre coronavirus normal with no masks in public packed restaurants and no worries about large indoor gatherings such as concerts basketball games and conferences does it mean the end of government mandated lockdowns which many states are easing already maybe it means something in between the cnn article doesn t say grossman wrote the data doesn t match cnn s headline or tweet which is all many people will see in the age of social media cnn s article didn t lead with the information promised in the headline instead noting that one survey found that fewer people avoiding small gatherings than were doing so last month and around 74 of americans say they re avoiding small gatherings the cnn piece finally gets to the normal life tidbit in the third subhead of the story and that apos s what really vexedgrossman grossman wrote that he searchedgallup s polling on coronavirus and found a question mentioning vaccines presumably where cnn got the 68 percent number because 68 percent of respondents said a vaccine is very important but cnn presented it differently in its headline return to normal life another release from gallup finds 80 of americans say it is very important for those who test positive for covid 19 to mandatory quarantine they said this measure needs to be in place before they apos d be willing to return to normal life the cnn article read nearly three quarters consider it very important for there to be a significant reduction in the number of new cases or deaths and 68 rate the availability of a vaccine as very important cnn s headline said 68 percent feel a vaccine is needed to return to normal life butthe study saidthat 68 percent feel a vaccine is very important as opposed to needed the gallup poll also refers to normal activities as opposed to normal life the data doesn t match cnn s headline or tweet which is all many people will see in the age of social media grossman added click here for complete coronavirus coverage well sure if there was a covid vaccine who wouldn t return to their normal activities but the question unlike cnn s article doesn t say anything about what s needed grossman wrote apos thinking about your willingness is much less restrictive than needed of course people are thinking about it that doesn t mean they re unwilling to resume normal activities without it grossman wrote claiming that this survey shows that 68 of americans say a vaccine is needed before returning to normal life is an egregious misreading of the data grossman wasn t alone in his thinking reason senior editor robby soave also accused cnn of misusing the data it turns out that the headline 68 of americans say a vaccine is needed before returning to normal life new survey finds is fake news soave wrote nothing that grossman first noticed cnn s misinterpretation of the poll the cnn article cites a gallup poll as its source but gallup did not poll respondents on the question of whether a vaccine was needed before returning to normal life which was cnn apos s wording of the question in the headline soave wrote cnn should delete the tweet fix the article issue a correction and be a lot more careful to accurately represent survey data in the future grossman wrote click here for the fox news app by tuesday night the site added a clarification which read the headline on this post was updated to clarify that the survey found 68 of americans say an available vaccine is very important before returning to normal life the post was also clarified to emphasizethat respondents were rating
