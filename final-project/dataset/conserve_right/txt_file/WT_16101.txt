ation should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion here s a question i might suggest be asked of our presidential hopefuls in a time of war would unilateral disarmament be a good idea here s how i might suggest they reply this is a time of war stupid we have troops in afghanistan and again in iraq perhaps as president obama appears to believe engagement will transform iran from a revolutionary terrorist sponsor into an upstanding member of the international community but for now death to america and death to israel remain among the openly proclaimed goals of its rulers north korea nuclear armed despite a 1994 agreement that president clinton assured us would lead pyongyang to freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program is developing missiles that can deliver nuclear warheads to distant targets such as los angeles china has been waging cyber attacks on the united states with impunity having taken slices of ukraine and georgia russia s vladimir putin may be preparing to test nato s mettle in the balkans top stories gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century i would further suggest that the candidates stress what an unpardonable error it would be to intentionally diminish our military capabilities given these threats and oh yes by the way diminishing our military capabilities is the current policy of the obama administration and it has the acquiescence and in some cases the support of many republicans in congress the american military today is smaller than it was before the pearl harbor of sept 11 2001 with more shrinkage on the governmental to do list gen raymond t odierno outgoing u s army chief of staff wrote in a wall street journal op ed last week that the current environment demands an active duty army of 490 000 troops but that the budget control act of 2013 also known as sequestration has already forced us to reduce army forces to 450 000 he added that the united states does not have an army sized equipped and prepared to meet the uncertain security challenges that lie ahead a question i might pose to reporters covering the race for the presidency do you not think america s military unpreparedness matters as much as donald trump s rude outbursts or bernie sanders outrage over the fact that some people in america make a lot more money than others there s more over recent years the u s had been developing increasingly sophisticated weapons of economic warfare the term generally used sanctions can be misleading just as not all firearms are alike there s a difference between a 22 caliber handgun and a 50 caliber sniper rifle not all sanctions are alike the relatively mild sanctions imposed on cuba beginning in 1961 were essentially an expression of disapproval for the dictatorial castro regime a regime that the obama administration is now rewarding even though it is unreformed unrepentant and in recent days has been arresting scores of dissidents significant economic pressures had been placed on iran then in late 2013 an interim agreement was concluded it substantially relieved those pressures it then became impossible to do what some members of congress planned to increase the pressure until such time as iran s rulers would see their economy being crippled and their regime threatened with collapse might they then have agreed to verifiably dismantle their nuclear weapons program we ll never know the comprehensive agreement currently being reviewed by congress disables america s economic weapons in return for an iranian promise to delay that program for a decade or so president obama claims it will be possible to snap back sanctions in response to iranian cheating or increasing iranian support of terrorism utilizing the billions of dollars scheduled to pour into tehran s coffers but mark dubowitz my colleague at the foundation for defense of democracies has noted that paragraphs 26 and 37 of the agreement give iran nuclear snap backs they make clear that if sanctions are re imposed for any reason iran will have the right to walk away from its nuclear obligations pocketing whatever financial concessions have been granted up to that point paragraph 29 requires the united states and the european union to do nothing to interfere with normalization of trade and economic relations with iran why would american negotiators agree to such concessions they apparently believe that talking softly while carrying no military or economic sticks is all that s necessary to achieve conflict resolution with canada or australia that s probably true but iran russia china and north korea are different have multiculturalism and moral equivalence blinded america s leaders to that reality perhaps because while many american leaders continue to give lip service to the imperative of peace through strength few seem to understand the paradox implied the best way to avoid war is to prepare for war and to convince your enemies you are not afraid to go kinetic credible threats are effective threats implausible threats are bluffs bluffs that are likely to be called and should war break out fortune favors the prepared and well armed conversely a nation in retreat a nation intent on weakening itself a nation that declares itself war weary will prove irresistible to empire builders i for one would like to know which presidential candidates understand these concepts or at least recognize that a war no less serious than the cold war is underway and that unilaterally disarming is precisely the wrong response i d even like to hear what bernie and the donald have to say on this score clifford d may is president of the foundation for defense of democracies and a columnist for the washing
