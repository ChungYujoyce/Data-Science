becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots the document reads having experienced a prolonged period of human rights disasters and challenging and tortuous struggles the awakening chinese citizens are becoming increasingly aware that freedom equality and human rights are universal values shared by all humankind and that democracy republicanism and constitutional government make up the basic institutional framework of modern politics a modernization bereft of these universal values and this basic political framework is a disastrous process that deprives people of their rights rots away their humanity and destroys their dignity the document decries china s atrocious history on human rights and states that even as china has opened up and allowed increased freedom in the past decade and a half this political progress has largely remained on paper there are laws but there is no rule of law there is a constitution but no constitutional government this is still the political reality that is obvious to all the ruling elite continues to insist on its authoritarian grip on power rejecting political reform the group demanded as americans did during the american revolution that rights are inherent not bestowed by the state they call for checks and balances through a separation of powers legislative democracy and judicial independence guaranteed human rights freedom of association and expression and religion election of public officials protection of private

and actions in that statement he said what i required of myself was both as a person and in my writing i had to live with honesty responsibility and dignity his statement reflects this i have no enemies and no hatred he said none of the police who have monitored arrested and interrogated me the prosecutors who prosecuted me or the judges who sentenced me are my enemies his statement indeed praised the improvements in china s treatment of prisoners and he heralded those changes as proof that china is on course to become a free country i firmly believe that china s political progress will never stop and i m full of optimistic expectations of freedom coming to china in the future because no force can block the human desire for freedom he said freedom of expression is the basis of human rights the source of humanity and the mother of truth to block freedom of speech is to trample on human rights to strangle humanity and to suppress the truth it seems that here in the united states many don t realize how good we have it as some lawmakers want to limit freedoms to participate in the political process look at the legislation that congressional liberals champion the disclose act would intimidate political donors into silence card check legislation would do the same to workers who oppose unionization more glaring even was the obama administration s decision to sign on to the united nations human rights council s resolution against hate speech which as the national journal reports is a small but significant step toward ending free speech the resolution broadly worded calls on countries to take effective measures consistent with their obligations under international human rights law to address and combat not only incidents of racial and religious intolerance discrimination and related violence but also negative racial and religious stereotyping as national journal writer stuart taylor wrote the ambiguously worded united nations human rights council resolution could plausibly be read as encouraging or even obliging the u s to make it a crime to engage in hate speech despite decades of first amendment case law protecting such speech hate speech is not good speech but outlawing it is the beginning of a slippery slope that undermines the first amendment we have it great here in america but we must defend the freedoms we have or one day we might
