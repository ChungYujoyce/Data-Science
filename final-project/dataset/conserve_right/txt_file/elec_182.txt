libertarian vice presidential candidate the main takeaway after some of the usual slightly sneery scene setting about weirdo libertarians reported from july s freedomfest in las vegas and the lovely color detail of the patrician weld being amazed he s staying in a new york hotel whose price is three digits beginning with one that while weld totally thinks of himself as libertarian and has for a long time he s also a guy who just likes to do strange and challenging things as a lark like writing novels and hates being bored and likes being in the political mix an unnamed former adviser says there s nothing more he would like than to be flying around the country on somebody else s dime flying first class and talking to political reporters all day another unnamed former staffer says of weld he is old money white and fucking brilliant everybody tries to distance himself from those traits when running for office and he always embraced them and made them his own reason has written quite a bit on some conflicts between weld and libertarianism as most define it despite weld s long time affection for that self identification and this profile is decent on explaining that aspect of the weld libertarian story the profile by simon van zuylen wood sums up that conflict weld s strategy isn t to try to defend libertarian ideas instead he articulates the ones he thinks disaffected centrists want to hear when johnson suggests abolishing the internal revenue service weld raises an eyebrow and clarifies that he wouldn t go that far when asked about gun control weld suggests the formation cue a million libertarians choking on their dinner of a massive new fbi task force i ask him at random about climate change he advocates pragmatic mainstream and essentially unlibertarian ideas about the urgent need for governing bodies to prevent the rise of global temperatures by 2 degrees celsius these aren t ideas his free market brethren take kindly to he smiles he doesn t care i m running as myself weld to reason tv in may on why libertarians can trust him next california bitcoin regulatory bill pulled by its sponsor brian doherty is a senior editor at reasonand author of ron

reason at any time report abuses so picking a barack obama supporting candidate as your veep may not be the best libertarian option i was wondering how long it would take before the vitriol started pouring in vitriol and he has my vote so there there s nothing more he would like than to be flying around the country on somebody else s dime flying first class and talking to political reporters all day another unnamed former staffer says of weld he is old money white and fucking brilliant everybody tries to distance himself from those traits when running for office and he always embraced them and made them his own and by the way that s how you do vitriol oh i see that diane reynolds paul is one of those insufferable purists sarc though i love hillary she can do no wrong in my eyes and shill for jill i am nevertheless voting for johnson why one word bill weld i thought it had more to do with the fact that you can t bring yourself to vote for a jew oh right i m an anti semite because i don t think charlie hebdo is funny thanks for reminding me what else should i know about myself that i probably don t realize no you re an anti semite because you consistently peddle wacko blood libel conspiracy theories about the supposed perfidy of the israelis tell us more about how the israeli defense industry is both fueling and profiting from militarized policing in america s inner cities no i said that the israeli private security company g4s wants to set up shop in the us armed guards outside every bar and convenience store to protect us from jihadis but that s hardly news i also now shill for jill but that is hardly news either ah the mask keffiyeh is starting to slip yes yes go on tell us more about these rootless cosmopolitans and their war profiteering hm i feel as if there s something you d like to tell us don t employ the pluralis majestatis unless you re an edwardian era potentate it s just gauche otherwise we are not amused william weld never mind libertarianism he s running as himself ain t nobody just like this i gotta be me baby hit or miss i think you meant ain t nobody that s funny i was just reminded of the opening break from that earlier today and dl d it to play with i think it was used in the shadow cutchemist brainfreeze mix but otherwise wasn t much used by people except for this which i never liked weld suggests the formation of a massive new fbi task force the urgent need for governing bodies to prevent the rise of global temperatures by 2 degrees celsius you know for a supposed pragmatist libertarian he does seem to want more government yes but these are things we can work with for example i can declare allegiance to isis and distract the fbi from trying to radicalize retarded kids to jihad against their mothers but first blow up the local synagogue because that would really show her right ma republicans share 70 of their political dna with libertarians which sounds great until you recognize that garden slugs share 70 of their dna with humans there s a hell of a lot of self described libertarians who think it means having really super smart and enlightened central planners who will decide what choices everyone should be allowed to make i ran into a millennial who was a libertarian and a huge gayjay supporter and he fell right into that category his biggest complaint about the rs and the ds was that they were all controlled by stupid people and the lp was filled with smart people thankfully there was ample beer because if that guy is representative of the libertarian moment it s gonna look a lot like the libertarian moment in maoist china nothing says diversity than a boston brahmin william weld is that the story of the dude who shot an arrow through an apple sitting on some shlep s head william tell tell who no who s on first don t you mean fist what does a krulak have to do with this when william weld finally gives a libertarian answer bah wasn t meant to be a response no offense hi ho silver no he s the guy in that poe story who murders his doppelganger william wilson deadpool we are not amused by the memes petitions and signs about harambe our zoo family is still healing and the constant mention of harambe makes moving forward more difficult for us we are honoring harambe by redoubling our gorilla conservation efforts and encouraging others to join us this makes me want to see even more harambe memes i am amused by harambe memes please continue harambe was a jew did you win yet obviously ok does that mean i can t keep spreading the blood libel now you re getting it is there blood slander harambe was a jew i d like to meet his mohel is there something here that is supposed to impress me or make me want to vote for him who votes for or against the vice presidential candidate one would hope you bring something to the ticket worth voting for though the anti palins it was all i ever heard about other than around here when mccain was running seriously people were phreaking the phuck out about her i guess this time is different cause the younger one would be prez i processed that as the anti paladins it was all i ever heard about other than around here when mccain was running i think it s time for a break from dnd campaign planning i don t know i love hillary but i can t stand tim whoever so i m voting for jill watermelon when it is a protest candidate and said vp candidate gets as much screen time as the candidate himself yea he s kind of important where is this guy libertarian exactly well when your vp choice offends most every libertarian out there it doesn t say great things about your judgement maybe having mitt romney in the johnson administration cabinet will pull weld in a a more libertarian direction together they re an ex republican governor triple threat weld was a mistake we should all say a prayer asking that nothing bad happens to president johnson is that you mark hanna weld is certainly not a libertarian but he also doesn t fit into either party today and has fiscal conservative bona fides i presume johnson brought him aboard primarily as rainmaker for fundraising and endorsement hunting given that his campaign is having unprecedented success in fundraising and polling i don t see a reason to harp too much about the choice of weld yes the whole who cares if he s a sellout as long as we win attitude has never caused problems before i mean it s not like there hasn t been a history of reformers taking power and becoming the same old same old johnson s america is a thousand times more libertarian and free than either trump or hillary s and that s really all i care about it also helps that johnson doesn t have compromising character flaws like compulsive liar hillary and deranged narcissist trump johnson s america is a thousand times more libertarian and free than either trump or hillary s and that s really all i care about interesting that this line of thinking has usually been disparaged on reason except that the multiplier is usually maybe two or three times not a thousand times if i thought that a gop candidate or even a democrat would make the u s 1000x more libertarian than the opponents would i would seriously think about voting for that candidate it would be a tough call because i also like to help build the libertarian party by increasing its vote count and the number of registered libertarian voters this year i can do that and support a candidate who has shown he can do the job if elected and who will work hard to make this country many times more libertarian than it is now not to mention many more times libertarian than any of his opponents would or could i have been voting lp since 1980 no candidate has agreed with me 100 no candidate has slavishly followed the party platform 100 this year s potus ticket is yet another mix of qualities but in the mix is more than enough genuine libertarianism to suit me and to qualify to be the standard bearer of the lp in 2016 if weld were the top of the ticket i might really have to hold my nose but as long as he is 2 and johnson can benefit from his experience fundraising skills and brilliance then what is not to like go team el pee go bake the cake schlomo yes the whole who cares if he s a sellout as long as we win attitude has never caused problems before well why don t we try it for once and see how it turns out just for a change agreed he ll also attract the trumpary haters with his milktoastiness he appears to be the antithesis of the nuttery that is trump and the cunt but he s not anything that could be called a libertarian johnson isn t going to win he is a guy who is supposed to be out there using this opportunity to sell libertarianism and get ideas out same goes for weld the current situation is one where even when johnson gives a coherent and genuinely libertarian idea weld is right behind him to say i wouldn t go that far as he proceeds to give the exact opposite position that is completely dependent upon government intervention if you think temporary poll bumps and fundraising are going to help libertarianism long term i think you are sorely mistaken i see a golden opportunity being squandered the lp will be lucky to ever get this much media attention in future cycles and they are spending it pushing a weird hodge podge of ideas that often contradict what other ticket has their vp openly and frequently disagree with the party at large as well as the candidate himself andrew jackson john c calhoun well in the olden days there was the idea of balancing the ticket this caused trouble when the president died e g john tyler and andrew johnson and fell out the way when fdr died and caused veep picks to be increasingly scrutinized and is pretty impossible now with the enormous media coverage oh and by the way the veep has a lot more power than he used to something johnson is not going to undo it seems which makes this more difficult and now that the veep picks are the convention doing the candidates bidding rather a free vote what other ticket has their vp openly and frequently disagree with the party at large as well as the candidate himself i find that refreshing anti team i just wish it was the nazi cakes he was disagreeing with really how much of that did weld do when he was a republican if he were offering more libertarian positions i d be more willing to tolerate it right now i see their are an awful lot of people willing to embrace what is quite clearly a butchering of the libertarian message when they are willing to continue to endorse said candidate and react prickly to criticisms of the ticket it definitely stinks of go team partisanship to me where we are going to disagree most strongly is on the good or harm this will do over time it is undeniable that johnson weld won t win but right now they have the microphone and if i was ignorant of libertarianism and listening i would have no more of a clue as to what the hell it is than i did before if i was ignorant of libertarianism and listening i would have no more of a clue as to what the hell it is than i did before if he gj can convince a fair portion of the population that libertarianism is being fiscally conservative and socially tolerant it will be a huge win i m a big believer in incrementalism ask the progs if it works people don t change overnight they certainly don t change when they think the idea is radical which is exactly their position on libertarianism baby steps to liberty gj is exactly what the dr ordered except gun control another kerner commission carbon taxes burqa ban and nazi cakes don t strike me as a very libertarian incrementalism those are examples of incrementally pushing the norm further to the progressive side the big problem with libertarian incrementalism is that your goal is to have politicians bureaucrats government contractors people on the dole etc lose power and funding something that they don t like while the fabians had the advantage of giving those groups what they wanted that is more money and power the big problem with libertarian incrementalism is that your goal is to have politicians bureaucrats government contractors people on the dole etc lose power and funding something that they don t like this is the biggest reason that i believe the only way to get to smaller government is through revolution whether violent or non violent i don t think it s possible to increase liberty iteratively it s waaaaaaay too tempting to abuse power i don t think it s possible to increase liberty iteratively i would very much like to try before going to the mattresses how many decades would you like to spend trying francisco nor tolerant you missed the part about how johnson seems to want to give weld quite a bit of power which will prevent johnson from doing the libertarianish things he advocates and not to mention i thought two faced politicians that we can t trust was something reason attacked a lot reason s gone full establishment rino gayjay and weld both say they re a couple of republican governors running on the lp ticket they re not libertarians they re not even stealth libertarians they re fucking no labels republicans who seized the only available minor party 50 state ballot line this race is similar to 1980 hillary is jimmy carter trump is reagan and gayjay thinks he s john anderson i predict he s going to underperform ed clark again you missed the part where johnson admitted that as president and vp they were obliged to work within the constraints established by the constitution that same constitution gives very limited authority and function to the vp even if johnson commissions his running mate with serious tasks and programs as clinton did his actual mate recall in the end congress will have to pass bills and president johnson will have to sign them not vice co president weld weld s power will amount to johnson s courtesy under those circumstances i think that if johnson wants to do any libertarianish thing weld will have only the power of persuasion to talk him out of it now granted weld is a slick talker and johnson is not but johnson isn t a fool if he really thinks that going in a particular libertarian ish direction is the right thing to do i don t think weld could talk him out of it much less thwart him via any constitutional powers or means having listened to johnson talk i remain completely unconvinced he s not a fool hitler the libertarian party is getting all of this attention precisely because the top ticket candidates have serious track records it isn t simply that this is the anti establishment year look at jill stein she is getting attention too but seemingly much less i think because she and her running mate are far less credible candidates for potus than johnson weld the media are intrigued that there are alternative candidates running this year who could actually win if people voted for them and actually do the job if they win now would people with serious track records put themselves on the line only to sell an ideology with no credible expectation of winning johnson has said over and over that they wouldn t be doing this unless they saw a chance to win outright maybe it s a long long shot but it appears that they see a good fight in it for themselves as well as some chance to win and make history either way i have been watching videos of the two interacting in town halls and at campaign events to me it seems clear that johnson is not weld s sock puppet i am encouraged that he won t have any problem leaving aside the more objectionably statist proposals and advice that weld might contribute then again johnson is far from being a doctrinaire libertarian but he certainly wants to take the nation much further down the libertarian road then even reagan ever promised much less delivered that s a good start we should all say a prayer asking that nothing bad happens to president johnson ok did someone hand out drugs why was i not told he was a good public servant but would you go so far as to say he was a wonderful public servant which of the other short bus members should they have nominated i m nominating gary busey for everything today so gary busey ship already sailed on that by about 41 years or 141 years actually come to think of it maybe one of the candidates should try to co opt the libertarian vote by making johnson his or her vp the transformation of an electable lp into gop lite is happening a lot quicker than i thought also i get the distinct feeling that johnson and especially weld would rather just ditch libertarianism and the turn the lp into some wishy washy centrist party this is of course what many on reason would normally hate but team no labels what is giving you that distinct feeling i have so far watched hours of campaign video from this year alone not to mention back in 2012 in which johnson is advocating individual choice in pretty much everything ubering everything clearing the way for people to pursue happiness as they please and downsizing not curtailing growth but actually shrinking government by at least 20 including an end to our foreign military intervention all of that sounds awfully libertarian to me sure there are some contradictions ideological gaps or warts but every candidate has shown us a different mixture of such flaws all the way back to 1972 what else is new the thing that encourages me about johnson is that he seems persuadable on the points where he and more purist libertarians differ i get the distinct feeling that he can be persuaded to lean more our way if not come the whole distance by the same token his understanding of practical governance may inspire and allow him to persuade the purists to give moderation a chance from time to time the goal is to keep pulling the country more in the libertarian direction i have been convinced since 2012 that johnson genuinely sincerely wants to do this his practical experience combined with a powerful mandate should he actually succeed in winning the white house encourage me that if we give him the chance he can and will make it happen the transformation of an electable lp into gop lite is happening a lot quicker than i thought that might be what happens but if we end up with a version of the libertarian party that is sort of centrist right libertarian that will still be a big improvement on the conventional gop let s face there s always going to be two parties the game is in how to manipulate the axes so that they line up more with libertarian authoritarian than conventional left right if one can move the gop in a libertarian direction or cause it to be replaced with a more libertarian party that s progress weld s strategy isn t to try to defend libertarian ideas instead he articulates the ones he thinks disaffected centrists want to hear and yet i m still expected by some left libertarians to hold my nose and pull the lever for this fuck by some left libertarians no such thing as right left libertarian there is libertarian and there is not libertarian sheldon richman has a sad using that standard weld is definitely in the not libertarian camp when johnson suggests abolishing the internal revenue service weld raises an eyebrow and clarifies that he wouldn t go that far when asked about gun control weld suggests the formation cue a million libertarians choking on their dinner of a massive new fbi task force i ask him at random about climate change he advocates pragmatic mainstream and essentially unlibertarian ideas about the urgent need for governing bodies to prevent the rise of global temperatures by 2 degrees celsius fucking brilliant all hills we re not supposed to die on i think something something fuck you and your fucking sky daddy bigot ideas he s gonna cut spending so you have to vote for him a slight dramatization of certain actual johnson weld supporters you don t have to vote for him jesus get over yourself your vote really isn t important since you re a member of the almost 1 that s already inclined to vote for an actual libertarian and not the other 99 that are perpetuating a broken system i m all for making libertarianism appealing to people who want social tolerance minus the socialist money grabbing and fiscal conservatism minus the militarism and racial resentment and since that s basically the point of johnson weld 2016 i m on board with it stfu and vote trump i considered it until i saw this http www express co uk news psychopath seems totally scientific at one point it was just a joke i was making about siv then he actually turned into a trump shill and became the joke the joke s on you cuck want social tolerance so gun control opposing freedom of religion and freedom of association you don t have to vote for him jesus get over yourself i wasn t really talking about you but that s a mighty defensive reaction your vote really isn t important since you re a member of the almost 1 that s already inclined to vote for an actual libertarian and not the other 99 that are perpetuating a broken system my vote is important to me alone thus why i m not interested in voting for somebody who embodies my ideals even less than a john mccain or a mitt romney my first and second presidential votes both of which i held my nose for however what i think is more important is voicing my displeasure to other libertarians about the lp going full team and nominating a pair of hybrid social justice moderate republican 90s rejects because they think that centrism is going to win this election i m not a huge ron paul fan but i d be dancing in the streets buck naked for his campaign before i lifted a finger for the johnson weld excuse of a ticket i m not interested in voting for somebody who embodies my ideals even less than a john mccain or a mitt romney that speaks volumes as to your ideals as gj is orders of magnitude more libertarian than either romney or mccain you sure you re not simply a contrarian no i m just being hyperbolic of course the johnson weld ticket has portions that are better than mccain or romney just not enough to be categorically differentiated from those tickets great we have another ticket that pays lip service to fiscal sanity i ll believe it when i see it just not enough to be categorically differentiated from those tickets simply not true read this gj is a moderate libertarian with one really bad unlibertarian position on public accommodation find me another credible politician that s only got one bad position albeit weld has many thankfully he s not running for president me thinks you set the bar too high for this stage in the game gj is a moderate libertarian with one really bad unlibertarian position on public accommodation so using govt as a means to try and engineer climate change solutions isn t un libertarian one of the proposals that i think is a very libertarian proposal and i m just open to this is taxing carbon emission that may have the result of being self regulating try and change the entire planet s temperature via top level govt meddling in economic behavior libertarian and how about the basic concept of self ownership is prostitution a victimless crime johnson responded that currently the victims are the prostitutes d oh et tu johnson and here i thought totally denying women s agency was the purview of democrats and republicans yet here was johnson buying into the idea that sex work is inherently exploitative and victimizing well its good to know that at least you re open minded about who qualifies as libertarian frank surely you ve never argued anyone else should be refused the label if they happened to disagree on a single issue ever first let me apologize for the snide tone it was uncalled for secondly as to this my vote is important to me alone thus why i m not interested in voting for somebody who embodies my ideals even less than a john mccain or a mitt romney my first and second presidential votes both of which i held my nose for i just really really don t get it how on earth does johnson fall short of mccain and romney on libertarian ideals he has a solid record of vetoing spending as governor and he vetoed every gun control law as governor as well he s for ending the drug war and he s not stroking a massive warboner over iran or shitting himself over terrorism i understand revulsion at weld but there simply are not many credible people that can run as libertarians i think people are failing to realize that one of the biggest reasons for the prominence of johnson and weld this year is because they can t be dismissed out of hand as unserious due to their records of accomplishment the lp would mired at 3 if they picked peterson or mcafee it was uncalled for no it was entirely called for no it was entirely called for fuck off and let the adults have a conversation unencumbered by your puerile bleatings i apologize in advance for my uncalled for tone fuck you you needle dicked turd gobbler no worries on the tone it gets contentious in here at times and i ve certainly been guilty of writing in a tone that i later regretted as i mentioned above i was being hyperbolic and didn t really mean that johnson weld is worse than mccain or romney i think it s more accurate to say that johnson weld feels like a very similar ticket to mccain palin or romney whoeverthefuckheranwith sure he may decriminalize pot on the national level but he has been less than doveish when talking of isis he s been rather wishy washy with his gun rhetoric which doesn t help the fact that his vp is a gun grabber and he s shit on some very basic core libertarian issues like freedom of association this whole fiscal conservative social liberal rhetoric has defined his campaign as a centrist one not as a liberty loving one i disagree on petersen only getting 3 he may not have been as polished and articulate as johnson or weld but liberty rolled off his tongue quite naturally i think there are a bunch of disaffected major party voters who would have a much easier time accepting petersen over johnson i was being hyperbolic and didn t really mean that johnson weld is worse than mccain or romney in the sense that mccain and romney were the establishment candidates of their moment and johnson weld are supposed to represent an anti establishment reform party yes johnson weld are worse in their given role because what good for libertarians do lp candidates serve by merely showing that demopublican lite can steal votes from demopublican douches instead of functioning as a threat which forces the mainstream to take libertarian ideas seriously the libertarians are moving towards the mainstream and suggesting go ahead and keep running on carbon taxes and gun control and shit like that our voters will totally compromise there was a brian d article a few days ago where he responded to criticisms about how johnson isn t doing fuck all for any of the core principles that any various liberty oriented constituents might care about and the retort was paraphrased ah but that s not important because see what s really important are what would happen if he were president and how he d govern on core issues like taxing and spending yeah as though his winning is a real concern here it pretends the game is something different than what it really is winning isn t what s going to happen what s going to happen is the lp is going to do better than normal the choice is really do you see more value in an lp canidate that gets 5 of the vote but shows that getting 5 requires completely selling out on every core principle or do you want to get 3 and show how those principles matter the counter argument to this and its a good one is that getting that 5 means the lp gets funds and more ballot access next time around which i m cool with if that s all this is about then i m down for it just don t try and tell me the shit sandwich is something its not what would happen if he were president i like how reason is adopting the whole assume this politician secretly agrees with you despite everything he says and can t do the things you don t like which always works and he s shit on some very basic core libertarian issues like freedom of association no not freedom of association a small subset of freedom of association called public accommodation law i liked petersen and mcafee both significantly more principled than gj but americans aren t ready for that yet let s get the ball rolling in the right direction before we start scaring the straights no not freedom of association a small subset of freedom of association called public accommodation law please show us some examples where johnson has expressed any strong convictions about the other parts of freedom of association you think are important since you re making that distinction he s for ending the drug war and he s not stroking a massive warboner over iran or shitting himself over terrorism johnson isn t for ending the drug war he s campaigning on continuing it gayjay supports what he calls humanitarian wars not in america s interest that s a samantha power madeline albright foreign policy trump consistently vocally opposed the war on all drugs for over 20 years up until he decided to seek the gop nomination hell the only consistent political positions trump has held for any length of time is legalize drugs and stay out of foreign wars don t blame me i voted mcafee barely legal belizean prostitute 2016 so far i ve collected a deez nuts 2016 and a we shall overcomb but have not warn it since oct of last year once it became clear he wasn t just a joke anymore but i havent found a mcafee t shirt with the appropriate visuals all hills we re not supposed to die on i think have you run this by noted self appointed lp mary ruwart hazelmeade apparently she is charge of all torquemadette purity tests for alleged racism nogoodthinkniks and all approved the hills have eyes we die on don t you mean michael hihn no i meant hazelmeade she s off her rocker quire frankly she s could find a racizm in a bowl of kasha with milk hinh is a deranged necrothread fucking lunatic claiming hihn spiracy and member of the peacock family whom nobody takes seriously yet keeps claiming to have lp ark of the covenant yanno the radio to talk to god cato you don t eat your kasha with kefir nasty stuff kefir you don t eat your kasha with kefir i tried it once and puked it back up 20 min later and was sick for the rest of the day never again for fun i engaged with hihn last week on a tax thread it was rather amusing watching him become more and more hysterical as i systematically dismantled his assertions in the end he resorted to throwing up a post like twelve hours later calling me an aggressor which apparently in his world is anyone who disagrees with him and makes him look like an idiot he also threatened to link to that thread for years to come i really hope he does because good lord does he look crazed every 6 months someone replaces his imagined h r aggressor it was me at one point like 2 years ago it was stupid fucking brilliant we are the weld chuck yeager is still awesome even though william weld doesn t endorse the blood libel i will still vote for him even though i love hillary and she can do no wrong in my eyes and i now shill for jill you might want to hold off on your endorsements until aipac s next conference toward the end of march a lot of black women go to college black women with degrees some of those girls are fine that s why i posted it i was pleasantly surprised i tip my hat to you sir is it safe to assume dominic mitchell is a dick referring to his comment not the content of the post so groovus what do you think of raimondo s thoughts on the ukraine aren t you still living there yeppers and about to go to bed too raimondo is overblowing it just a tad actually a lot in the midst of all the finger pointing it s hard to know who is telling the truth since both rus and ukr have everything to gain by blaming the incident on each other as far as ww3 no hardly it is true that poroshenko needs something of a diversion because ukr won t be admitted to the eu anytime soon and that is what he was banking on at the very least to shore up loans from the imf whilst waiting for eu membership and the primary drive behind maidan ukr is doing a remarkably job at keeping rus at bay but it s almost like masada in a sense with a resources directed at fighting off the east it s hard to grow the economy something poland and estonia in particular haven t had to deal with nearly as much belarus appears to be in appeasement mode at this point from what i can tell from an furriner s pov ukr simply can t be poland belarus or estonia by proxy of geography and history cost of living is still really low but then unemployment is high and the biggest stickler is the eu insistence ukr takes a shitload more rapefugees something the population doesn t want my wife and myself included and traditional areas of economic growth are stagnant medical has been an area of growth but it s been primarily private hospitals and polikliniki oh and shrill bot isn t as popular as he thinks troomp is regarded as a patsy and kloun whilst people have not forgotten obumbles and shrill bot s refusal to either donate aid and or sell lethal munitions during donbass so what sort of fiscal conservatism has weld been saying i know johnson has advocated axing the irs education hud and commerce which honestly i can get behind as a start though even getting rid of one will be very difficult it s rather irrelevant in the only even vaguely plausible scenario for johnson getting elected he wins a plurality in a state or a few and thus denies anyone an electoral college majority throwing the election into congress in such a case the house of representatives voting by state picks from the top three candidates getting electoral votes which could possibly compromise on johnson but the senate only chooses from the top two ev getters for vp so weld can become vp itself a pretty irrelevant job under most circumstances if and only if the libertarians manage to win more evs than one of the major parties so the big problem the lp has this year that let s say they make 20 of the vote and win at least one state how are they going to do in 2020 and 2024 history hasn t very good for third parties and will they have to be even more pragmatist then they are now alternate scenario jesse ventura leads a rag tag army of minnesotans to take over flint the federal government send in the troops but unbeknown to them the general in charge is a huge fan of professional wrestling he switches sides and helps jesse take over the entire state hillary personally leads the loyalists into battle and is killed by johnson who is weilding a giant battle axe while stoned out of his gourd by the rules of the necromongers you keep what you kill so johnson is now potus the only thing stopping this scenario from becoming reality is that flint is in michigan not minnesota pretty sure the 10th amendment covers interstate invasions forget it he s rolling that and no one would notice what happens to flint and if they instead did the usual 0 8 with no one caring there s no talk of letting lp candidates into debates etc what are they going to do in 2020 and 2024 keep being a radical fringe party so will chris christie michael pataki michael bloomberg lincoln chafee and paul lepage also get seats in a johnson cabinet so pan zangloba you want a canadian gary johnson so that means a red tory who is fiscally responsible which is a contradicition in terms so how about david crombie or john sewell the fuck no i want a libertarian party that hates sjws not one that placates them actually that might be an improvement over our current lot it was john titor i was arguing with and my stance was and is that lauren southern is better than gj hence in the cripple fight we re ahead of us lp on points oh sorry you guys all look alike that said who do you think could be the canadian gary johnson a fiscally conservative red tory is a contradiction in terms though go provincial drag out gordon campbell out of retirement and listen to the screeching of people who think he personally made millions starve to death and or turn to indentured servitude as premier of bc or ask patrick moore founder of greenpeace to run he s canadian and probably into pot as well i mean which politician up here isn t into pot ass sex and mexicans too bad rob ford and ralph klein are both dead i guess if you want to get into politics in canada having a personality is bad for your health i stated that i d prefer to have a shitty libertarian opinion to none at all that does not mean criticism of johnson is unwarranted unlike some people who post walls of impotent defeatist whining i don t think being the guy declaring his libertarian purity as the firing squad loads their rifles is a good future impotent defeatist whining you know who else wanted defeatists to shut the fuck up ot polling the collective wisdom of the commentariat is scent sensitivity legitamate or just an excuse by somone who don t like smells to control other people working in a facility this week that has signs posted not to wear any scented products funny deodorant wasn t specifically mentioned in the short list due to sensitive by someone s i think it s bs unless they re living like bubble boy i think it is legit usually tend to be females who suffer from it and i think alot of it is mental i would spend hours scouring the house and moving every chemical i could find out of the house when my wife complained my mom always smells things too people who smoke probably have lost much of their olfactory senses and since quitting my sense of smell seems keener it s not common but it is a legit hypersensitive response and there are legit cases demonstrably dx d usually it applies to perfumes colognes and that type of stuff the scent itself is primarily the problem the secondary is the chemical composition which depending on the substance can be quite toxic in a rare small group of people the link will give you the basics yes and no are some people more sensitive to scents allergic to perfumes yes are they so sensitive that they require a total eradication of perfumes from the workpace no i see it a lot like the whole peanuts thing the idea that a child is going to die because there are peanuts in the same room as them seems pretty damn far fetched however it s courteous to be a little cautious around the allergic kid so that they have a reduced chance of coming into contact with peanuts right which in a sane world inhabited by courteous adults would mean don t bathe in your cologne unfortunately some people just don t get it and think that the rest of us just love the overwhelming odor of pachouli that the uneducated seem to think is the best smell ever rather than a crime against humanity or just an excuse by somone who don t like smells to control other people may be some tiny portion of the population is legitimately impacted i suspect there was a much larger tolerance for other people s individuality in the past snowflakes have elevated annoyance into initiation of force so they can eliminate anything they don t like thank you everyone for the response especially learned dr groovus it s only one week and then i m gone so i ll just try to avoid whoever it is which of course isn t identified even though it would make life so much easier for everyone else as a kid i had it really bad regarding lit or unlit scented candles don t know why but if there were more than a few about i would start losing the ability to breathe and a throbbing headache i had it regarding incense being dragged to catholic mass was a problem at times trouble is truly unscented toiletries are hard to come by usually they have at least a masking fragrance try finding a cake of unperfumed soap some people think ivory soap s unperfumed but that s because it s their background or baseline so was ramon navarro the ultimate libertarian he was a gay mexican and he probably smoked pot at some point history hasn t been good for third parties except when they replace one of the other two there is no risk of johnson winning a vote for johnson is a signal to the losing party in 2016 that they might consider courting the libertarian vote if they want to win in 2020 that is all it is well ok it quite if the libertarian party can get enough support to participate in the debates that could be a huge win hillary had to pay lip service to many bernie positions in the course of winning the primary she might have even started believing some of them was ginger rogers the only libertarian woman raised by a single mom acted in scripts by dalton trumbo supported barry goldwater wore a monocle in 42nd street and did a few musicals so i m wondering how gary will perform in a debate without weld and what the chances the two will contradict each other a few times can we dig up weld s distant relative theodore the abolitionist and nominate him based on the portrait alone that s one dude you don t want to fuck with maybe these pictures are more flattering i don t think those pics are of the same person as hm s pic really meanwhile in australia a victorian mother is suing her doctor as well as the public health sector for the cost of raising a child following a botched abortion apparently the child ended up being born the compensation would also cover food clothing and schooling expenses for the child apparently you can t put your child up for adoption in australia a botched abortion usually refers to harm to the mother what kind of quack can t kill a helpless fetus the thing can t even run away from you since she seems to want to keep the kid i m kind of curious how she explains that yes mommy hired a guy to kill you but the didn t finish the job so mommy got some money by way of compensation that story is insanely shittily written so she went to her gp didn t think he did the job got ultrasound and yup 20 weeks pregnant victoria apparently allows abortion up to 24 weeks why the hell not go to a different doctor i mean sure you paid this guy and he dicked it up he should pay but if you re serious try getting it done before deadline what stopped her what did the doctor say why now two years after she gave birth journalism is hard but she must have a twitter at least http boston cbslocal com 201 e walpole joe from lowell is out doing his bit for the cause they are going to catch you one of these days you weird little bastard anyone hear of this carbon fee johnson was apparently talking about in interview sounds like a tax but i can t find a reputable source reporting

wasserman an l a sports executive wasserman s charitable foundation has given the clinton foundation between 5 million and 10 million in 2009 and 2010 his investment company paid bill clinton 3 13

aboussie wrote in june 2009 we need this meeting with secretary clinton who has been there now for nearly six months this is by the way my first request why exactly would a coal producer need to meet with the secretary of state is he having some trouble with exports to china sugar freed also i m sure jeff tucker has formed his libertarians for hillary group second try now that triggered my smell sensitivity holds nose and pulls lever extreme lincoln buffs to be married saturday in foyer of lincoln home would lincoln if he had a log racism on the rise across the world that could be the only explanation right the japanese were least likely to say there are too many immigrants in their country sure you are japan sure you are and what s your opinion on koreans again oh well they re dogs but dammit you got us well you are what you eat is an example of the kind of joke a racist would tell of course the japanese aren t open to mass immigration i ve met many that claim they would like to see more immigrants in japan of course they are talking to an immigrant but you can judge someone by what they do more than by what they say japanese govt officials will give lip service to the merkels of the world in order to not feel embarrassed at the next major international summit of course the japanese aren t open to mass immigration what island nation is ellis australia australia after wwii not only welcomed immigrants they paid them to come but the white australia policy effectively only allowed immigrants to australia from the uk and other european countries since the 1970s when the white australia policy was officially ended australia immigration points system allows educated and skilled workers based on a quota that determines what jobs need to be filled australia has replaced the a white australia policy that excluded non whites with a policy that excludes people with non white values iow while australians have no problem with people with a darker shade of skin they still want people who are just like them sealand lip service to the merkels now there s a horrible euphemism i spewed beer across the bar thank you i give and give racism on the rise across the world that could be the only explanation right american western european whites run the world qed so the libertarian party had a set of principles but they re too extreme so they trade them for another more popular set of principles and so on until they re as lucky as hans is the fable hans in the fable nothing like urine colored background for text good story though i have my principles and if you don t like them i have others groucho marx so let s be honest the problem with the lp is that they are going to be pragmatic enough to be electable without becoming totally unprincipled which will not be easy especially with guys like weld near the top and they will have to get libertarianish things done all the while without a huge blacklash which will be very difficult too i mean getting rid of education hud and commerce or a 20 spending cut will not be easy and there will be serious opposition to them reason spends endless amount of ink explaining how the two major parties and really the gop is dead and then turn around and shill for two washed up republicans if the two parties really are dying then the lp should be able to grow their own politicians shouldn t they i prefer to look at trump as doing this if the elephant were wounded then all hell might break lose as unpredictable at the best of times wounded elephants could literally go mad and cause tremendous damage to both sides if this happened the rider used a metal spike and hammer to pierce the elephant s brain and kill it immediately gary johnson is trying to be wac bennett or sidney johnston catts jay leno s garage is one of the best channels on youtube as evidence we get to see an absolutely gorgeous packard recreation if you like that petrolicious which i think was originally sponsored by hagerty s do short vids which are also quite nice less technical tho bad less jay gabbing good maybe when they did the american top gear it should have been leno tim allen and stolen sabine schmitz from germany it would have worked so well wow this erection came out of nowhere i didn t know jay leno turned you on also a lot of reasonoids have gotten really na ve about the tendencies of reformist parties to take power and become little more than the establishment they once attacked the lp will avoid this because libertarian moment no because a true libertarian won t seek office what s left is politicians claiming to be libertarians but since they re politicians well you know the rest no they ll avoid it because they already are the establishment they attack so on the issues listed in the article trump is more libertarian than weld here s a nutpunch given to a dude already rolling on the ground after taking a nutpunch from mother nature chris david manager of around the corner auto service said construction work on a nearby highway bypass left the closest storm drain cordoned off by a fence in the shop s backyard which when record breaking rains began to fall acted as a dam for debris leaving water nowhere to go but inside david and three employees have been working nonstop to clean the damage but he faces an arduous road ahead to reopen the shop s doors to customers as he told local cbs affiliate wsbt insurance is not going to cover it because they think it was the fault of the state not the fault of ours total estimated damage to the auto service store has already climbed to a whopping 120 000 should any reconstruction be necessary of course david would also be forced to obtain what amounts to the state s permission slip to repair damage the state haphazardly caused in the first place yeah that sounds about right they get you coming and going this is funny person a kountry bumpkin 3 days ago in accordance with agenda 21 if your house is in a floodplain i wouldn t expect to be getting a permit from the indiana department of natural resources truth is under agenda 21 they do everything in their ability to force people out of their homes person b mannie kountry bumpkin 3 days ago under the national flood insurance act construction including reconstruction within the 100 year floodplain requires additional permitting structures that are over 50 damaged cannot be rebuilt the stated objective of this is to discourage construction in the 100 year flood plain thus limiting the recurring costs of damage relief they re not trying to force people out of their homes they re just trying to ban them from rebuilding when they re damaged totally different i don t think people should build in flood areas or hurricane zones but if they pay the insurance i don t see why they can t govt seems to want to insert itself between the owners and the insurance cos let people collect but boot them out regardless haven t we heard the catastrophic insurance ain t goodinuff screeching before everyone thinks government is qualified to know what s better for you what hardly any of them realize is that the people actually then given the power to decide what s better for you are often the dumbest most awful people on earth and you lose your home business because some retarded municipal construction crew blocked a drain and no one will compromise because they don t have to fytw when you point to examples like this progs always handwave and go but those are the exceptions mistakes will sometimes get made in the net its for the greater good then you get things like the aca where its all mistakes top to bottom nothing about it provides any of the promised benefits in the net its one gigantic bottomless money suck that mostly hurts the people they think they were trying to help and they still refuse to look at it or acknowledge anything but the intentions exactly why i think public choice theory is such an important explanation of how govt actually works it doesn t really offer any solutions but effectively exposes the inherent failure existing in almost every govt program regulation etc are there any flood insurers besides the national flood insurance program the feds at this point patrick mcgoohan as danger man holy fuck this is awesome if you like hard boiled detectiving and you want an excellent example check this out mcgoohan is amazing as the lead the writing is top notch and the process they show him work through was fantastic and they did it all in 25 minutes of screen time thanks sounds up my alley i don t know the context behind this i think it s about her involvement in implementing welfare reform but this tweet by neera tanden is fucking gold it looks like she tried to exonerate herself by presenting an email in her notes app it was deleted as i read it scratch that your link still works if i clicked away from it on her feed it seemed to go away i don t twitter so i don t know how its supposed to work so basically she faked an email on the fly making a statement she wanted proof for it seems she then ginned up better subsequent fake messages to cover for the first entirely obvious fake message isn t that the sort of bald faced lie that gets people in charge in troub oh wait that s right people can lie all their want if they have the right connections all we re missing is white indian g night everyone it must be computer time at the mental hospital i see our resident necrofucker is coming out to shit all over the thread when johnson again gets around 1 i hope both he and weld have the decency to go away forever i ve made 64 000 so far this year working online and i m a full time student im using an online business opportunity i heard about and i ve made such great money it s really user friendly and i m just so happy that i found out about it heres what i do http usatodayjobs nypost55 com facebook gives you a great opportunity to earn 98652 at your home if you are some intelligent you makemany
