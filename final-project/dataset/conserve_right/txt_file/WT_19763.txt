apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap as the nation awaits the release of the special counsel s report thursday a new poll finds that many americans aren t ready to clear president donald trump in the russia investigation slightly more americans want congress to keep investigating than to set aside its probes after special counsel robert mueller left open the question of whether trump broke the law about 6 in 10 continue to believe the president obstructed justice the poll by the associated press norc center for public affairs research also finds greater gop confidence in the investigation after attorney general william barr in late march released his letter saying mueller found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but didn t make a judgment on the obstruction question top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties at the same time the poll indicates that americans are mostly unhappy with the amount of information that has been released so far they ll get more thursday when barr is expected to release a redacted version of the nearly 400 page report trump has repeatedly claimed total exoneration after barr asserted in his memo that there was insufficient evidence for an obstruction prosecution it s a total phony trump said of all allegations to minneapolis tv station kstp this week any aspect of that report i hope it does come out because there was no collusion whatsoever no collusion there was no obstruction because that was ruled by the attorney general overall 39 of americans approve of the job trump is doing as president roughly unchanged from mid march before mueller completed his two year investigation but many americans still have questions it s kind of hard to believe what the president says as far as exoneration said james brown 77 of philadelphia who doesn t affiliate with either party but says his political views lean conservative and in my mind the attorney general is a trump person so he s not going to do anything against trump the poll shows 35 of americans think that trump did something illegal related to russia largely unchanged since the earlier poll an additional 34 think he s done something unethical brown says he remains extremely concerned about possible inappropriate contacts between the trump campaign and russia citing trump s past interest in building a trump tower in moscow and believes the president committed crimes of obstruction to cover up financial interests he s not going to jeopardize his pocketbook for anything he said still the poll suggests barr s summary helped allay some lingering doubts within the gop among republicans more now say trump did nothing wrong at all 65 vs 55 a month ago and fewer say he did something unethical 27 down from 37 a month ago glen sebring 56 of chico california says he thinks the nation should put the russia investigations to rest after reading barr s four page summary of the mueller report the moderate republican credits trump with helping double the money he s now earning because of an improving economy and says congress should spend more time on issues such as lowering health care costs it s like beating a dead horse sebring said we ve got a lot more important things to worry about even as trump blasts the mueller probe as a democratic witch hunt poll respondents expressed more confidence that the investigation was impartial the growing confidence since march was driven by republicans three quarters now say they are at least moderately confident in the probe and 38 are very or extremely confident up from 46 and 18 respectively in march among democrats about 70 are at least moderately confident down slightly from a month ago and 45 are very or extremely confident still 61 of americans say they believe the justice department has shared too few details so far with the public and 55 think it has shared too few with congress about a third think the department has shared too little with the white house which has argued that portions of the report should be kept confidential if they involve private conversations of the president subject to executive privilege democrats have been calling for mueller himself to testify before congress and have expressed concern that barr will order unnecessary censoring of the report to protect trump the house judiciary committee led by rep jerrold nadler of new york is poised to try to compel barr to turn over an unredacted copy as well as the report s underlying investigative files the poll shows that even with the mueller probe complete 53 say congress should continue to investigate trump s ties with russia while 45 say congress should not a similar percentage 53 say congress should take steps to impeach trump if he is found to have obstructed justice even if he did not have inappropriate contacts with russia we don t even know what we found yet in the probe until we do congress should definitely continue to push this issue said tina perales a 35 year old small business owner in norton ohio who describes herself as republican that little letter barr sent out summarizing the report i think was completely bs this mueller thing is hundreds of pages and he just sums it up like this these things just don t add up deep partisan divisions remain democrats were much more likely than republicans to believe trump had done something improper and to support continued investigations that could lead to his removal from office house speaker nancy pelosi d calif has downplayed the likelihood of impeachment proceedings but isn t closing the door entirely if there are significant findings of trump misconduct on investigations 84 of democrats believe lawmakers shouldn t let up in scrutinizing trump s ties to russia but the same share of republicans disagrees similarly 83 of democrats say congress should take steps to impeach trump if he is found to have obstructed justice even if he did not have inappropriate contacts with russia while 82 of republicans say congress should not the ap norc poll of 1 108 adults was conducted april 11 14 using a sample drawn from norc s probability based amerispeak panel
