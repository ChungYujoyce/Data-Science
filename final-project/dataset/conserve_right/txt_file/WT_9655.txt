apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic chinese cyber spying chinese computer hackers some linked to the military engaged in an aggressive international campaign of electronic espionage through the internet from 2003 through at least 2009 according to documents obtained by inside the ring the electronic spying campaign targeted large amounts of data and information from u s government and private sector networks as well as from the french and german governments other states and international organizations top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey the documents labeled secret provide some of the first details to be made public on chinese cyberspying and reveal a u s government program to monitor and halt the activity that was code named byzantine hades a state department cable dated april 2 2009 states that byzantine hades activity appeared linked to the chinese military in chengdu the cable was a department diplomatic security bureau report that discussed the findings of canadian security researchers who dubbed the worldwide chinese intrusions ghostnet the researchers identified four internet domains that were involved in byzantine hades intrusion activity in 2006 the cable says subsequent analysis of registration information also leads to a tenuous connection between these hostile domains and the people s liberation army pla chengdu military region first technical reconnaissance bureau trb the disclosure is the first official u s government report linking global computer hacking to china s military according to the cable a chengdu hacker named chen xingpeng was linked to the pla technical reconnaissance bureau which also is called the military unit cover designator 78006 the cable says there was no official link between byzantine hades spying and the pla reconnaissance bureau but noted much of the intrusion activity traced to chengdu is similar in tactics techniques and procedures to bh activity attributed to other pla technical reconnaissance bureaus the link between mr chen and the chinese military further emphasizes the idea that this clandestine cyber spying network may in fact be a state sponsored intelligence gathering operation the cable says the documents were first disclosed by the reuters news agency further signs of china s byzantine hades activities surfaced in the past two weeks in a report by the mcafee computer security firm which dubbed unidentified computer intrusions in more than 71 networks shady rat the mcafee report did not name china in the computer attacks but other experts said all indications pointed to beijing s involvement and methods similar to those used in the government s byzantine hades intelligence a nov 5 2008 state department cable disclosing international talks in berlin on cyber espionage also provide new details of byzantine hades computer strikes byzantine hades is a cover term for a series of related computer network intrusions with a believed nexus to china that has affected u s and foreign governments as well as cleared defense contractors since at least 2003 the cable states german intelligence officials according to the cable said these efforts are conducted for the purpose of espionage and present a significant threat to german interests targets cover a broad range of german government activities including the military the economy science and technology commercial interests diplomatic efforts and research and development the cable says further quoting the officials as saying the espionage focused activity increases before negotiations between german and chinese officials state department diplomatic security officials said chinese electronic infiltrations generally are carried out through the use of socially engineered email messages crafted to appear authentic and specifically targeted to individuals of interest these messages normally contain an attachment or embedded link which is used to deliver malicious software malware onto the victim computer the cable said chinese spies often use software variants of older malware because they remain effective and are not generally detected by the majority of anti virus solutions currently used the cable says noting a clear increase in the scope and sophistication of these activities over time like the germans french intelligence also reported that they had observed nearly identical cyber espionage emanating from china that breached computers of high level french officials the french claimed to have been victims of specific technical monitoring facilitated through computer network operations the cable said the representatives indicated that believed chinese actors had gained access to the computers of several high level french officials activating microphones and web cameras for the purpose of eavesdropping the cable concludes its section on byzantine hades by noting that the problems appear global and had affected numerous nations in january then defense secretary robert m gates sought to engage china s military in talks on chinese cyber activities but was rebuffed china s government routinely denies it engages in any cyberspying or cyberwarfare activity a third cable from december 2008 also discusses likely chinese cyber attacks on computers at the international monetary fund and world bank in november 2008 it states that reports at the time indicated china was seeking sensitive information about the two financial institutions the december cable says byzantine hades a series of related computer network intrusions with a believed nexus to the prc has affected u s and foreign government systems as well as those systems belonging to international organizations such as human rights organizations a fourth cable from march 2009 says that a part of the chinese spying operation code named byzantine anchor had identified a key spy as chinese hacker yinan peng leader of a hacker group called javaphile that computer security experts say is suspected of carrying out the recent major hacking against google and other u s corporations according to the cable an email message originating from a known byzantine anchor ip address was sent to javaphile s leader the cable says the same ip has been identified in incidents affecting the pentagon and department of state byzantine anchor hackers since late 2003 have targeted and compromised u s government and cleared defense contractor computer networks in attempts to conduct computer network exploitation cne this cable says numerous sensitive reports have identified an apparent relationship between the chinese hacker group javaphile and byzantine anchor intrusion activity based on overlapping characteristics the cable says in addition to internet protocol addresses that linked byzantine anchor to javaphile both hacking activities employ an identical customized command and control tool called eracs it states according to the cable chinese hackers on july 30 2008 used a pirated computer inside the pentagon to download and install the eracs tool a week later state department networks also were compromised by attacks emanating from the same malicious ip address as the pentagon attack though the intelligence community has long suspected affiliation between the javaphile hacker organization and byzantine anchor the recent discovery of peng s receipt of correspondence from a known hostile ip presents a more significant basis for this hypothesis the fourth cable states letterman update david letterman on monday poked fun at the al qaeda terrorist who posted a death threat on a website calling for an assassin to cut out the comedian s tongue on cbs late night mr letterman cracked wise about the threat disclosed in this space
