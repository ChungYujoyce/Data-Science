tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion philadelphia and to think i was worried having lingered too long over a cheesesteak lunch i feared being late for former vice president joseph r biden s big kickoff rally here saturday forced to watch the event at the eakins oval from a mile or so away but despite showing up at about 12 58 p m two minutes before the festivities were set to begin i easily waltzed right up to the front of the thin crowd a mere 20 feet or so from the lectern from which mr biden would deliver his remarks a barack obama or donald trump rally this was not despite being held in the heart of a big democratic city on a picture perfect saturday afternoon the crowd could not have totaled more than a few thousand the organizers were obviously expecting the light loads as the bay of television cameras set up to capture the event was brought in close to the stage at least that way the small area in front of the stage looked full of biden fans to the tv viewers at home the organizers were less successful in their choice of the cascade of opening acts that took to the stage before the former vice president s arrival a pastor gave a benediction a young girl led the crowd in a rote pledge of allegiance a local singer tried gamely if not altogether successfully to hit the low notes on the star spangled banner sadder was the gospel choir that fell prey to incompetent technical organization while they were belting out a song some technical genius simultaneously played a different song over the loudspeakers to their credit the choir pretended not to notice except to sing a little louder top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the crowd was similarly wan attempts at starting a we want joe cheer petered out after no more than five chants a woman in front of me remarked that she came out of curiosity but was really interested in pete buttigieg the wunderkind mayor of south bend indiana another recounted how obama rallies felt like rock concerts this not so much mr biden himself tried to capture a little rock star energy though after being introduced by his wife jill biden the former vice president strode onto the stage to the predictable tones of born in the u s a sporting aviator shades and a suit jacket both of which he quickly dispatched with his 30 minute speech was disastrously delivered either the sound was too low or mr biden was nowhere near close enough to the microphone as he spoke so inaudible was the former vice president to the crowd assembled in front of him that at one point he was drowned out by a tiny cessna flying thousands of feet overhead cries of speak louder did little to change the situation what was audible was less than impressive mr biden stumbled over his teleprompter delivered words at one point suggesting that the constitution was ratified in 1887 he delivered policy free peans to unity punctuated with an overabundance of the word folks he also has an odd habit of every now and again stressing that he actually means what he just said really guys or i m not joking this has the odd implication that the vice president doesn t mean much of what he says it s like when a person prefaces a sentence to be honest by far the largest applause line that mr biden delivered was one stressing the need to defeat president trump and indeed this is the barely suppressed subtext of the former vice president s rationale for running it s not that he s the smartest or the most qualified or the most competent or the most charismatic it s that his fans have determined that his obvious struggles on the stump aside he is the most electable central to this contention is that mr biden connects with the white working class the blue collar voters who pulled the lever for mr obama twice and then switched to mr trump thereby flipping wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania and delivering the presidency to the new york real estate magnate the evidence for this is thin on the ground one awful showing in the iowa caucuses aside mr biden has run only in delaware which suggests if nothing else a connection with credit card and pharmaceutical company employees bob byrd a longtime delaware politico does point out that for many years the state hosted a large auto plant now shuttered he says that mr biden did indeed have a strong appeal to the workers there but that was decades ago and as professor paul brewer of the university of delaware says the political loyalties of the white working class have changed a lot since biden s last senate run which is to say they are now much more likely to vote republican and indeed in a weird way the strongest rationale for mr biden s electability that he served two terms as the vice president of the last democratic administration actually undermines it after all doesn t the victory of a liberal biracial law instructor undermine the notion that only old joe can win back joe
