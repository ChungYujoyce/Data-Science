that the army s new combat fitness test a planned successor to the service s earlier physical fitness test is producing large scale test failures by women soldiers former army officer david brown reported oct 5 that the leaked analysis of pass fail rates on the army combat fitness test shows it is catastrophically ill considered setting up the army s women to fail a total of 2001 men passed the test with 848 failing a pass rate of 70 but for women soldiers the pass fail statistics were stark out of 357 women who took the fitness test 300 failed a whopping 84 mr brown wrote that he supported the earlier fitness test that he believes produced troops who responded to it by working to become fit the old test also cost much less than the new test the army combat fitness test is an unbridled unparalleled unimaginable disaster he wrote according to mr brown soldiers who fail their physical training test are flagged blocking attendance at key military schools like the basic leader course or airborne school and if somehow you get there anyway when you re tested again you ll be turned around and sent home he said you cannot be promoted you cannot be reclassified into another military occupational specialty ultimately the test will eliminate women from the service he said mr brown told inside the ring said some negative responses to his column were mainly due to the army describing the test as a combat test this isn t some special test soldiers take before going to combat this is a regular physical fitness test that finance clerks and dental hygienists and supply people will take once or twice a year stateside he said given the 84 failure rate for women the army could lose 300 000 soldiers he added the test could be formally adopted in less than a year it is made up of six parts including a strength dead lift standing power throw hand release push ups sprint drag carry leg tuck and a two mile run in under 20 minutes the slide was published on clearancejobs com the u s army center for initial military training said in a statement the initial testing phase of the army combat fitness test sought to assess physical fitness from 63 battalions this was the first time a majority of the soldier s had experienced the age and gender neutral test which directly correlates to warrior tasks and battle drills the statement said the leaked chart was not an official document the statement said once soldiers have adapted to the new test we expect success and performance rates to be similar to the current army physical fitness test the statement
