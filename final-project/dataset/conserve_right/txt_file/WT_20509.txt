apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion flattery so the saying goes will get you everywhere this is wisdom usually employed by lovers but donald trump and kim jong un are trying to see whether it will work in statecraft the stakes like the risks are large mr kim sent a birthday greeting to the president and in return since he was in the neighborhood the president dropped in on mr kim and met him for a chat a chew and a handshake at the demilitarized zone separating the two koreas the president even accepted mr kim s invitation to take a few steps over the border to stand on north korean soil which was actually north korean concrete since everything at the dmz is paved this was spectacular television which mr trump once the host of a popular television show knows how to stage and it was spectacular statecraft about which the pudgy maximum leader once derided by the president as rocket man knows something too top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey two of a kind you might say if only for a day both men are driven by an enormous ego president trump is confident that his salesman s personality can make a friend of any skeptic critic or even enemy a lot of great triumphs have been based on relationships he said sunday there s no reason why mr kim shouldn t imagine that he too can charm anyone he is accustomed to nothing less than worship from his subjects and he has left a long trail of bodies of those who failed to properly observe the holy rites of worship one of those bodies was that of his half brother whether the bit of theater at the dmz as remarkable as it was will amount to anything but a photo op beyond the imagination of the president s public relations flacks is something else some of those closest to the president including the secretary of state and his senior national security adviser are said to be skeptical of the notion that personality can prevail over national interests mr trump has demonstrated that he will as he often boasts walk away from a bad deal as he did at his last meeting with mr kim at their summit in hanoi he may soon get another opportunity to do it again there is no sign that mr kim charmed by the president s razzle dazzle diplomacy or not will give up his nuclear weapons program for anything less than all he wants beginning with lifting the sanctions that have the north korean economy by the throat mr kim wants the sanctions lifted first and only then to talk about dismantling his nuclear weapons program it s important that neither men blinks first the only substantive result from the trump kim meeting on the border so far as we know is an agreement to resume the negotiations that were suspended in hanoi four months ago mr trump says he is in no hurry and that s a good thing because there may not be anyone for the americans to negotiate with at the moment translators and negotiators are scarce in pyongyang because mr kim killed some of them for displeasing him by their performance in hanoi merely by being there when he was humiliated by mr trump mere association with bad news is punishable in north korea by a hangman mr trump no doubt expects that some kind of spectacular triumph abroad would enhance his prospects for a second term and perhaps it would but he can expect no thanks from the democrats who are determined to use everything short of assassination to get rid of him we live in mean times the president s diplomacy was not nothing new north korean nuclear tests are probably suspended at least for now mr kim no doubt thinks he s got the president s number but he wouldn t take the risk of upsetting the detente if detente is what it is by exploding some of his test bombs until he sees what diplomacy can do in his stunning visit observe william tobey a professor at harvard who formerly served on the national security council and judith miller of the manhattan institute trump went out of his way to give the north korean tyrant what he craves trump calls his step across the line into north korea a special moment that attests to the great relationship the united states now has with the north but a birthday greeting and a walk of a few steps into the dark place do not make a great relationship what the president has forged and it s no small thing is an acquaintance of convenience with a brutal tyrant it can be a useful acquaintance as long as the president keeps in mind what it is not what he wants it to be wesley pruden is editor in chief emeritus of
