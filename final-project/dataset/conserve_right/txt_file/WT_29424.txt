that i can quickly sign the base package had totaled about 17 2 billion though the price tag ended up topping 19 billion after lawmakers agreed to add more money through the amendment process but the package had been opposed by mr trump who complained about the amount of aid that has gone to puerto rico to recover from hurricanes in 2017 and said the democrats bill hurts farmers states and border security we want to do much better than this all sides keep working and send a good bill for immediate signing the president tweeted on thursday senate leaders have been trading offers but they have reached no major breakthroughs in the past month in early april senators had filibustered both a gop written bill and an earlier version that had cleared the democrat led house unfortunately taking up a disaster bill for the second time without addressing the administration s concerns will not increase its chance of becoming law said rep kay granger the top republican on the house appropriations

three legged stool when discussing disaster aid meaning he wants to put together legislation that can garner support from the house the senate and the white house senate majority leader mitch

additional 50 billion in estimated future costs over the life of the disaster sen patrick j leahy the top democrat on the senate appropriations committee said in response that the president is holding disaster aid to other americans hostage because of a petty political grudge with residents of puerto rico instead of rallies and false inflammatory rhetoric the president should work with democrats to help rebuild our stricken communities said mr leahy vermont democrat though puerto rico has received much of the attention in the debate other issues also are in play mr shelby recently has been advocating for language that would help unlock money from a harbor maintenance trust fund a move that the white house has resisted about 9 billion is in the fund which gets its revenue through a user fee on importers at u s ports republicans unsuccessfully pushed this week to amend the package to add the 4 5 billion in emergency money the white house requested last week to address the influx of
