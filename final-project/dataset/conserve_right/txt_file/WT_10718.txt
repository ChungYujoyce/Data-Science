their northeast salem home we treated him like he was our own not a guest not a visitor don said he became our son one of the hardest things was to see him go at the end of the year no matter how long students stay whether it s for two weeks or up to two years the philipps can t help but get attached the walls of their house like those of many families are plastered with photos of their children

short term english and homestay program facilitated by cultural gateways and held on the willamette campus they spent mornings attending class afternoons enjoying group outings to places like the state capitol and the oregon coast and evenings with host families don and christina took kana and yui roller skating at oaks park in portland but just as exciting to the 15 year old girls was a trip to winco foods in salem kana s mouth dropped open when she saw the bountiful layout of the store and the two girls snapped photos as if they were visiting a historic landmark don explained that they don t have large grocery stores like that in japan the philipps introduced them to salads and roast beef and the girls had tacos for the first time kana s favorite food during her stay was hamburgers
