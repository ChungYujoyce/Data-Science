pressure on china to end their harmful trade and investment practices the president earlier ordered 25 percent tariffs on 50 billion in chinese goods as punishment for beijing s forced transfer of u s technology on companies doing business in china and for intellectual property theft china responded with the threat of a penalty of the same size on u s exports prompting mr trump to order u s trade representative robert lighthizer to target another 200 billion in chinese goods for 10 percent tariffs the president said the penalties will go into effect if china refuses to change its practices and proceeds with its plans for retaliatory tariffs combined the potential tariffs on beijing could reach 450 billion an amount equal to 89 percent of chinese goods imported to the u s last year neither side has yet imposed tariffs on the other in their growing dispute over technology and the u s trade gap the first round is to take effect on july 6 but the rhetoric is intensifying after several rounds of high level trade talks that white house economic adviser peter navarro said yielded no progress none of these efforts by the president and his team have resulted in any progress on the two core issues facing the u s china relationship mr navarro told reporters citing the trade imbalance and china s campaign to acquire u s technology by any means necessary the actions president trump has taken are purely defensive in nature he said asserting that china does have much more to lose because it sells so much more to the u s than it buys despite investors jitters over the rising trade rhetoric mr navarro said the president s action will be ultimately bullish for corporate america and u s workers i understand that there s going to be concern about what the impact might be both on the financial markets and on the global economy he said this trade dispute will lead to relatively small effects in two economies that collectively add up to about 30 trillion in annual gdp our view is that these actions are necessary to defend this country this is a trade dispute nothing more nothing less mr navarro said china is seeking by 2025 to control 70 percent of u s industries such as aerospace agricultural machinery artificial intelligence biotech business application software electronics new generation it precision farming robotics and satellite communications china cannot have 70 percent of production of these industries by 2025 he said dan boylan contributed to this article which is based in
