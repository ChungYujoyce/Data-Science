to send him to the u s to study law a goal of his at new york university thousands of thoughts are surging to my mind chen said before he left china his concerns he said included whether authorities would retaliate for his negotiated departure by punishing his relatives left behind it also was unclear whether the government will allow him to return chen s expected attendance at new york

disabled and for farmers rights and fighting against forced abortions in his rural community that angered local officials who seemed to wage a personal vendetta against him convicting him in 2006 on
