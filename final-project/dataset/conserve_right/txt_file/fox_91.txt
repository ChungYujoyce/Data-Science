member defense team includes some famous faces among them former independent counsel ken starr and former harvard law professor alan dershowitz although dershowitz insists he aposll play a limited role house democrats have selected seven members led by house intelligence chair adam schiff to be impeachment managers on saturday democrats sent the senate a 111 page brief calling the evidence of

let history weigh on every one of our shoulders meredith for democrats to get their way they aposll need to convince at least four republican senators and all of their caucus to stand firm to force

wallace mark meredith reporting from mar a lago mark thank you joining us now from south carolina senator lindsey graham one of president trump aposs closest allies and the chair of the senate judiciary committee senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen lindsey graham r sc chairman judiciary committee thank you wallace the democratic house managers the prosecutors filed their trial brief last night and they said that the president is trying to put himself above the law here is their key quote that is what president trump has attempted to do and why president trump aposs conduct is the framers apos worst nightmare your response sir graham well as to obstruction of justice the president tried to exercise executive privilege he said to the house who was trying to impeach him in 48 days from the time they authorized impeachment until they voted on the articles was 48 days it aposs the first impeachment in modern history without outside counsel it was a partisan railroad job and one of the reasons he aposs being impeached is that they had to do it in such a hurry he could not exercise executive privilege and i have got a quote from senator schumer i won apost read today but i aposll let it out tomorrow saying that any president has the right to defend the office and article ii obstruction of congress is about the president saying i want to go to court and exercise executive privilege over documents and witnesses instead of allowing him to do that they impeached him for obstructing congress they tried to put trump below the law abuse of power is so poorly defined here i don apost know how presidents in the future can conform their conduct it aposs the first impeachment in history where there aposs no allegation of a crime by the president wallace you have been very clear over the last few months where you stand on this case here are a few graham right wallace of your clips begin video clip graham this is un american at its core what the house of representatives is doing is a process of political revenge i think this is a bunch of b s this thing will come to the senate and it will die quickly and i will do everything i can to make it die quickly end video clip wallace all right let aposs talk about that die quickly first of all counting votes have you given up on the idea that the senate republican majority is going to vote to dismiss this case right away on tuesday is that dead for practical purposes graham yes that aposs dead for practical purposes there are a lot of senators who i think will wind up acquitting the president but believe that we need to hear the house aposs case the president aposs case answer to the house aposs case and ask questions and then that aposs when the witness requests will be so the idea of dismissing the case early on is not going to happen we don apost have the votes for that so we aposll play it out along the clinton model wallace all right you say then the next big issue you say there is no need to hear from witnesses in this trial but sir that directly contradicts what you said as a republican house impeachment manager in 1999 during the clinton impeachment trial let me put up a quote from then you said there may be some conflict that has to be resolved by presenting live witnesses that aposs what happens every day in court and i think the senate can stand that question why were witnesses ok then but they aposre over the line now graham well the people being asked for by senator schumer are the secretary of state the chief staff to the president of the united states the national security adviser to the president of the united states and the acting omb director all of these witnesses were available to the house the president said he would claim executive privilege here aposs what has happened in the house they did this in 48 days they never allowed the president to exercise executive privilege and when he suggested he might they impeached him for obstructing congress now i aposd like you to ask mr jeffries the following what are we supposed to do in the senate regarding executive privilege if it aposs going to be invoked who determines whether or not the privilege applies clearly to me any president would ask for executive privilege regarding these witnesses and if they were that important why didn apost you call them in the house do you need them to make your case the people called by the senate were blumenthal vernon jordan and monica lewinsky blumenthal asserted executive privilege but that was litigated in the house and the court ruled against blumenthal what they aposre doing here is they aposve got a railroad job in the house and they aposre trying to fix it in the senate and i aposm not going to be part of that wallace ok let me ask you about this question of executive privilege because you aposre quite right president trump has said if the senate tries to call chief of staff mulvaney or former national security adviser john bolton that he will assert executive privilege and you aposve indicated you aposll support him take a look begin video clip graham i aposm not going to defy executive privilege the president said he would invoke executive privilege i hope no republican will destroy execute privilege end video clip graham but in the 1974 case of the united states v nixon during the height of watergate the supreme court ruled unanimously on the nixon tapes and here was the key quote from the court the generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial so isn apost the precedent the legal precedent about executive privilege is that it must yield to the need of evidence and there is evidence that john bolton for instance could give that it was impossible to get any other way isn apost the precedent clear that he cannot invoke executive privilege to prevent john bolton from testifying graham no he can invoke executive privilege there aposs a supreme court case that says when you deal with national security issues the privilege of the president is at its highest the president has never had a chance to invoke executive privilege regarding john bolton or anybody else they aposre asking the senate now to destroy that privilege you have a supreme court case on executive privilege because it went to court and here aposs what schumer said in 1998 to suggest that any subject of investigation much less the president with obligations to the institution of the presidency is abusing power and interfering with an investigation by making legitimate legal claims using due process and asserting constitutional rights is beyond serious consideration they aposve literally impeached president trump because he wanted to exercise executive privilege they said no that is obstructing congress this privilege attaching to bolton has never been to court and at a minimum it should go to court wallace well i guess i just i don apost want to get too much into the weeds here and litigate this but there aposs two points one in the nixon tapes case in 1974 the court said the assertion of executive privilege must yield to evidence in a criminal case and the president is being tried in a criminal case and in an graham this is not a wallace let me graham there aposs no crime inaudible wallace well he aposs being tried for high crimes and misdemeanors you can argue that it doesn apost rise to that but that aposs what the trial is all about and secondly the supreme court has also ruled that when it comes to deciding whether or not executive privilege it doesn apost it aposs not going to go to the court because there was a case involving a judge named judge walter nixon in which the court basically said you know what we aposre not going to weigh in when the senate is involved in an impeachment trial their word stands graham so the point you aposre trying to make here is that we aposve got a supreme court case that was litigated after nixon invoked executive privilege the president has never been able to go to court because they wouldn apost let him i aposm not going to legitimatize a house impeachment process that calls the secretary of state the chief of staff and the national security adviser of any president and deny them their day in court to protect those essential national security advisers come to the senate and destroy the privilege because it could never be used in the house the bottom line here is if these people were that important to the case they should have called them in the house executive privilege was raised by clinton he went to court and he lost you aposre trying to get the senate to legitimatize what i think is a political railroad job i aposm going to vote to honor the privilege and if the privilege is to be decided by the united states senate i hope we will all honor the privilege because here aposs the way to destroy it you impeach a president you don apost let him to exert executive privilege in the house you deny him or her their day in court you come to the senate and you strip it away you aposve destroyed executive privilege through the impeachment process that would really make the presidency far less effective and would hurt the constitutional balance of power that aposs exactly what they aposre trying to get us to do listen to schumer in apos98 if you don apost believe me wallace let aposs get out of law and let aposs get back to politics graham ok wallace because more and more of your republican colleagues are saying not committing to it we aposve put five up here on the screen that they aposre at least open to the possibility of witnesses now the democrats if they hold firm would need only four gop senators to come over to their side so they would be able to call witnesses your best guess as a vote counter will the senate end up calling witnesses graham if we call one witness we aposre going to call all the witnesses there aposs not going to be a process where the democrats get their witnesses and the president gets shut out here aposs what i aposm going to do i aposm going to be consistent i aposm going to vote against calling the four witnesses requested by senator schumer they aposre all covered by executive privilege they aposre part of the national security team of the president they could have been called in the house they chose not to apparently they don apost need them to make their case hunter biden and joe biden and the whistle blower we can look at those allegations of misconduct outside of impeachment i want this trial to get over with as quick as possible i want the people of the united states to pick the next president not a court of impeachment and i aposd like to be spending my time working on prescription drugs and national security issues instead of this wallace ok i aposve got two more graham now let me just say one thing ok i aposm sorry i aposm sorry go ahead wallace i aposve just got two more quick questions to ask you and we aposll try to get through this as quickly as possible you talk about wanting to get through this the trial as quickly as possible there are reports that republican senate leader mcconnell is going to put out a rule on tuesday that for the opening arguments 24 hours for each side he aposs prepared to put the senate in session 12 hours a day so basically the house prosecutors would get two 12 hour days and the defense would get two 12 hour days to make their opening arguments one is that true and two if it is how do you respond to the democratic impeachment managers who say this is just a rush to get this over with graham well to my friends on the democratic side you know i like nancy pelosi i have known her for years and i think she is a very religious person but when it comes to donald trump nancy pelosi may pray for him privately but she has orchestrated the church of holy hell from the time trump has been sworn in to now it has been one thing after another here aposs what i would say to the house folks you took 48 days to impeach this president you did not allow him to call any witnesses he could not have a lawyer present during the house intel committee this has been a partisan railroad job and you aposre asking for fairness in the senate you violated every norm of what we do it took five years for starr to look at clinton mueller looked at trump for almost two years and you took 48 days so here aposs what i would say the sooner this is over the better for the country we can get back to do the business of the american people and do things that really matter to them i have been very consistent i supported mueller i trusted him to be fair this has been a political hit job this is political revenge and what they aposre doing to the presidency is a danger to the institution itself wallace and finally in 30 seconds i think it aposs fair to say that you are the senator who is personally closest to president trump and at various points you aposve said he aposs mad as hell he aposs demanding his day in court i assume you aposve spoken to him recently what aposs his mood how does he feel about the fact that he aposs about to undergo a trial for removal in the senate and what does he want from the senate graham i think he wants to have a chance to have his day in court that he didn apost get in the house it would be nice to have a lawyer present it would be nice to request witnesses i guarantee you he aposll get a better deal in the senate than in the house but his mood is to go to the state of the union with this behind him and talk about what he wants to do for the next rest of 2020 and what he wants to do for the next four years he is very much comfortable with the idea this is going to turn out well for him he believes politically this has helped him he thinks it aposs a threat to the presidency the one thing he talks to me constantly about is what does the next president do after this if this is successful he does not want to legitimatize attack on the presidency and that aposs my number one goal is to do this trial in a fashion that no house republican or democrat ever again will do again what this house did wallace senator graham thank you thanks for joining us always good to talk with you graham thank you wallace up next speaker pelosi chose the impeachment managers who will prosecute the democrats case against president trump congressman hakeem jeffries the highest ranking leader on the team joins us next commercial break wallace speaker nancy pelosi has named seven democratic lawmakers to serve as impeachment managers or prosecutors trying to convince the senate to convict president trump joining us now from new york a member of that team congressman hakeem jeffries and welcome back to fox news sunday rep hakeem jeffries d ny impeachment manager good morning chris wallace the white house defense team last night sent out their responses to the articles of impeachment calling impeachment a dangerous attack on the right of the american people to freely choose their president this is a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election now just months away they say democrats have been trying to impeach and remove this president since the day he took office jeffries our case is simple the facts are uncontested and the evidence is overwhelming donald trump pressured a foreign government to target an american citizen for political and personal gain and withheld 391 million in military aid from a vulnerable ukraine without justification as part of his effort to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election that is a corrupt abuse of power and that is precisely why we are here right now getting ready to proceed with a senate trial wallace let aposs talk about the trial as we talk and we aposre now just a little over 48 hours from when the trial will actually start with motions on tuesday do you the senate impeachment managers do you know what the rules of this trial are going to be that you aposre going to have to operate under and secondly what about this talk that senator mcconnell is going to put out a rule that you have two days 24 hours basically two 12 hour sessions to deliver your opening arguments do you have any problem with that jeffries well we do not know what the rules are going to be at this moment we certainly look forward to being able to review the resolution the most important thing is that the american people deserve a fair trial the constitution deserves a fair trial our democracy deserves a fair trial and we believe that a fair trial involves witnesses it involves evidence it involves documents we intend to present that to the american people we aposre going to proceed in a serious solemn and sober fashion as we aposve done in the house now as we transition to the senate we need to just follow the facts apply the law be guided by the constitution present the truth to the american people as it relates to the solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 election the senators are going to have to decide the american people are going to have to decide is that the right thing for a president to do should we protect the corruption of our democracy wallace ok but to answer my specific question there is talk and it appears that it aposs informed talk that mcconnell is going to say you have got two days you have 24 hours but you have got two days and we aposll keep the senate in session from 1 00 in the afternoon to 1 00 in the morning are you ok with that jeffries well again i don apost want to speculate as it relates to what the resolution may look like because senator mcconnell hasn apost presented that resolution and ultimately the decision will be made by the 100 senators all of whom have sworn an oath to be impartial we certainly hope that they conduct themselves in that fashion we have a very strong case to present there were 17 different witnesses who testified in the house proceeding 12 of whom testified publicly many of them were trump appointees individuals like ambassador sondland who gave a million dollars of course to trump aposs inauguration who testified under oath that this was a quid pro quo wallace but here aposs what i think a lot of people find curious that your team in your opening arguments is basically going to be making two arguments that are completely contradictory one you have an overwhelming case the case that you have built is sufficient that the president should be removed from office but two we need to call more witnesses don apost those contradict each other jeffries they don apost there aposs a strong case that was developed in the house but as was the situation in the clinton impeachment and senator graham just acknowledged there were three additional witnesses including monica lewinsky who was at the center of the impeachment in 1998 who did not testify before the house proceedings but was called to be present as it relates to what took place in the senate and if senator mcconnell is saying that we aposre going to follow the clinton model then let aposs just follow the clinton model wallace what about the argument that we heard from senator graham in the previous segment why should the senate take the time and go to the trouble to litigate whether or not they can hear from witnesses like former national security adviser john bolton when the house could have done it and you decided that you were in too much of a rush to do that jeffries well we proceeded expeditiously because trump aposs abuse of power his pressuring of a foreign government in this instance for his own personal and political gain related to an urgent matter of national security you know the notion of withholding 391 million that was allocated in a bipartisan basis wallace well but wait you can apost have it but again you can apost have it both ways congressman you say it was an urgent matter it was a threat and then nancy pelosi waited a month to even hand over the articles of impeachment jeffries yes i aposm glad you raised that because there aposs two parts to this process there is the impeachment process and then of course there aposs the removal trial that takes place in the senate and speaker pelosi aposs decision which was the right one to temporarily for a short period of time hold those articles of impeachment have created the space for us to have a discussion about a fair trial and in that space what we aposve seen is john bolton has come forward to say he aposs willing to testify before the senate lev parnas has come forward to say he is willing to testify before the senate we aposve acquired additional information in terms of correspondence between the office of management and budget and the department of defense which says that the president was the one who directed the aid be withheld from ukraine we aposve had five republican senators say that a fair trial should involve hearing from witnesses and we aposve also seen that the non partisan government accountability office has concluded that the white house broke the law that aposs additional information that i would think senators who believe in a fair trial would want to hear wallace you heard lindsey graham before say look he doesn apost want witnesses but he says if we aposre going to have witnesses and a number of other republicans are saying this there should be reciprocity if democrats get to call witnesses then republicans get to call witnesses if you want and i assume he aposs your top witness former national security adviser john bolton if you want to call john bolton and the republicans say well then we aposre going to call hunter biden are you willing to pay that price jeffries well ultimately this is a decision that the 100 senators will make perhaps with some involvement from chief justice john roberts who is proceeding over the trial what i will wallace would that be would that be a fair trade for you jeffries well what i will say chris is that the standard that should apply is relevance as it relates to the central allegation in this case of the president pressuring the ukrainian government for his own personal and political gain what i would think is relevant is the fact that in 2017 the trump administration allocated 150 million in military aid to ukraine and allegedly there were no concerns with corruption in ukraine in 2018 the same trump administration allocated 200 million in military aid to ukraine it was never held up there were never any congressional hearings about alleged corruption in ukraine under republican control the president had two different calls with the ukrainian president in april on the 21st and on july 25th wallace well i mean i suppose his argument would be that aposs when he became i assume his argument would be that aposs when he became aware of it jeffries well the key question is what was the intervening event because the president had two calls of course he never mentioned the word corruption in may of 2019 the department of defense trump aposs department of defense indicated in a letter to congress that all necessary preconditions for the receipt of the aid had been met including the implementation of anti corruption reforms by the ukrainian government it seems that the intervening event may have been the announcement by joe biden that he was running for president wallace ok one final question and that is house speaker pelosi who has been saying for weeks that she takes no joy in the impeachment of donald trump she used the words that you have used solemn sober serious here she is begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d ca house speaker this is a very serious matter and we take to it heart in a really solemn way end video clip wallace which is why even some democrats were surprised to see the ceremony where she signed the articles of impeachment handing out pens like it was a celebratory bill signing and as we can see from these pictures here all the participants look pretty happy doesn apost that blow a hole in your narrative that the democrats aren apost enjoying the impeachment and the effort to remove this president rep hakeem jeffries d ny i was at that ceremony and there was no joy in that ceremony wallace well there we we just saw the we just saw the pictures congressman jeffries there was no joy in that ceremony and from the very beginning through the end speaker pelosi has been clear that we are going to proceed in a very serious and solemn and sober fashion we don apost dislike this president we work with this president on criminal justice reform i did personally on the first step act we worked with this president to pass the u s mexico canada trade agreement we worked with this president to fully fund the government we don apost dislike wallace but you aposve also been talking about impeaching a lot of your remembers since he took the oath of office jeffries we don apost dislike donald trump but we do love america we do love democracy we do love the constitution and in america no one is above the law not even the president of the united states george washington in his farewell address said the constitution is sacredly obligatory upon all wallace right jeffries that means everyone wallace congressman jeffries thank you thanks for your time today and we aposll of course be following the action on the senate floor this week which could go well into the evenings thank you sir jeffries thank you chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the case against president trump with key details about the impeachment trial still not clear plus what would you like to ask the panel about whether the senate should call witnesses for the trial just go to facebook or twitter at fox news sunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up the impeachment trial pulls some democratic presidential candidates off the campaign trail begin video clip sen bernie sanders i vt presidential candidate i would rather be in iowa today there aposs a caucus there in two and a half weeks sen amy klobuchar d mn presidential candidate i aposve just got to get back here i aposm a mom i can do two things at once end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel where the race stands coming up commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states a lot of presidents some good some not so good but you got a good one now even though they aposre trying to impeach the son of a b can you believe that end video clip wallace well president trump weighing in on impeachment even as he welcomed the national champion lsu tigers to the white house on friday and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove charles lane of the washington post jonathan swan from axios and pollster kristen soltis anderson also a fox news contributor jonathan let aposs start with the white house defense team and let aposs put it up on the screen because it aposs a really good cable news panel with people like ken starr and alan dershowitz but more a panel it seems to me than a cohesive team of lawyers how comfortable do you think white house counsel pat cipollone is with having to try to run this operation jonathan swan national political reporter axios i don apost want to speak for pat cipollone i know that he aposs leading this he aposs very much in charge him and jay sekulow the key lawyers here and they have a very good relationship with jane raskin she was on the on the robert mueller defense team there are a number of people inside the white house at a very senior level who did not want the president to have alan dershowitz on his team that was an issue of great consternation particularly given the recent reports about his very close ties to jeffrey epstein they did not want that association so that was probably the most controversial part of it but i actually don apost think that this has been a huge issue having these additional people the president wanted it and he sees it as a television trial wallace the big question after opening arguments will be whether or not the senate actually calls live witnesses to testify here are the two senate leaders on that subject begin video clip sen mitch mcconnell r ky well i think we aposll be dealing with the witness issue at the appropriate time into the trial sen chuck schumer d ny the senate must conduct a fair trial a fair trial has witnesses a fair trial has relevant documents as a part of the record end video clip wallace karl what aposs your vote count what aposs your sense will the 47 democrats and independents stand firm united and will at least four republicans jump ship join with them to call witnesses and if they do which witnesses karl rove fox news contributor yes i think the 47 democrats will hang tight in this in large part because a couple of them are likely to flake on the ultimate question of should the president be removed from office there are more there are it aposs much more likely that we will have more democrats voting to retain the president in office than republicans voting for removal ph wallace and what about the republicans rove i this this all depends upon how these first several days play out you have five members of the senate i think three in particular alexander collins and murkowski who are inclined to have witnesses two others who say they aposre open to it but i think it all depends on how what aposs the sense of the end of 48 hours of the presentation of the two cases do they need to hear from more but think about this the democrats are basically saying we did not prove our case in the house and in order to prove the case in the senate we aposve got to have these witnesses and i think that speaks to the underlying flaw in in this whole whole approach wallace well you aposve actually brought us to the next subject because we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of whether or not the senate should call witnesses we got this on twitter from gloria perry quote why should the senate be doing the job of the house the jury hears the evidence and decides on its validity let aposs present it the house should have collected all the evidence already chuck how do you answer gloria charles lane fox news contributor well it aposs not unheard of in an ordinary criminal trial for after the indictment for additional evidence and new witnesses and documents to come up in the actual trial in chief but i think this whole business is underlying it is all politics and the democrats i think for political reasons did not want to spend a year litigating the president aposs claim of executive privilege they wanted to get this thing into the senate and now i think they have a very plausible and for many people politically popular argument there ought to be witnesses i think even a lot of republicans in polls say we aposd like there to be witnesses of course i think the witnesses the republicans want are people like the whistleblower and hunter biden and it could be a big can of worms what this is about is putting those moderate middle of the road senators karl was referring to on the spot particularly susan collins and corey gardner and martha mcsally for wallace people who are up for election lane re election and by the way they spent this weekend in florida at a fundraiser spearheaded by rick scott putting those people on the spot wallace kristen let aposs let aposs talk some politics assuming the president is not removed from office and i think that aposs still the overwhelming assumption he aposll be running for re election as he is already in 2020 first of all do you think impeachment will be a big issue given the way we consume news these days or do you think it will be largely forgotten by next november and secondly to the degree that it is an issue and obviously we don apost know how the trial aposs going to play out who does it help the republicans or the democrats kristen soltis anderson fox news contributor so barring something a blockbuster change that happens over the course of the next week or so or a decision to call witnesses that bring some kind of blockbuster testimony there i don apost expect this to affect the president aposs re election chances in any marked way his job approval has stayed extremely steady throughout this entire process even as a majority of americans in fox news apos own polling say that they would like to see the president impeached the trial thus far or pardon me the hearings in the house did not move the president aposs numbers i don apost expect this to take the place of key issues like health care and immigration that are going to be much more top of mind to voters when they cast ballots in november swan i aposll just put one asterisks next to this impeachment has been great for business on the trump campaign wallace they aposve raised a lot of money swan oh have they ever have they ever and to the extent to which this has grown their fundraising base and actually really engaged the republican donors but also the grass roots they aposve collected data they aposve already got a formidable data machine text messages facebook i mean it aposs been significant wallace and and really swan and that has long term dividends wallace and quickly jonathan swan yes wallace i want to ask you the same question i asked lindsey graham because we saw that really interesting clip where he aposs celebrating with the lsu football team and then he suddenly brings up impeachment how much has this gotten under his skin swan he aposs of course he aposs thinking about this all the time and you know he aposs watched because he watches tv all the time and it aposs the it aposs the subject on you know but but this is also how trump talks like anyone who aposs had a conversation with the president would know that he will jump from one topic to a completely different topic in the same sentence it aposs it aposs sort of quite typical wallace all right panel we have to take a break here but when we come back what the war of words between elizabeth warren and bernie sanders is really about and what effect will it have on the 2020 primary race commercial break begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate after taking all the hits i go down and everybody who aposs hit me is out you all declare me not you editorially in a broad sense declare me dead and guess what i ain apost dead and i aposm not going to die end video clip wallace joe biden speaking to the new york times editorial board declaring his campaign alive and well after some bumpy months on the campaign trail and we aposre back now with the panel well karl i think it aposs fair to say joe biden has not gotten a lot of love from political insiders and from the political media but the fact is he aposs still leading in the polls some state polls certainly national polls by double digits one is he still the favorite to win the democratic nomination and two is he still the toughest challenge to donald trump in a in a general election rove i think the answer to both is yes i loved it last spring people were writing him off because he came out and sort of bumbled around and said weird things and i wrote in my column in the wall street journal don apost count him out because there aposs a certain resiliency to him we we all know that he aposs goofy but we all have a goofy uncle that shows up at the summer picnic that we sort of like and that aposs the quality of joe biden he aposs sort of the goofy uncle at the summer picnic that we have a sort of confidence that if he were president we aposd make it through so yes he represents in my opinion the most serious threat to the president of all the field and i think that at a as i wrote in my column two weeks ago he is likely to be the democratic nominee but if if i had to pick one but but ironically i aposd like to take the field against him but you can apost do that because i don apost think he aposs a 50 50 candidate and all better than 50 50 and and all kinds of weird things are going to happen wallace i think in a canada casino ph you can take the field against him but in any case one thing that aposs clearly helping him at least right now is this nasty split between elizabeth warren and bernie sanders among over among other things whether or not a woman can be elected president here aposs the famous clip from the debate begin video clip sen elizabeth warren d ma presidential candidate i think you called me a liar on national tv sen bernie sanders i vt presidential candidate what warren i think you called me a liar on national tv sanders no let me let aposs not do it right now you want to have that discussion we aposll have that discussion warren anytime sanders you called me a liar you told me all right let aposs not do it now end video clip wallace chuck how do you see the fight on the left playing out lane i think joe biden sees it as kind of like the iran iraq war you know that let those two keep fighting forever and destroy each other and it aposs a it aposs a great bonus for him i think elizabeth warren played this card in part because she really needed to that she wasn apost winning the progressive wing of the party and i think she wanted to you know sort of stir up sentiment among women in the democratic primary race but there aposs a huge risk in that because bernie sanders apos people are now firing back and saying this whole thing was an unfair setup that it aposs a it aposs she aposs not accurately portraying their conversations so on and so forth between this and the fact that the senators will have to sit quietly through a week or so of impeachment at least i think you have to say that joe biden comes out ahead and just to pick up on something karl said african americans have stood by joe biden they are a key piece of the democratic electorate and it turns out the most pragmatic segment because clearly they are focused on somebody who can beat trump in the fall and they see it as joe biden rove this hurt her badly she didn apost shake his hand and in iowa that matters if she had shaken his hand and said the same thing i think people in iowa would say well at least she was showing some strength but she was disrespectful and this reinforces the image that she can apost tell the truth she inaudible wallace all right let me switch subjects because meanwhile in a it aposs it aposs hard to say this in a week where the president goes on trial possibly to be removed from office but in fact the president had a pretty good week first he signed that big trade deal with china and then the senate by an overwhelming bipartisan majority approved his great deal with mexico and canada and here aposs the president on that begin video clip donald trump president of the united states today we just had passed the usmca it aposs going to take the place of nafta which was a terrible deal and the usmca will probably be second to this witch hunt hoax end video clip wallace kristen how do you explain the gap between rising and very strong numbers of approval for the president aposs handling of the economy and his much lower numbers when it comes to overall job approval anderson you aposre right that there aposs a gap of about ten points in almost every poll where you ask both of these questions and i think that gap is driven by folks saying i like what aposs going on with my 401k i like what aposs going on in my bank account but i wish he would stop the tweets i wish he would conduct himself much more conventionally presidentially there aposs a lot in terms of tone and style that donald trump does that will rub people the wrong way even if those very same people feel like the economy is doing better so the big question is which one of these is going to win out when it comes to people making their voting decision i think in a normal environment you would see a president with these kinds of economic numbers and political scientists would build their models that would say yes the incumbent is likely to get re elected but with this big gap it aposs possible that the economy does not win out that people say look i like what aposs going on in my bank account but i don apost know that i want four more years of this the atmospherics the tone the style wallace let anderson and that aposs going to be the big conflict wallace let me pick up on that with you jonathan how confident is the trump team both in the white house at the campaign headquarters that no matter how divisive and polarizing he is that the economy is going to see him through swan look this is something that they aposre watching very closely and i wouldn apost call it confidence because it aposs sort of like knocking wood every you know couple week trump didn apost have that many tools after he passed the tax cuts to keep the economy frothy he aposs now put in place two of them usmca which was very significant and then the china deal really calmed the markets it was you know we aposre probably not going to see a phase two deal that was a phase one we aposre probably not going to see a phase two deal before the election but if nothing major happens with china between now and november they feel you know pretty as good as you can with something as unreliable as the economy wallace let let me just pick up on that with you karl because i famously remember that in 1945 the brits threw out winston churchill just after he had let them to victory out hitler and the nazis he still lost and i guess the question is is a president with an economy and the numbers are really quite extraordinary is a president with an economy this strong beatable rove he is but the economy is very a very strong weapon in his arsenal and i would expect from from my contacts inside trump world that they aposre going to make a very strong effort to get a trade deal moving with the united kingdom in order to keep this sense of amendment we aposve got a second act there are things that we aposre going to do to keep the prosperity growing but but i think this tension between the strong economy and the president aposs re election numbers points to one very important thing who his opponent is as a democrat and then the conduct of that democratic campaign and the president in the period of july august september and october are going to be critical probably how each day plays out more than any election since probably 1980 when people were sitting there saying well we aposve got concerns about jimmy carter but is that guy ronald reagan up to it wallace fifteen seconds swan one thing i am stunned to pick up when i talk to people inside the trump orbit is they are they are starting to talk about mike bloomberg and this this enormous spending he aposs doing is catching their attention wallace i aposve got to say two new york billionaires that would be a pretty fun show to watch all right panel thank you see you next sunday up next our power player of the week from being told he aposd never walk normally again to trekking to the ends of the earth a real life adventure story commercial break wallace after suffering a terrible accident he chose to make feats of extraordinary endurance his brand now he wants people to test their own limits here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape wallace why why take on these challenges colin o aposbrady professional endurance athlete you know for me i think it aposs two fold one i want to push my own limits for the human potential but i also for me my larger purpose is really to inspire other wallace voice over colin o aposbrady is talking about his athletic endurance achievement in a world full of records his are astonishing becoming the first person to walk across antarctica solo and just last month rowing across some of the world aposs most treacherous waters from south america to antarctica unidentified male we did it unidentified male we did it wallace on camera do you ever think in the middle of one of these challenges expedition what the hell am i doing o aposbrady all the time all the time you know i aposve definitely thought like whose idea was this anyways oh wait it was my idea wallace voice over his idea started with a freak accident in thailand in 2008 o aposbrady there was a flaming jump rope that other people were participating in it looked like a good idea to me and unfortunately for me it went terribly wrong the rope wrapped around my legs and lit my body completely on fire to my neck wallace doctors said he aposd never walk normally again o aposbrady that was kind of the deepest not just physical pain but also emotional sort of downward spiraling to be kind of told that my life would never be the same wallace he says his mother pulled him out of it o aposbrady colin your life aposs not over what do you want to do when you get out of here so at first i didn apost want to play along but eventually i i closed my eyes one day and i opened my eyes and said mom i just you know pictured myself crossing the finish line of a triathlon wallace eighteen months later o aposbrady finished first in the armature field at the chicago triathlon he went on to climb mount everest and break ten world records o aposbrady top of the world wallace which brings us to 2018 and that solo trek across antarctica o aposbrady i was carrying a 375 pound sled mostly full of fuel and food just enough kind of food to get me to the end which i was nearly running out of when i finished still a long way to go wallace he was alone with his camera for 54 days braving windchills of 80 degrees below zero and brutal storms o aposbrady i aposm hoping these tent poles hold wallace on camera did you ever think either one i aposm not going to be able to finish this or two it may finish me o aposbrady you know when you aposre alone for that long it aposs like throwing a party for yourself but all of your angels and all of your demons are all invited they aposre all kind of competing in there in your brain i aposm trying to hold it together wallace voice over then late last year the row across the 600 mile drake passage in 13 punishing days o aposbrady we had to keep the boat moving constantly 24 hours a day because the currents and the swells would push us around too much the only way we thought to do that was to do 90 minute shifts i just threw up ninety minutes rowing 90 minutes resting ninety minutes rowing 90 minutes resting wallace o aposbrady explains what drives him in his new book the impossible first o aposbrady i made it wallace he hopes people will seek out their own challenges o aposbrady i want them to set this down and say now my impossible first is to do this and go out and take action in their own lives anything is possible if you believe in yourself end videotape wallace colin isn apost done with his adventures this spring he wants to climb mount everest again but this time with his wife jenna now these program notes ahead of a big week in washingto
