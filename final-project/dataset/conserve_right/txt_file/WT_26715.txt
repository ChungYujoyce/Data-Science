ce for house seat becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion former vice president and current presidential candidate joe biden has bragged on two occasions that he would like to beat up president donald trump in march 2018 mr biden huffed they asked me would i like to debate this gentleman and i said no i said if we were in high school i d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him mr biden s tough guy braggadocio was apparently no slip a year later he doubled down on his physical threats top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick the idea that i d be intimidated by donald trump he s the bully that i ve always stood up to he s the bully that used to make fun when i was a kid that i stutter and i d smack him in the mouth had former vice president dick cheney ever dared to say something similar of president obama what would the media reaction have been recently sen cory booker new jersey democrat another presidential candidate took up where mr biden left off trump is a guy who you understand he hurts you and my testosterone sometimes makes me want to feel like punching him which would be bad for this elderly out of shape man that he is if i did that this physically weak specimen one trait of the democratic field of presidential candidates is always to sound further to the left than any of their primary rivals apparently a similar habit is to see who can most effectively imagine beating up the president for now mr booker seems to be in first place the current candidates are just channeling three years of sick showboating by hollywood celebrities actor robert de niro has repeatedly expressed a desire to physically assault mr trump a month before mr trump was elected mr de niro said of him i d like to punch him in the face later mr de niro doubled down with a series of f trump outbursts this is especially dangerous in the aftermath of progressive zealot and bernie sanders supporter james hodgkinson s 2017 attempt to assassinate republican congressmen at a practice for a charity baseball game rep steve scalise louisiana republican was shot and nearly killed three other people were also shot and wounded rep rashida tlaib michigan democrat just hours after she was sworn in said a rally that she had promised her young son that we re going to impeach the motherf r donald trump is a controversial president no doubt he replies to his critics with strong often inflammatory invective yet the continued litany of threats to physically assault or kill a president is lowering the bar of assassination and it will haunt the country long after mr trump is gone on the day mr trump was inaugurated pop music star madonna told a large crowd outside the white house that she had thought of blowing it up a few months later comedian kathy griffin issued a video where she held up a bloody facsimile of a decapitated trump head since then hollywood and the entertainment industry have been in constant competition to imagine the most gruesome way of killing off mr trump stabbing blowing up burning shooting suffocating decapitating or beating celebrities such as johnny depp snoop dogg george lopez moby rosie o donnell mickey rourke and larry wilmore seem to relish the media attention as they discuss or demonstrate what they consider to be creative ways to kill the president it is hard to determine whether their tweets and outbursts are designed to restore sagging careers are heartfelt expressions of pure hatred or both we saw something similar to the current climate of threatened violence during the re election campaign and second presidential term of george w bush a few columnists documentary filmmakers and novelists went well beyond the boilerplate invective of calling mr bush a fascist racist nazi and war criminal and imagined his assassination in a variety of ways but we are now well beyond even that rhetorical violence mr trump and his critics often go at it relentlessly in interviews in twitter wars and on television and radio no insult seems too petty for mr trump to ignore yet progressives like mr biden and mr booker seem to think that by bragging of wanting to do violence to the president they will rev up their base and win attention as if physical violence is justified by mr trump s unorthodox presidency nonetheless the current climate is becoming scary those who brag of wanting to violently attack the president should worry about where their boasts will finally lead if any of the thousands of james hodgkinsons in america take such threats seriously and act upon them victor davis hanson a classicist and historian at the hoover institution at stanford university is the author of the second world
