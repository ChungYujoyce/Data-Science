and media but some democrats have not given up and want more information on moscow trump ties hope hicks president trump s former communications director found herself answering the same questions on russian contacts when she appeared june 19 before the house judiciary committee some democrats are looking to impeach mr trump based on facts in the mueller report s volume ii section on possible obstruction of justice rep adam b schiff california democrat and congress most enthusiastic promoter of the democratic party financed dossier rejected the mueller rule outright there s no limitation on confining his testimony to the four corners of the report mr schiff chairman of the house intelligence committee told cnn that may be his desire but congress has questions that go beyond the report mr mueller never spoke during his tenure until may 29 his last day as special counsel when he issued a terse statement and vowed not to speak again under democratic subpoena he reluctantly agreed last week to testify before the intelligence and judiciary committees mr schiff says the precedent was set by attorney general william barr who has testified on his concerns about how the obama administration opened the investigation in july 2016 he appointed john durham the u s attorney for connecticut to set up shop in washington to inquire how the fbi spied on trump associates relied on the opposition research dossier and obtained wiretap warrants mr mueller s report effectively demolished the dossier which alleged a sweeping trump russia conspiracy that the fbi didn t find mr schiff appears to want to counter the barr effort by opening his own counterintelligence inquiry he said he plans to summon not just mr mueller but also his staff of prosecutors for closed door questions how

discovered the texts while reviewing how the fbi handled the clinton email investigation the fbi later fired him outright the house intelligence and judiciary committees have somewhat different goals in questioning mr mueller judiciary chairman jerrold nadler new york democrat said he believes mr trump obstructed justice mr mueller said in volume ii that he could not come to that conclusion but neither could he exonerate mr trump mr barr then concluded that mr trump didn t obstruct justice saying in part that there was no underlying crime mr nadler in a joint statement with mr schiff said americans have demanded to hear directly from the special counsel so they can understand what he and his team examined uncovered and determined about russia s attack on our democracy the trump
