lumber transporters and were manufactured by china s hubei sanjiang space wanshan special vehicle co and that they could not be used for transporting missiles other analysts say the disguised launcher transfers are typical of chinese covert arms proliferation efforts a u n analysis of the launchers reveals that the launchers fronts and sides the fenders the exhaust systems fuel tanks and tires of the vehicles seen on parade exactly matched those of the ws51200 series advertised by wanshan an end user document in the u n report purports to show that north korea s forestry ministry bought the six trucks through the wuhan sanjiang import and export corp in november 2010 other documents in the report from china show that the vehicles are described as ws51200 nonhighway trucks with the longest body and largest payload mass of all such vehicles in china it was independently developed by the ninth academy of the china aerospace science and industry corp and its recent successful delivery to the client has filled a gap in this sector in china the report states the china aerospace science and industry corp is the chinese military s main mobile missile producer the document without naming north korea says the vehicle was developed by the wanshan company of the ninth academy in accordance with the client s needs using the ws series heavy duty chassis technology discovery of the north korean kn 08 prompted the pentagon to conduct a recent study that concluded the long range missile threat to the united states has increase sharply the pentagon announced earlier this year that it is adding 14 new anti missile interceptors to its missile defense system richard fisher a specialist on the chinese military who was one of the first analysts to confirm that the north korean missile launchers are chinese made said the u n report is a defeat for the united nations and a failure of american diplomacy because china escapes an appropriate accusation of violating u n sanctions against selling missile technology to north korea mr fisher said china has been promoting the falsehood that the trucks were sold for use in hauling lumber the sanjiang group of the china aerospace science and industry corp designed the 16 wheel truck that was sold to north korea for the specific purpose of transporting erecting and launching large missiles mr fisher said that a north korean nuclear missile that can reach anchorage alaska is being carried by a chinese made tel is not the result of some violation of a contract but of a deliberate chinese policy to help north korea
