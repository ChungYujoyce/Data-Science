apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic presumptive democratic presidential nominee joseph r biden said monday president trump has done more to shield the white house from the coronavirus than he has to protect the general public the former vice president said mr trump could push the nation toward reopening the economy by following through on the unfulfilled promise that anybody that wants a test can get a test the administration is fully aware that this is the right path too after all the president and his staff are now reportedly receiving daily tests mr biden wrote in a washington post op ed they knew exactly how to make the oval office safe and operational and they put in the work to do it top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk they just haven t put in that same work for the rest of us mr biden said if trump and his team understand how critical testing is to their safety and they seem to given their own behavior why are they insisting that it s unnecessary for the american people the coronavirus crisis has pushed mr biden off the campaign trail and become a central part of his message as he looks to weaken mr trump ahead of the fall election his goal is as obvious as it is craven he hopes to split the country into dueling camps casting democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep america grounded and republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy mr biden said it s a childish tactic and a false choice that none of us should fall for polls show more than half of voters disapprove of the trump administration s response to covid 19 the disease caused by the new coronavirus and that mr biden has a 4 point edge over mr trump in a head to head matchup mr biden said americans want the nation to reopen as soon as possible and said governors would be able to lead the way if they had more support from the president and the federal government it s been more than two months since trump claimed that anybody that wants a test can get a test mr biden said it was a baldfaced lie when he said it and it still isn t remotely true mr biden said the economy will not come back until people are confident they are safe and the number of cases start to level out or drop instead of once again seeking to divide us trump should be working to get americans the same necessary protections he ha
