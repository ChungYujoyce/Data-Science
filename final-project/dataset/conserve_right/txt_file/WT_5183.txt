e indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion president trump s engagement of north korea and its intransigent and unpredictable dictator kim jong un was a stunning departure from the staid and unproductive efforts of prior u s administrations early on the president s application of maximum pressure to replace the previous failed strategic patience approach appeared fruitful mr kim halted a series of provocative nuclear and missile tests particularly when economic sanctions took hold and brought much financial pain to his regime the trump kim singapore summit in june 2018 brought promise their follow up meeting eight months later was disappointing since then mr kim has become more emboldened re engaging in saber rattling in what he now terms positive and offensive measures for fully ensuring the sovereignty and security of the country it s time for the united states to respond definitively and clearly to mr kim and his patron china that enough is enough top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the challenge washington faces with mr kim is that the fulcrum of influence between north korea and the united states has shifted it moved as a result of north korea s success in developing nuclear weapons and a slow yet steady decline in the u s military presence on the korean peninsula that began in 1971 with the withdrawal of the 7th infantry division in 1989 further cuts to the 2nd infantry division in south korea occurred that downward trend has continued north korea has noticed moreover the u s military presence in east asia has also declined after 1991 following the philippine senate s refusal to permit continued u s access to the sprawling subic bay naval base and clark air force base our influence in the region was further degraded china noticed now president trump should take notice of the value of forward deployed forces in asserting u s influence in securing our vital national interest in east asia including freedom of navigation deterred aggression and nuclear nonproliferation the reduction in u s forces in south korea over time clearly signaled that the united states was disinclined to engage in land combat on the korean peninsula despite the rising threat from north korea s nuclear and missile proliferation furthermore the regrettable u s departure from the philippines benefitted china which has aggressively asserted its territorial claims to the oil rich spradley islands lying between china malaysia the philippines and vietnam while demanding the u s navy steer clear of nearby sea lanes that china feels thus emboldened says much about how it sees the influence fulcrum shifting in their favor with a reduced u s military presence of forward deployed forces in the region this should provide a lesson for president trump s policymakers both mr kim and china have taken measure of america s withdrawal from east asia both understand that as u s regional presence wanes their ability to flex their muscles waxes the value of forward deployed forces was clear during the cold war indeed it demonstrated our firm resolve to fight soviet sino aggression wherever it might occur this proposition is in doubt today and contributes to the perception that the united states lacks resolve in the region the president s wise employment of maximum pressure is not enough to assert u s influence in north korea and the region to secure peace even now mr kim is creating new front companies supported by chinese banks to circumvent sanctions a strong forward deployed presence with robust allied cost sharing is essential in securing the undivided attention of north korea and china which think we are irresolute in pursuing our national interests they must be disabused of this first the united states should return two full u s army divisions to south korea with accompanying field artillery rocket brigades and missile defense units to effectively confront the threat of north korean tactical artillery and missiles to south korea second the united states should re engage in robust u s allied military exercises to demonstrate that if mr kim seeks armed conflict he will lose third the united states should initiate negotiations with the philippines to restore our naval and air power projection in the region making our intent clear to both pyongyang and beijing it s one thing for the united states to aspire to deterrence and freedom of navigation in the region it s entirely another to be a resident there fourth the united states should negotiate with our reliable ally australia to develop a u s australian joint warfare training and testing center for forces and capabilities that may be called upon to confront armed aggression in east asia given australia s abundant territory the increased ranges of future u s munitions and our common interest in resisting chinese aggression in the region such joint training and testing would be beneficial the influence fulcrum shift favoring north korea and china has accommodated increased chinese aggression in the region as well as mr kim s continued brinkmanship it s time to set both straight and a resurgence of forward deployed forces in the region is a vital step in deterring war particularly endless ones president trump earnestly seeks to avoid l scott lingamfelter a
