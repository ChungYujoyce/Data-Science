wilson told reporters in the aftermath first amendment in milwaukee president trump will stage yet another splendid rally in milwaukee on tuesday one in a long sequence of campaign rallies that make up his successful voter outreach but there s always drama afoot and the milwaukee rally is no exception this rally takes place in the university of wisconsin milwaukee panther arena a detail which caused so much consternation among students that chancellor mark mone had to explain that the campus had naming rights for the venue but neither owns the site nor controls who appears there young critics had deemed the trump gathering a hate rally i have frequently spoken about our unwavering commitment to your safety inclusivity equity and respect we are proud that we educate the most diverse population of any campus in the state with more under represented minority students and veterans than any other wisconsin campus our campus community is further enriched by our first generation lgbt and non traditional students diversity is further enhanced by critical conversations that can help others see life through their fellow human beings lens mr mone wrote in a letter to students and faculty our diversity is also vital in creating an environment that welcomes and encourages the open exchange of ideas and civil intellectual challenge this free expression will at times be logical and at other times highly emotional most of us cherish the right to say what s on our minds at the same time each of us is and will continue to be confronted with hostile speech and words that challenge our sense of morality and justice this type of speech is also a right and is protected by the first amendment mr mone advised trump coverage 93 negative it is a tradition that continues almost all the broadcast coverage about president trump has been negative in recent months in the first 100 days since house democrats began their impeachment push on september 24 abc cbs and nbc have aggressively aided the effort a media research center analysis finds the big three evening newscasts have battered the president with 93 negative coverage and promoted impeachment at the expense of nearly all other trump news write rich noyes and bill d agostino who evaluated 1 053 comments about mr trump which aired on the networks from sept 24 to jan 1 the broadcast networks donated at least 124 hours of wall to wall live coverage as they pre empted regular programming in favor of house democrat led impeachment activities the analysts said three fourths of the coverage was devoted to impeachment which earned 849 minutes of airtime compared to the fight against isis which got 78 minutes north korea 19 minutes immigration 17 minutes and the economy 9 minutes democratic candidates were also compromised mr trump drew a total of 1 143 minutes joseph r biden got 107 minutes sens elizabeth warren and bernard sanders got 24 minutes each and pete buttigieg had 8 minutes while most citizens would want their media to be even handed in their coverage of candidates the networks seem poised to be as lopsidedly negative in their coverage of trump s 2020 campaign as they have been in their coverage of his presidency the analysts concluded poll du jour 66 of u s adults say the federal government should have a lot of responsibility in reducing economic inequality in the u s 44 of
