national review the league of morons a key coronavirus question do we want god beauty in babette s feast john wayne the hero we need now why museums should reopen now a strongly worded heterodox view surreal is a word people have been using a lot in the past month or so under the new coronavirus realities it can be used to touch on the terrifying and the life endangering as well as the merely inconvenient for many of us life is not what it once was routines might be out of whack a family might finally spend time together whereas before work kept people apart for long hours or you couldn t even be with a dying loved one at the end and of course there is the all around uncertainty we need something to latch on to when we don t really have words that can adequately describe what is going on there is also the wistful thought that this may just be a bad dream we get to wake up from surreal could describe a recent day when new york governor andrew cuomo s daily news conference included praise of president donald trump the president then had clips of the governor s praise played at the white house coronavirus evening briefing that same night a cynical bone in me thought is that some clever way someone thought to harm a potential cuomo presidential run the president also has been known to be a fan of praise but could there be something else going on too in a country that has been falling into the abyss of constant anger and derision could we be having a moment where this surreal has an element of enduring change the pivotal question seems to be is this just a national crisis that we are going to merely get through with some minimal surface level changes or is this going to be a moment of profound change after that cuomo trump lovefest of sorts i was thinking a lot of my friend kate o beirne she died three years ago this month and if you know her name you remember that she was a panelist on cnn s capital gang as well as my colleague at national review she had a quick new york wit and it was a gift many of us wish we had it often seemed like everyone wanted her advice on just about everything whether it was high level national politics or dating advice she may have gotten me appropriately dressed to meet pope benedict xvi on one memorable occasion the anniversary of her death wasn t the only reason i was thinking of her it s all the surreality too thanks to the generosity of her family i was able to be with her near the end i saw things i cannot explain healing things god prepares us in mysterious ways before we leave and i saw confirmation of that for not the first time in my life but i also remember all the people in her hospital wing who were alone that s of course the rule now you re sick and dying and you can t have those you most love in the world by your side i know god uses that too but it s agony it was surreal of course that moment three years ago to see a woman laboring to even breathe a woman to this day often described as a dynamo and a force of nature a woman who would make every event better who would draw you out of yourself who was the godmother of men widely considered d c curmudgeons the late journalist robert novak and judge robert bork was lying helpless in a bed we are of course all going to be in that position one day whether it s succumbing to cancer or the sudden robbery that is coronavirus or something even more abrupt death is inescapable and the reason i thought of kate when i watched the two press conferences that day is that it seemed as it can sometimes these days that maybe even the politicians realize that there are things more important than party politics you see service kick in pope francis prayed for politicians the other day and noted that it is a noble calling at least it should be that s why we pray for wisdom and prudence in elected leaders and for those who want to be leaders too a presidential campaign even in the time of the coronavirus sets a tone it can add or subtract to the confidence level of a population with kate as she neared the end this woman who was the font of every good column idea for her colleagues gradually had no interest in politics she seemed to care only about her family her faith her friends who knows what complex psychological issues are playing out in all of our individual and shared experiences of the surreal right now but i do wonder as i hear a governor talk about his family and his struggles during the course of a daily briefing whether he s having the kind of healthy mortality check we all ought to have of course sometimes i watch the white house evening briefing and see the comments on twitter and realize we are nowhere near the sober place this is calling us to but we can all make a decision to contribute to this as a transformational moment one that is not just about survival but about flourishing in enduring and even eternal ways jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist
