wave of domestic criticism as many world war ii themed anti japanese dramas on television have come across as bizarre vulgar even pornographic kitsch the campaign is causing public revulsion and condemnation popularly mocked as resisting japan bizarre dramas these movie and tv productions often portray the communist led anti japanese forces during the war in the most hagiographic and self glorifying light chinese forces are shown carrying out all sorts of miracles to destroy japanese troops with soldiers throwing rocks to down japanese military aircraft and a lone chinese woman using hunting bows to kill dozens of fully armed japanese soldiers in one episode of the tv series called our unit designation shall never fade a chinese battalion commander brings down a high flying japanese military airplane by hurling a hand grenade into the air kill every japanese devil has a scene that shows a chinese man using a sewing needle to dispatch japanese invading soldiers in the

anymore dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed the scripts are also bizarre and incredible indelibly imprinted into the chinese popular lexicon are many infamous lines from these resisting japan bizarre dramas one of them is this gem my grandfather was brutally killed by the japanese devils when he was only 9 years old i hate the japanese another is a sentence in one drama that has been made into a mocking ringtone i knocked out a japanese devil s machine gunner with a single bullet from 800 li away a chinese li is roughly a third of a mile so the good comrade could kill a japanese solider from 248 miles away the standard chinese term to describe world war ii is the eight year war of resistance against japan counting the 1937 marco polo bridge incident as the beginning of the conflict but the term was not used until after the war was over in 1945 yet many chinese tv and movie dramas routinely use this phrase in their scripts as if the communists already knew in 1937 or 1940 exactly how long the war would last to many chinese viewers the most repulsive aspect of these crudely anti japanese productions is the blatant display of salacious often pornographic scenes broadcast during the prime evening viewing slots in a highly watched drama called the man from the frontier city a man gives a beautiful widow an aphrodisiac drink followed by a full five minute depiction of the woman s masturbation and the subsequent sex act between the two the nation s jaws dropped from the broadcast this month the talk of the nation in

his wife s body and the woman gleefully pulls the ignition pin thus sacrificing their lives for the party and the motherland their last words let s have an ecstatic moment one more time enemy defeated game over the backlash to these socialist surrealist dramas has been momentous in china so much so that the party leadership moved to curb the enthusiasm of the country s artistic propaganda community the official xinhua news agency on thursday published a rare hard hitting article calling the shows vulgar and deviant after a national outcry the communist party s propaganda department promptly banned the broadcast of let us fight the japanese devils together but short of abandoning the japan demonizing policy altogether many remain doubtful that such vulgar and deviant kitsch on china s public airwaves will be effectively eliminated miles yu s column appears fridays he can be reached at
