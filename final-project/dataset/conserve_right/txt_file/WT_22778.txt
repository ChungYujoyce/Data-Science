evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties we need answers to the questions left unanswered by the mueller report pelosi said on the house floor ahead of voting house minority leader kevin mccarthy countered that the democratic maneuvers are all just a desperate attempt to relitigate the mueller investigation he called it an impeachment effort in everything but name earlier in the day pelosi all but ignored questions about impeachment during a policy conference saying the democrats strategy is legislating investigating litigating in that order pressed about trump she said i m done with him i don t even want to talk about him the house s far reaching resolution approved tuesday empowers committee chairs to sue top trump administration officials to force compliance with congressional subpoenas including those for mueller s full report and his underlying evidence they now no longer need a vote of the full house the judiciary committee chairman rep jerry nadler of new york urged his colleagues to support the legislation so we can get into court and break the stonewall without delay after the vote nadler said he would go to court as quickly as possible against mcgahn who at the behest of the white house has defied subpoenas for documents and his testimony the chairman also said he is prepared to go to court to enforce subpoenas against former white house communications director hope hicks and annie donaldson a former mcgahn aide if they don t show up for scheduled interviews this month and nadler added new names to the list saying he is also interested in hearing from assistant attorney general jody hunt who served as former attorney general jeff sessions chief of staff and former white house aide rick dearborn both are mentioned frequently in the mueller report either work with us and comply with subpoenas or we ll see you in court said rep james mcgovern d mass the chairman of the rules committee house leaders have signaled they will hold off on suing barr for now after the committee struck a deal with the justice department to receive some underlying materials from mueller s report nadler has called these some of mueller s most important files and said all members of the committee will be able to view them they include redacted portions of the report pertaining to obstruction of justice some staff have already started viewing the files however nadler said the committee will likely sue for access to the report s secret grand jury information the chairmen of several oversight committees said after the vote that tuesday s action extends beyond the russia investigation into other aspects of trump s administration including their subpoena for the president s tax returns this is not just about russia this is a broad coordinated campaign to stall more investigations across the board said rep elijah cummings d md the chairman of the oversight committee we are here in a fight for the soul of our democracy and we will use every single tool that is available to us to hold this administration accountable it s not clear if that will be enough though for the dozens of house democrats who say it s beyond time to start impeachment proceedings pelosi has resisted those efforts so far preferring to build the case in the courts and in the court of public opinion the no 2 democrat rep steny hoyer of maryland downplayed the tensions saying tuesday he doesn t get the impression the caucus is embroiled by this issue and divided by this issue we have differences of opinion but i don t think that we are divided the ramped up actions this week are intended to mollify some of the impatient members while also seeking to deepen the public s understanding of mueller s findings mueller wrote in his 448 page report released last month that there was not enough evidence to establish that there was a criminal conspiracy between trump s 2016 campaign and russia but he also said he could not exonerate trump on obstruction of justice the report examined several episodes in which trump attempted to influence or curtail mueller s investigation on monday the judiciary panel heard testimony from john dean a white house counsel under richard nixon who helped bring down his presidency dean testified that mueller has provided congress with a road map for investigating trump the focus on mueller will continue wednesday when the house intelligence committee is scheduled to review the counterintelligence implications of russia s election interference as detailed in mueller s report the president s eldest son donald trump jr is scheduled to testify before the senate intelligence committee also wednesday the oversight committee will consider new contempt citations against barr and commerce
