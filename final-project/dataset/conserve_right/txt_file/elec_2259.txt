opinion analysis opinion on nov 5 virginia will hold its tuesday night football game might be on spike check your tv listings why the land of presidents holds its gubernatorial elections in off years no presidential or congressional races on the ballot is anyone s guess maybe state lawmakers want to see just how few voters will go to the polls top stories 500 doctors tell trump to end the coronavirus shutdown say it will cause more deaths purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni ann coulter turns on trump most disloyal actual retard that has ever set foot in the oval office and this year turnout could well set a new record low the latest polls show virginians virtually hate the two candidates running for governor many will be casting their votes against one rather than for the other aside from of course the kool aid drinking true believers on each side you know who you are terry mcauliffe 56 whose claim to fame is that he raised hundreds of millions of dollars for bill clinton and then for his first lady has never held any elective office and he wants to start off as governor yes yes he does he s involved in not one but two federal investigations and most recently stories emerged that he might have made even more money off terminally ill people seriously what s more he lives in mclean a suburb of georgetown then there s ken t cuccinelli ii 45 a homegrown up from the bootstraps blah blah blah good god he s boring that monotone and he walked into the buzz saw of the obama playbook on women s issues like abortion and reproductive health oh and you re also against divorce wonder how the local media read washington post will play that so tuesday s game will go like this mcauliffe will score at least six touchdowns maybe seven cuccinelli will score five and maybe a field goal or two book it but wait that s 42 38 or 49 41 where s the rest with the other guy robert sarvis never heard of him too bad you should have mr sarvis 37 was born in fairfax the son of an english and irish american and a chinese immigrant after attending one of the best high schools in the country just miles from his home he went to harvard to study mathematics then attended the university of cambridge he got a law degree at nyu then earned a master s in economics from george mason university in the middle of a legal career he left to join a software development business and founded a company that developed apps for google s emerging android operating system in between he married a black pediatrician from greenville miss and fathered two children although he ran unsuccessfully as a republican for a state senate seat in 2011 out raised by the democrat 72 1 with a war chest of just 26 000 he left the party to become a libertarian i realized that the republican party at least in virginia in the current era is not a good vehicle for liberty candidates he told the richmond times dispatch which this year has refused to endorse a candidate republicans are very strident on personal issues him not so much on abortion he sidesteps saying it s counterproductive to try to settle the matter through the coercive power of the state he s also a vocal advocate for gay marriage and calls for the legalization of marijuana so much for the out of step republican when they talk about liberty he said of republicans they don t mean any personal issues there is very little respect for personal autonomy on other issues he favors protecting civil liberties returning health care regulation to the states upholding gun rights eliminating virginia s regressive car tax and overhauling the tax code run of the mill republican stuff the latest poll puts him at 13 percent not bad for a third party candidate not good for a guy trying to become governor but mr sarvis lays out a simple path to victory over the two universally despised candidates if everybody who s voting against the other guy actually voted against both of them i would win in a landslide he said with a laugh last week in an interview people feel locked into a two party system but the fact of the matter is we don t have to do it that way most americans agree a gallup poll in october found that 60 percent say the democratic and republicans parties do such a poor job of representing the american people that a third major party is needed a new low of 26 believe the two major parties adequately represent americans is a vote for the third party candidate tuesday futile and stupid a wasted vote probably and more mr cuccinelli has worked his way up the ranks and remains the most qualified candidate in the field but then again the situation is dire how long will americans put up with choosing between two terrible candidates virginia s plight brings to mind animal house and the conclusion reached by delta tau chi frat leaders when faced with a do or die decision we gotta take these bastards otter says now we could fight em with conventional weapons but that could take years and cost millions of lives oh no no in this case i think we have to go all out i think this situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody s part
