apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic for weeks after the covid 19 outbreak began mainstream media outlets reflecting propaganda themes voiced by the chinese government have sought to label public discussion about a laboratory origin of the coronavirus as an unfounded conspiracy theory china s government and many scientists insist that the virus resulted from a naturally occurring mutation from bats to humans with a possible wild animal host as an intermediary carrier further critics of the lab escape theory deceptively have conflated the idea that china bioengineered the virus as a weapon together with the possible inadvertent escape of a bat coronavirus top stories ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century as reported by the washington times china has discovered some 2 000 viruses including deadly bat coronaviruses in the past 12 years carrying out the research at a less secure laboratory in wuhan some 3 miles from the suspected center of the outbreak the huanan seafood market which traffics in wild animals that laboratory and a key researcher tian junhua have been working on bat coronaviruses in a search for vaccines to the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars that first broke out in 2003 a march article in the washington post ridiculed the idea that the virus escaped from a lab as a fringe theory likewise the new york times labeled lab origin a conspiracy theory the post s david ignatius however surprised many last week with a column pointing out questions about claims that the outbreak originated at the wild animal market in wuhan no bats were sold at the market mr ignatius a frequent source of leaks from liberal u s intelligence analysts reported that american intelligence agencies do not think the coronavirus outbreak is deliberate wrongdoing by the chinese but they have not ruled out an accidental release of a virus that had been gathered for scientific study the reception of the theory of an accidental leak is changing among scientists as well last month the authoritative nature medicine published new information from a group of top u s scientists who have studied virus the authors include kristian g andersen andrew rambaut w ian lipkin edward c holmes and robert f garry who have all written on the new virus the scientists acknowledged in a letter that the origin of the virus is not known but said there was strong scientific evidence it was not manipulated in a laboratory they believe the virus jumped through natural selection in humans following zoonotic animal transfer but there is a second theory based on china s known work on bat coronaviruses at level two security laboratories far lower than the high security level four lab at the wuhan institute of virology china has experienced lab escapes of viruses in the past including the sars virus thus the new coronavirus known as sars cov 2 could have leaked we must therefore examine the possibility of an inadvertent laboratory release of sars cov 2 the scientists stated the epoch times went further in a detailed investigation of the origin of the coronavirus broadcast tuesday in an online documentary the newspaper s investigation uncovered evidence a chinese scientific paper published on jan 7 in nature indicating that the new coronavirus is closely related to two sars like virus samples from bats obtained by the people s liberation army and studied at a military research center in nanjing china china s government this week renewed calls for greater cooperation in dealing with the pandemic beijing however has not disclosed what it knows about the origin of the virus or its extensive bat coronavirus research done at the wuhan laboratories graham send pandemic bill to china congress is stepping up calls for china to be held accountable for the pandemic causing mass death and global economic dislocation the world should send a bill to china said sen lindsey graham south carolina republican without chinese misconduct there would be no pandemic and they need to pay a price noting that the deadly virus spread is the third time china has caused a pandemic mr graham said china should pay big time mr graham wants to end u s reliance on pharmaceutical supplies from china and sharply curtail trading relations by the united states and the rest of the world he also wants china to close its wet markets the wild animal markets that are suspected of being a source of the coronavirus outbreak when they give us stuff it s like an arsonist who set a fire giving us a bucket of water you shouldn t be grateful because without the arsonist there would be no fire he said in interviews this week on fox news channel rep jim banks a member of the house armed services committee this week called on the state and justice departments to sue china for damages caused by the coronavirus in the u n international court of justice if china s leaders hadn t become embarrassed by the outbreak and tried to cover up its spread the world may have had a better chance to prepare for this or even contain it in wuhan or china the indiana republican said instead we have a pandemic china shoulders most of that blame rather than succumb to the propaganda and spin of chinese officials the world must hold them accountable for mishandling this outbreak if the united nations cannot even do that it has completely lost its purpose mr banks wants beijing to pay reparations for failing to alert the world to the virus outbreak sen marsha blackburn tennessee republican also is advocating for forcing china to pay damages ms blackburn has called for china to waive some of the nearly 1 trillion debt of the u s government paper ridicules beijing s criticism chinese diplomats are known for going to great lengths when it comes to the work of foreign embassies recalling english author and diplomat sir henry wotton s description of a foreign ambassador as a gentleman sent to lie abroad for the good of his country critics have described chinese diplomats as akin to mafia lawyers sent out to defend criminal clients the leaders of the communist party around the world china is deploying its diplomats to write articles and letters to defend beijing s handling of the coronavirus pandemic on saturday australia s daily telegraph did a journalistic takedown of a letter to the newspaper sent by the chinese consulate general in sydney a letter that was sharply critical of the paper s pandemic coverage the chinese official who signed the letter but was not named by the paper characterized the daily telegraph s coverage as being full of ignorance prejudice and arrogance in response columnist tim blair wrote if a state owned newspaper in china received this kind of complaint subsequent days would involve journalists waking up in prison with their organs harvested on the origin of the virus the consulate said that subject was an issue requiring professional science based assessment sure it does how professional and science based was the claim published on march 12 by china s foreign ministry spokesman zhao lijian that it might be u s army who brought the epidemic to wuhan mr blair wrote the consulate then asked for the real motive behind critics who link the virus to china and state the virus was made in china our motive is accuracy mr blair said the people of wuhan made a huge effort and personal sacrifice to stop the epidemic the letter said mr blair retorted wuhan s dr li wenliang indeed made a huge effort to warn people about the coronavirus outbreak then as the new york times reported in early january he was called in by both medical officials and the police and forced to sign a statement denouncing his warning as an unfounded and illegal rumor and now he s dead so that s personal sacrifice covered as well he wrote dr li died of covid 19 complications the consulate letter noted china s epidemic prevention and control was part of the people centered philosophy of the communist party of china and the strong advantages of the chinese system in 2018 amnesty international reported that china executed more citizens than the rest of the world combined mr blair noted please tell us more about your people centered philosophy and how many bullets it requires he said the consulate concluded that the newspaper s articles have wantonly attacked and smeared the cpc and the chinese government with vicious language and yet we haven t been jailed or shot where s the justice in that mr blair said contact bill g
