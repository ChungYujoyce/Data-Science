apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap a chinese university s plan to conduct a blanket search of student and staff electronic devices has come under fire illustrating the limits of the population s tolerance for surveillance and raising the prospect that tactics used on muslim minorities may be creeping into the rest of the country the guilin university of electronic technology is reconsidering a search of cellphones computers external hard disks and usb drives after a copy of the order leaked online and triggered such an intense backlash that it drew rare criticism in state run newspapers searches of electronics are common in xinjiang in china s far west a heavily muslim region that has been turned into a virtual police state to tamp down unrest they are unheard of in most other areas including where the school is located in the southern guangxi region a popular tourist destination known for spectacular scenery not violence or terrorism top stories gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed that s why the planned checks worry some xinjiang has emerged as china s surveillance laboratory said james leibold a scholar of chinese ethnic politics and national identity at la trobe university in australia it is unsurprising that some of the methods first pioneered in china s west are now being rolled out in other regions under president xi jinping the government has in recent years tried to tighten controls over what the public sees and says online and stepped up political oversight of universities sometimes these measures have run into a new generation of chinese accustomed to greater freedoms sparking public outcry and occasionally government retreat the leaked notice in guilin warned that hostile domestic groups and

necessary to resist and combat extremist recordings that it called mentally harmful the order triggered a public uproar last week posts on china s twitter like weibo site with hashtags on schools checking electronic devices were viewed nearly 80 million times users voiced privacy concerns comparing the measure to computer chips inserted in brains and the george orwell novel 1984 then came critical editorials in state run publications saying the notice could violate chinese constitutional protection of the right to communicate freely and have those communications remain confidential if colleges and universities check the phones computers and hard disks of teachers and students they re suspected of infringing on communication freedom and privacy said an editorial in the beijing youth daily those responsible at the school should be held accountable as they had a great negative impact on the school s image administrators told another state owned publication the paper that the search had not yet been carried out and that they were considering reducing its scope university and local education ministry officials referred questions to a media office which did not answer repeated phone calls weibo while not a government body ran into hot water in april when it said it would censor content related to gay issues on its microblog the company backpedaled under intense criticism including from state run publications it s unclear what prompted the guilin university s planned search it could have been a trial run to see how the public would react or an overzealous local

though online censorship is common in china physical searches of phones and laptops is an extreme measure that many will not accept most people in china are willing to tolerate big brother as long as it contributes to social stability but for many this is going too far colley said schools in xinjiang have been conducting similar searches since the region s highest court in early 2014 issued a

computers of all teachers on campus xinjiang is home to a large uighur population a muslim ethnic group that has long harbored simmering resentment against rule from beijing a series of riots and
