apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap from the moment donald trump became a national political figure he has been shadowed by investigations and controversy they have been layered lengthy and often inconclusive leaving many americans scandal weary and numb to his behavior and with each charge against him trump has perfected the art of deflection seemingly gaining strength by bullying and belittling those who have dared to take him on now trump is facing a high velocity threat like none he s confronted before top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches it has rapidly evolved from a process fight over a whistleblower complaint to an impeachment inquiry within two weeks much of the evidence is already in public view a rough transcript of a phone call in which trump asks ukraine s president to help investigate democratic rival joe biden the whistleblower s detailed letter alleging the white house tried to cover up the call and possibly others unlike special counsel robert mueller s two year investigation which circled an array of people in trump s orbit but not always the president himself trump doesn t have the benefit of distance his words and his actions are at the center of this investigation the mueller report it was always manafort this and his son that there was a cascade of players said presidential historian douglas brinkley referring to former trump campaign chairman paul manafort and donald trump jr this was just donald trump and a disturbing conversation with another world leader so suddenly washington is different and the history of trump s presidency has changed by year s end he could become only the third american president impeached by the house of representatives that new reality caught trump and his advisers off guard according to people close to the president if anything they thought the specter of impeachment had been lifted after the mueller investigation ended without a clear determination that trump had committed a crime the contours of that investigation played to trump s strengths mueller spent two years in silence allowing the president to fill the vacuum with assertions that the investigation was a hoax and a witch hunt the details of the investigation that did leak out were often complicated and focused on people in trump s sphere even mueller s pointed statement that he had not exonerated trump did not seem to stick there was ultimately plenty of smoke but no smoking gun numerous other democratic inquiries appeared likely to meet a similar fate including house investigation into trump s business dealings his tax returns and a variety of administration scandals for many americans they were one big blur of investigations without any clarity of purpose then the whistleblower gave the democrats what they needed a simple easily explainable charge that the president sought a foreign government s help for personal political gain and his words to back it up for house speaker nancy pelosi d calif and several democratic moderates who had resisted calls for impeachment the calculus shifted it was now more of a risk to recoil from impeachment than charge ahead what we re seeing right now is a completely different moment in the history of this country said rep debbie mucarsel powell d fla one thing that didn t change at least not immediately was the clear partisan divide over trump s actions both in washington and across the country according to a one day npr pbs newshour marist poll conducted wednesday 49 of americans approve of the house formally starting an impeachment inquiry into trump among democrats 88 approve of the investigation while 93 of republicans disapprove mike staffieri a retiree and republican who lives just outside of richmond virginia said democrats were trying to throw enough poop at the wall and hope something sticks on capitol hill some trump allies concurred confidently dismissing the impeachment inquiry as just another partisan effort to take down a president who is despised by many democrats that rough transcript of a phone call in which trump presses ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskiy to work with attorney general william barr and personal lawyer rudy giuliani on an investigation into biden it s just trump being trump according to his backers you ve heard president trump talk that s president trump said sen ron johnson r wis mark updegrove a presidential historian and president of the lbj foundation in austin texas said it s that enduring support from republican lawmakers that currently separates trump from richard nixon who resigned in the midst of the watergate impeachment inquiry because his party began to abandon him the big difference between this and watergate is that you had both republicans and democrats being deeply concerned about the president being involved in criminal wrongdoing updegrove said it was a bipartisan effort and you certainly don t have that here but it is early compared with watergate there were small signs that some republicans were trying to keep some measure of distance from the president some gop lawmakers fled washington for a fall break claiming they hadn t yet read the whistleblower s complaint others said they were open to learning more about the situation trump s hold on the republican party makes it nearly impossible to foresee a scenario in which the gop controlled senate convicts trump if he were impeached by the democratic run house the president is acutely well aware that it s his party alone that can protect him in the midst of the past week s firestorm he tweeted to republicans stick together play their game and fight hard republicans he later deleted the tweet ap polling editor emily swanson and associated press writers alan fram in
