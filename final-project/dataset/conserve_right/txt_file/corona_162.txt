national review transgender student s bathroom access case returns to court apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound trump s grotesque tweets sessions says trump s anger over russiagate recusal is not all unjustified but stands by decision brexit architect cummings defends decision to travel amid lockdown what is before congress is not a stimulus bill we have often opposed stimulus bills in the past considering it a mistake for the federal government to borrow money to expand a depressed economy at the moment though the government is not trying to expand the economy or even arrest its contraction it is principally trying to enable the temporary shutdown of much of the economy with the least humanitarian damage the legislation should be judged on whether it aids efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus aids the treatment of the infected relieves the plight of those adversely affected by it and the fight against it and supports the overall economy these purposes as we notedat the outset ofthis debate sometimes overlap and sometimes conflict they also call for placing speed aheadof efficiency and both ahead of mere partisan objectives congressional democrats have not risen to this occasion they saw an opportunity to advancegoals on the environment racial diversity and planned parenthood funding that whatevertheir other merits do not belong in this bill and they have been willing to slow down theprocess toward these ends some republicans are also losing perspective albeit less crassly they fear that the expansionof unemployment insurance in the bill is too generous and will incentivize quitting or refusingto take work under normal circumstances we would share this concern but at the momentwe should be more focused on helping the unemployed especially since the rules ofunemployment insurance discourage the gaming of the system however imperfectly and thisexpansion is temporary congress has let temporary expansions expire before the bill s rebates 1 200 for singles and 2 400 for married couples up to an income limit are not especially well designed the income limits are based on previous years income whichmeans that some people who need help won t get it it would have been better to give therebates to everyone and count them as income for the taxes collected next year but they willmitigate some near term hardship jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist https cdn jwplayer com v2 playlists xtkmeukk contextual true search contextual recency 30d ph 2 function if function typeof jwplayer var jwp jwplayer document queryselectorall jw player container div jwplayer 0 null if jwp var episode jwp getconfig playlist 0 var pubdate new date episode pubdate 1000 var prelimmonth pubdate getutcmonth 1 var month prelimmonth length 1 prelimmonth 0 prelimmonth var prelimdate pubdate getutcdate var date prelimdate length 1 prelimdate 0 prelimdate var finaldate pubdate getutcfullyear month date var title episode title var labelmapping c3 nationalreview c4 null c6 null ns st st national review ns st pu national review ns st pr title ns st ep title ns st sn null ns st en null ns st ge news ns st ia 0 ns st ce 0 ns st ddt finaldate ns st tdt null jwp on ready function ns streaminganalytics jwplayer jwp publisherid 23390304 labelmapping labelmapping the provisions to support businesses small and large are especially valuable businesses cannot be expected to have saved enough money to weather a once in a lifetime pathogen the public has an interest in their being able to pay ongoing expenses during this crisis and to resume as viable enterprises once it ends the legislation stipulates that businesses receiving loans cannot pay dividends or engage in stock buybacks for several years this is faddish thinking and there are better ways to protect taxpayer interests and keep existing shareholders from making windfall gains the legislation is far from perfect the enormous spending involved would be easier to stomach if legislators and presidents had shown greater restraint before this crisis hit or showed any interest in getting the national debt on a sustainable trajectory but we will take our own advice the support for business the relief for individuals and the expansion of medical capacity are all urgent matters they justify a bill that in a happier time nobody would consider and we ourselves would vehemently reject get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
