 sign in everytown for gun safety midterm elections endorsement list heavy on safe democrats manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong former new york mayor michael r bloomberg s gun control group announced a round of candidate endorsements this week but his plan to pour 50 million into gun control efforts appears to be struggling to find campaigns to back in nationally watched races everytown for gun safety released its inaugural endorsement list and named candidates from 28 states 17 u s senate candidates 61 candidates for the u s house and 32 candidates for state offices the group also endorsed several republican candidates for the u s house in safe gop districts and sen susan m collins of maine who also is expected to win re election everytown also announced that it will run television ads supporting oregon gov john a kitzhaber and rep robin l kelly of illinois both democrats in safe races photos top 10 handguns in the u s the group is backing democrats in close senate races in iowa louisiana north carolina and elsewhere but some key democrats in such races aren t on the list in addition more than half of the u s house candidates with endorsements are in districts that political analysts deem to be safely in democrats hands suggesting trouble finding high profile candidates who could stand to benefit from mr bloomberg s help these are candidates who have shown leadership in the fight to keep our communities safe from gun violence both on the state and federal level said everytown president john feinblatt with a potential budget of 50 million everytown has resources to pour into races but financial support has been limited see also nra launches ad campaign against michael bloomberg recent spending includes 12 500 on behalf of ms kelly for production costs associated with a web video and 18 400 in support of chuck riley a former state representative in oregon running for state senate other spending by the group isn t tied directly to races this year this month it launched a six figure ad campaign protesting supermarket chain kroger s policies permitting open carry of loaded firearms while prohibiting items such as skateboards it also ran television ads in the district of columbia arizona nevada and new hampshire over the summer in an effort to raise awareness about domestic violence and guns less than two years after the newtown school shooting spree the lack of focus on guns in the election campaigns is stark it is not an issue democrats are using in any general way said floyd ciruli a denver based pollster there are obviously some exceptions but not many a spokesman for mr bloomberg said the stated 50 million figure is not necessarily meant for campaigns but represents what he plans to spend on the issue through everytown s educational and advocacy efforts and through personal expenditures spokesman stu loeser also said the former mayor is preparing more direct expenditures and additional contributions he pointed to 2 5 million mr bloomberg already has given this cycle to senate majority pac and 2 million to a committee affiliated with the pro choice abortion group emily s list senate majority pac is the organization closely affiliated with senate majority leader harry reid nevada democrat emily s list generally backs democratic candidates the senate majority pac has spent millions opposing rep tom cotton in the senate race in arkansas against sen mark l pryor who can hardly be counted as a bloomberg ally mr pryor released an ad confronting mr bloomberg after the billionaire s group formerly known as mayors against illegal guns went after the democrat for voting against a measure to increase background checks for gun purchases in april 2013 the reid affiliated pac also is backing other democratic candidates who have been at odds with mr bloomberg s agenda such as sen mark begich of alaska who also voted against the background check legislation and alison lundergan grimes in kentucky who aired an ad showing her firing a gun to prove her gun rights bona fides some democrats did tout the endorsements this week maryland lt gov anthony brown running to replace outgoing gov martin o malley and don beyer a democrat running to replace retiring rep james p moran in a solidly democratic district in northern virginia expressed their delight at gaining everytown s backing it appears as though mr bloomberg is trying to buy himself some headlines by investing in only safe races said andrew arulanandam a spokesman for the national rifle association most recently mr bloomberg s independence usa political action committee spent 150 000 attacking milwaukee county sheriff david clarke an outspoken gun rights advocate who narrowly won his democratic primary last month independence usa also gave 250 000 apiece to groups supporting incumbent republican sens thad cochran of mississippi and lindsey graham of south carolina in their primary contests both of which involve beating back challengers supported by the tea party the bloomberg group last year put about 2 2 million into supporting ms kelly in a special election and more than 700 000 in support of sen cory a booker new jersey democrat another competitive race where everytown is getting involved is colorado s senate seat where sen mark udall a democrat is trying to hold on against a challenge from rep cory gardner two state level democrats in colorado lost recall elections as a result of their support of gov john hickenlooper s push for gun controls in the wake of the december 2012 newtown school shootings making mr bloomberg s support controversial coloradans have repeatedly rejected michael bloomberg s radical gun control agenda and they will reject sen udall in november said gardner spokesman alex siciliano in arizona everytown has endorsed rep ron barber an arizona democrat who was shot by a deranged gunman in the same january 2011 spree that killed six people and wounded rep gabrielle giffords ms giffords own super pac americans for responsible solutions has raised 17 million this year and is working to boost candidates who support gun control efforts but everytown has devoted much of its resources this year to state level initiatives it has given 1 million to the washington alliance for gun responsibility which is pushing a ballot initiative to tighten background checks for gun purchases in the state the group also has contributed more than 130 000 to an unsuccessful campaign against a ballot initiative in missouri to reaffirm state residents second amendment rights copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to
