force this week focused on when to start reopening the country in a moment we aposll speak with a top public health expert dr tom inglesby director of the johns hopkins center for health security but first let aposs bring in david spunt reporting from the white house with the latest on the health battle the nation is still fighting david spunt fox news correspondent chris for the first time in history there was a presidential disaster declaration in every u s state today easter sunday was the day the president hoped to open the economy but the science shows chris we are still weeks away begin videotape spunt on the front lines it aposs race against time to flatten the curve jeff eichenlaub sinai grace hospital walked in and it was just there are patients everywhere sick patients everywhere helpless is a good word on and sad is correct unidentified female i aposm about 10 to the hospital i guess when i left my house today i sort of had mixed feelings spunt friday marks the first time the united states crossed the 2 000 coronavirus death mark in one day workers lower the bodies of unclaimed coronavirus victims into the ground on new york aposs hart island new york state alone has more cases than any other country in the world but social distancing is helping cuomo what we aposre doing is working stay with it even though it is a grind spunt but more hot spots are beginning to appear in the philadelphia chicago and washington d c areas michigan governor gretchen whitmer signed a strict executive order barring travel between residences gov gretchen whitmer d michigan all public and private gatherings of any size are prohibited spunt millions of relief checks are on the way to the bank accounts of anxious americans president trump is considering opening the economy on may 1st a day after dozens of stay at home orders expire across the country trump there aposs no happy talk jim this is the real deal and i aposve got to make the biggest decision of my life end videotape spunt the new york times is reporting the president ignored early warning signs about the virus in january and february the white house released a statement to fox news touting his accomplishments to help the american people president trump in two days on tuesday will announce a bipartisan commission to help reopen the economy chris wallace david spunt reporting from the white house david thanks for that joining us now from baltimore dr tom inglesby director of the center for health security at john hopkins johns hopkins university doctor let aposs start with that new york times report that from january on top public health officials were warning the president about the threat from the pandemic and that he did not take action until mid march one what aposs your reaction to the report and how much did those lost weeks cost us dr tom inglesby johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health so chris i can apost say who in the administration knew what and when but i would say that that article reinforces what we aposve heard along the way which is that many in the administration were very worried about this as early as january and february and that seems pretty clear now and i aposd also say that if we had acted on some of those mornings earlier we would be in a much better position in terms of diagnostics and possibly masks and personal protective equipment and getting our hospitals ready wallace when you say be in a much better position if we had imposed social distancing stay at home at the end of january and early february would there be a dramatic dramatically less number smaller number of cases and deaths inglesby yes i aposm not sure we would aposve been able to get the collective political will to do it as early as january and february because we didn apost really know when we had cases but if we had done a lot of diagnostic testing earlier it aposs possible we would have seen enough disease to get the will to do that in february and yes the earlier we put in place social distancing the earlier we would have gotten to a peak and to a better place where we can start to think about responding wallace let aposs talk about where we are right now the u s now has more than a half million coronavirus cases and this week we had 2 000 deaths in a single day so we keep talking about that curve are we at the peak of that curve or even on the downslope as some public health officials are now saying inglesby it looks like in the last few days if you look across the country and you average out the numbers that we are near a plateau in the number of cases which would be reaching a peak and in some places like new york which has had a terrible disease new york city which has terrible terrible impact with this epidemic we have a few days of similar case counts day to day and so that is what we might call a peak it doesn apost mean that the downslope of the peak is going to be fast it could be that this plateau carries on for a while and we aposve seen in other countries where they started to have lower case counts over time that it can take days and weeks for the numbers to even get cut in half so i think what we may be at a peak we hope we are it aposs still going to take time for us to start to bring the case numbers down especially in places which are the biggest hot spots wallace well let aposs talk about that there are all kinds of models where talking about first there was a model that 100 000 to 200 000 people in the u s would die from the disease now the latest model is 60 000 one how reliable are these models and what aposs your projection for how many deaths we aposre likely to see from the coronavirus here in the u s inglesby so all models are just approximations they all have their strengths and limits and so it aposs useful to look at many models and trying to get a general sense of things i think the model you aposre referring to has been one of the white house has been using which has had lowered estimates of total number of people who might die from this which is a model that really tries to fit the experience of wuhan china onto the united states as a whole i think it aposs good for an overall general estimate of what might happen but in terms of specific days when things will happen or specific numbers i aposm not confident in any particular model i think it aposs hard to see out beyond a couple of weeks and i think one of the biggest factors is that it will depend on what we do as a country this isn apost preordained what the final outcome will be in terms of overall numbers it depends on our collective reaction what we do with social distancing whether or not we develop therapies over time that work our overall ability to track cases and to build public health capacity around the country that aposs going to be crucial for us to try and get control of this over time wallace well let me pick up on that doctor because the big question right now is whether president trump is going to lift his stay at guidelines on april 30th and begin urging leaders and businesses to reopen the country here aposs the president talking about that begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i aposm going to have to make a decision and i only hope to god that it aposs the right decision but i would say without question it aposs the biggest decision i aposve ever had to make end video clip wallace the president says that he aposll consult with public health experts with business leaders what aposs your recommendation inglesby i think it will be too soon to reopen the country on may 1st i think there may be parts of the country that have such good numbers and can build up such public health capacity and get diagnostic testing ability in place some perhaps in may but it seems like it may be may or june before the best places in the country the most ready places in the country are likely to have all those things in place i just think for perspective it aposs important to know that the u s has more cases than any country in the world and no country has reopened altogether in the way that i think is being considered so even when we do start to ease social distancing it will need to be very careful because if we don apost if we aposre if we aposre not careful when we ease social distancing we aposll recreate the conditions that existed back in early march we could have another peak the way that we have on this month so we aposre going to have to be really be careful about it think about keeping people at safe distances from each other whenever possible wearing cloth masks putting up physical barriers and work spaces if that aposs possible we have to think about work differently so i think it aposs going to be too soon unfortunately by the end of this month the numbers aren apost going to be anywhere close in many places in the country to do that for the whole country wallace let me pick up on that because your center for health security the center that you head is saying that when before we open and then as we open that there has to be much more testing there has to be really a tremendous amount more because there aposs very little right now of contact tracing and then for people who still have the disease that there has to be quarantining the president was asked about more testing this week take a look begin video clip trump we aposre going to see if we have it do you need it no is it a nice thing to do yes we aposre talking about 325 million people and that aposs not going to happen end video clip wallace dr inglesby the president says we aposve already conducted 2 million tests how many more when you talk about random testing how many more tests are you talking about and your center is also talking about the need for 100 000 more contact tracers inglesby so first on diagnostic testing we have done a lot of testing but the ultimate number the overall number is less important than when we have the ability to trust anyone who has symptoms that might be covid right now we can apost do that in most places in the country there aposs just not enough capacity we need to be able to have the capacity so if someone says i feel like i aposm getting a flu or pneumonia they can walk into a clinic or a hospital or a testing center and get that test that day and get the results hopefully that day so that they can be in isolation that we can identify their contacts so that number is going to differ from state to state depending on population and how they aposre organized but it aposs going to need to be a lot more than it is now because in many places in the country we can apost get testing for mild or moderate cases in terms of tracking cases and contacts that aposs the strategy that countries have had that have had most success have used to bring the numbers down so for example south korea new zealand australia iceland they aposre all using very very active case finding and contact tracing and getting people in quarantine who are exposed to covid cases and using that strategy they aposve been able to get their numbers way down we don apost have that capacity in the country and so it aposs going to take a lot of people to get that built wallace i aposve got one big question left i got a little bit more than a minute left to for you to answer it president trump is saying that he may take action this week against the world health organization and he and the head of the who dr tedros have gotten in the real war of words over the past week take a look begin video clip trump they called it wrong they called it wrong they really they missed the call dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus director general world health organization if you don apost want many more body bags then you refrain from politicizing it trump i can apost believe he is talking about politics when you look at the relationship they have to china end video clip wallace has the who mishandled the crisis do they side with china and what you think of the idea that the president seems to be raising of cutting the u s aposs contribution of 450 million a year to the who inglesby so the u s needs the world health organization to function properly it is an organization that helps the world get prepared and respond to this we aposre going to need the world to recover from covid and we aposre going to get normalcy back around the world we need the who i don apost think that they have been favoring one country over another it aposs a really difficult situation but overall i think the u s should continue to do what it aposs been doing overtime which is work very closely with the world health organization and support its work wallace dr inglesby thank you thanks for joining us today please come back sir inglesby thanks chris wallace up next businesses large and small are struggling to weather the storm billionaire businessman mark cuban joins us to discuss what it will take to restart the economy commercial break wallace the coronavirus pandemic has closed countless businesses and put millions of americans out of work earlier i sat down with billionaire entrepreneur mark cuban to discuss what kind of an economic recovery we should expect and when begin videotape wallace mark treasury secretary mnuchin said this week he thinks the economy will be back open for business in may do you think it will be that soon and how will you decide when to send your people back to work mark cuban owner nba dallas mavericks i mean it aposs semantics will it be open 24 hours a day no will we open some doors and take some baby steps yes how will i decide it aposs very simple when the scientists say it aposs safe for my employees to come back to work that aposs when i aposll feel confident enough to let them go back to work wallace the u s economy i don apost have to tell you is taking a huge hit 17 million people filing for unemployment benefits over the last three weeks goldman sachs predicts that the gdp in the second quarter instead of going up 2 percent or 3 percent is going to go down about 30 percent contrast by about a third president trump says that when we do get a recovery it aposs going to be a fast one a v shape sharp down sharp up here he is talking about that begin video clip trump i think we can get more than back to normal from an economic standpoint actually be better but more than back to normal i think we aposre going to go like a rocket ship once we get back to business there aposs a lot of pent up energy and demand end video clip wallace do you see a quick recovery or do you think it aposs going to be a little bit slower than that cuban i wish he was right but he aposs not i think it aposs going to be slower i think there aposs going to be so many different ways we have to adapt to this new abnormal people aren apost going to just venture outside they aposre not going to go to large gatherings they aposre not going to feel confident right off the bat there aposs going to be a lot of trepidation and that concern is going to lead to people holding back on spending money you know there aposs been we aposre not going to know if the virus is coming back and on top of that when it comes to hiring people back companies aren apost going to just immediately bring everybody back so there are a lot of people who were hoping they aposd go back to work but just won apost be able to and i think that aposs going to create problems wallace but you do talk about a transition and if it aposs not a quick recovery an eventual recovery and you keep talking about america 2 0 what does that mean cuban so there will be a lot of change there will be a lot of uncertainty but out of that uncertainty will come new great businesses if there aposs one thing that sets this country apart from any other country in the world it aposs the fact that we aposre a country of entrepreneurs we aposre creative we aposre innovative we like to take risks and chances to create new businesses and that aposs exactly what we aposll do and i have no doubt in my mind that in five years or 10 years we aposll look back and there will be 25 or 50 companies that started out of the pandemic of 2020 that are just amazing and world changing but that said it aposs going to take us time for all those companies to have their impact so i don apost see a v shape recovery but i have no doubt in my mind that we aposll come back and be stronger than ever but it aposs not going to happen immediately wallace all right well let aposs talk about the recovery as it comes in stages you aposre best known as being the owner of the dallas mavericks nba basketball team president trump talks about the hunger to get back to life as normal including life in people supporting and going to games take a look begin video clip trump they want to sit next to each other like normal at a football game baseball game basketball game hockey game we want to go back to life end video clip wallace but you know you were talking about people not immediately going embracing the idea of big crowds 20 000 people in an arena sitting right next to a stranger so do you think the nba returns this season how do you do that with social distancing and could you envision a situation where everybody who comes in has to have their temperature taken cuban well a couple questions there chris do i see us getting back to a season i don apost want to make any predictions but i aposm hopeful that we will but i don apost think we aposll play in front of fans i think initially we aposll play just for the t v cameras with essential personnel and players and i think that aposs a great thing because i think we need things to cheer for we need things to get excited about we want a communal experience so we can all root for our favorite teams that aposs going to be a big step and i think the nba recognizes that that aposs a responsibility we have and that we aposll undertake it as soon as it aposs safe because we won apost do anything to jeopardize the safety of our players or employees now part two to that in terms of when do we get back to that sense of normalcy where we can all crowd into a stadium or an arena once we have confidence in a medicine then i think that aposs when it happens when you know again american exceptionalism is outstanding you know we the scientists are going to come up with solutions and when they do and when we have that confidence people will go back we aposre already taking the precautions and already going through the process at the american airlines center to say ok what do we need to do in terms of sterilization sanitization repeat cleaning in terms of informing people that you know the seat that they aposre in has been cleaned you know two hours ago or three hours ago whatever it may be and so we aposll take those necessary steps so once once the science is in place and we start to feel confident then the facilities and the arenas and stadiums et cetera will take the steps to make sure that it aposs clean and then once we start going through confidence will build wallace you have also invested in about 150 small businesses as part of your work on shark tank i know that you support the 2 trillion program bailout whatever you want to call it a big chunk of which is for small businesses but i also know you think it would work better instead of the payroll protection plan where small businesses have to apply for loans if instead they just got overdraft protection how would that work cuban very simply so with your bank where you already have a checking account you would work with the banks to designate here aposs my rent here aposs my landlord that i write checks to here aposs my utilities that i write checks to here aposs what i do for payroll and for those checks they won apost bounce and the reason you do it that way is you reduce all the friction right now we aposre seeing all the friction from the banks but the distribute loans or approve loans and then distribute the ppc loans and how it aposs slowing everything down and that aposs leading to companies being laid off i mean employees being laid off and companies closing with an overdraft protection program companies could just continue as usual pay their payrolls pay their insurance pay the utilities rent et cetera and they wouldn apost have that fear that they wouldn apost be able to make those payments and so i always just felt that the overdraft protection program would work a whole lot better wallace you also say that the government should take a hard line when dealing with big corporations for instance the airlines which the president is talking to this weekend don apost let the ceos do anything to set the terms for how they aposre going to be bailed out cuban yes without question i mean look they aposre coming for money for a reason and this is taxpayer money so i aposm not saying don apost give them money but there needs to be terms and conditions that really put the taxpayer first if we aposre going to give them a loan that aposs great but let aposs ask for equity let aposs ask for equity kickers i use warren buffet as an example when he helped bailout bank of america in the early 2010 timeframe he gave them 5 billion as a loan but he also got warrants and options and other things that he then turned into a 12 billion profit we should be able to do that for american citizens and part two to that chris is you know it also can show other benefits for the airlines the government buys a lot of commercial air travel so it aposs not inconceivable that we as part of this deal we can pre pay for commercial travel and work out programs with the airlines to have federal employees travel to build confidence in the airlines again so have the government pre pay however many hundreds of millions of dollars that we typically spend with those airlines work on a sanitation program to make sure that the insides of those airlines are safe when we go to fly them have federal employees fly in those newly safe airlines and develop confidence so that that then can be ph conveyed to the general public then they aposre going to be more likely to travel that will lead to the airlines coming back sooner wallace finally you talked back in 2019 about running for president before and you finally decided not to do so and the other day you said you were reconsidering now i don apost have to tell you i suspect you know this already but the deadline for filing as an independent candidate has already passed in some states and is about to in other states so i know mark cuban likes publicity as much as the next person maybe more than the next person you aposre not really serious about this are you cuban hey ph unique circumstances you just never know chris i never would have considered it prior to a month ago but now things are changing rapidly and dramatically so there aposs different ways to get through those issues you mentioned so i aposm not saying no but it aposs not certain something that i aposm actively pursuing i aposm just keeping the door open wallace then are you saying that this is something that is serious cuban as it is today i aposd say probably not that it aposs not going to happen but again so much can change you just never know this is not something we aposve seen before this is obviously a unique set of circumstances and so i aposm just not going to say no it aposs just you just don apost know what can happen between now and november wallace mark cuban you aposre always interesting and you aposre always provocative thanks so much for sharing part of your easter weekend with us cuban great thanks for having me chris and stay safe end videotape wallace coming up the nation aposs capital emerging as one of the next potential hot spots in the coronavirus pandemic mayor muriel bowser joins us to discuss where washington d c is on the virus curve and the economic toll on the city chris wallace fox host coming up the nation aposs capital braces for a surge in coronavirus cases begin video clip mayor muriel bowser d washington d c if you consider new york city the first wave d c could be in the second wave end video clip wallace we aposll ask washington aposs mayor muriel bowser about her plan for keeping residents safe next on fox news sunday commercial break wallace while national attention has focused on the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in new york health officials are tracking the next potential cities to get hit hard including the nation aposs capital so far washington has seen more than 1 700 cases and 47 deaths and joining us now d c mayor muriel bowser mayor national public health officials keep talking about washington as the next potential hot spot and you aposve said that you worry that washington could be in the second wave of virus outbreaks so what is it that you aposre seeing that worries you mayor muriel bowser d washington d c well certainly chris we are getting prepared and we like all cities and states around the country are looking at various models to see what they tell us about when our medical surge will happen and we expect that that could happen in washington d c in june our residents are doing everything that we ask so that we can push down the number of peak cases and push out when that surge would happen in d c wallace i want to pick up on what you just said because you are working off a model that says that washington is going to hit its peak not an april as new york is now or even may but in late june why so late in washington bowser well we think that all of the interventions that we put in place very aggressively in the early part of march closing our schools shutting down our bars and restaurants closing essential businesses in washington d c has pushed out when the peak might occur and we we just know we see that in a number that there are cities who are experiencing a surge in cases and hospitalizations now and we know and we see from what we see on the ground in testing that show that our peak will come later wallace meanwhile it aposs not just a health crisis for you d c is getting hammered economically and i want to put up some numbers almost 60 000 residents have filed for unemployment claims since march 13th that aposs more than double the 27 000 who filed for unemployment in d c all of last year mayor bowser how serious is the economic situation in washington right now bowser well it aposs it aposs very serious as it is in cities and states around the country we don apost think that we aposre any different except we went into this pandemic in a very strong position chris you showed our unemployment filings for 2019 and we have exceeded that just in five weeks going into this so we went into this pandemic fiscally strong strong employment growing business space and of course growing hospitality and tourism and it was our hospitality and tourism sector that was struck first with closing our convention center shutting down mass gatherings even shutting down our cherry blossom festival so all of those things are hitting our hotels restaurants and bars and our workers very significantly so we know that how we slowly turn on the economy and we aposre looking to national experts and the cdc to tell us what things can slowly come back on so we can get people back to work wallace well let me pick up on that because as i was just discussing earlier president trump is considering and in fact is going to set up a counsel a reopening the country counsel this week is considering lifting his stay at home guidelines as early as the end of this month and beginning to reopen the economy if the president goes ahead and does that will you listen to him bowser well we know chris that the most optimistic models demonstrate the and the ones that the white house task force has pointed to repeatedly are based on keeping stay at home directive in place through the end of may so we are what we aposre looking for is a staying periods of decreasing infection sustained periods of decreasing hospitalizations and that will be a signal to us in washington that we see the containment of this virus and also that our medical system can withhold growing hospitalizations and i think that aposs going to be key not only for us in washington d c but for the entire nation but keep in mind that the most optimistic modeling points to interventions remaining in place through the end of may wallace you say the end of may as i as i pointed out the president aposs talking about maybe the end of april may 1st so you aposre saying if if he starts saying we aposre going to start relaxing those guidelines which aren apost an order you aposre the mayor you aposre in charge in d c are you saying you won apost necessarily follow his direction bowser i aposm saying that we aposre going to follow what the data on the ground tells us as we have her directly the president hasn apost issued any stay at home orders for any jurisdiction in the united states of america and we are looking to our own experience in washington d c are levels of infection decreasing are hospitalizations decreasing do we see the number of lives lost in our city decreasing and we know when we see sustained level of those numbers just for for for a few examples then that is a trigger to us to tell us how we can start to get our economy going again but we aposre also looking to examples around the world we know we can apost just flip a switch and have everything go back to normal because if we do that we could suffer a rebound and lose all of the gains that we aposve made by strict social distancing in our town wallace finally mayor i don apost have to tell you african americans are getting hit much harder by this virus than any other group i want to put up some some numbers a cdc study found that 33 percent of hospitalized patients in this study were black although they made up only 18 percent of the population in those areas mayor bowser how do you explain that bowser well we know chris and this virus has put a spotlight on the disproportionate number of african americans who suffer from chronic disease and it aposs also put a spotlight on the health disparities that have plagued african americans for generations and you can trace slavery racism jim crow rules and laws in our country you can also look to how many african americans are living in substandard housing conditions which we know impact the levels of asthma but diabetes and heart disease this virus is violently attacking so while this is not new during the covid 19 response it certainly calls for national and local actions that are going to change the trajectory for african americans health outcomes in our nation wallace mayor bowser thank you bowser thank you wallace thanks for your time during these busy days and we aposll be watching as you work to protect our nation aposs capital thanks mayor bowser thank you chris thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the 2020 race now that bernie sanders has suspended his campaign and joe biden is the presumptive democratic nominee commercial break begin video clip sen bernie sanders i vt former presidential candidate we have never been just a campaign we are a grassroots multiracial multigenerational movement joe biden d presidential candidate let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by senator sanders i hear you i know what aposs at stake i know what we have to do end video clip wallace bernie sanders addressing his supporters after suspending his campaign for president and presumptive democratic nominee joe biden reaching out to those voters and it aposs time now for our sunday group former white house press secretary ari fleischer fox news correspondent gillian turner and fox news political analyst juan williams ari how does biden pull this off move far enough to the left to win not just the backing but the strong backing of of sanders supporters while not moving so far to the left that he turns off the independents and moderates he aposs going to need in the fall to beat donald trump ari fleischer former white house press secretary chris the first thing you have to recognize is the democratic party as a whole has moved sharply to the left there was there was a gallup poll that came out a couple months ago that said 24 percent of the democrats consider themselves liberal when bill clinton was president today 51 percent consider themselves liberal so the party aposs shifted but what aposs happened to joe biden is he aposs renounced previous positions he used to hold on abortion for example the overwhelming bipartisan position was opposition to federally funded abortions he aposs now opposed to that he wants federally funded abortions he aposs changed his position on from obamacare where he was against government controlled healthcare the public option now he aposs for it he aposs for a green new deal he aposs for free college even if you don apost have and you don apost have to pay for it a host of issues he aposs shifted left because the democratic party has shifted left wallace so juan you just heard ari make what will undoubtedly be the trump white house case which is it aposs too late that biden is already too far to the left do you agree with that and how do you see him playing this where yes he reaches out to the biden the sanders supporters because there still are some significant differences between biden and sanders juan williams fox news political analyst yes wallace on medicare for all and the green new deal how does he win them over but still not be seen as a socialist at least in a credible sense as the president will try to portray him williams well i think we aposre in a chris we aposre in a politically difficult moment for joe biden in that you know usually when a candidate has the nomination in hand that candidate looking towards the general election moves to the center not to the left or the right but in this case i think you see biden saying i aposve got to move to the left somewhat to build a bridge to the bernie bros to the people who were alienated in 2016 by hillary clinton think the establishment democrats that rigged the whole election against them and i think what he aposs doing is by reaching out lowering the age of eligibility for medicare to 60 and making college education more affordable i don apost think that thanks to bernie sanders those are any longer seen as socialist radical left wing ideas at a time of rising income inequality in the country those those ideas are pretty mainstream wallace right williams and politically i don apost think that the president will be able to say this is socialism most people will say it aposs pragmatic wallace then there is barack obama aposs continued silence about his own former vice president and president trump had some fun with that this week take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states it does amaze me that president obama hasn apost supported sleepy joe it just hasn apost happened when aposs it going to happen when is it going to happen when isn apost he he knows something that you don apost know end video clip wallace gillian what do you think is taking barack obama so long to come out in endorsing and in strong support for his former vice president gillian turner fox news correspondent well what we do know is that his team for the last year and a half has said he aposs planning to stay out of the campaign fray because he feels that aposs with the appropriate role for a former president is and he aposs going to get in once the democrats have coalesced around a single candidate so i would anticipate based on that that any day now he aposs going to throw his full weight behind biden and when he does it aposs going to be a huge boost for biden i think president obama aposs ratings among the democrats are still astronomically high somewhere in the 90th percentile and i think those very same americans are super eager to hear from president obama on the coronavirus pandemic something else he aposs not really spoken out about a lot so everyone aposs going to be tuned in wherever he does this whether it aposs online or in front of crowds touting vice president biden i would say chris quickly that the big risk for biden with support from president obama is that he aposs likely to outshine him on the trail he aposs a great orator and i think that aposs something that biden is probably thinking long and hard about you know if he wants to be following at all after you know president obama introduces him at rally after rally if we have rallies wallace gillian i want to stay with you and ask you about this really stunning report in the new york times this morning i talked about with dr dr inglesby that top health officials within the administrations were warning the president from mid january on about the real threat of this pandemic and that it took weeks in a sense really more than a month for president trump to respond how damaging do you think that is to the president turner well president trump and the rest of the white house comms team have been pushing back on that report really hard the last two days whoever ends up being right or wrong in this scenario i think the one thing chris that everybody all americans can really agree on is the role that china has played china aposs government as separate and distinct from the chinese people china aposs communist party the government we now know thanks to leaked u s intelligence reports and other studies that they spent weeks and months under reporting the real case numbers in wuhan during the early days of the outbreak i talk i spoke to peter navarro the trade advisor last week he said he thinks one of the reasons china hedged and delayed and delayed reporting for so long was because they were trying to hoard ppe and medical equipment so i think the real shoe that aposs still to drop here is the american people really learning in depth about the role that china aposs government played in covering this up as opposed to i think we can give our own government the benefit of the doubt that they didn apost willfully ignore warnings that hundreds of thousands of americans were going to die if it turns out to be an intelligence oversight or bad guidance given to the president we aposll have to grapple with that in the fallout from that over the coming years for sure wallace juan i we aposre running out of time so i need a quick answer for you on this your reaction to the new york times report today about the president getting all these reports including at least two in january from his secretary of health and human services secretary azar williams well i don apost think it aposs any great revelation that we had a slow response as a country i aposll leave all the finger pointing and backbiting to others as gillian was just saying i mean they aposll we aposll have reviews but and but you know the key here is moving forward and i think moving forward i think we have to look at how the president aposs conducting himself are we getting the tests right now quickly are we moving towards understanding how people who have had the virus can act possibly on an immune basis to help us all of that i don apost think these briefings the president aposs been holding are any help even the conservative wall street journal editorial page has said he aposs turned it into the trump show so i think we need trust credibility like dr inglesby at the top of this show chris we need those voices dr fauci less so than the president attacking the who and the reporters wallace yes i want to pick up on the briefings with you as a communications professional ari because the president did get high marks for his white house briefings at least originally but in more recent days certainly this week you saw him getting into fights with governors he did not think were sufficiently appreciative or reporters here aposs one case where he was asked about deputy inspector general who had criticized the administration take a look begin video clip question you asked him ph when she was appointed donald trump president of the united states now look look question i told you when she was appointed by your administration trump you aposre a third rate reporter and what you just said is a disgrace end video clip wallace ari if you were advising the president what would you tell him about these briefings fleischer well i aposve been saying this for weeks chris i think the briefings are extremely helpful it is proper and wise for the president of the united states in a crisis to be regularly accessible but the briefings should be no longer than 30 minutes apos worth of q as the longer it goes on like that reporters run out of good questions and it just becomes the old war of one truculent side against another i also think the president needs to remind everybody we aposre one country and these little battles don apost really help the best thing that helps is unity and i wish that was the tone the president was setting it aposs not his style wallace ari fleischer panel thank you all see you next sunday happy easter and happy passover up next our power players on this weekend of religious holidays the
