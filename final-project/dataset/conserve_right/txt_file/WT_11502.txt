apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing china s ruling communists opened a pivotal congress to initiate a power handover to new leaders thursday with a nod to their revolutionary past and a broad promise of cleaner government while keeping off stage the main event the bargaining over seats in the new leadership all the main players were arrayed on the stage in the great hall of the people president hu jintao his successor xi jinping and a collection of retired party insiders a golden hammer and sickle the communist party s symbol hung on the back wall yet in a nearly two hour opening ceremony scant mention was made of the transition or that in a week hu will step down as party chief in favor of xi in what would be only the second orderly transfer of power in 63 years of communist rule the congress is writ small the state of chinese politics today it s a largely ceremonial gathering of 2 200 plus delegates who meet while the real deal making is done behind the scenes by the true power holders top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 the centerpiece event of the opening of the weeklong congress a 90 minute speech by hu served politics allowing him to define his legacy after a decade in office while marshaling his clout to install his allies in the collective leadership that xi will head an important thing for him is to make sure that there s no critical no negative summary judgment of the past 10 years said ding xueliang a chinese politics expert at hong kong university of science and technology still ding said 90 percent of the effort is on putting your people in place the party s public silence on a leadership transition that everyone knows is taking place and that politically minded chinese have been talking about has deepened a palpable sense of public unease many chinese feel the country is at a turning point in need of new ideas to deal with a slowing economy growing piles of debt and rising public demands for more accountable transparent government if not democracy in signs of the public disquiet at least four ethnic tibetans in western china set themselves on fire on the eve of the congress in protests against chinese rule of tibetan areas according to overseas tibet support groups and the tibetan government in exile in india at dawn in tiananmen square next to the congress venue a woman in her 30s threw pieces of torn paper into the air and shouted bandits and robbers a curse often leveled at corrupt local officials she was taken away by the security forces which have smothered all of beijing for the congress in his speech hu cited many of the challenges china faces a rich poor gap environmentally ruinous growth and imbalanced development between prosperous cities and a struggling countryside yet he offered little fresh thinking to address them and said restoring a relatively high growth would be the best way to deal with public expectations only on tackling rampant corruption did hu sound the alarm he called on party members to be ethical and rein in their family members whose often showy displays of wealth have stoked public anger nobody is above the law hu said to the applause of the 2 309 delegates and invited guests with xi and other party notables on the dais behind him he later said if we fail to handle this issue well it could prove fatal to the party and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state always an occasion for divisive bargaining the leadership transition has been made more fraught by scandals that have fueled already high public cynicism that chinese leaders are more concerned with power and wealth than government in recent months one top leader bo xilai has been purged after his wife murdered a british businessman a top aide to hu was sidelined after his son crashed a ferrari he shouldn t have been able to afford and foreign media reported that relatives of xi and outgoing premier wen jiabao had traded on their proximity to power to amass vast fortunes public image aside the scandals have especially weakened hu on whose watch they occurred in the power broking over the next leadership in recent decades the leadership line ups have sought to balance different factions within the party who has prevailed won t be apparent until next thursday a day after the congress when the members of the politburo standing committee appear before the media on stage with hu appeared one of his nemeses his predecessor jiang zemin who has supported xi and is angling to fill many of the seats in the leadership with his allies nearby dressed in a mao jacket sat 95 year old song ping a veteran of the revolution and party insider who was hu s earliest political mentor hu drew the line on political reform a catchphrase for everything from greater transparency to democracy even though retired party members media commentators and government think tanks have in recent months called it an urgent need hu s signature policy a grab bag of ideas meant to promote more balanced growth and stronger party rule that goes under the clunky phrase the scientific outlook on development has already been adopted in the party constitution hu s report to the congress called it a powerful theoretical weapon to guide the party even though this congress is about rejuvenation passing the power to the young what we see is the opposite said willy lam of chinese
