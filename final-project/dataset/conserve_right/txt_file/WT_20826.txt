apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap president donald trump launched a furious and highly personal twitter attack friday against the federal reserve and chairman jerome powell fuming that the fed once more did nothing and wondering who is our bigger enemy powell or china s leader the outburst came after powell speaking to central bankers in jackson hole wyoming gave vague assurances that the fed will act as appropriate to sustain the nation s economic expansion while the phrasing was widely seen as meaning interest rate cuts he offered no hint of whether or how many reductions might be coming the rest of the year powell had barely finished speaking before trump escalated his criticism of the fed which he has repeatedly accused of keeping rates too high for months the president has ridiculed powell the man he picked to lead the fed top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed as usual the fed did nothing trump tweeted adding we have a very strong dollar and a very weak fed he went further by saying my only question is who is our bigger enemy jay powel sic or chairman xi a reference to china s president xi jinping trump later corrected the name spelling asked by reporters late friday if he wanted powell to resign trump responded let me put it this way if he did i wouldn t stop him powell has said he has no intention of resigning before his four year term is up while the enemy remark appeared to elevate trump s attacks on the fed to a new level fed officials meeting in jackson hole sought to play down the comment fed vice chairman richard clarida said he had been too busy attending the conference to even look at trump s tweets he said the fed planned to keep doing its job of pursuing low unemployment and stable prices in spite of trump s criticism this is an institution created by the congress more than 100 years ago clarida said in a cnbc interview we have a very clear assignment from the congress we are just focusing on doing our job many private economists have expressed growing alarm about trump s criticism of the fed as an intrusion on its independence and a threat to its credibility david jones a leading historian of the federal reserve said the enemy remark set an unfortunate precedent this challenges something that has been sacred in the history of the world s most successful central bank said jones an economist and author of four books on the fed the central banks that have been successful are those which are independent of political pressures and were free to make the appropriate monetary policy powell s speech came on a day of fast moving events in the financial world and a sharp escalation in the trade dispute with china that threatens to tip a weakening global economy into recession china announced a new round of tariffs on u s products earlier in the day and trump responded with higher duties on certain chinese goods he also declared on twitter that he had hereby ordered
