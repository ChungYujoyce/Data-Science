apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic a delegation of high level taiwanese diplomats said thursday that many of their own people oppose a major trade deal with mainland china and also made a rare public acknowledgment of rising domestic resistance to u s pressure to expand a radar system for detecting long range missile threats from beijing the diplomats suggested that u s missile defense interests might be more palatable to the taiwanese public if washington were more willing to bolster more traditional aspects of taiwan s national defense such as an expanded sale of american made fighter jets and submarines at the same time the officials meeting with editors and reporters at the washington times criticized china s record on human rights and individual freedoms twenty five years after the bloody crackdown at tiananmen square they said beijing should look to taiwan as a model for democratic and social change see also rising red tide china s navy air force rapidly expanding its size and reach like president bush once said taiwan is the beacon of democracy in the region said dale wen chieh jieh who heads the department of policy planning within the taiwanese ministry of foreign affairs mr jieh said that despite an unprecedented pursuit of closer relations between taiwan and china over the past five years taiwanese president ma ying jeou has made a statement every year in support of democracy in mainland china democracy is a founding value of taiwan and of course we would like to see this political system or political philosophy really enter into mainland china he said even though we want to improve relations across the taiwan strait our stance on democratic values will not be compromised tense relations between taiwan and china have eased in recent years and mr ma has called for a meeting with chinese president xi jinping but taiwan s place in the obama administration s strategic calculus has become a subject of debate u s officials promoting the obama administration s asia pivot rarely mention taiwan instead they appear more focused on enhancing relations with other allies on china s periphery such as south korea and japan while pursuing ties with former adversaries such as vietnam another taiwanese official who joined mr jieh at the times suggested that the 35th anniversary in april of the taiwan relations act long the cornerstone of u s taiwanese ties was bittersweet we have been very appreciative of the u s continued support of taiwan s security and economic survival but i have to say that it s my personal experience in washington that taiwan the name has been less frequently mentioned at important meetings said kwei bo huang secretary general of taiwan s association of foreign relations a government backed outfit created last year to help promote ties between the island and its partners around the world taiwan is still a very vital place in east asia and in the obama administration s rebalancing strategy said mr huang even if it hasn t been included officially in that big project taiwan is no less than japan and south korea as an important u s ally he said long range missile defense the taiwanese officials raised concern about u s pressure to expand a missile defense system on the island that could detect long range missile threats from china rep j randy forbes virginia republican and chairman of the house armed services seapower and projection forces subcommittee introduced language to pave the way for such a system in the committee s fiscal 2015 defense authorization bill the forbes proposal calls for the pentagon s missile defense agency to explore the costs and benefits of merging a taiwanese early warning radar which has the ability to peer deep into china with the u s military s own missile defense and sensor systems mr huang said two to four long range early warning radars have been built along taiwan s western coastline but some in taiwan are resisting the idea of expanding the system president ma has been enduring so much domestic pressure questioning why do you need these long range radar towers detecting the long range missiles of mainland china that won t target taiwan but target some other countries he said despite the opposition mr huang said the ma government has been very affirmative in helping the u s set up these radar towers because the ma administration does believe that setting up these long range radar towers not only helps the u s but also helps taiwan it s not my personal criticism but a lot of people s criticism in taiwan is that hey why do we taiwan need such big radar towers that can detect the inner land of mainland china mr huang said we don t need that actually that s some people s argument mr huang said taiwan wants u s military support that would protect taiwan from external threats including from china regardless of u s concerns about chinese long range missile potential toward targets beyond the 115 mile wide taiwan strait it s very important for the united states to show its substantial support for taiwan he said if the u s continues to sell pre warning radars to taiwan we need something we can see for example something in the air f 22 f 35 or submarines that enhance our national defense capability trade deal with china the taiwanese officials praised the obama administration for not interfering with the ma government s pursuit of a potentially historic agreement with china aimed at reducing tariffs and commercial barriers however they stressed that taiwan also wants to be considered for membership in the trans pacific partnership a massive pacific rim free trade proposal many foreign policy analysts say the obama administration is pushing asian trading partners on china s periphery to sign on as a way to undercut beijing s growing economic clout in the region although it remains to be seen how the separate trade deals will proceed and coexist the taiwanese officials acknowledged that there is resistance within taiwan to the ma government s pursuit of a deal directly with beijing we do face some resistance from certain sectors of our society said mr jieh we need to have more understanding and support from our grass roots people about the benefits of signing a trade agreement we ve been in a not cordial relationship with china for decades he said so i think the challenges facing the passage of this agreement on the surface are mainly internal but that won t change the determination of the government because from the government point of view it will bring tremendous economic interest to taiwan he said china is in talks with japan and south korea toward similar trade deals and that taiwanese economists have determined that taiwan will face tremendous economic loss unless it reaches a deal of its own with beijing total economic loss to taiwan mr jieh said will be over 16 4 billion which is totall
