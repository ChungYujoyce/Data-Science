tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn his rhetoric is as fiery his twitter feed is as divisive and his style is as disruptive as those of the american original but on substance brazilian president jair bolsonaro the trump of the tropics so far has delivered the one thing no one expected more of the same in trying to tackle the country s deep seated problems swept into office last year on promises to rid brazil of crime and corruption and revive south america s largest economy the nationalist president made global headlines in recent days by rejecting international concern about raging amazon wildfires and getting into a public feud with french president emmanuel macron whose wife mr bolsonaro seemed to insult on social media since taking office jan 1 he has commemorated a 1964 military coup mused about invading neighboring venezuela warned that argentina s presidential election would cause a wave of refugees conditioned accepting 20 million in aid from the group of seven nations on getting a personal apology from mr macron and told chancellor angela merkel who had frozen aid over the amazon forest fires and the brazilian government s pro development policies to take your dough and reforest germany top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century like mr trump mr bolsonaro is given to politically incorrect statements and maximalist demands that appall his opponents but energize his political base on tuesday he complained about the country s policies to protect indigenous populations and limit economic development arguing that protected tribes don t speak our language but they have managed to get 14 of our national territory at the same time mr bolsonaro s government has yet to make a dent in problems that bedeviled his more conventional predecessors pension reform remains stalled in congress the president s hometown rio de janeiro has a spike in homicides and overall violent crime the economy is teetering on the edge of a recession and mr bolsonaro s hesitation to veto an abuse of authority law which could stifle investigations has called into question his commitment to fight corruption he continues to govern by speaker said clovis saint clair editor of the jornal do brasil it s not entirely surprising but it is worrying and disappointing that he continues to behave as though he were campaigning brazilians patience is wearing thin said the author of one of the few book length profiles of mr bolsonaro especially among those who backed the former army captain as a way to keep the long ruling leftist workers party pt from returning to power polls indicate that his base is still behind him mr saint clair said but the part of the electorate that voted for him merely in opposition to what it perceived as the threat of the pt is realizing that maybe he wasn t the best choice so the president s popularity has tumbled one supporter whom the president can still count on is president trump who defended his fellow populist on twitter on tuesday over his handling of the amazon fires i have gotten to know mr bolsonaro well in our dealings with brazil mr trump tweeted he is working very hard on the amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of brazil not easy he and his country have the full and complete support of the usa from carte blanche to obstructionist perhaps the biggest reason for the early disenchantment is that mr bolsonaro has not come through on his promise to clean up brazilian government after many in the political elite were implicated in the multiyear billion dollar car wash graft investigation it was the discrediting of much of brazil s establishment that opened the lane for mr bolsonaro s outsider campaign last year especially in recent times he has truly turned out to be an obstructionist in the fight against corruption said paulo roberto de almeida who until march led the brazilian foreign ministry s ipri think tank the president s nomination of his son eduardo to serve as ambassador in washington and the maneuvering to shield his son flavio a rio senator who is facing an investigation over alleged money laundering brought accusations of nepotism and favoritism mr bolsonaro also is increasingly curtailing justice minister sergio moro famous as an anti corruption crusader and the public face of the car wash investigation who analysts believe may sooner or later turn into a political threat to the president what we saw in the past few weeks was a cutback to sergio moro s famous carte blanche mr de almeida said there has been a series of steps to take back the commitments made by the president with regard to the fight against corruption and the autonomy sergio moro wanted brazilians mr de almeida added are now closely watching what mr bolsonaro will do about abuse of authority legislation passed by congress critics say the legislation is designed to intimidate judges and prosecutors in corruption cases though attorney general raquel dodge has recommended that the president veto the bill at least in part mr bolsonaro has yet to make a final decision on whether to sign it into law recession fears on economic terrain too the government has struggled to change the old narrative even after nine months in office mr bolsonaro s ambitious pension reform plan seen by many as key to rekindling an underperforming brazilian economy that for years has been stuck in crisis still has cleared only the lower house of congress for the medium to long term health of the brazilian economy the pension reform is extremely important said thomas o keefe who counsels investors as head of the new york based mercosur consulting group but brazilians who were hoping for a fast turnaround are disappointed mr de almeida said brazil did not have a jump in investments to recover its economy which is somewhere between a recession and a depression the former diplomat said the president s contradictory statements and his difficulties in congress have markedly lowered expectations for investments many other promises of what was branded a pro market administration including tax reform and the privatization of state owned businesses remain entirely unfulfilled mr de almeida said there s not a very clear definition of how brazil is going to work from now on he said although mr bolsonaro has established close personal ties to mr trump the u s president s ongoing trade dispute with china may only make matters worse for brasilia brazil s no 1 export market is china mr o keefe said the chinese economy continues to slow down that s going to have a very negative impact brash style china is not the only concern on the international scene where mr bolsonaro s brash style and policy swerves appear to have jeopardized a free trade agreement between the four nation mercosur trade bloc and the european union a comment on social media that unfavorably compared the french first lady s looks with those of mr bolsonaro s wife last week prompted mr macron to say he hoped brazilians would quickly have a president who is up to the job mr bolsonaro dismissed the french leader s suggestion that massive forest fires in the amazon must be dealt with as an international crisis as reminiscent of a colonial mindset the great grandson of italian immigrants mr bolsonaro has long portrayed himself as a staunch defender of brazilian sovereignty and played up his relationships with mr trump and right wing leaders such as israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and italian populist matteo salvini mr bolsonaro s fierce response to international concern over the environmental health of the vast amazon region springs from a belief that such a concern represents a violation of brazil s sovereign rights but especially his attempt to overcome traditional tensions with the united states have been met with doubts in the local foreign policy establishment mr de almeida said it s clear that this rapprochement lacks real foundations he said it has an ideological foundation the fight against the left against globalism absolutely surrealist things nobody takes seriously even in the rough and tumble world of latin american politics mr bolsonaro s overt attacks on alberto fernandez the front runner in argentina s oct 27 presidential election appeared to cross a line a president of brazil had never meddled this directly in the domestic politics of argentina said gustavo cardozo of the argentine center of international studies bolsonaro even suggested many argentines could emigrate to brazil in case of a fernandez win and cause a problem in border regions although his rhetoric may be rambling and his personality virulent mr bolsonaro is on the right path when he tries to turn the page from the protectionist leftist ideology that hampered the continent under the workers party and its regional allies mr cardozo said at home though blaming his predecessors will no longer let the 64 year old make up lost ground much less get him reelected in 2022 analysts predicted should mr trump be ousted in the 2020 u s vote mr bolsonaro will also lose perhaps his most powerful and useful ally on the international scene his strategy is to always keep the focus on the endgame of the political fight to keep his base motivated as trump does in the united states mr de almeida said he turned out to be a mediocre leader without the capacity to clearly express policy or government project who continues to campaign after more than half a decade of what many view as an ever deepening political economic and social crisis brazilians may simply be ready to move on and not ready to embrace mr bolsonaro s desire to refight the battles of the past the problem is that he is looking backward his adversaries are the pt the left which dominated brazil from 2003 to 2016 mr de alme
