seattle san francisco and los angeles that would spread radiation as far east as chicago in general after a nuclear missile strikes a city the radioactive dust produced by 20 warheads will be spread by the wind forming a contaminated area for thousands of kilometers the global times report said at the time based on the actual level of china s one million tons tnt equivalent small nuclear warhead
