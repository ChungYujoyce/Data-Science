include such things as carbon fiber used in composites for radar evading stealth systems bearings machine tools x ray machines high performance computers rugged telecommunications equipment phased array antennas avionics aircraft turbine engines and some underwater equipment the rules were coordinated with the pentagon but appear biased in favor of the bush administration s pro business policies toward china former national counterintelligence executive michelle van cleave stated in a recent report for the national defense university that in the past decade china remained among the top intelligence threats china maintains some of the world s most effective intelligence services including the ministry of state security and the people s liberation army military intelligence and technical intelligence departments with global reach she stated collection of scientific and technological information has been one of the chinese intelligence services top priorities in recent years china has successfully used espionage to acquire a range of sensitive u s technologies including design information on all of the most advanced u s nuclear weapons missile design and guidance technology electromagnetic weapons r d and space launch capabilities the relaxing of export controls followed release of the pentagon s latest annual report to congress on the chinese military that warns china is buying and stealing large amounts of u s military technology for its arms buildup china continues a systematic effort to obtain from abroad through legal and illegal commercial transactions dual use and military technologies the report said many dual use technologies such as software integrated circuits computers electronics semiconductors telecommunications and information security systems are vital for the pla s transformation into an information based networkcentric force the report noted several illegal activities by china in seeking missile imaging semiconductor and

is the leading threat to u s technology defector wars the decades long debate at the cia over whether soviet kgb defector yuri nosenko was a true defector or a plant dispatched by moscow to fool the agency resurfaced this week the agency abruptly canceled a planned talk by former cia soviet operations officer tennent h pete bagley on his new book spy wars moles mysteries and deadly games a hike through the so called wilderness of mirrors that is central to the spy business intelligence sources said a network of current and former cia officers opposed to mr bagley s views was behind the cancellation mr bagley also had his scheduled talk at the international spy museum canceled this week it was expected to have been a contentious debate on mr nosenko who defected in 1964 was imprisoned by the cia as a suspected false defector and was eventually freed and declared legitimate in 1969 he now lives under an assumed name in northern virginia mr bagley said in an interview that he believes his talk at the cia was canceled because agency officials objected to his views on mr nosenko it s the nosenko case he said i give very powerful convincing reasons to believe that nosenko was a plant the suspicions were confirmed by post cold war discussions with former kgb officers he said my book does not question whether or not nosenko was a genuine defector he said the point is that there were penetrations of u s intelligence and cia including the breaking of american ciphers a cia spokesman said mr bagley s talk was not canceled due to his message but because of questions regarding prepublication review of the book intelligence officers are routinely exposed to a range of views on complex topics that s a key part of the job the spokesman said one source of opposition to mr bagley and his book is former fbi counterspy david major who recently called the book dangerous and disruptive because it presents the myth that the kgb would dispatch an agent as a false defector to spread disinformation retired maj gen oleg kalugin who works with mr major at the counterintelligence centre also dismissed mr bagley s book as absurd and misleading meanwhile a senior counterintelligence official said mr bagley s book is an excellent primer on the topic of spies mr nosenko s bona fides were doubted after an earlier kgb defector anatoly golitsyn convinced the late cia master counterspy james jesus angleton that the kgb had formed an ultra secret strategic disinformation program to deceive the united states which included dispatching false defectors mr bagley said he believes mr nosenko was sent to cover up russian intelligence penetrations of u s electronic spying and codes and to dissuade the cia that moscow had no role in the assassination of president kennedy lee harvey oswald a former marine had defected to the soviet union before returning and killing kennedy north korea pact a senior bush administration official said the shutdown of north korea

north korea shuts and seals the yongbyon facility chinese in hawaii a defense department official is upset that the u s pacific command recently hosted a meeting in hawaii of representatives of u s and foreign special operations forces that included commands from china s special operations forces we shouldn t be inviting the chinese to these meetings said a special forces operator opposed to the meeting a former special operations officer was also upset that the pentagon s special operations and low intensity conflict office is promoting chinese participation in such meetings since the chinese military continues to view the united states as its main enemy and is using such forums to gain information that could be used against the united states in a future conflict c bill gertz
