avenatti responded that he was working them and threatening litigation prosecutors said but he did not tell daniels he had already received the money daniels began publicly raising concerns about avenatti s conduct in november in a statement she said avenatti had launched a fundraising effort to raise money for her legal case without telling her she also said he had filed a defamation lawsuit against trump on her behalf against her wishes for months i ve asked michael avenatti to give me accounting information about the fund my supporters so generously donated to for my safety and legal defense he has repeatedly ignored those requests she said days ago i demanded again repeatedly that he tell me how the money was being spent and how much was left instead of answering me without my permission or even my knowledge michael launched another crowdfunding campaign to raise money on my behalf i learned about it on twitter at the time avenatti responded that he was still daniels biggest champion he said that under his retention agreement she had agreed to pay him just 100 for his services and he was entitled to keep all the money he raised for her legal defense to defray what he said were substantial costs of her case the defamation case initiated by avenatti against trump backfired with a judge ordering her to pay the president s legal bills when avenatti was first charged with defrauding other clients and extorting nike in march daniels said she was saddened but not shocked she added on twitter that she had fired avenatti a month earlier after discovering that he had dealt with me extremely dishonest
