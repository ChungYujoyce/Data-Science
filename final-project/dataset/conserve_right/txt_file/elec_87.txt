source ap photo paul sancya i ll say it again there is not a single candidate currently running that will beat donald trump in 2020 not one unless someone steps up his or her game big league donald trump is going to win a second term as president of the united states now that being said after tonight s cnn democratic debate there had to have been a winner i thought sen bernie sanders was one of them he needed to be feisty aggressive and willing to attack he did that but he will need to destroy his best pal sen elizabeth warren to start a foundation from which he can reach the top of the 2020 field it remains to be seen whether he s willing to engage in that sort of campaign yet that brings us to marianne williamson she puts the side in the outsider we re in the era of the political outsider and with williamson she s way out there but she also had the better moments of tonight s debate clinching some of the biggest applause lines spikes in google searches and appeared to have what the others don t something new to offer don t get me wrong there s no way i m voting for her but her brand of politics shouldn t be dismissed she s also feisty and seemed to inject some energy into that cnn audience warren sanders klobuchar buttigieg ryan bullock hickenlooper and delaney all had the same politician packaged lines which came off as rather stale there s no life with this crop none and once again the field showed that they re nuts we discussed nuclear weapons policy which proved why the gop is trusted more on national security issues health care for illegals open borders gun control and whether or not we ll destroy private health insurance for millions of americans now or later the public option an aspect of the original obamacare legislation that was axed because it was viewed as a poison pill was discussed as well all of these are losing issues so whoever is the nominee especially someone who is viewed as being able to win back blue collar democrats cough biden cough this agenda will not do that if it s biden in 2020 he ll be viewed as a democrat with a working class background promoting an agenda that mocks denigrates and targets those with working class backgrounds everyone in america who is marianne williamson and why is she winning this debate everyone in montana who is this guy that claims to be our governor pic twitter com x0aydrmf8h how many new

this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country then i m afraid that the democrats are going to see some very dark days pic twitter com krlwqdovck williamson spoke for less than 10 minutes but the fact that she is unique different and appears to see this election in a very very different light perhaps at the gop s peril makes her stand out and for the better she will qualify for the fall slate of debates and while she may be a bit off i think she actually did better in this debate than the previous one right now i m not so sure what s going on is it that williamson who has peddled anti vaxxer points is genuine and has a certain quality that could make her a dark horse in the 2020 election or does she seem that way because the democratic party has devolved into outright insanity either way the apparent anti vaxxer is the one who spoke arguably more sense than most on the stage because
