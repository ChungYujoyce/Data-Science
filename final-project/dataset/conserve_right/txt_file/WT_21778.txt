banking violations in an attempt to secure a senior position in a presidential administration his attempt at petitioning for political favors was unsuccessful in more ways than one he didn t get the job he wanted and he compromised the one he had sweeney added if convicted he could face up to 30 years in prison manafort lobbied trump s son in law jared kushner to consider calk for secretary of the army according to emails from the weeks leading up to the 2016 election shown to jurors at manafort s tax evasion and bank fraud trial last year prosecutors said while manafort s loans were pending approval calk gave manafort a ranked list of government positions he wanted starting with secretary of the treasury followed by deputy secretary of the treasury secretary of commerce and secretary of defense as well as 19 ambassadorships similarly ranked and starting with the united kingdom france germany and italy according to trial evidence manafort passed along calk s resume to

the trump white house he also said calk was strong in defense issues management and finance kushner responded on it calk was formally interviewed for the position of under secretary of the army in early january 2017 at the presidential transition team s trump tower offices prosecutors noted but calk never got an administration post though he did approve manafort s loans manafort received a 9 5 million cash out refinance from calk s bank on november 2016 and an additional 6 5 million construction loan on a manafort property in new york in january 2017 prosecutors said calk began in july 2016 to exploit his position as head of the bank and its holding company knowing manafort urgently needed loans to avoid foreclosure proceedings on multiple properties he and his family owned calk himself was not summoned by federal prosecutors to testify in manafort s case instead executives who worked under calk at the federal savings bank testified he began green lighting more than 16 million in loans after he expressed interest in joining the cabinet if trump won the 2016 election testifying under an immunity agreement james brennan who was a vice president of the bank at the time said calk overruled bank executives who rejected manafort s loan for inconsistencies the loan closed because mr calk wanted it to close brennan said the federal jury was unable to reach a verdict on the bank fraud charge related to calk but manafort was convicted on eight other counts in the case manafort later acknowledged guilt in all the bank related charges as part of a deal with the special counsel s
