tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap the intensity of president donald trump s hardline approach to immigration hasn t just pushed the republican party rightward it s also moving democrats in ways that are profoundly transforming the immigration debate gone are hopes for a big bipartisan immigration overhaul once envisioned in congress with dire conditions taking hold at the border and deportations stoking fear in immigrant communities groups on the left are no longer willing to engage in the trade offs that had long been cornerstones to any deal that s pushing the 2020 democratic presidential candidates to increasingly say they ll rely on executive action to undo trump s policies and revamp the system that lawmakers have been unable to fix the brutality of this administration has pushed this conversation to happen said cristina jimenez executive director of united we dream action top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties the group formed around protecting young immigrants known as dreamers from deportation but now sees that issue as a starting point or floor in the debate as the nation confronts harsh images from the border including the deaths of migrant children and adults in federal custody the world is bearing witness jimenez said you re seeing the pressure of this moment is pushing the conversation at their first televised debate the democratic presidential candidates gave voice to the enormous shift under way talk of reviving comprehensive immigration reform was largely absent replaced by calls for unilateral action day one we take out our executive order pen and we rescind every damn thing on this issue that trump has done said vermont sen bernie sanders california sen kamala harris said she would immediately use executive action as president to protect young immigrants by preserving the obama era deferred action for childhood arrivals program and by extending those deportation protections to parents and military veterans massachusetts sen elizabeth warren and former housing secretary julian castro want to do away with the law that makes illegal entry into the united states a criminal rather than civil offense and sen cory booker announced a plan tuesday to use his presidential powers to orient the department of homeland security away from immigration raids on schools or churches and end trump s travel ban to the u s by residents of certain majority muslim nations longtime immigration advocate frank sharry said the urgency of the situation and the gop s embrace of trump s priorities is propelling democrats in a new direction do we think comprehensive immigration reform would pass in 2021 it s kind of hard to imagine he said for more than a decade congress has tried to broker an immigration compromise by marrying two different but related concepts a pathway to citizenship for some of the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally and beefed up border security and enforcement to prevent a wave of new arrivals the pairing was central to a 2007 effort from john mccain and ted kennedy the former senate lions and to a sprawling 2013 bill that was approved overwhelmingly in the senate only to be ignored by john boehner s gop controlled house but that calculus changed under trump he entered the campaign in 2016 decrying mexican immigrants as rapists and seized control of the party with his promise to build the wall one of trump s first actions as president was to shut down entry into the u s for immigrants from some muslim countries as president his focus has been on enforcement both limiting new arrivals seeking asylum and stepping up deportations of those immigrants already here even longstanding residents whose only crime was illegal entry even though trump spoke privately early on of doing something nice for the dreamers groups on the right who favor tough enforcement never signed on nor did some of trump s more influential advisers and trump ultimately resisted bipartisan overtures from congress last week as the border crisis worsened house speaker nancy pelosi tried to add provisions to improve migrant care as part of a 4 6 billion emergency funding bill but the white house threatened a veto saying it would hamstring the administration s ability at to enforce borders president barack obama s administration also carried out tough enforcement policies as they tried to broker a broader immigration deal with congress there were so many removals under his watch that immigrant advocates labeled him the deporter in chief but when no deal could be found obama decided to go it alone establishing and then expanding the deportation protections for young dreamers that trump is seeking to end a step that is now pending before the supreme court democratic rep joaquin castro the chairman of the congressional hispanic caucus said tuesday he still wants congress to fix a broken system the texas congressman the twin brother of the presidential candidate led a delegation of lawmakers to visit border facilities monday and posted stark videos of women some of them grandmothers being detained in cramped and potentially unsanitary conditions i continue to hold out hope that we can work together on some kind of immigration reform legislation castro said in an interview part of the challenge is that for the president it is his no 1 go to political punching bag issue that makes it very hard because even for moderate republicans it moves everybody to the far right republicans say the problem is democrats want open borders government benefits for those here illegally and the abolition of immigration and customs enforcement at the recent presidential debate all the democratic candidates onstage raised their hands when asked if they would provide health care for immigrants illegally in the u s all democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare how about taking care of american citizens first that s the end of that race trump tweeted with the emotions around immigration so raw longtime advocates see the gridlock as hard to overcome the process of a mccain kennedy bipartisan breakthrough on immigration is hard to imagine said sharry he said even a more narrowly tailored bipartisan measure linking funding to build trump s border wall to deportation protections for dreamers failed in the senate in 2018 after the white house opposed it the idea of a bipartisan deal with a trumpian republican party is impossible to imagine for the short run he said associated press writers col
