legend was born after his death political commissars in his unit allegedly discovered volumes of lei s diaries with 200 000 words of fanatical admiration for mao daily affirmations of his faith in

spread in different sections of china s communist hierarchy through official propaganda however china s populace has become increasingly skeptical about lei and whether the model soldier of the propaganda campaign ever existed many ask how lei who was nearly illiterate could have possibly composed voluminous diaries with literary flourish others have questioned the authenticity of pictures shot by professional photographers of lei doing good deeds even though he was an obscure soldier until his death inspired the propaganda campaign yet many newly discovered photos of lei recently have gone viral on china s internet showing the utterly selfless puritanical proletarian communist soldier riding a motorcycle in tiananmen square in what communists term a petty bourgeois outfit
