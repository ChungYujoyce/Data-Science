apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic last saturday voters in taiwan overwhelmingly elected a western educated lawyer named tsai ing wen of the opposition democratic progressive party dpp to be the country s first female president it was a watershed event in taiwanese political history not just for the lopsidedness of the result but more importantly for what it said about voter attitudes on an existential issue the relevance of communist china to the island democracy the first tell tale sign that this would be a referendum on china did not come with the 2016 presidential race it has become seemingly inevitable since taiwan s midterm local elections in november 2014 that whichever political party clung more closely to the increasingly tenuous connection with china was destined to suffer in that election the incumbent kuomintang or kmt got decimated by the independence leaning dpp when the ballots were counted the kmt had lost by a landslide at virtually every level a major reason for the kmt rout was that then president ma ying jeou had accelerated his policy of cozying up to beijing after his 2012 re election during which he had vowed to never meet with the chinese leaders without first consulting taiwan s voters that policy triggered massive student led protests dubbed the sunflower movement and increasingly strident opposition from the dpp top stories doj

century that should have been a warning signal to the kmt leadership that getting close to china was not going to play well with taiwan s voters but the illusion of the kmt as a legitimate political party over the whole of china still lingered despite the fact that the kmt for the past 70 years has been for all practical purposes a taiwanese political party despite the agony of the 2014 defeat the tone deaf kmt establishment chose an even more pro unification candidate hung hsiu chu for this year s all important presidential race ms hung was an unknown untested and according to many unqualified female legislator whose most pronounced policy position was her unwavering insistence on the kmt s political connection with mainland china and on the idea that taiwan remains part of a single unified china by contrast the dpp quickly settled on ms tsai a lawyer and a taiwanese as its candidate for a while taiwan was thrilled to have for the first time in the history of any chinese society two female presidential candidates but very early in the campaign it became clear that ms hung was no match for ms tsai in part because of her lack of energy but primarily because her stand on unification with china was for most voters a major turn off her polling numbers plummeted and the election result looked like a foregone conclusion sensing the inevitability of ms hung s defeat the kmt mandarins staged a coup in october four months into the race she was humiliatingly dropped in october from the ticket to be replaced by a taiwan born moderate politician named eric chu but it was too late the urbane and able mr chu had a heavy cross to bear just two months before the vote president ma made a secretly planned high profile trip to singapore on nov 7 to meet with chinese president xi jinping the first ever one on one meeting between the leaders from the two sides of the taiwan strait for mr ma the meeting was meant to strengthen the kmt s claim that it alone could bring peace and stability through direct talk with its self proclaimed master in beijing and so boost mr chu s chances in the election but the idea behind the ma xi meeting was problematic for most taiwanese voters mr ma s open support for the so called 1992 consensus whereby the two sides agree that there is only one china and taiwan is part of china but let each side interpret what that china is and who represents it was an implicit recognition of china s flawed one country two systems approach and under that approach beijing exercised sovereignty defense responsibility and diplomatic representation for the region that included hong kong and taiwan but allowed the capitalist system or lifestyle to exist within that region the recent unhappy experience in hong kong however had severely discredited that approach for many taiwanese voters mr ma miscalculated badly as his meeting with mr xi only served to isolate the kmt further from the island s other political forces the fringe political parties the third force were outraged the dpp called the trip the ultimate betrayal of mr ma s 2011 campaign pledge that he would never meet individually with the leader of communist china during his second term the final nail in the coffin of kmt s defeat came on the day before the election a terrified 16 year old taiwanese singer named chou tzuyu was shown on tv issuing a tortured apology to china and its many nationalist internet flamers for holding a taiwanese flag in a production screenshot an act for which she was accused of being a pro taiwan independence activist the televised apology outraged all segments of the taiwanese society further discrediting the kmt s china friendly approach and giving the dpp the final push toward a landslide triumph and until the kmt recognizes that it is not a chinese political party but a taiwanese political party the streak of electorate defeats will continue miles yu s column appears fridays he can be reached at
