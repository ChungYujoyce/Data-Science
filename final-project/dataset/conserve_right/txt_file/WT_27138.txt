ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump also assailed the whistleblower complaint as improperly filed and dishonest compared with a word for word transcript of the call actually no exact transcript exists and the acting director of national intelligence told congress that he believed the whistleblower complaint was in alignment with a rough transcript released by the white house trump had a similar playbook to dispute the russia investigation by assailing special counsel robert mueller as biased and saying the inquiry was illegally hatched by democrats those charges have been shown to be untrue meanwhile amid signs of manufacturing weakness trump unfairly pointed a finger of blame at the federal reserve rather than his escalating trade war with china and overstated his role in a world trade organization ruling for the united states a review impeachment trump as i learn more and more each day i am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment it is a coup intended to take away the power of the people tweet tuesday the facts no illegal coup is afoot house speaker nancy pelosi d calif last month initiated impeachment proceedings against trump she accused him of abusing presidential powers by seeking help from a foreign government to undermine democratic rival joe biden and help his own reelection the move followed a complaint by a whistleblower a cia officer who made the charges a coup is usually defined as a sudden violent and illegal seizure of government power the impeachment process is laid out in the constitution giving congress the authority to impeach and try a president as part of its responsibilities as a coequal branch of government to provide a check on a president when he or she commits treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors is vague and open ended to encompass abuses of power even if they aren t strictly speaking

died news conference wednesday with finland s president trump they never thought in a million years that i d release the conversation and this is an exact word for word transcript of the conversation right taken by very talented stenographers remarks wednesday to reporters in the oval office the facts it s not a word for word transcript the memorandum of trump s july 25 phone call with zelenskiy itself makes clear that it does not represent an exact transcript of what was said according to the document it is not a verbatim transcript and instead records the notes and recollections of situation room duty officers and nsc policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place a number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record it cited potential factors such as the quality of the phone connection variations in accent and or interpretation nsc refers to the national security council the acting director of national intelligence joseph maguire told a house panel last month that he believed the whistleblower acted in good faith and the complaint was consistent with the white house s rough transcript trump on the whistleblower he got his information i guess second or thirdhand he wrote something that was total fiction remarks to reporters thursday gop house minority leader kevin mccarthy whistleblowers were required to provide direct first hand knowledge of allegations but just days before the ukraine whistleblower came forward the ic secretly removed the requirement from the complaint form tweet on sept 28 trump who changed the long standing whistleblower rules just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report drain the swamp tweet monday the facts the process for submitting a whistleblower complaint was not rigged against trump there was nothing improper in how the complaint was submitted no whistleblower law was changed and nothing under that law requires the complaints to have firsthand information in a rare statement this past week the inspector general for the intelligence community also made clear that it had determined the whistleblower did have some firsthand direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct it s not true that the whistleblower could provide nothing more than secondhand or unsubstantiated assertions the ig said intelligence agency workers have long been able to blow the whistle based on secondhand or hearsay information the law only requires federal workers to have a reasonable belief of misconduct in order to file a complaint according to debra d agostino a federal employment lawyer in this case the whistleblower flagged in part trump s july call to zelenskiy in a typed nine page document addressed to the house intelligence committee the watchdog said that while the whistleblower was not a direct witness to the call the inspector general separately obtained other information during its preliminary review to deem the allegations credible pointing to suspicious activity mccarthy r calif cites the removal of some information from the standardized complaint form which previously stressed the need for firsthand information for an inspector general to determine the complaint credible the inspector general s office said it had removed that language from the form earlier this year because it determined that it could be read incorrectly as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint with the congressional intelligence committees in any event the inspector general s office said it had provided the whistleblower separate background material on submitting a complaint that included that language schiff trump congressman adam schiff should resign for the crime of after reading a transcript of my conversation with the president of ukraine it was perfect fraudulently fabricating a statement of the president of the united states and reading it to congress as though mine tweet wednesday trump rep adam schiff illegally made up a fake terrible statement pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the ukrainian president and read it aloud to congress and the american people it bore no relationship to what i said on the call arrest for treason tweet monday the facts trump is overstating schiff s exaggerations the california democrat in what he said was a parody during a committee hearing mocked and overstated the president s pleas in his july call to zelenskiy as trump does with his critics routinely under the constitution treason occurs when a u s citizen or a noncitizen on u s territory wages war against the country or provides material support not just sympathy to a declared enemy of the united states it is defined narrowly as part of an effort by the framers to prevent the government from using it as a reason to suppress political speech said j richard broughton associate dean at university of detroit mercy and a member of the republican national lawyers association the executive branch can only bring charges in extremely limited cases for instance in the cold war case of julius and ethel rosenberg who were executed for giving atomic secrets to russia the rosenbergs were convicted of espionage not treason because the u s and russia were not officially at war no one has been convicted of treason since the aftermath of world war ii says carlton f w larson a university of california law professor who has a book on treason during last week s house intelligence committee hearing schiff made clear he was providing an account that was in essence what he believed trump was conveying to zelenskiy when shorn of its rambling character no exact transcript of trump s comments with ukraine s president actually exists just a rough transcript released by the white house trump liddle adam schiff fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up twisted words into my call with the ukrainian president to make it look like i did something very wrong he then boldly read those words to congress and millions of people defaming libeling me tweets on sept 28 the facts schiff s remarks are not illegal nor would it be defamatory or libelous lawmakers are given wide protections from liability for comments made in the course of congress under the speech or debate clause in the constitution which seeks to foster political debate economy and trade trump on a world trade organization ruling allowing the u s to tax impose tariffs on 7 5 billion worth of european imports annually you never had wins with other presidents did you but we re having a lot of wins at the wto since i became president news conference wednesday the facts trump is wrong that the u s never got any wto victories under other presidents the u s has always had a high success rate when it pursues cases against other countries at the wto in 2017 trade analyst daniel ikenson of the libertarian cato institute found that the u s had won 91 of time it brought a complaint that ended up being adjudicated by the geneva based trade monitor true ikenson noted the countries bringing complaints tend to win overwhelmingly that s because they don t bother going to the wto in the first place if they don t have a pretty strong case the wto announcement culminated a 15 year fight over eu subsidies for airbus a fight that began long before trump was in office trump as i predicted jay powell and the federal reserve have allowed the dollar to get so strong especially relative to all other currencies that our manufacturers are being negatively affected fed rate too high tweet tuesday the facts actually most economists and many factory owners point to trump s trade policies for the difficulties in u s manufacturing not the federal reserve and chairman jerome powell the institute for supply management reported on tuesday that factory activity shrank in september for the second straight month that report shows that the factory sector has been contracting in large part because of the trade war against china that trump sparked by launching a salvo of tariffs the index is based on a survey of manufacturers of the 10 quoted in the report none blames the challenges they face on the fed or the strong dollar but three say the tariffs and trade war have hurt their businesses the primary culprit here is the trade war eric winograd senior u s economist at alliancebernstein said tuesday trump is right that the fed s decision to raise short term interest rates four times last year contributed to a stronger dollar but it wasn t the only factor the u s economy is growing more quickly than europe s or japan s which attracts more investment and boosts the dollar s value and many global investors prefer to invest in u s treasury securities when the global economy slows as it is now because treasuries are seen as a safe haven that also pushes up the dollar the fed has reversed itself this year and cut its benchmark interest rate twice but that hasn t weakened the dollar because other central banks are also cutting rates trump has previously urged the fed to slash its rate to zero but that could spook consumers and businesses who might see it as a sign that a recession is near consumer spending could fall as a result and slow the u s economy the kind of sharp rate cuts by the fed that trump is demanding would also likely encourage investors to place more money in stocks and other speculative investments this would risk inflating a stock market bubble to levels that might ultimately destabilize the u s economy ap economics writers josh boak and christopher rugaber in washington and associated press writer amanda seitz in chicago contributed to this report find ap fact checks at
