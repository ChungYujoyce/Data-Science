after he issued an unprecedented invitation and expressed willingness to cross the border for what would be a history making photo op south korean president moon jae in announced that kim accepted trump s invitation to meet when the u s president visits the heavily fortified site at the korean border village of panmunjom moon praised the two leaders for being so brave to hold the meeting and said i hope president trump will go down in history as the president who achieves peace on korean peninsula top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump said he looked forward to meeting with kim but sought to tamp down expectations predicting it would be very short he said virtually a handshake but that s ok a handshake means a lot officials spent sunday morning working out logistical and security details trump said during an earlier appearance with moon the invitation while long rumored in diplomatic circles still came across as an impulsive display of showmanship by a president bent on obtaining a legacy defining nuclear deal north korea responded by calling the offer a very interesting suggestion presidential visits to the dmz are traditionally carefully guarded secrets for security reasons white house officials couldn t immediately say whether kim had agreed to meet with trump the president himself claimed before flying from japan to south korea that he wasn t even sure kim was in north korea to accept the invitation all i did is put out a feeler if you d like to meet trump said in japan he added somewhat implausibly i just thought of it this morning before arriving in seoul trump said at a news conference in japan that he d feel very comfortable crossing the border into north korea if kim showed up saying he d have no problem becoming the first u s president to step into north korea his comments followed hours after trump asked for kim to meet him there if chairman kim of north korea sees this i would meet him at the border dmz just to shake his hand and say hello he tweeted it was not immediately clear what the agenda if any would be for the potential third trump kim meeting if he s there we ll see each other for two minutes trump predicted such a spectacle would present a valuable propaganda victory for kim who with his family has long been denied the recognition they sought on the international stage despite trump s comments saturday he had told the hill newspaper in washington in an interview this past week that he would be visiting the dmz and might meet with kim the paper reported it had withheld trump s comments citing security concerns by the white house north korea s first vice foreign minister choe son hui said the meeting if realized would serve as another meaningful occasion in further deepening the personal relations between the two leaders and advancing the bilateral relations meeting with trump at south korea s presidential blue house on sunday moon said when he saw trump s invitation to kim i could really feel that the flower of peace was truly blossoming on the korean peninsula moon who will accompany trump to the dmz added that the meeting if it happens would be a significant milestone in the peace process trump s summit with kim in vietnam earlier this year collapsed without an agreement for denuclearizing the korean peninsula he became the first sitting u s president to meet with the leader of the isolated nation last year when they signed an agreement in singapore to bring the north toward denuclearization substantive talks between the nations have largely broken down since then the north has balked at trump s insistence that it give up its weapons before it sees relief from crushing international sanctions still trump has sought to praise kim who oversees an authoritarian government in hopes of keeping the prospects of a deal alive and the two have traded flowery letters in recent weeks every president since ronald reagan has visited the 1953 armistice line except for george h w bush who visited when he was vice president the show of bravado and support for south korea one of america s closest military allies has evolved over the years to include binoculars and bomber jackets trump ever the showman appears to be looking to one up his predecessors with a kim meeting as he left the white house for asia earlier this week trump was asked whether he d meet with kim i ll be meeting with a lot of other people but i may be speaking to him in a different form trump said such trips to the demilitarized zone are usually undertaken under heavy security and the utmost secrecy trump tried to visit the dmz when he was in seoul in november 2017 but his helicopter was grounded by heavy fog trump has staked his self professed deal making reputation on his rapprochement with the north and has even turned it into a campaign rallying cry trump has repeatedly alleged that if he had lost the 2016 presidential campaign the u s would be at war with north korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs the meeting would come at a time of escalating tensions while north korea has not recently tested a long range missile that could reach the u s last month it fired off a series of short range missiles trump has brushed off the significance of the tests even as his own national security adviser john bolton has said they violated u n security council resolutions associated press writers hyung jin kim and kim tong hyung in seoul south korea and darlene superville and jill colvin in washington contributed to this report
