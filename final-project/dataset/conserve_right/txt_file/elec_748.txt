donald trump capturing their party s presidential nomination hispanic republicans are hitting the panic button and taking a unified stand against the bombastic billionaire on the eve of the third gop debate about two dozen hispanic leaders emerged tuesday from a closed door meeting in colorado with a stark warning for republicans they can kiss the hispanic vote and their chances of winning the white house goodbye if mr trump is nominated our message to trump is you re done said alfonso aguilar director of american principles project s latino partnership and former official in the administration of president george w bush we think if you are the candidate that republicans will lose the white house see also anti trump glee leaves gop with single digit candidates mr aguilar and the other hispanic leaders said they plan to monitor the rest of the gop field over the coming weeks and months and could decide to write off others based on their immigration views we re going to hold you accountable he warned the trump campaign declined the chance to comment on the meeting see also ben carson leads donald trump in new national poll on 2016 gop field mr trump meanwhile is set to once again take center stage in the gop presidential debate that is set to kick off at 8 p m wednesday at the coors events center at the university of colorado in boulder hosted by cnbc the prime time showdown is being limited to 10 participants based on national polls and follows a 6 p m undercard event that is scheduled to feature four of the lower tier candidates mr trump has downplayed the idea that he has fallen out of favor with hispanics though an ap gfk poll this week showed 72 percent of latinos say they view him unfavorably compared to 11 percent who see him in a positive light given colorado s deep pool of hispanic voters wednesday s debate could focus more on immigration which polls show and activist say is a threshold issue for many hispanics who won t even look at a candidate that comes out against robust legalization foolishly some candidates think they don t need the hispanic vote in the primary so they pander to the voters with extreme views instead of just showing us who they are said rosario marin former treasurer of the united states under president george w bush who attended the meeting heed our warning don t expect us to come to your side during the general election if you are not with us now we will not be with you then the hispanic summit tuesday was billed as the first of its kind and attendees said they ve scheduled another meeting a day before the dec 15 debate in nevada which is also home to many latino voters the group also vowed to highlight how mr obama broke his promise to push an immigration fight during his first year in office and how hillary rodham clinton the likely 2016 democratic nominee said last year that illegal immigrant children surging across the u s mexico border should be sent home republicans have wrestled over the issue of immigration since mitt romney lost latino voters by a 71 percent to 27 percent margin in the 2012 election after he pledged to rely on self deportation to reduce the number of illegal immigrants living in the united states the pledge contrasted with the executive amnesty that mr obama granted to young illegal immigrants known as dreamers roughly six months out from the general election mr obama won the latino vote by an even wider margin 75 percent to 23 percent in colorado which has produced republicans with diverse opinion on the issue including former rep tom tancredo a staunch amnesty opponent and sen cory gardner who supports a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants and expanding guest worker programs this year the issue has divided the gop field with former gov jeb bush and sen marco rubio both florida republicans carly fiorina and ohio gov john kasich being among the candidates that have backed some sort of a path to legal status for illegal immigrants others including sen ted cruz of texas have vowed to oppose amnesty and have supported expanding legal immigration mr trump meanwhile has focused on the enforcement side of the debate and signaled he is open to reducing legal immigration in august he rolled out a six page plan that called for more border fencing deporting all illegal immigrants and ending the policy granting automatic citizenship to almost everyone born in the u s including to illegal immigrant mothers sen jeff sessions alabama republican applauded the trump plan saying at the time that it re establishes the principle that america s immigration laws should serve the interest of its own citizens for too long immigration reform plans in washington have served the special interests at the expense of working americans mr session said by contrast this plan puts the needs of working americans foremost and develops an effective strategy for improving their wages and job prospects for the hispanic leaders that gathered in boulder tuesday the proposal was yet another troubling sign for mr trump who had caught their attention over the summer when he said that mexico officials were sending drug smugglers rapists and some i assume good people into the united states mr trump has pledged to support whoever wins the gop nomination hispanic leaders however said they won t support mr trump we still have hope that we can help elect a republican candidate but we are 100 percent united behind the fact that mr trump is not our guy massey villarreal former head of the hispanic chamber of commerce said before the meeting we are not going to shy away from the fact that if mr trump is the nominee we will encourage latinos to write their own candidate in he said mr aguilar said he would leave the ballot blank and also said that it would be naive to suggest that mr trump is the only gop candidate who could jeopardize the party s chances of winning over more hispanics trump is in a league of his own but there is a concern about the way cruz has been handling the issue he said mr aguilar said mr cruz the son of a cuban immigrant father has sent the wrong message by cozying up to mr trump while also coming out against birthright citizenship and refusing to spell out his plans for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the country others said they are willing to cut mr cruz
