apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic former attorney general jeff sessions announced he was running for his old alabama s senate seat in 2020 gushing about president trump s agenda and hoping he will earn the white house s support despite his sour relationship with the president no senator will be more effective in advancing president trump s agenda mr sessions declared thursday evening on tucker carlson tonight mr sessions ripped the house democrats ongoing impeachment effort a farce and predicted they would eventually slink away and said he had no regrets about his time running the justice department top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century however that tenure did not meet with mr trump s approval who calls picking mr sessions his biggest mistake because mr sessions quickly recused himself from the russia collusion probe the mueller report found no evidence of collusion as mr trump insisted from the beginning and he felt mr sessions despite being the first senator to endorse his presidential run had betrayed him i did the thing i had to do mr sessions said thursday night a top white house official suggested earlier thursday that mr trump might support mr sessions effort to regain the seat he had resigned to become attorney general if the choice comes down to mr sessions or incumbent democratic sen doug jones white house senior counselor kellyanne conway said the president doesn t want to deny or deprive alabama of their right to choose despite a report that mr trump has discouraged mr sessions from running asked whether mr trump would support mr sessions mrs conway replied we d love to have a republican senator there we think that jones has been a reliable liberal vote on way too many things really disappointing obviously not representing the interests of the people of alabama as well as he could be mr sessions announcement was not unexpected and the political rumor mill had trended toward that decision for weeks before his appearance on mr carlson s show his opponents in the 2020 gop primary already were criticizing the man who had held the seat for decades before becoming attorney general jeff sessions is one of the reasons i decided to get off the sidelines and into the race for senate said republican candidate tommy tuberville he s been out of the swamp for less than two years and now he s itching to go back mr sessions who would be 73 when he returned to the senate said he will file the papers friday it s not my seat but i believe i have something to offer he said thursday evening long considered a stalwart conservative trump loyalists came to regard mr sessions as a craven washington figure for failing to defend the president as attorney general jeff sessions had his chance to have president trump s back and take on the establishment politicians and he failed mr tuberville said if we re going to help president trump change this country then we have to stop recycling the same old politicians rep bradley byrne who also is running for the seat and recently led gop fundraising with 2 5 million cash on hand issued a similar statement although he did not name mr sessions from the mueller investigation to this impeachment president trump has been under constant attack mr byrne said i won t sit back and watch them destroy our country alabama deserves a senator who will stand with the president and won t run away and hide from the fight mr sessions pushed back against that narrative thursday saying he has never wavered in his support of the trump administration s agenda and saying mr trump had done an exemplary job thus far on the foreign and domestic fronts mr jones who won the 2017 special election to replace mr sessions is rated the most vulnerable senator seeking reelection next year alabama is a republican leaning state and gop candidates have won the governorship and other statewide races by commanding margins mr jones was aided immeasurably in his bid by accusations that roy moore a former state supreme court justice who won the 2017 republican primary had behaved inappropriately with teenage girls as a young lawyer and sexually assaulted one mr moore denied the charges but they buried his campaign while mr jones has positioned himself much closer to the center than congressional democrats left wing coastal leadership he has been attacked by alabama conservatives as too liberal in particular they point to mr jones opposition to the appointment of supreme court justice brett m kavanaugh as a prime example mr moore declared his 2020 candidacy in june a move the party has desperately tried to derail although few people consider mr moore to have any realistic shot at winning mr byrne enjoys considerable establishment support whereas mr tuberville is famous for being the former head football coach at auburn university and is making his first run at public office each campaign has touted polls claiming their man is a front runner although a recent tally showed mr tuberville in the lead and mr byrne dominating only in the area around mobile which is his district other gop candidates in the race include alabama secretary of state john merrill
