tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn mexico city andr s manuel l pez obrador marked the anniversary of winning mexico s presidency monday amid some strange contradictions a leftist he has been more fiscally conservative than any of his predecessors since the 1950s he has cut the size of government so dramatically it has drawn protests he has been more openly religious than most mexican presidents in recent memory he still spends most of his days on the campaign trail holding near daily rallies in outlying states even though he is firmly in control of congress and the opposition is a fragmented mess top stories trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time he has better relations with u s president donald trump than his conservative predecessor and has cracked down on migrants harder despite risky economic moves polls say his approval rating ranges from 66 to 72 seven months after he took office dec 1 clearly many mexicans are reacting more to his personality folksy smiling humble incredibly accessible than any big governmental results unlike previous mexican leaders he still shakes hands in public eschews security details flies economy class on commercial flights and takes selfies with fellow passengers i think he has a good vision but his proposals the team he has i m not saying they are good or bad there are just a lot of doubts there said argelia miranda vazquez a government worker who was engaged in a friendly discussion with some l pez obrador supporters outside a huge anniversary rally the president held in mexico city s main plaza monday like many she was charmed by some of his symbolic moves to dismantle the high level distant arrogant presidency of years past like taking lavish pensions away from ex presidents but aside from that everything continues the same miranda vazquez said rub n jimenez a l pez obrador supporter agreed that the biggest change has been psychological things are better in popular terms because the people have more hope that things will get better jimenez said the government is more democratic and it is getting closer to the people but even jimenez agreed that real progress has been slow homicides remain at historic highs though the rate of increase has slowed the government oil company is staggering under debt and some government spending cuts have hampered medical care at state run hospitals the business community is spooked by l pez obrador s propensity for rescinding what he feels are unfair infrastructure contracts the cabinet largely composed of newcomers is on what can be most kindly described as a learning curve the cabinet is learning and very slowly jimenez said the people s needs have to be met more higher wages we need quicker progress the national guard l pez obrador s new military based policing force has to make more rapid progress the 65 year old president maintains an exhausting schedule of daily morning news conferences capped off by his outdoor rallies but though the opposition is disorganized mexico is increasingly polarized in part because l pez obrador laughingly dismisses anyone who opposes him as fifi a word that means roughly posh elite or frivolous constantly whipping up his base while disparaging the opposition is something l pez obrador has in common with trump or people like conservative italian interior minister matteo salvini says federico estevez a political science professor at the autonomous technological institute of mexico it s the new politics you know it s trump it s salvini it s all of them they all do it it s only the establishment that doesn t do it estevez said obviously it works the argument that l pez obrador is more populist than leftist may have some validity he has cut out some social programs that went directly to mexico s poorest people and replaced them with handouts like scholarship and work programs that go to a broader income band he has bent over backward to avoid conflict with trump especially on issues like migrants l pez obrador originally ordered central american migrants be given work and travel visas and promised investment to create jobs in their home countries but under trump s threats to close the border and impose tariffs on mexican products the government has begun raiding trains buses hotels and parks to stem the flow of migrants while leftists may view that as a betrayal it plays well among average mexicans who appear to be fed up with throngs of central americans haitians and africans crossing their country trying to reach the u s border he should focus on the people instead of being compassionate with the migrants who come from other countries said miranda vazquez he should support the people and the others well let their governments take care of their own people l pez obrador has broken with traditional leftist positions on other issues too he has little use for environmental restrictions loves fossil fuels and has cut tens of thousands of government jobs as part of an austerity drive in some ways he s doing something that would not have been expected of a leftist president said estevez it s amazing ho
