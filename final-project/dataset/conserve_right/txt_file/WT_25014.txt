 in coronavirus nursing home policy florida race for house seat becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion president trump s peace plan for the palestinian israeli conflict surfaced two years ago and to this day remarkably only he and a handful of aides know its precise details a stream of leaks however contains enough internal consistency that their collation supplemented by conversations with administration officials provides a plausible outline of the plan s contents these suggest the plan boils down to a grand exchange the arab states recognize israel and israel recognizes palestine both with capital cities in jerusalem this approach builds on elements forwarded by egypt s president abdel fattah el sisi in 2016 the obama administration in 2009 the 2002 arab peace initiative and even my 1990 symmetry plan these prior plans either had israel go first or called for simultaneous steps in contrast mr trump s has the arab states initiate with israel responding this change prompted mahmoud abbas of the palestinian authority pa immediately to reject the deal of the century when he met with mr trump in may 2017 one report noted that abbas has long feared such a plan and vehemently opposed it top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all

purported deal contains many elements favorable to the palestinians palestine consists of areas a and b on the west bank in their entirety and parts of area c in all it will constitute 90 percent of the west bank the capital is within or near jerusalem s expansive municipal boundaries perhaps in an area stretching from shuafat to isawiya abu dis and jabal mukabar an international body oversees a joint pa israeli administration governing jerusalem s holy basin including the old city a joint pa jordan body controls jerusalem s islamic sanctuaries egypt jordan and lebanon give more rights to their palestinian residents jewish residents in smaller west bank towns are relocated a land passage connects the west bank and gaza gaza joins palestine when the pa regains control of it washington organizes a gigantic economic aid package perhaps 40 billion or roughly 25 000 per palestinian resident of the west bank for the pa palestinians enjoy temporary access to select israeli seaports and airports until foreign funds build exclusive pa facilities in exchange the palestinians apparently will be asked to accept several limitations continued israeli military control over palestine s borders its air and sea access and the jordan valley legal recognition by the u s government and perhaps annexation by israel of larger jewish towns amounting to 10 percent of the west bank giving up the right of return for palestinians living outside israel in favor of compensation assuming this outline to be correct in the essentials it raises three main worries first the benefits to israel are illusory its peace treaties with egypt signed 40 years ago and jordan 25 years ago led not to significant trade friendly diplomatic relations or an increase in human contact rather they intensified anti zionist sentiments among egyptians and jordanians while improving their governments arsenals the same pattern of heightened hostility also followed other arab diplomatic agreements with israel lebanon in 1983 the plo in 1993 why should saudi or bahraini recognition be otherwise in other words arab state recognition hardly benefits israel and could hurt it ending the palestinian claim to a right of return is israel s other illusory benefit just recall the farcical 1990s non change of the plo charter to drop its call for israel s destruction to anticipate the hollow theatrics ahead second despite the palestinians gaining real and irreversible benefits money territory legitimacy they with certainty will continue their century old pattern of rejecting israel through campaigns of delegitimization and violence as has been the case since the first palestinian israeli agreement in 1993 that s because shimon peres discredited new middle east idea that enriching and rewarding palestinians makes them peaceable underlies the reported trump plan long experience however shows that these benefits makes them more inclined to eliminate the jewish state in brief the pa will pocket palestine and intensify its anti zionism third should israelis complain to mr trump about that delegitimization and violence he will likely respond with annoyance the palestinian israeli conflict is now off the table and they should move on should they persist his predictable rage will damage not just israel but also the anti tehran campaign and anti islamist efforts in general in short the reported plan repeats the great miscalculation of traditional palestinian israeli diplomacy by asking too little of arabs and too much of israelis i predict that it will fail just as did those of bill clinton george w bush and barack obama therefore americans concerned about israel iran and islamism need to prepare for the imminent unveiling of what could be a problematic plan yes so far mr trump has been the most pro israel president ever but as the bible reminds us put not your trust in princes daniel pipes danielpipes org danielpipes is president of the middle e
