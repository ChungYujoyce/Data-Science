cares act is clear on who will receive its much needed payments in the form of checks to individuals and expanded unemployment insurance plus relief for small businesses and certain industry sectors but the rules governing the federal reserve bank s lending authority will severely limit the ability of some mid and large size businesses to obtain the financing they desperately need to get through the current economic shutdown on march 23rd thefedcommittedto using its full range of authorities to provide powerful support for the flow of credit to american families and businesses the recently passed relief bill authorizes the treasury secretary toprovide a newly created fedfacility up to a total of 500 billionas collateral loss protection whichthe fed canleverageto make around 4 trillion

small businesses with less than 500 employees can access 350 billion worth likely to soon be expanded of contingent loans doled out by thesmall business administration sba those loans willbe forgiven if the borrowing employer keeps people on the payroll there are winners and losers in this package as well carve outs in the cares act include sba forgivable loans for large restaurant and hotel companies withunder500 employeesper location as opposed to in total there is also a financing gap forsome startups and small businesses backed by or affiliated with venture capital private equity still cannot access the sba forgivable loans because of historical sba rules the fedalsoannounced the details of itsmainstreetbusinesslending programto support lending to eligible small and medium sized businesses that were in good financial standing before the crisis complementing efforts by the sbato support businesses with up to 10 000 employees and less than 2 5 billion in revenue but it s unclear how good financial understanding is defined and how solvency requirements will be applied which could lead to the fed picking winners and losers leaving some without access to funds section 13

requirementstate thatany borrowerwhois generally not paying its undisputed debts as they become due during the 90 days preceding the date of borrowing is considered insolvent at a time when the government has essentially shut down the economy that 90 day requirement will be increasingly difficultfor many companiesto meet this means that far larger corporations corporations that previously were paying their bills on time before covid 19 but now find themselves distressed may face problems thanks to new arbitrary fed facility rules only companies with publicly issued corporate bonds that as of march 22 carried investment grade credit ratings bbb and above can access the fed s newprimary market corporate credit facilityandsecondary market corporate credit facility companies that don t currently haveat least two bb credit ratings from agencies are ineligible many companies are being downgraded well below bb due to covid 19 as of february about50 percentof all investment grade

ineligible by these arbitrary criteria the fed will now buy ford junk bonds which were downgraded to junk after march 22 but not amc and cinemark junk bonds since their downgrades to junk happened on march 16 to expeditiously resolve theseproblems and expand crisis lending uniformly the following actions should be taken first congressshouldamendsection 13 3 of the federal reserve act toclarify solvency requirementsandgrantthe fed more flexibilityin administeringitsmain streetbusinesslendingprogram the fed could also use the administrative procedures act to eliminate the way it previously defined strict solvency requirements for 13 3 emergency lending eligibility second congress should pass legislation that waives sba affiliation rules to allow companies with less than 500 employees backed by venture capital and private equity to access cares act sba programs conditional on not firing people the fed should also relax the lending requirements of its main street business lending facility to cover loans below 1 million giving more access to smaller borrowers purchase 100 percent of the loans rather than purchasing only 95 percent of each bank loan leaving 5 percent with the bank and consider making terms more attractive to banks and borrowers third the fed should expand its corporate bond buying programs move to move its eligibility date from march 22 to some earlier time perhaps in february before all covid 19 ratings downgrades and loosen current credit rating requirements to uniformly help more corporations in distress due to covid 19 the fed could also loosen the current aaa credit rating requirements for credit card auto loan and small business loan asset backed securities that can be bought by itstalf program these measures may be controversial inviting concerns over moral hazard but the unprecedented and unique nature of a once in a century pandemic requires an unprecedented and unique response the federal reserve should also want to avoid the
