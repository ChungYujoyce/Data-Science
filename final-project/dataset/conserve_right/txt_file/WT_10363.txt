ould be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic taiwan and china recently signed a new economic agreement but on the island across the 100 mile taiwan strait from the mainland a political debate is under way over just how close is too close for comfort the economic cooperation framework agreement ecfa signed last week in chongqing china will improve economic ties between the longtime rivals however many in taiwan are protesting the potential political impact of the deal and are calling for a referendum to be held on what both beijing and taipei do not formally recognize is an international pact the ecfa focuses china taiwan interaction on economic issues and has been debated in taiwan for months if approved it will take effect in 2012 top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 business supporters of the agreement in taiwan say it will help firms gain access to the mainland s booming economy the ecfa will remove tariffs on 14 billion of taiwan s exports and 3 billion of chinese imports taiwan s opposition democratic progressive party dpp and some taiwanese labor organizations are protesting the deal that the ruling kuomintang party kmt is working to implement after approval by the legislature bi khim hsiao director of the dpp s department of international affairs said the economic agreement will draw taiwan deeper into china s circle putting it closer to china politically it s never just economic for china she said during a skype interview last week on june 26 the dpp held a street protest in taipei that included 30 000 to 40 000 people who called for a nationwide referendum on ecfa the kmt and dpp are currently negotiating the terms of ecfa s formal approval which will be further reviewed during a special session of the legislature july 7 if a referendum is approved it would require a majority of registered voters to approve the agreement not only parliament but the public should be allowed to have a say in this ms hsiao said however frank wang director of the taipei economic and cultural representative office s tecro press division said the kmt is determined to ratify ecfa during the special session tecro is the taiwan government office in washington ratifying the agreement presents political problems both china and taiwan do not formally recognize each other and thus do not regard the ecfa as an international treaty according to drew thompson the director of china studies at the nixon center the agreement has not been signed by either head of state and is being handled by quasi governmental organizations affiliated with their respective political parties indeed according to parris chang president and ceo of the taiwan institute of political economic and strategic studies and former dpp official president ma ying jeou is not allowing parliament to modify ecfa as it would an international treaty but has limited its response to a yes or no similarly china is treating the ecfa as it would a domestic trade deal with hong kong said patrick chovanec a professor in china and former businessman over a skype interview from china john tkacik a retired u s diplomat who was chief of the state department s china intelligence unit during the clinton administration said neither beijing nor taipei desires any international attention to ecfa s domestic legal status chris nelson senior vice president of samuels international associates who writes a daily asia focused report said the political implications of the deal are a legitimate concern for taiwanese citizens the mainland is trying to tie taiwan closer and closer to them he said but added that ecfa is hardly reunification in itself many taiwanese businesses however see no other choice under the dpp administration from 2000 to 2008 the taiwanese economy suffered from some isolationist policies one reason the kmt won the 2008 elections dissenters such as mr chang maintained that the benefits will be limited to a few fat cats in taiwan but many experts say ecfa is largely in taiwan s favor predicted to boost the island s economy by 4 5 percent by 2020 there s no question that this is a good deal for taiwan s domestic economy mr nelson said without a pact with the mainland on the other hand taiwan fears that it will be cut off from the rest of asia s economy especially with the free trade agreement china recently signed with six nations in the association of south east asian nations asean the businesses are thinking if we don t sign ecfa then what are our prospects mr chovanec said as an island he added taiwan can only grow so much different views on taiwanese independence also contribute to the confusion when the kmt party fled to taiwan in 1949 it continued to see itself as the legitimate government in exile of china there are still significant differences between the kuomintang and the ccp but they do agree that there is one china mr chovanec said however according to mr tkacik most ethnic taiwanese do not see taiwan as a part of china including the dpp and have reservations about the kmt s policies we fear that president ma will sell out to china mr chang said with the upcoming legislative elections however mr chang pointed out that the people of taiwan will have a chance to voice their discontent taiwan is a vigorous democracy and the people will speak up if they think the government has gone
