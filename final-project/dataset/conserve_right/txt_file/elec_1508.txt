win the republican nomination imagine trying to explain america s presidential selection process to an extraterrestrial the nation s two major political parties entrust iowa with beginning the elimination process that one midwestern state representing just 1 percent of the nation s population with an electorate not reflective of america writ large iowa s population is whiter more protestant and decidedly less black and hispanic than the rest of the country moreover it s not much of a political bellwether jimmy carter won the democratic caucuses in 1976 as did barack obama in 2008 in modern times george w bush is the lone republican to parlay a caucus win into the presidency yet here we are in 2016 once again giving this under populated state an oversized role in the nation s future some observations about what transpired in iowa on the republican side on monday night mister trump meet mister tyson the former boxer is credited with saying that everyone has a plan til they get punched in the mouth on monday night trump was on the receiving end of said punch yes the turnout turned out to be a record high as trump had promised but not all the newcomers flocked in his direction as he also prophesized according to fox news entrance polls the late deciders broke first to marco rubio then texas sen ted cruz and then trump one reason why rubio finished a close third much closer than expected to the flamboyant developer one way to look at trump s bad night going into the caucuses trump stood at 28 6 percent in thereal clear politicsaverage he finished with only 24 percent on caucus night cruz was everything but likeable cruz organized iowa like few republicans ever have 12 000 volunteers 1 000 precincts a pair of old college dorms rented and renamed camp cruz to house that army unlike trump s calculation that star power was an irresistible force it was sweat equity that paid off cruz bumped hisrcpaverage by about 4 points credit cruz with standing his ground he didn t back down on opposing the ethanol subsidy he didn t deviate from his game plan of courting evangelicals however the game plan wasn t glitch free three out of five gop caucus goers identified as evangelicals in this year s republican caucuses a higher percentage than in 2012 yet per the fox news entrance polls this portion of the vote didn t break as heavily for cruz as anticipated this suggests a core problem for cruz moving forward he s bright organized and a methodical strategist but he s just not likeable beyond that base of religious and constitutional voters he ll be hard pressed to finish second in new hampshire where the electorate is less devoutly protestant and less conservative and trump may be particularly vengeful the rubio expectations game one other way the iowa night seem alien to alien visitors the ability for a non winner to claim victory and in 2016 that s florida sen marco rubio whose surprisingly strong third place finish confirms him as the biggest fish in the so called establishment lane rubio was a non factor in iowa as recently as a few weeks ago but then he worked the state in person invested heavily late in television on the eve of the vote and profited handsomely from the one fifth of the gop voters for whom electability was the prime concern armchair quarterbacks will debate how much rubio benefitted from trump s debate snub didn t work for reaganin 1980 maybe also backfired on the donald in 2016 plus cruz scontroversial mailer rubio won the expectations game let s see if that translates into votes in new hampshire and more immediately an influx of cash as donors contrast his over performance to the anemic showing of new jersey gov chris christie at 2 percent just a percentage point behind jeb bush left behind dr ben carson finished fourth a better showing than he might have anticipated a month ago when his campaign cratered carson s free fall led to cruz s december surge carson s slight recovery on monday night his core being evangelicals likely kept cruz from a bigger win to the adage that elections reflect change and turnover mike huckabee and rick santorum won the last two gop caucuses on monday night neither cracked 3 percent huckabee quickly put his campaign on hiatus santorum likely won t be far behind change gives us continuity for all the talk these past few months of how iowa would be an opening salvo in a trump fueled revolution reality proved otherwise yes a historically large gop electorate struck a blow against washington experience cruz trump and rubio combined have all of ten years in federal government between them they cornered three fourth of iowa s vote however the iowa results were also a vote for more of the same since 1988 the gop caucuses have followed a familiar pattern iowans siding with a republican who embodied the concept of one of us bob dole a son of kansas was a fellow midwesterner he was iowa s winner in 1988 and 1996 george w bush huckabee and santorum all ran campaigns in which their personal faith and public policy ideas were dna strands given the choice of voting for cruz who worked the evangelic crowd in no uncertain terms father god please awaken the body of christ iowans went with the purer social conservative not the wealthy guy from new york running as a born again conservative trying to win over the midwestern crowd with his celebrity persona and flashy plane in the end cruz simply out organized and out thought trump which is why trump fever is over at least until next week s vote get the recap of top opinion commentary
