with him has a moral problem with me he spoke of the core values of left republicanism represented by ex ira figures such as ellis and the party s former leader gerry adams there s a really strong continuity over that 30 year period i m proud of it anyone who asks me i tell them i m a gerry adams republican there are concerns over sinn f in s internal decision making process the party s finance minister in stormont asked a senior ex ira man if he would be content with a crucial decision to cut heating subsidies but broin considers the allegations pretty mild the great strength of sinn f in in the peace process he said is that at every stage where we ve moved we ve brought the family with us there are ex combatants in the national executive but the peace process is meant to be about facilitating the transition from armed conflict to political activity he adds there is nothing shady about elected representatives in politics speaking to advisers the following day i joined louise o reilly broin s colleague canvassing on a housing development in dublin fingal a sprawling suburban constituency on the outskirts of the city we met denise a professional in her mid 40s who voted fine gael at the last election but said she is now so angry with all politicians that she is considering not voting denise slowly softened as o reilly ran through her party s proposals denouncing fine gael and fianna f il for having it stitched up between them i ll be quite frank with you i wouldn t normally be keen on voting sinn f in denise said after they had spoken some more she seemed convinced i think someone like you would be excellent in government if the trend is borne out on polling day this election carries the potential to restructure the political landscape of the republic of ireland while a heated debate grows as to whether sinn f in is even a legitimate potential party of government this is not a normal irish election to some particularly older voters the idea of a sinn f in surge in the republic is unconscionable and deeply painful jean mcconville one older voter said simply shaking his head mcconville was one of the disappeared a catholic convert and widow from belfast who was murdered and secretly buried by the ira in 1972 orphaning her ten children her case is one of the saddest and most high profile of the troubles agnes mcconville spoke to a bbc documentary in 2013 about hearing her mother s squeals as she was bundled into the back of a van and taken to be murdered to many who remember seeing themcconville children on the news pleading for information about their mother it is traumatic to witness the rehabilitation of sinn f in not only as part of the peace process in the north but potentially entering government for the first time in the south the sinn

republic takes issue with the framing of sinn f in as the radical left alternative i don t consider things like abolishing property tax as being left progressive moynihan told me there are questions to ask is it left or is it populist googletag cmd push function googletag display 1x3 but she freely gives the party credit for its recent role in opposition some of the people in sinn f in are excellent spokespersons someone like eoin broin really gets the housing crisis is great on it broin along with the party leader mary lou mcdonald pearse doherty the sinn f in finance spokesperson and louise o reilly its spokesperson on health has been a crucial player in the party s recent gains we ve built the credibility broin the 47 year old td for dublin mid west told me we have to work harder
