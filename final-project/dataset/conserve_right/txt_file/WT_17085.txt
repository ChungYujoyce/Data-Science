bush administration told congress this week that u s nuclear weapons and the infrastructure to support them will be needed for the foreseeable future as russia and china continue to build up their nuclear arsenals and rogue states such as iran and north korea continue work on nuclear arms we re going to need nuclear weapons for a while and we re going to need to make them safer and more secure said steve henry assistant secretary of defense for nuclear matters in summing up the report to congress on u s nuclear strategy the report national security and nuclear weapons maintaining deterrence for the 21st century is a statement by the secretaries of energy defense and state it stated that the future security environment is very uncertain and some trends are not favorable rogue states either have or seek weapons of mass destruction including nuclear weapons and the risk of future proliferation cannot be ignored the report said the future direction that any number of states may take including some established nuclear powers with aggressive nuclear force modernization programs could have a dramatic effect on u s security and the security of our allies mr henry said russia and china both are established powers with nuclear buildups under way that need watching and require the united states to keep nuclear weapons ready and to have a system in place with both people and facilities that could respond to any potential unsettling strategic imbalances on russia mr henry said you can t ignore what countries say and their rhetoric and you can t ignore what they are doing in practice the russians are aggressively modernizing their nuclear forces he said and china is building new strategic nuclear forces and the buildup cannot be ignored the united states is a little bit unsure as to the future of their program mr henry said today china s program is much smaller than the u s or that of the russians but how do you judge what the future may be mr henry also said the united states is worried that al qaeda and other terrorists will obtain nuclear weapons specifically getting nuclear material from rogue states and that u s nuclear weapons can be used to deter those states from supplying terrorists with that material such states would be held accountable if their nuclear material is used in attacks on the united states he said the report said the nuclear programs of iran and north korea show the need for the united states to provide nuclear guarantees to key allies mr henry said the united states is committed to reducing nuclear stockpiles but must maintain capabilities for security one of the most important elements of current nuclear arms strategy is developing the reliable replacement warhead a newer safer and more reliable warhead that will be fashioned from existing warheads but will be less expensive to maintain mr henry said the report said without the replacement warhead the ability of the united states to maintain its nuclear deterrent over the long term will be in question the united states plans to have a strategic nuclear warhead arsenal of between 1 700 and 2 200 by 2012 the report said tribal area terror retired air force lt

pakistani president pervez musharraf has lost some 500 troops fighting terrorists in the region and also tried to use a political agreement with tribal leaders in the region but it has not been

counterterrorist operations in the region providing 25 u s helicopters and air assault training to pakistani troops supplying night vision equipment and giving 110 million in economic aid to the tribal region on the recent confrontation at pakistan s red mosque gen clapper said the behavior of the extremists who had been holed up in the mosque highlighted the threat and extremists based in the border areas have taken both the stepped up pakistani army presence in the fata and along the border as well as the storming of the mosque as a pretext for resuming terrorist attacks on the pakistani security forces also pakistani religious leaders are stepping up opposition to extremists and in one recent meeting declared that suicide bombing violated islamic law he said recent internal
