country forward through an unprecedented crisis the former vice president said this week as he unveiled six policy task forces which will try to seek common ground between the biden camp and former

the democratic party s presumptive presidential nominee as sanders dropped out of the primary race aoc named co chair as biden sanders set up unity task forces we aposve listened to bernie supporters

friday that biden brought the party together faster than anybody imagined and that s going to prove to be a great strength people were predicting a convention that was going to be brokered and a long fight into the spring that didn t happen he noted in a conference call with political reporters but as with every presidential election season it aposs a delicate balancing act and a risky one further what aposs at play here is an inversion of the usual playbook where candidates courtthe base for the primaries and then tack to the center for the general faced with a field full of far left candidates in the primary election biden and a handful of his rivals played up their credentials as more moderate leaning practical politicians but in the name of unity and avoiding another 2016
