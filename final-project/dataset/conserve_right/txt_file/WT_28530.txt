act lawsuit mr trump has claimed that the purpose of mr mueller s may 16 white house visit was to interview him for the vacant fbi director post mr mueller a former fbi director has said the meeting s purpose was to discuss the bureau in general whatever the purpose john dowd mr trump s attorney during the ensuing 22 month probe said mr mueller had a duty not to meet with the president knowing he was likely to be investigating the trump campaign the most dishonorable conduct i have ever witnessed mr dowd told the washington times noting mr mueller s military service mr dowd added capt robert mueller usmc sits in front of his commander in chief being interviewed for fbi director knowing he is going to investigate the president and never says a word that same day may 16 mr mueller also visited mr rosenstein at the justice department i am with mueller mr rosenstein said in an email to mark filip a former deputy attorney general now in private law practice he shares my view duty calls sometimes the moment chooses us the next day mr rosenstein shocked the white house without consultation he announced that mr mueller would take over the russia probe launching a historic investigation that would attract a staff of mostly democratic prosecutors he gave mr mueller wide latitude to investigate mr trump and his campaign associates saying any links with russia should be probed may 2017 was a particularly tumultuous month inside the justice department and the fbi mr trump fired fbi director james b comey on may 9 the white house cited a memo written by mr rosenstein on how mr comey crossed the line in announcing no charges against hillary clinton for her mishandling of state department emails aghast mr rosenstein almost immediately began a hunt for a special counsel his inbox filled with demands from liberal nonprofit groups to appoint one he didn t believe he had written the memo to justify a firing the next day mr rosenstein made his first overture to mr mueller an aide emailed mr mueller s law firm wilmerhale i m writing to try to arrange a meeting between mr rosenstein and bob mueller hopefully for friday may 12 morning anytime before 10 a m can you let me know if mr mueller would have any time thanks so much a mueller assistant replied 24 minutes later can we do it at 8 a m also would it be possible to get a parking spot for mr mueller inside the building on the night of may 12 mr rosenstein sent the boss doesn t know email to mr mueller the next morning mr mueller wrote to mr rosenstein rod if you have a moment would you please give me a call by may 16 the deal seemed done mr rosenstein again met with mr mueller and sent the sometimes the moment chooses us email mr mueller spent time that same day with the president mr rosenstein announced the appointment on may 17 these astonishing emails further confirm the corruption behind rosenstein s appointment of robert mueller said judicial watch chief tom fitton judicial watch released documents in september about another traumatic event unfolding inside the justice department that may mr rosenstein acting fbi director andrew mccabe and other aides met to discuss the comey firing the same day mr rosenstein met with mr mueller and mr mueller met with mr trump the group s suspicions immediately turned on mr trump as a target in the justice department s russia election interference probe in an astounding discussion mr rosenstein offered to wear a wire during a meeting with the president to record the conversation and ask him his motivations according to a contemporaneous memo written by mr mccabe he said he thought this might be possible because he was not searched when he entered the white house mr mccabe wrote i told him that i would discuss the opportunity with my investigative team and get back to him the wire caper apparently never happened mr mccabe who would be fired the next year for allegedly lying to investigators about a leaked news story acted on may 16 to investigate mr trump as a possible russian spy and election collaborator a year later mr rosenstein discussed how to respond to a 2018 new york times story about the wire and about invoking the 25th amendment to remove an incapacitated president the story apparently came from the fired mr mccabe he talked about the incident while selling his book the threat mr rosenstein ended up issuing a statement the new york times s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect i will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda but let me be clear about this based on my personal dealings with the president there is no basis to invoke the 25th amendment mr mueller completed his final report in march while mr mccabe implied that mr trump is a russian spy the 448 page report offers no such evidence mr mueller was assigned to find any links with russia by any trump associate or mr trump himself the mueller report said the evidence we obtained did not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to russian election interference in july mr mueller appeared before two house committees at the insistence of democrats rep louie gohmert texas republican asked him about his may 16 2017 meeting with the president asked whether he planned to investigate mr trump for firing mr comey at the time he was appointed special counsel mr mueller answered i m not going to get into that internal deliberation from the justice department were you talking to him about fbi director position mr gohmert asked not as a candidate mr mueller said did he mention the firing of james comey in your discussion with him the congressman asked cannot remember mr mueller said i don t believe so but i m not going to be specific if he did you could have been a fact witness as to the president s comments and state of mind on firing james comey mr gohmert said i suppose
