were bringing us all back today for a vote that will go nowhere minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif said of the 3 trillion coronavirus bill approved friday night the measure may not go anywhere butit will likely serve as a marker and send a message in more ways than one house speaker nancy pelosi d calif was sending a messageby getting the bill passed on the other hand senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky was sending a messageby vowing not to pass the bill and like most things in congress the sides likely will meet somewhere in the middle that in fact would mean the likelihood of another coronavirus bill even if it s months from now the eye popping 3 trillion price tag traumatized some democrats conservative and moderate democrats worried about the sheer size of the legislation democrats with competitive races fretted that republicans would weaponize the bill to show what s wrong with the democratic party they d argue that liberals including reps alexandria ocasio cortez d n y hijacked the legislation tilting things way to the left however the bill also gave those facing competitive races an opportunity they could boomerang the vote for their benefit voting nay demonstrated opposition to the legislation and independence from pelosi in the end 14 democrats most from competitive districts voted no on the measure many members of congress including some in my own party have decided to use this package as an opportunity to make political statements and propose a bill that goes far beyond pandemic relief said rep abigail spanberger d va who flipped a district from red to blue in 2018 therefore i will respectfully vote against this bill rep cindy axne of iowais another democrat who claimed a district from a republican last cycle she expressed the same reservations i am deeply troubled by numerous provisions in this bill that could see large amounts of taxpayer dollars allocated to helping those who are not hurting at all axne said i could not in good conscience vote to accept this washington gamesmanship still many liberals said they wanted even more something in the 4 trillion range could you blame house liberals it was pelosi herself who encouraged her caucus to go big pelosi advised democrats to expect a massive number on the fifth coronavirus bill because interest rates are so low the interest rates and the prospect of access to credit has bolstered the stock market we intend to use those interest rates to bolster the american people in other words debt has never been this cheap pelosi absorbed flak from her left flank for the last coronavirus bill the measure totaled 484 billion much of it to beef up the popular paycheck protection program ppp for small businesses but house democrats added money and provisions for underbanked communities which often lacked access to capital they tacked on extra health assistance senate republicans originally wanted only to approve 251 billion for the ppp on the spot pelosi would have none of that house minority leader kevin mccarthy joins sean hannity on hannity that s why this plan was an homage to liberal democrats in pelosi s caucus who weren t pleased with the previous coronavirus legislation even though ocasio cortez was the only democrat to vote against the earlier bill still this bill didn t have enough for some progressives such as rep pramila jayapal d wash who voted no i can t go home to the people and tell them that this is going to get money in their pockets jayapal said i guess i wished we were putting forward a bill with state and local funding a paycheck guarantee top house democrats left out the white house and senate republicans when drafting this legislation that essentially meant it s not going anywhere and would be dead in the senate two weeks ago house majority leader steny hoyer d md said he didn t want to pass a bill that was just a message well if the bill passed only in the house it s simply a message bill and top democrats directed part of the message at house liberals here s the pie in the sky measure we spent exhaustively you can check a lot of boxes and say you voted for the bill but this bill is not going to become law that s the message it s also a message to voters concerned about the coronavirus democrats could now gang up on mcconnell and portray him as the grim reaper again willing to block virtually any legislation comingover from the house democrats seized on mcconnell s statement earlier this month that it was time to hit the pause button on more coronavirus spending mcconnell made a preemptive strike on the bill in a floor speech last thursday he characterized the plan as a totally unserious effort and a democratic wish list the kentucky republican hit all the white hot topics contending the bill will cut checks specifically for illegal immigrants he noted that the word cannabis showed up in the legislation 69 times more times than the word job and four times as many as the word hire mcconnell then repeated his argument about cannabis if you followed mcconnell s metric that meant he used the word cannabis more than he used the word job or hire in his own remarks but who s counting it still reads like the speaker of the house pasted together random ideas from her most liberal members and slapped the word coronavirus on top of it mcconnell charged to be frank that s kind of the slapdash approach to this bill that s because pelosi seemingly wanted to include something for everyone that s another part of the message pelosi was saying to the left i hear you and she undoubtedly viewed this measure as the start of a negotiation there may be no bicameral coronavirus bill on the radar now but there almost certainly will be another one in the future perhaps this summer federal reserve chairman jerome powell indicated recently that lawmakers may need to do more to salvage the economy additional fiscal support could be costly but worth it if it helps avoid long term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger economy powell said this trade off is one for our elected representatives who wield powers over taxation and spending in short you can t get there justby reopening and flinging the doors open to bars restaurants and hair salons even republican sens josh hawley of missouriand cory gardner of coloradointroduced legislation they calledthe rehire america bill the plan would award temporary wage increases to workers brought back to their jobs and the federal government would provide incentives such as credits to reopen and rehire it s unclear how much such a program would cost but one could envision that package spiraling into the hundreds of billions of dollars considering how much cash washington spent on the paycheck protection program to boost small businesses mcconnell dismisses dem bill as aposparade of absurdities apos after mcconnell finished excoriating the democrats bill he conceded in an interview with colleague bret baier that we all believe another bill is going to be necessary he declined to paste a due date on the next piece of legislation mcconnell asserted only that it s going to include liability protection in order to get through the senate mcconnell said he wanted to impose restrictions for suing due to coronavirus citing concerns that bankruptcies would skyrocket but it means both leaders have set the stage both have faced pressures from their respective caucuses and conferences pelosi s caucus wanted action the passage of a big bill that happened mcconnell s membership demand
