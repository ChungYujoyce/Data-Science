of the annual united nations gathering in new york and through his attorney rudolph w giuliani the president blasted mr biden and son hunter as corrupt they said the younger mr biden raked in millions

canterbury for atf director the president declared later in the day joe biden and his son are corrupt mr giuliani a former u s attorney in new york took to the airwaves and social media to call on democrats to investigate the bidens for big money selling public office if dem party doesn t call for an investigation of bidens millions from ukraine and billions from china they will own it mr giuliani tweeted the biden campaign responded that the president is lashing out in desperation against the former vice president mr biden s top spokeswoman kate bedingfield also said mr trump is trying to obscure his efforts to pressure ukraine s president for damaging information about the bidens allegedly in return for u s military aid what we have here is the president of the united states trying to pressure a foreign country to make up stuff about the political opponent at home that he fears the most joe biden ms bedingfield said on msnbc in washington the democratic chairs of the house permanent select committee on intelligence oversight and reform and foreign affairs committees sent a letter monday to secretary of state mike pompeo demanding documents related to the accusations that the president and mr giuliani pressured the ukrainian government to investigate the bidens seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an american election undermines our sovereignty democracy and the constitution which the president is sworn to preserve protect and defend wrote democratic reps adam b schiff of california elijah e cummings of maryland and eliot l engel of new york yet the president and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election the story has gained in intensity and partisan fury since last week when a government whistleblower s complaint came to light over mr trump s phone call in late july with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky the administration has refused to turn over the complaint to congressional democrats but an inspector general who reviewed it has deemed the matter urgent in the call mr trump reportedly urged the ukrainian leader to investigate the bidens at the time the u s was debating whether to release 250 million in aid for ukraine which it later did and added 140 million the president denied monday that he pressured mr zelensky in exchange for u s aid i did not make a statement that you have to do this or i am not going to give you aid mr trump told reporters i wouldn t do that i put no pressure on them whatsoever i could have mr trump said his conversation with the ukrainian leader was a very honorable call there was no pressure put on them whatsoever he said it could probably possibly have been ok if i did but i didn t put any pressure on them whatsoever you know why because they want to do the right thing and they know about corruption and they probably know that joe biden and his son are corrupt they probably know that joe biden and his son are corrupt sen mitt romney utah republican and a frequent critic of mr trump said monday that such disputes about the conversation s details indicate that the administration should release the transcript of the call to congress what has been alleged by some news sources is that the president asked for an investigation into mr biden that would be in my view very inappropriate and a very serious allegation itself so let s find out what exactly what was said mr romney said monday he added that it would be very helpful to see the transcript the president and mr giuliani are calling for investigations of hunter biden s pocketing of at least 3 million 50 000 per month for a job on the board of the ukrainian gas company burisma holdings he got the job in 2014 shortly after he was discharged from the navy reserves for testing positive for cocaine his father was playing a prominent role in the obama administration s foreign policy hunter biden now 49 left the post in april when his term expired the 3 million was wired to hunter biden through accounts in cyprus and latvia according to reports that the washington times did not independently verify in 2016 mr biden visited kyiv as vice president and threatened to withhold 1 billion in u s loan guarantees unless the country s leaders fired ukraine s top prosecutor for alleged corruption the prosecutor also was looking into the gas company although hunter biden apparently was not a target the bidens also have been implicated in a billion dollar deal in china in his book secret empire peter schweizer described a trip mr biden and his son took to china in 2013 aboard air force two less than two weeks later hunter biden s law firm made a 1 billion deal with a subsidiary of the chinese government s bank of china the deal later swelled to 1 5 billion according to the book a lot of money from china mr trump said monday china would love nothing they d rather see than biden get elected because they would take this great trade deal that we re about to make and they would really have themselves a deal mr giuliani asked on twitter how president barack obama allowed the bidens to make big money selling public office and whether the democrats will continue to condone and enable this kind of pay for play mr biden has said he did nothing wrong and that he never discussed the business deals with his son investigative journalist john solomon unearthed a stream of bank documents that showed more than 3 million flowing from burisma holdings to rosemont seneca partners llc a hedge fund run by hunter biden and his business partner devon archer rosemont received regular burisma transfers of more than 166 000 a month in 2014 and 2015 while mr biden was mr obama s point man on ukraine and as russian troops were tormenting the country according to those reports the fired prosecutor viktor shokin told mr solomon that hunter biden was on a list of board members who would be interrogated in the burisma corruption investigation in a speech last year at a washington think tank mr biden boasted of threatening ukrainian leaders in 2016 to fire the prosecutor i looked at them and said i m leaving in six hours if the prosecutor is not fired you re not getting the money mr biden recalled telling then ukrainian president petro poroshenko well son of a bitch he got fired and they put in place someone who was solid at the time mr biden told the council on foreign relations event insisting that mr obama was aware of the threat mr trump said he is the target of another democrat witch hunt with the whistleblower s complaint about his phone conversation with the president of ukraine here we go again they failed with
