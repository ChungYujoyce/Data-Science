opinion having attracted an estimated crowd of 25 000 30 000 people in mobile alabama this past week and a record 24 million viewers watching the first republican debate it s hard to believe that donald trump is hurting the republican party those who adhere to this view are engaging in wishful thinking they are missing the importance of branding and marketing within today s political arena these pundits see branding and marketing merely as thesaurus alternatives to words like selling and communicating without understanding these two vital constructs by dismissing the importance of these two disciplines they miss what a successful candidate barack obama did to win the presidency in 2008 it should be no secret that the robustness of both specialties has been proven and to win must be utilized by candidates and their respective political parties top stories purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni australian researchers see virus design manipulation cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces branding is the reason mr trump leads in the polls he is a celebrity brand that people love presently but can be easily dismissed by a demanding public mr trump knows how to brand himself and implement this strategy within his promotional mix this is good for brand trump and republicans because this tactic is getting people who are not politically oriented to stop look and listen he is initiating a discussion where he engages the public on issues concerning immigration american leadership in the world and making america strong again he answers questions in simple generalities without a policy statement to confuse or bore even the most sophisticated mr trump breaks through the clutter he is a personality who loves television and whose audience loves him back his poll numbers are high because of his notoriety and this is all good news for all republican candidates in general but for no one in particular at this time however these trump poll numbers should be put into perspective as former chief strategist and media advisor for mr obama david axelrod recently said in terms that mr trump the beauty brand ceo would appreciate we re still in the swimsuit competition it gets harder in the talent rounds and it is in the talent rounds where the other candidates can present their respective brand characteristics that got them to the show with that said it is the corporate brand or the republican party that is presently benefiting from this trump promotional machine why because many more potential voters are listening as a result of mr trump s genius which is a good thing despite what many critics say but promotion alone doesn t win elections marketing does barack obama was a great speaker cool candidate and crowd getter but it was his marketing tactics voter segmentation analysis organization getting the vote out through volunteers motivating students to work for the first time in politics and his ability to understand retail politics sitting down with the folks that got him to the white house mr trump on the other hand is a great promotor but not necessarily a great marketer marketing is the art and science of satisfying the needs of customers or in this case voters branding on the other hand is one component of the marketing whole this means that mr trump needs more than getting his name out to his target market getting his supporters to vote show up on primary day is the next objective to win the nomination candidate obama understood this and the jury is out whether mr trump does high poll numbers have a strange effect on candidates who and must always be reminded by their political team that polls don t win elections votes do mr trump should be retold that harry reid s opponent sharron angle had poll numbers that predicted she would beat him in the 2010 nevada senate race senator reid won the election what mr trump must do is implement a marketing strategy that calculates how to get his primary voters to select him as their candidate even before that he must get those who support him in the polls actually go to the polls on primary day this means designing a retail political organization and then listening to political professionals for whom he has little or no respect after the republican candidate has been selected the real marketing takes place the republican party elders should remember one simple marketing shibboleth people buy brands not companies this means that unless you they are brand loyal republicans or democrats people vote the person not the party think in terms of whether one is a brand loyal pepsi or coke drinker or is a shopper who waits for each week s sale price to make a choice as to what brand he or she will buy the same goes for political candidates in the end it will be the candidate and not the party despite what party activists feel that the electorate believes will get the job done or is the special of the week who wins if the republican leadership remembers that it is what the voter wants in a candidate whoever it is then and only then will they benefit from the promotional acumen of brand trump dr john
