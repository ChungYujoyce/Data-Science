the party s voters will finally get their say on her candidacy top stories australian researchers see virus design manipulation coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history russian fighter jets intercept u s navy patrol aircraft over mediterranean clinton s campaign has argued that as voters learned more about his record sanders will begin to lose support instead it seems that as sanders has

maintains a commanding lock on the party s leadership an associated press survey of superdelegates who are influential in picking the nominee found that 449 of the party insiders back clinton while

significant advantage over clinton among all voters on each of those measures just 30 percent of all voters consider clinton honest i was going to bite my tongue and vote for hillary but i never really trusted her said robert stone a 59 year old from hilton head south carolina who already cast an absentee ballot for sanders every time she opens her mouth i can t help but think she s lying
