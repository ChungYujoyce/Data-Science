apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap president donald trump said he probably wouldn t watch but former special counsel robert mueller s testimony before congress on wednesday proved irresistible the president fired off an onslaught of tweets before the back to back hearings even began at 8 30 a m all told he tweeted and retweeted more than two dozen times on mueller s testimony about his investigation into the president and the trump campaign s ties to russia as it ended trump tweeted truth is a force of nature top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time then he strode out of the white house and took a victory lap in front the reporters and cameras assembled on the south lawn it s over trump declared he blasted the phony cloud created by the investigation and said there was no defense to this ridiculous hoax this witch hunt the investigation had cast a two year shadow over the white house unnerving aides stalling staffing and triggering hundreds of angry tweets from the president many of which involved phrases like no collusion no obstruction and witch hunt for all of that the president had insisted earlier in the week i m not going to be watching probably maybe i ll see a little bit of it as it turned out that statement wouldn t have survived the fact checks to which so many of trump s claims are subjected the television conscious president referenced fox news coverage of the hearings in several of his tweets and revealed that he was watching closely enough to deliver a detailed review of mueller s presentation the performance was obviously not very good he had a lot of problems trump said pointing to mueller s lack of familiarity with some aspects of the investigation and accusing him of playing favorites this was a devastating day for democrats even as the testimony was still under way republicans were claiming it as a win rudy giuliani the president s lawyer blasted mueller s frequent stumbles and calls for questions to be repeated tweeting that the former fbi director was being destroyed on credibility knowledge competence and numerous ahs pauses and excuses like beyond my purview mueller s nationally televised appearance on capitol hill was long anticipated as a potential pivot point for the presidency one that could galvanize more house democrats toward impeachment or help dispel the investigatory cloud that has shadowed the white house ever mindful of the need to spin powerful televised images trump and his fellow republicans unleashed a barrage of tweets and statements that continued a pattern of attacks in which trump has made baseless claims about mueller s probe and its findings so democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime try pinning it on a very innocent president and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our country they call it obstruction trump wrote in one early tweet wrong why didn t robert mueller investigate the investigators in fact the mueller report did not declare there was no collusion between russia and the trump campaign nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice trump also revived a baseless charge that mueller was highly conflicted mueller a longtime republican was cleared by the justice department s ethics experts to lead the russia investigation trump over the last week had been speculating with confidants about how the hearings would go and while he expressed no worry that mueller would reveal anything damaging trump was irritated that the former special counsel was being given the national stage according to two republicans close to the white house they spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations wary of americans being captivated by finally hearing mueller speak at length trump seethed to one adviser that he was annoyed democrats would be given a tool to ramp up their investigations and that cable networks would have new footage of mueller to play on loop though the probe did not result in charges of criminal conspiracy or obstruction there has been growing concern among those close to the president that mueller s appearance could push undecided or reluctant democrats toward impeachment by the day s end trump weighed in on that prospect too impeachment s over trump tweeted just before air force one landed in west virginia where the president was attending a closed fundraiser lemire reported from new york follow lemire on twitter at http twitter com jonlemire and superville at http twitter com dsupervilleap for more of ap s coverage o
