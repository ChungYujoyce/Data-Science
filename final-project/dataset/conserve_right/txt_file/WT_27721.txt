or house seat becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion you don t have to be jewish to know that land disputes between nations can be volatile and intractable things today one such dispute finds two nuclear powers facing off and its resolution in which one fifth of the world s population hangs in the balance is in president trump s power to shape one year before israel was born an autonomous region known as kashmir came into being a result of the end of the british empire in india and the establishment of a neighboring muslim majority nation called pakistan and since that day in 1947 india and pakistan have been in conflict over kashmir which lies between them two weeks ago india announced that it would abandon kashmir s autonomous status and moved quickly to further militarize the region creating a virtual blackout of information and electricity for millions of residents kashmir is a delicate issue that the united states and the united nations as well as india and pakistan have worked hard to balance over the years especially given the nuclear stakes india s move is thus a break with this tradition of diplomatic even handedness and military restraint if the lessons of israel palestine teach us anything it is that blunt unilateral force is not a true solution but a path to conflict and war indeed pressure is building upon the indian and pakistani leadership to take decisive action top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick given that india and pakistan are both nuclear powers escalation of tensions between the two countries is incredibly dangerous just last month president trump in a meeting with new pakistani prime minister imran khan offered to personally mediate the dispute america is now in a complicated position on the issue we have forged trading and security alliances with both india and pakistan over the decades each country has a large diaspora in the united states while nuanced diplomacy has ensured that the united states has not faced a zero sum game between the two it is time the united states use its moral and strategic leverage to get both sides to the table to address the issue of kashmir once and for all there are humanitarian legal and security interests in such intervention the first step is for the united states to convince india to return to the status quo ante the line of control prior to the recent crackdown that step will build confidence calm simmering tensions respect long standing international agreements and create room for negotiations those negotiations given the scale and gravity of the kashmir issue must be mediated and multilateral indeed until president trump s offer to mediate the dispute has festered as a bilateral standoff the most immediate benefit to talks will be to the the 12 million people of kashmir who continue to suffer their plight must be addressed and a number of international organizations like the united nations and ngos such as amnesty international are sounding the alarm bell over human right violations including persecution of minorities in the region peace between india and pakistan means security for them and the possibility to at last develop and grow it would be hard not to see the applicability of israel palestine like kashmir this delicate piece of land the size of new jersey hangs in a balance maintained by international organizations the united states and neighboring countries the u n partition plan for palestine sought to give self determination to two groups the jewish people and palestinian arabs in a region that had chafed under british and ottoman rule over time the balance has shifted and the united states has helped israel make peace with former enemies but the surrounding countries friend or foe play an integral role in the balance of power if the balance collapses the levant could devolve into war what s more like kashmir the israeli palestinian situation is far from being solved and neither side is happy with the status quo yet maintaining the balance in the region allows a future negotiated peace to be possible a two state solution like an independent kashmir is an eventual goal kept alive by an equilibrium of treaties actions by the two sides and foreign involvement and when an actor violates the status quo and breaks that equilibrium the eventual goal of true stable autonomy is destroyed and then comes inevitable war cooler heads must prevail both sides should immediately accept president trump s offer to mediate the conflict first to de escalate the current crisis then to address the final status issues that can no longer be ignored america fatigued by conflict and eager to stay out of foreign entanglements must again summon our historic role in promoting peace and democracy failure and the prospect of nuclear war is simply not an option jack rosen is president of the american
