guy benson for a wide ranging interview among the topics they discussed was the future of the u s supreme court benson began by asking johnson about recent comments made by his running mate former massachusetts gov william weld in which weld named justice stephen breyer and judge merrick garland as the sort of judicial candidates that the libertarian ticket would be considering bill has backed away from naming those names johnson told benson that disavowal will no doubt come as a relief to many libertarians this is the same stephen breyer after all who joined the pro government majority in the eminent domain debacle kelo v city of new london it s the same stephen breyer who dissented in the gun rights cases d c v heller and mcdonald v chicago the same stephen breyer who frequently votes to grant broad leeway to police and prosecutors in fourth amendment cases as for merrick garland president obama s languishing pick to replace the late justice antonin scalia his record as i ve previously noted reflects a version of legal liberalism that tends to line up in favor of broad judicial deference to law enforcement and wartime executive power breyer and garland are not exactly libertarian legal heroes according to johnson what weld was really trying to accomplish by name checking breyer and garland was to point out that we were really going to be bipartisan that we really were trying to bring together both sides of this nevertheless johnson conceded to benson i think bill if he had it all to do over again he would not have named names benson then asked johnson about his opposition to imposing litmus tests on scotus nominees would you have any litmus tests for a supreme court justice on cases like kelo for example cases that really matter to libertarians libertarian principles benson asked yeah i think kelo is one that really does stand out johnson responded although we don t have litmus tests but kelo really stands out as a litmus test in my opinion most libertarians will be cheered to hear that unfortunately for johnson he spoiled the effect somewhat by appearing genuinely shocked a moment later when benson noted the role that justice breyer played in that particular case did breyer actually uphold kelo johnson asked benson yeah he did benson replied he was in the majority in that case oh my gosh johnson declared i think it s safe to assume that johnson weld won t be dropping stephen breyer s name anymore related is scotus a good reason to support trump libertarian and conservative legal experts weigh in advertisement next

report abuses siv please read the article before commenting yeah baby woooooo better yet don t comment the truth hurts team lp fanboi the what who is this siv person you all keep yammering about he might have the day off i imagine his knees and jaw are pretty tired after the threads last night was he at trump s all you can eat backdoor buffet again again more like still it s pretty much a 24 7 trump cum guzzling feast for that dickhead reeding iz 4 faggits n cucks 1 11 11 and this shows one of the manifold reasons i won t be wasting my vote on johnson the guy pretends to knowledge he doesn t have to be fair this doesn t differentiate him from any other politician except that he s worse at pretending otherwise what politician doesn t admiral stockdale it d be great if interviewers stopped feeding him answers nick s interview last week was atrocious i wonder if guy didn t bring up kelo in the question whether johnson would have mentioned that case at all as a not litmus test litmus test you saw that too huh actually he admits to not knowing stuff including in this article which is pretty damn rare among politicians that being said not knowing breyer is a terrible scotus justice along with to some extent all the other ones wtf yeah his ignorance isn t the problem it s his incurious attitude and deference to the status quo that s what pot will do to you lack of curiosity maybe deference to the status quo not so much okay that s what pot does to me the problem is that a good politician should be able to say i m not familiar with x but in a problem like this my philosophy is to do y unfortunately gj doesn t have a philosophy he is trying to be a middle of the road get along type of guy who is beholden to keeping everyone happy rather than reducing the scope and size of government because the intersection of left and right politics is an unprincipled morass of feelz this is why he or weld pays lip service to leftist causes like abortion gun rights or scotus it flies directly in the face of liberty instead trying to create a mushy middle ground that will keep everyone happy and actually pleases no one it s worse than that thanks to the socialist gary johnson and his gun hating side kick the libertarian party is now doomed to another 30 years of irrelevance how the hell does this happen every where you turn in this cuntry socialism statism that disavowal will no doubt come as a relief to many libertarians not really at risk of perpetuating the crab bucket libertarianism i too am not relieved to hear that weld just misspoke did he also misspeak when he said anyone who s on a terrorist watchlist be able to buy any gun i m also not relieved to hear that calling illegals illegal is very incendiary at some point you have to call a spade a spade call a spade oh what you did there im not worried about weld the most likely path to the wh for johnson ends up with a vice president pence at some point you have to call a spade a spade that pussy wouldn t even say that phrase for fear of alienating the precious precious blm sters and their divisive dumpster fire for fear of being branded a bigot and evulz racizt he s white he s old he s a he and he s not a cringing progressive intersectionalist not on paper anyway that ship has sailed ar 15s are weapons of mass destruction dude william weld said so what is more likely the truth the first thing that came out if your mouth or what came out after you realized the first thing you said was angering your supporters yeah exactly when someone changes their mind under public pressure the reaction isn t the past is forgotten all is well the reaction is nice cya there gary s newer comments aren t exactly substantive either he seems to only nod about kelo when prompted it would be more encouraging if he said more than yeah that s probably important and maybe suggested a few issues himself without being spoonfed far more entertaining will be the post election sit down with doug benson i was going to say something similar that an interview with doug benson would be far more interesting especially if they re both baked he does non baked interviews benson that is bill has backed away from naming those names i think bill if he had it all to do over again he would not have named names something about this weld johnson ticket is a little off now they re sounding like a real political party kelo stands out but heller doesn t and neither does citizens united moreover the entire democratic party is against both cases there is no way to be bi partisan and work with both sides without walking away from cu at this point it is fair to say that the lp and by extension reason and a large section of the libertarian movement has walked away from the uncompromising support of the 2nd amendment and the right to free political speech that is pretty fucking sad bipartisan means not libertarian you can t please the rs and ds with a libertarian scotus nominee no you cannot since when did libertarian come to mean bipartisan and centrist and work with everyone johnson is like bizzaro spock libertarian isn t the entire reason for the lp that both parties in their own ways loath freedom 1 bearded vulcan bipartisan generally means the average citizen is about to get fucked let s think of some recent high profile bipartisan efforts by congress the usa patriot act the iraq war tarp the national defense authorization act of 2012 the 2015 budget i know i m leaving off plenty war on drugs i d rather something be bipartisan than common sense although put the two together and you re screwed social security medicare and aid for families with dependent children conservatives love janice rogers brown the typical constitutional conservative s dream scotus justice is going to be almost exactly the same as the typical libertarian or it would ve been until the recent development of libertarian as meaning an sjw who like the central planners to give us a few choices jrb is one judge and while she s a very good one the slate of conservative favored jurists runs the gamut although i applaud the republicans in the senate for resisting obama s moderate appointee if the same guy had been nominated by a republican he would be confirmed without much resistance i think prolefeed has it backwards it s not that conservatives would necessarily oppose a libertarian it s that they d more often than not settle for someone who s not libertarian it s not that conservatives would necessarily oppose a libertarian it s that they d more often than not settle for someone who s not libertarian yes their preference is for judges who strongly align with limited government principles and a literal reading of the constitution but they will support a gop president s nominee unless it is someone like harriet miers they intrpret fierce opposition by senate democrats and liberal legal scholars as some sort of endorsement much like capital l libertarians in the last 3 presidential elections although to be fair bob barr had some credibility as a civil libertarian yes their preference is for judges who strongly align with limited government principles and a literal reading of the constitution if only their preference is for judges who will tell them what they want to hear in senate hearings sometimes that translates into jurisprudence free speech objections aside the past two election cycles 2014 with cantor 2016 with sanders jeb trump etc have demonstrated that all of the hand wringing and fears over the effects of cu were completely wrong if anything it s shown that campaign spending beyond a certain low point is an enormous waste of resources the msm of course will not point this fact out as they are the financial beneficiaries of the current approach the effects of cu is that the government can t declare criticizing politicians illegal of course the justification for campaign finance restrictions was always bullshit jeb spent over 53 million per delegate won trump just under forty thousand if that were paid directly to the delegate bush would have done much much better at this point it is fair to say that the lp and by extension reason and a large section of the libertarian movement has walked away from the uncompromising support of the 2nd amendment and the right to free political speech this assumes that the lp is somehow the center of mass of the libertarian movement it isn t i have discussed the lp with a significant number of libertarians and in my experience the overwhelming majority of them 80 will have nothing to do with the lp considering it either to be dominated by sell outs who compromise in a desperate bid for electoral success full of nut jobs a scam a waste of time and an unfunny joke i think the lp is actually one of the most minor and least influential components of the liberty movement and has nowhere near the popularity and influence that outsiders assume it must have okay the lp reason and a significant portion of the libertarian movement that is still pretty sad i used to be the chair of a state lp party and the people i met there were dedicated to liberty now if you look at a cost benefit analysis of whether the lp is the most effective way of getting more liberty at the margins mmm maybe not at least from an anarchist perspective johnson wasn t asked about either of those two cases in the interview john so i m not sure why you would expect him to bring them up as for his positions on them was the citizens united supreme court decision good for america i think it the citizens united case comes under the first amendment that they should be able to contribute as much money as they want source thomas r eddlem the other candidates for president thenewamerican com aug 20 2012 out of hillary trump and stein he is the only one on record supporting the citizens united ruling i didn t find any mention of him specifically on heller but he also has had the most consistent record of supporting gun rights 1 mistaken impression he was asked if he had litmus tests and which if any cases stood out and he said he didn t have any litmus tests and that kelo was the one case that stood out so neither heller nor cu stand out to him and both cases are negotiable otherwise there would be a litmus test and i didn t say he opposed those cases he doesn t he just doesn t care about them and views them as something that can be traded to get things he considers more important if you want to vote for johnson fine but don t ever again claim that gun rights are that important to you because they are clearly not important to johnson and that doesn t bother you he is focused on wrongly decided cases no need to worry about heller stare decisis takes care of it heller was a 5 4 decision stare decisis isn t going to take care of it moreover even if it were not technically overturned future courts could limit it to its facts to such a degree it would become virtually meaningless heller has to be a priority and it just isn t for johnson johnson doesn t give a fuck he cares about sorry pot mexicans and gay rights those seem to be the three issues he won t trade away yep the lower federal courts have been generally hostile to the second amendment they have already rubberstamped as permissible new york city s 340 permit fee and one year process to get a permit to keep a handgun in your own home discriminatory gun carry permitting in new york new jersey maryland california and hawaii where only those who are wealthy and connected are allowed to carry a gun outside the home for self defense a safe storage law in san francisco that requires homeowners to keep guns on their person or locked up when they are sleeping or in the shower directly contradicting the heller ruling a complete ban on any gun possession by anyone who has a doctor s prescription for medical marijuana bans on firearms based upon cosmetic appearance this is the most troubling because the bogus legal reasoning behind these bans leaves the door wide open to wide bans on entire classes of firearms not just the so called assault weapons expect a hillary clinton supreme court to uphold all of these laws and more including enabling the bankruptcy of gun makers by frivolous lawsuit enabling the bankruptcy of gun makers by frivolous lawsuit i expect instead they will arrive at some sort of settlement which includes taxing the everloving shit out of guns and ammo those seem to be the three issues he won t trade away hardly he s a mush on pot he doesn t really understand immigration and his position on gay rights and related issues is incoherent yeah i think kelo is one that really does stand out johnson responded although we don t have litmus tests but kelo really stands out as a litmus test in my opinion self contradict much there gayjay fucking imbecile any frequenter of this site can rattle off at five of the best worst scotus cases of both recent and historical memory yes they all are litmus tests stop embarrassing yourself gayjay you wanted weld you got welded good and hard own it gayjay it is not just overturning the five worst it is all of the good ones that are in danger as lousy as kelo is it is not as important or as damaging as overturning citizens united and heller would be how the hell can anyone who claims to be a conservative or libertarian be asked about the supreme court and both citizens united and heller not be at the top of the list i don t think johnson is an imbecile i think he is just being honest he really doesn t give a shit about the second amendment or political speech yeah he is not actively against gun rights and political free speech he will just happily trade those things away to get the things he does consider important which seem to mostly revolve around pot immigration and gays being able to buy wedding cakes which seem to mostly revolve around pot immigration and gays being able to buy wedding cakes the approved wording is mexicans pot and ass sex no john if this bozo and yes i agree with tarran that gayjay is running a half assed vainglorious alleged campaign doesn t know five hell i will be generous two best worst cases each and more important can explain why they are conducive antithetical to liberty then he is bona fide useless this election is about scotus nothing more nothing less everything else including the economy since so many recent rulings directly effect commerce and the application of the commerce clause is secondary the economy such as it is in the usa will be there scotus is now at least 40 years out with as many as five appointments in the next 4 8 years also obama will withdraw garland from consideration as soon as shrill bot is elected i agree this election is about the scotus and the chance johnson had to make a big impression was to be really forceful on the scotus and gun rights and free speech and ending the parade of horribles the courts have inflicted on us and johnson has basically refused to do that he is just a dud you tell me what he is doing to further or better explain the cause of freedom because i don t see it all i see is him telling the world that libertarians are really leftists who like pot i disagree the election is always about the economy a 1 growth difference compounded over 100 years fixes a lot of shit a 1 growth difference compounded over 100 years fixes a lot of shit and one one scotus case can pre emptively scuttle it you and me i still am bound by the penaltax even in ukr haven t seen the worst of obamneycare yet and that was decided less than five years ago don t tell me that hasn t already had a demonstrable impact on the usa s economy to say nothing of the fourth branch of goverment the regulatory state oh and wickard is the worst worst case ever decided by scotus stare decisis indeed heller and citizens united are important to the voting demographic johnson is trying to attract but because they are against them a social liberals are social liberals to the bone how the hell can anyone who claims to be a conservative or libertarian be asked about the supreme court and both citizens united and heller not be at the top of the list because most people list the wrong decisions at the top of the list not the right ones ask me and kelo would be 1 followed by raich for fairly recent decisions i mean i could go back to slaughterhouse or something i tend not to think about the correct decisions oh for sod s sake robc to convince someone why the bad decisions are incorrect you have to counterbalance with the ones at least an equal number of if not more that are good and can be argued conclusively thoroughly and exhaustively correct then you might be able to sway a heart to sway a mind and must be done in that order you are making the common mistake in addition to this pie in the sky throwing it to the house nonsense my wife and i have better odds simultaneously fingerbanging all of vladimir putin s sloppy seconds whilst getting struck by lighting and crusty takes a vow of celebacy in russian all at the same time than gayjay throwing anything to the house besides fart wafts that people deep down agree with you us recent history and history of the last one hundred years in the usa largely demonstrates otherwise gayjay is not playing eleventy frillion d chess here much less checkers considering that the correct decisions are hanging by a thread and you are being asked about nominating court justices how could they not come to your mind as well johnson was invited to give his litmus tests for justices and he said there were none why should i not take him at his word and conclude that he would appoint someone who was willing to overturn heller if that person was good on other things and appealed to both sides you tell me rob how to square i have not litmus tests and want to work with both sides with saying johnson is not willing to compromise and trade away heller because he also said kelo was a litmus test sorta look at the 4 judges who got kelo right look at how those 4 judges voted on heller and cu see a connection any judge who who overturn kelo would also support heller and cu they all come from the same legal philosophy you dont need a litmus test you need a judge whose legal philosophy is correct and then there is no need for litmus tests so anyone who supports kelo will automatically support heller that is just not true there are critics of kelo from the left and not every person on the right supports gun rights in any meaningful way see for example weld if weld were on the court would you trust him not to overturn heller or limit it to nothing i wouldn t come on rob any judge who who overturn kelo would also support heller and cu they all come from the same legal philosophy every single justice who has been nominated has deviated either narrowly or broadly from the ideology of every president who nominated them without exception you nor i truly know how justices may rule once confirmed earl warren anyone you need a judge whose legal philosophy is correct which is wait for it a litmus test as scores of scotus judges have shown even ideologically congruent justices have arrived at same or similar opinions but not being 100 in agreement via written opinion which legal philosophy is correct the only way you ll get your definition of correct robc is you get nominated and confirmed my litmus test is the constitution will the justice adhere to the words written there to their interpretation of it sure my litmus test is a literal litmus test so i can figure out which one of these hoes is a basic bitch ph 11 oh my gosh johnson declared my breakfast is coming up my stomach responded donald fucking trump talks more often and in more uncompromising terms about gun control than gary johnson i don t say that as any kind of endorsement of trump i point it out as a way to shame libertarians who are shilling for this guy what on earth is going on well for starters trump saying he ll do something is an unusually unreliable indicator of future performance donald trump uncompromising on anything you gotta be kidding he s supported assault weapon bans all sorts of gun control measures go find a fattie to keep your typing fingers busy you miss the point my point is not that trump is good from a libertarian perspective my point is that he is bad and yet still manages to consider gun rights to be more important than johnson yes trump sucks and johnson has managed to suck worse that is my point johnson didn t want to stand out by being the only broadly acceptable candidate in the race broadly acceptable first there are no female libertarians and second chicks don t like it when you call them broads what on earth is going on two phenomena that show up in movement after movement 1 people start compromising when power looks achievable we have a chance to get our guy in office all we have to do is soft pedal x we can do that next year don t make the perfect the enemy of the good 2 people vote for the lesser of evils sure he sucks on x but can you imagine how much worse it will be on issues x y z if the other guy s win the election you yourself have pointed out how successfully the leftists have used 1 to transform our society from a generally liberal one to the proggie dystopia that is gradually coming into focus and of course 2 is so common that in every election a majority of voters are following its logic to make their choice i understand all of that and yes compromise is necessary to accomplish anything the question is what issues are you willing to compromise on and what issues are you not the thing with johnson is that he is about being reasonable and broad appealing when it comes to things like gun rights and religous liberty he is uncompromising on open borders pot and cutting spending that tells you where his priorities lie and what his real beliefs are my problem with him is that i have a different set of priorities and beliefs if letting the democrats continue to spend money is the price of keeping the 2nd amendment it is a sucky choice but better than the alternative i disagree with the drug laws but being able to smoke pot is pretty cold comfort when they come to take my ability to defend myself away and its a crime to criticize a politician or practice anything but state approved religions i think johnson has completely whacked out priorities and values my thinking is similar but different i think he isn t a libertarian in that johnson really believes in society being crafted by free people making their own choices that business of we don t want a society that results from business owners being permitted to discriminate between prospective customers is one many statements along those lines i just don t think he values freedom in and of itself it s top men itis but comparatively mild compared to clinton stein or trump not to mention his throwing out the replica gun that austin petersen gave to him when austin pledged austin s loyalty and support to him not only was it unbelievably churlish that episode told me that he really knows very little about leading people as opposed to managing them pot we don t have litmus tests really so he d be perfectly happy to nominate someone who would overturn heller and citizens united fuck that goddam gary i want to vote for you but you aren t making it easy why would you vote for the sob best candidate on my ballot he made kelo a not litmus litmus test can you imagine anyone getting kelo right and getting cu or heller wrong he made kelo a not litmus litmus test so he ll make obamneycare s not tax not penalty but really a tax and a penalty at the same time and call it a fee like that cockamamie carbon fee which is so totes not a tax no way so bae af how much are you willing to compromise robc tell me what s your point of no return with this guy what is your line in the sand what other flips flops and lapses in judgement numero uno being william weld exactly what romney would be if he ended up a pickled scotch soaked lush a better candidate on my ballot then you appear to be implying no matter what this guy does or says and flip flops because voters got pissy with the truth which is most often one s first response you will mindlessly vote for him no matter what nothing this charlatan can say will sway you because team and they say teamberuled voters are mind numbed zombies you didn t answer the question how much are you willing to compromise cede which is what i meant to type i don t expect to get an answer on that one no there isnt nothing he can do as long as he is better than clinton trump stein de la fuente i think that will be the other ky options i will vote for johnson if he falls below one of them i will vote for that one instead however i do have a team reason to vote for him he has a real chance to break 2 which gives all the real libertarian candidates automatic ballot access for the next 4 years including president in 2020 that is a damn good reason for voting for him regardless of anything else i dont know how you read he is better than trump clinton as a mindless team response i dont know how you read he is better than trump clinton as a mindless team response 1 you didn t specify that until now in those exact words 2 you still haven t stated what you are willing to cede and to what point is unacceptable i get the ballot access what i want to know is what specifically qualifies the price as too high until that question gets answered discretely and directly then yes i question your overall discernment and you now are in mindless team territory 3 define real hazelmeade authenticity robc authenticity sugarfree authenticity gilmore authenticity tarran authenticity what specifically qualifies the price as too high i think i specified it let me lay it out in more detail since subtle doesnt work 1 i vote i am going to cast a ballot in november i have no problem with people who dont but that isnt me 2 i vote for the candidate i most want to win office x whatever that means 3 the point when johnson becomes unacceptable is when someone else on the ballot becomes more acceptable clinton could renounce her leftist ways and become a goldwater girl again and assuming i believed her she could move ahead of johnson i think i specified it no you didn t and i get it you won t whatever policy position that is your tipping point your fulcrum of yeah he doesn t support this or that so s yep no vote for him you do not a have a clear demarcation like any other team robot don t ever claim you re princinpals yes that was purposeful can t be bought robc because you appear to have a hard time elucidating your principles beyond tallest midget rationale not unlike well johnson and weld frankly and you can t seem to tell me what moreso than johnson weld means either and yes spell out a laundry list of how they fall short insofar as your local races i ll have to defer to your expertise i dont know what is so hard to understand about best candidate on the ballot yeah sometimes that is tallest midget other that staying home what is my choice and staying home doesnt help any i dont think i have any one single principle that would keep me from voting for anyone well pro socialism maybe but even that is a sliding scale i would have preferred to vote for paul instead of johnson but he didnt win and actually i will get to vote for him i would think that i preferred a potential gop candidate to the lp candidate is the opposite of team and paul has issues too im not running so no candidate is perfect so voting for the best is all i got and as i have said a jillion times i voted for barr root johnson weld is an easy vote in comparison actually i was wrong i do have one issue that prevents you from getting me vote were you an active inside participant in the destruction of the usfl that is unforgivable i am not sure what you want i vote for the most pro liberty candidate as best i can calculate do i need to publish my formula or something define real moreso than johnson weld basically the ky lp could put more real libertarian candidates on the ballot easily whether they pass the purity test is personal opinion based on history in local races there is a decent chance alt text dumb and dumber omg y all are just a bunch of purists sarc seriously to follow up on and adapt what some other people have said the only scenario where johnson wins the presidency would not involve weld assuming johnson weld win enough states to throw the election into congress then the senate will choose the vp from the top 2 vote getters who i assume will be trump pence and hillary kaine so the senate will either pick pence or kaine probably on who wins the senate in this election then in the house they will pick from among the top 3 vote getters and each house delegation gets a vote assume there s a deadlock such that neither hillary nor donald wins the house delegations i m not actually sure how that will happen but bear with me some delegations go for donald some for hillary some for gary and a majority cannot be reached assume the democrat kaine wins the vice presidency a reverse scenario can be constructed if pence wins the democratic house members won t want to resolve the deadlock except by voting for hillary which by hypothesis bear with me cannot be done since there s a deadlock but the republican house members may want to vote johnson as an alternative to kaine who is after all a democrat so the donald delegations may join with the johnson delegations to choose johnson in preference to kaine construct a reverse scenario if pence becomes vp this sounds a bit far fetched the good news is weld is out of the picture while your outcome is correct your scenario is wrong house wont consider what the senate is doing for veep at all hillary cant win in the house imo the state by state voting goes against her but i could see the gop coming behind johnson instead of trump house wont consider what the senate is doing for veep at all what does that mean if there s a deadlock in the house the party which wins the vice presidency won t have much of an incentive to compromise in order to resolve the deadlock ummm the house wont be doing anything else until they elect a president and they have nearly 3 weeks to figure it out that could be a couple hundred ballots eh they have experience of dicking around doing nothing i m sure that experience will come in handy if they really don t want to elect anyone but i don t really know what they ll do anyone with better information can educate me gary can be a bumbling rambling incoherent mess no doubt i d love to see how clinton or trump would hold up under this kind of specific and relentless questioning however they would never even agree to an interview of this kind so at the end of the day i d rather vote for the guy who admits he doesn t have all the answers and even gets it wrong now and then better news if just hilldog and trumpster are excluded i don t care who the vp is though i have to hold my nose re weld did breyer actually uphold kelo johnson asked benson yeah he did benson replied he was in the majority in that case oh my gosh johnson declared i like gary johnson i really do but i almost get the impression he s winging it even more than trump look he forgot ok know what i mean puff puff what does the magic dragon have to do with this too much marijuana starts to impact your cognitive functions after a while and you ll never even miss it give poor gary a break it s not like he s ever run for president before the right villainous kevin williamson perhaps americans shouldn t be too quick to mock brazil s awful political scene about 18 billion was misappropriated through the pedaladas fiasco most of which was paid back by way of comparison the u s government made at least 72 billion in improper payments in 2008 mostly through the major entitlement programs a 2014 audit found that a u s government transparency program failed to account for at least 619 billion in spending from 302 federal programs and the data that the government put forward to a rightly skeptical public was in the words of usa today wildly inaccurate we have seen the future at least brazil has some nice beaches corruption leads to poverty it leads to poverty in brazil in chicago in detroit in philadelphia in los angeles in upstate new york and in the rio grande valley capitalism the awesome productive capacity of free people can bear many burdens and defray many costs but it can be perverted and misdirected too from the state run enterprises in brazil and venezuela to the green energy fantasies of u s progressives we see that the real threat to capitalism is not domination but seduction brazil seems to be hearing that gospel we refuse to listen why does kevin d williamson seem more libertarian than the johnson weld combo platter according to johnson what weld was really trying to accomplish by name checking breyer and garland was to point out that we were really going to be bipartisan that we really were trying to bring together both sides of this nevertheless johnson conceded to benson i think bill if he had it all to do over again he would not have named names right because the real problem here is in being too specific and too transparent hide more and be more bland so that no one knows what you re talking about or who you d nominate that s the ticket yeah i think kelo is one that really does stand out johnson responded although we don t have litmus tests but kelo really stands out as a litmus test in my opinion yeah that s it perfect never have a checkable stance on anything make sure that you both are in favor of and against having litmus tests because being too clear on either option would scare away voters people love voting for candidates who are perceived as untrustworthy flip floppers enb never quite captured it in her desperate attempt to put favorable gloss on his answer to the prostitution question but what he actually said was a hilarious combination of 3 different answers his first instinctive response was its a federalism issue let the states decide iow he didn t have any principled view on the matter at all and felt that whatever states do well that s what they do more power to them then anderson cooper reads the lp party platform to him which says that they have a principled stance on self ownership and oppose all decriminalization of all victim less crimes gary then says yeah i agree with that despite it contradicting his first point cooper then says so you agree that prostitution is a victimless crime and gary says oh no i think prostitutes are victims weld chimes in that there s all sorts of victimization in prostitution and gives a knowing nod as though you know what i mean cooper remember that time in vegas basically he manages to take 3 or more different positions in the course of about 30 seconds i ve eaten jello that had stronger convictions you see what you did there with the positions and the pros there seems to be a king and burwell missing from that breyer list of accomplishments doing my best jack nicholson you re god damn right i have a litmus test my dear the next five minutes can change your life give a chance to your good luck read this article please move to a better life we make profit on the internet since 1998 http www jobsea3 com is there any issue johnson weld are libertarian on the tpp and cira don t count as they were written and supported by a bipartisan group of the biggest establishment statist hacks in d c so to be libertarian is to be a gadfly you can t agree with the establishment about anything i think we can all agree that dred scott was a poor decision right guys right re gary johnson on scotus we don t have litmus tests but kelo really stands out nothing could further from the truth the kelo decision was a wonderful judicial decision that still reverberates to this day our founding fathers were foolish enough to believe that eminent domain was to be used solely for the purpose of improving property for the public s good how ancient that ridiculous idea is this was the political stone age now thanks to heightened enlightenment our ruling class turds are able to enjoy the benefits of cronyism and political payoffs such progress indeed now our socialist slavers too can enjoy taking money from contractors under the table to build a mall a condo or anything else that strikes the fancy of their benign trustworthy and honorable cronies it is a win win situation the little people s property is stolen by the government and return they get just a fraction of what the property is worth and our socialist sociopaths who enslave us and their cronies make a fortune off of it we should all stop what we are doing and write a thank you note to souter ginsberg and all the other morons from hell who wiped their ass with us constitution and its original intent we can all look forward to more of the same in the future from the members of the soviet supreme court aren t we lucky got that wrong it was to be for public use and not public good like a road which is used by the public as opposed to a pipeline which is for benefit of a private company in what way do i the consumer not benefit from the existence of a pipeline used to transport more oil more efficiently if we make oil as difficult to transport as possible won t that increase costs which are thereby transferred to the customer looks at username oh you know what never mind jack i didn t ask a question go back to your rocking chair facing the corner of the room and resume licking your oversized lollipop listening to calliope music it doesn t matter he thinks he has libertarians dead to rights but that s because he s a stupid liar he doesn t have a problem with eminent domain he has a problem with the pipeline libertarians don t have a problem with the pipeline we have a problem with eminent domain he disingenuously conflates the fact that we don t oppose the pipeline in any and every possible way with the the notion that we must therefore support the use of eminent domain to build it his cult demands the pipeline be stopped and anyone who disagrees must be shamed even if it doesn t make any fucking sense can always count on kbo to apologize and excuse oil well done you are nothing if not predictable hey you ve got an option kbo don t read my comments lord knows i don t read yours unless you re addressing me but you follow me around don t you stop lying about libertarians and i ll stop calling you a liar stop repeating the same discredited bullshit and i ll stop calling you an idiot i don t follow you around you show up and shit all over the place what s wrong with oil we need oil for many things plastics fertilizers gasoline you have a problem with oil no the problem is eminent domain it s just not a problem for the phony libertarians here oh that s right guy you ve missed the point entirely you do benefit it can be construed as doing good adding benefit to the public too bad for you and the phony libertarians here that s not what the constitution calls for it calls for public use go back to hibernation it suits you which is why kelo and the cases that led up to it which allow the legislatures to define public use is such a problem it opens the floodgates of abuse what part of this is so hard for you to understand i might add that every phony uses good like you did trump claimed tearing down that old ladies house was for public good because he was adding jobs you re in good company so you wouldn t have a problem with private property owners selling their property to oil companies to build the pipeline correctly if i freely choose to sell you ve no objections exactly now go and look at all the cases today like bakken where individuals don t want to sell and oil companies are using ed to force them no problem for the phoneys here well okay then but oil companies are hardly the guilty party here government is that s like saying trump wasn t the problem with using ed the point is that damon crusades against ed but never mentions the biggest offenders today oil hypocrisy here is just one example today with individual farmers fighting against ed with the bakken pipeline http www law360 com articles l pipeline you won t see damon even discuss it he s selective about ed victims kelo or the onerous use of eminent domain stands out for libertarians really damon no greater use of onerous ed exists today than that being used by private oil companies who are taking private land for their personal corporate gain well at least here is one libertarian who speaks out against it george phillies speaking about just one recent instance keystone he said this eminent domain for private gain is the mark of the beast that our federal government has been turned into a proprietary tool of the corporate plutocratic interests who see the purpose of government as to rewrite the rules in their personal favor for sure we can t count on you damon for you it depends on just who exactly is taking that private property it s not so much about principle he also said this libertarians across america should condemn the keystone pipeline bill as a scheme to use eminent domain to seize massive amounts of private property for the private gain of a select few oil interests link http independentpoliticalrep blic pain for you it depends on just who exactly is taking that private property it is the exact opposite you re the one who s so fucking concerned with the pipeline while libertarians are concerned with eminent domain in general the pipeline doesn t stand out as especially egregious in that regard except to you because your cult demands it be stopped and doesn t actually give one shit about private property furthermore whoever the fuck george phillies is he s just another concern troll masquerading as a libertartian if the government has become a proprietary tool of corporate plutocratic interests then the people should stop voting for politicians who are so easily bought he s been a libertarian longer than damon idiot i don t give a flying fuck if he thinks nefarious interests control our political process rather than the voters then he s the idiot either pony up with evidence of electoral fraud or else shut up and accept that this what the voters want or at least will tolerate the pertinent question to libertarians is over rights not political bickering by the way reason has quoted him many times in the past but you re not too bright are you way to miss the point i don t know why he doesn t use anthony kennedy as an example of a scotus judge he likes he and weld sure don t know much about the court ron paul supported the kelo decision because of states rights i don t im just pointing that out to people that worship rp way to miss the point paul opposed the mcdonald v chicago decision too because of state rights just fyi we were really going to be bipartisan that we really were trying to bring together both sides of this stop isn t that the problem in the first place bringing both sides together only feeds the statism did breyer actually uphold kelo johnson asked benson yeah he did benson replied he was in the majority in that case oh my gosh johnson declared jesus h christ on a giant pogo stick what a complete and total fucking idiot excuse me sir can i have another brownie these are really good gary johnson campaigning through colorado with a lay over at rocky mountain high confections johnson needs to quit trying to appeal to the non existent angry sanders voters that shipped sailed long ago and they re solidly for despotic hillary i d like to ask johnson weld couldn t you have picked an easy case like lochner libertarians love it and the general public is too ignorant to know anything about it among certain groups of lefties lochner is a dirtier word than plessy or dred scott which is ironic well it looks like gary is about to implode what a wasted opportunity time to elect a new lp chairman and start planning to stop petersen in 2020 the only candidate who was worse than johnson nice article eye care softgel cara mengobati benjolan di payudara must be trying to be an ass and lose on purpose start working at home with google it s by far the best job i ve had

that neither he or anyone else can predict what decisions a supreme court appointee is going to make it also isn t likely that a libertarian could be appointed to the supreme court because a true libertarian would be rejected by the senate supreme court appointees are all government enthusiasts of one stripe or another breyer was not only bad on kelo and on 4th amendment issues he was the main architect of the united states sentencing guidelines a disastrous formulaic approach to federal terms of incarceration he is also a strong champion of the regulatory state who sees no moral or constitutional problem in allowing federal agencies to decide what behavior to criminalize breyer is a very mean and destructive man the fact that gary johnson doesn t know this is just one more clue that johnson doesn t understand the dangers involved in wielding the power of government thanks for sharing mantap bro eye care softgel green world i like this website because give me more information
