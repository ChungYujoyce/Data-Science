 should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion americans know less and less history these days which is a good thing for our candidates running for office either high office or low office one of the reasons americans when polled say barack obama was a great president is that few americans can remember any president other than president obama some remember president george w bush and a few more recall president bill clinton but i suspect they remember bill because he was always a lot of laughs they surely do not recall this pronunciamento the era of big government is over americans deficiency in history is helping president donald trump for sure in this presidential race but even more it is helping the presumptive democratic candidate joe biden he is running his campaign from the basement of his home he has cameras set up down there and who knows he might have a canned audience down there too you know it is canned to erupt with wild applause every time he utters a complete sentence or the canned laughter will begin chuckling when joe smiles or makes a derisive remark about donald trump top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state as a presidential historian i can tell you that joe s basement campaign is the first of its kind ever though personally i think john kerry would have done better in 2004 had he campaigned from his basement and going back in time michael dukakis would almost certainly have done better against george h w bush had governor dukakis campaigned from his basement and forget about appearing with his head protruding from a tank turret while wearing i believe it was a colander atop his head joe s campaign is reminiscent of the good old days when republicans campaigned from their front porches for some reason campaigning from one s front porch always reassured the electorate in the days of james garfield benjamin harrison and william mckinley i suspect that the sedate republicans who voted for these candidates were relieved that the candidates would not be stopping off in their communities the last republican to wage a vigorous campaign from his front porch was warren g harding who with his running mate calvin coolidge was favored with a tremendous victory 1920 my guess is that even h l mencken voted for the ticket after all harding was to provide mencken with many good lines of course today s electorate has no idea who harding was or garfield or harrison or mckinley or even mencken come to think of it they probably have no memory of george washington or of abraham lincoln both were for a certitude great presidents probably as great as mr obama though george owned slaves and abe kept household pets for his young sons at any rate joe is running the first basement campaign in american history and i would not count him out yes i know that he is faced with a growing problem from ms tara reade and she has just come out last week with a document that she got from her ex husband they were married briefly and apparently not happily it is a court filing that affirms he recalls her complaining about the sexual abuse she suffered when she worked in joe s senate office in the early 1990s the democrats are looking into this but as many as 25 percent of them think the democrats should dig up a new nominee it could get worse i have already urged joe to hang tough he has already said that he has no memory of this encounter it is a very sound line of defense after all joe cannot even remember what he said the day before yesterday has he ever thought of trying the defense of ageism i would consider just explaining that at his advanced age it is normal to forget things even a youthful adventure such as reaching under a nubile cutie s garment democrats would not want to be guilty of ageism besides democrats are always the beneficiaries of the media s double standard i can see joe from his basement intoning i remember nothing then he might attack president trump for being slow to respond to covid 11 i am going to enjoy this campaign r emmett tyrrell jr is founder and editor in chief of the american spectator he is the author most recently of the death of liberalism published by thomas n
