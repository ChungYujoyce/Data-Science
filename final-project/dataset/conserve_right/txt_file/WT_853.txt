verify to check their new hires signaling the white house s surrender on one of the best tools to shut down the jobs magnet that spurs illegal immigration in the budget released monday mr trump says he backs the current mostly voluntary version of e verify gone is language from the previous two budgets calling for mandatory nationwide use top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state immigration experts said the administration is setting the table for the 600 page immigration proposal jared kushner the president s son in law has been preparing for months that plan would shift american immigration to a more business friendly system and sources say it does not include mandatory e verify having the budget say otherwise could have been an embarrassing conflict said jessica vaughan policy studies director at the center for immigration studies it had to be changed to stay consistent with kushner s proposal which is at odds with what the president has been saying ms vaughan said it s a takeover of the president s immigration agenda by the special interests who benefit from illegal immigration e verify run by homeland security is an electronic system available to employers to run their new hires information they are told usually instantaneously whether the person is work authorized currently it s voluntary for most companies though federal contractors are supposed to use it and some states have passed laws mandating use as well though not infallible the system is considered the best way to prevent illegal immigrants from taking jobs and has long been the holy grail for security advocates and those pushing for stricter immigration limits the trump budget retreat was dismaying to them i hope it was simply an oversight rather than an indication that the trump administration is abandoning the most effective tool we have to limit illegal immigration and protect the jobs and wages of american workers said rosemary jenks vice president at numbersusa which runs television commercials backing use of e verify the obama administration had also supported mandatory e verify though only as part of a broader legalization of illegal immigrants obama officials figured mandating e verify before then would hurt those illegal immigrants already in the u s denying them jobs or locking them in with their current employers who could then exploit their captive labor the white house budget office did not respond to multiple messages asking about the change homeland security responded to an inquiry by forwarding a press release that didn t mention e verify the department then ignored a follow up email mandatory e verify had been part of mr trump s immigration policy dating back to the campaign it was priority no 9 on his 10 point immigration plan released in august 2016 and was part of his immigration plans in 2017 trump budgets released in 2018 and 2019 both called for mandatory nationwide e verify last year s document had a section labeled reduces illegal immigration work incentives it read the employment of illegal aliens by companies is a violation of the law harms u s workers and contributes to human smuggling document fraud identity theft money laundering and labor violations the budget proposes mandatory nationwide use of the e verify system an online tool that allows businesses to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the united states this year s section is labeled maintains a critical employment verification system and the section about mandatory nationwide use is deleted this year s budget also cuts 3 7 million from e verify s funding the budget says that comes from savings due to efficiencies from using cloud computing and doesn t mean any loss of capabilities ms vaughan said the administration is hoping people see that they re continuing the current voluntary system but don t realize they ve retreated on the promise of mandatory e verify ms vaughan said making it mandatory is critical because otherwise companies won t sign up fearing their competitors would gain an advantage i ve had this conversation with a number of big employers if you ask them why they haven t signed up for e verify the answer is because i don t have to she said indeed it took a series of scandals to get most of mr trump s own companies to sign up with illegal immigrants coming forward to say they d been employed for years at trump resorts one even recounted making the bed in mr trump s own room after those stories the trump organization rushed to sign up for e verify but the president himself suddenly had misgivings in
