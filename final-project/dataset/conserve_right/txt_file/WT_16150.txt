apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic to understand why the impact of president donald trump s tariffs could be felt throughout the united states consider this from the west coast to the great lakes and the gulf of mexico at least 10 percent of imports at many ports could be hit by new tariffs if trump s proposals take full effect according to an exclusive analysis of government data by the associated press ports and ground terminals in nearly every state handle goods that are now or will likely soon be covered by import tariffs and port officials fear this could mean a slowdown in shipping that would have ripple effects on truckers and others whose jobs depend on trade top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey since march the u s has applied new tariffs of up to 25 percent on nearly 85 billion worth of steel and aluminum and various chinese products mostly goods used in manufacturing tariffs are working big time trump tweeted recently the president has argued that the tariffs will help protect american workers and force u s trading partners to change rules that the president insists are unfair to the united states at the same time his administration is preparing to slap tariffs of up to 25 percent on an additional 200 billion in chinese imports many of them parts and materials u s companies depend on along with consumer goods after a public comment period ends thursday these tariffs are the administration s response to its charges that beijing uses predatory tactics to try to supplant u s technological supremacy those tactics include cyber theft and a requirement that american companies hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to china s market u s manufacturers are beginning to respond to the tariffs on friday ford announced that it has abandoned plans to import a crossover version of its focus compact car from china to the u s because of tariffs that took effect in july ford has already said it will exit most of the u s car business as it shifts sharply toward trucks and suvs in new orleans port officials say a tariff related drop in shipments is real not merely a forecast steel imports there have declined more than 25 percent from a year ago according to the port s chief commercial officer robert landry the port is scouting for other commodities it can import but expectations appear to be low in our business steel is the ideal commodity landry said it s big it s heavy we charge by the ton so it pays well you never find anything that pays as well as steel does the port of milwaukee imports steel from europe and ships out agricultural products from the midwest steel imports haven t dropped yet because they are under long term contracts said the port director adam schlicht but there has been an almost immediate halt in outbound shipments of corn because of retaliatory duties imposed by the european union on american products much of the corn he said is just staying in silos they are filled to the brim many other ports have been humming along and even enjoyed an unexpected bump in imports during june and july as u s businesses moved up orders to ship before the new tariffs took effect that started with manufacturing goods and is now spreading to retail items for back to school and christmas some of my retail customers are forward shipping the best they can to offset proposed tariffs says peter schneider executive vice president of t g s transportation a trucking company in fresno california port officials were encouraged by this week s announcement that the united states and mexico had reached a preliminary agreement to replace the north american free trade agreement hoping it might lead to reduced trade barriers canada s participation in any new deal to replace nafta though remains a major question mark the port officials continue to worry though that trump will make good on a plan to expand tariffs to an additional 200 billion in chinese imports a list that includes fish and other foods furniture carpets tires rain jackets and hundreds of additional items tariffs would make those items costlier in the united states and if americans buy fewer of those goods it would likely lead to fewer container ships steaming into u s ports the impact will be felt keenly at west coast ports like los angeles and long beach los angeles mayor eric garcetti relying on information from his port officials said his port the biggest in the united states could suffer a 20 percent drop in volume if the additional 200 billion in tariffs are imposed against chinese goods jock o connell an economist in california who studies trade said he doubts a downturn would be so severe that would match the slump that accompanied the global recession of 2008 but we will see a definite impact here are some of the key findings from the ap analysis u s tariffs will cover goods that are imported at more than 250 seaports airports and ground terminals in 48 states at 18 of 43 customs districts including those representing ports around los angeles san francisco new orleans and houston at least 10 percent of their total import value could be covered by new tariffs if all trump s proposals take effect retaliatory duties by china and other countries cover 27 billion in u s exports eugene seroka executive director of the los angeles port worries that if tariffs make it too expensive to import there will be an impact on jobs seroka and others don t expect layoffs on the docks union longshoremen whose average pay last year on the west coast was 163 000 according to the pacific maritime association which negotiates for the ports often have contract provisions ensuring that they are paid even if there s no work and there are fewer of them than there were a few decades ago because the advent of shipping containers has reduced the need for people on the docks dwayne boudreaux an international longshoremen s association official in louisiana said though that his stevedores are handling about 10 percent less steel from japan because of the new tariffs we don t think it s going to get worse he said but he added who knows that could change from the next press conference the impact might be greater on truck drivers and warehouse workers fewer will be needed according to o connell many drivers who deliver shipping containers from the dock to warehouses are independents contracted by trucking companies and they don t get paid if there is nothing to haul some might leave the profession said weston labar ceo of the harbor trucking association in long beach california it s hard to retain drivers he said if we don t have work for those drivers we re worried they will leave for some other segment of the trucking business or go into another business like construction less shipping means less revenue for the ports something that could limit their ability to pay for expansion and improvement projects according to kurt nagle president of the american association of port authorities he said u s ports are in the midst of a planned 155 billion in infrastructure spending from 2016 through 2020 the current trade war was foreshadowed in january by steep u s tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines it exploded with the u s tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum then came two rounds of duties targeting about 50 billion in imports from china along the way china the european union turkey canada and mexico imposed retaliatory duties on u s goods including farm products and harley davidson motorcycles on top of the 200 billion in additional chinese imports that could face u s tariffs starting next week trump has said that if beijing continues to retaliate he may eventually slap tariffs on all told 450 billion in chinese goods that would be equal to nearly 90 percent of china s 2017 exports to the u s trade wars are usually temporary president george w bush abandoned his steel tariffs after less than two years milwaukee s port director worries however that damage from the current trade dispute could linger canada is increasing corn exports to europe and brazil is trying to pick up the slack in soybean exports to china others are already picking up that business schlicht said ap data journalist larry fenn in new york contributed to this report
