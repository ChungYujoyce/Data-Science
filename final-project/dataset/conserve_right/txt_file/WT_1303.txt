than his earlier ones when he insisted it could be over in weeks he also acknowledged that the virus may send the nation s economy into a recession a potentially brutal blow for an incumbent seeking reelection that admission was startling for trump who for two weeks had struck a discordantly optimistic tone about the pandemic that endangered his presidency on monday that upbeat demeanor was gone

campaign was underway aimed at spreading fear among americans already spooked by the pandemic on sunday federal officials began confronting what they said was a deliberate effort by a foreign entity to make americans think the government was going to impose a nationwide quarantine agencies took coordinated action sunday evening to assure americans that the government was not planning to do that and on monday national security officials said there had been a cyber attack involving the computer networks of health and human services but the networks were operating normally they didn t detail the nature or scope of the problem or identify the foreign entity on fox news adams claimed the u s has turned the tide on testing a critical part of tracking and containing pandemics but whether that is true remains to be seen the u s effort has been hobbled by a series of missteps including flaws with the testing kits first distributed by the federal government and bureaucratic hurdles that held
