andrew breitbart would have been proud on thursday his website becamehillary clinton s number one target in his book righteous indignation excuse me while i save the world andrew recalled how he warned the tea party what lay ahead for them i said that they d be labeled racists and hate mongers and violent criminals that they d be depicted as the dregs of society people to be excluded from dinner parties because of their made up closet kkk status they were about to be targeted andrew added they need to marginalize and demonize those that would stand up to their hardball toxic and antidemocratic tactics but it won t work given a fair hearing given just the slightest exposure and the american people will rise to the occasion they see these tactics for what they are conservativeswill never be given a fair hearing but i made sure i was personally on hand in reno to hear hillary clinton s lies wearing my breitbart shirt here are the 20 worst lies in her speech in chronological order 1 trump s rhetoric is like nothing we ve heard before from a nominee for president of the united states on the contrary barack obama has specialized in divisive rhetoric both as a candidate bitter clingers typical white person and as president and of course hillary clinton often uses racist language in 2008 she panderedto hard working white americans in 2016 she borrows from black lives matter talking about white privilege and systemic racism 2 he s taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over one of america s two major political parties donald trump has nothing to do with hate groups but a radical fringe has been in charge of the democratic partyfor a decade and she was its first victim in the 2008 primaries since then the party s leaders have embraced the occupy wall street protests and the black lives matter movement which she still supports despite its incitement against police 3 in just the past week under the guise of outreach to african americans trump has stood up in front of largely white audiences and described black communities in insulting and ignorant terms poverty rejection horrible education no housing no homes no ownership crime at levels nobody has seen right now you walk down the street you get shot ironically clinton said thatin front of a largely white audience in reno but consider what she is saying if you speak honestly about problems in the black community you are racist that is how political correctness has imprisoned blacks for 50 years ever since democrat pat moynihan tried to talkabout the crisis in the black family 4 a man with a long history of racial discrimination trump has no history whatsoever of racial discrimination at the democratic national convention last month former maryland gov martin o malley fled from the camera rather than cite one single example of anything trump had said about black people much less done clinton cited a handful of lawsuits by the department of justice a department which recently tried suing louisiana school districts forhelping black students 5 and let s not forget trump first gained political prominence leading the charge for the so called birthers the birther movement started among hillary clinton s own supporters in 2008 encouragedby a candidate with a deliberate strategy of painting her opponent as not fully american her campaign also encouraged suspicions that obama is a secret muslim if trump is a racist for asking for obama s birth certificate thenhillary clinton is an even bigger racist than he 6 in 2015 trump launched his own campaign for president with another racist lie he described mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals trump s statement was over broad but he was not describing immigrants he was describing illegal aliens he did specifically add and some i assume are good people what the clinton campaign does not want to acknowledge in its push for open borders and total amnesty is that some illegal aliens from mexico do rape and murder 7 this is someone who retweets white supremacists online trump is constantly on twitter and retweets many people if he were interested in retweeting white supremacists we would see many examples notone or two inadvertent retweets among thousands if you want to find extremism on twitter visit hillary clinton s own twitter feed tweeting and retweeting black lives matter the day after police officers were murdered in dallas she was tweeting about white racism appalling 8 his campaign famously posted an anti semitic image a star of david imposed over a sea of dollar bills that first appeared on a white supremacist website the trump campaign didn t realize the image was antisemitic and did not know its origins it changed the image after complaints but look at the overt antisemitism in the clinton campaign a plan discussed by partyofficialsto use vermont sen bernie sanders religion against him for example which clinton nevercondemned 9 when asked in a nationally televised interview whether he would disavow the support of david duke a former leader of the ku klux klan trump wouldn t do it only later again under mounting pressure did he backtrack what clinton leaves out of course is that trump had already denounced duke and the kkk several times including the day before that cnn interview she falsely paints hisrepeated denunciation in the days after the interview as backtracking 10 trump said thousands of american muslims in new jersey cheered the 9 11 attacks they didn t thousands did not but a handful did breitbart news did much of the legwork uncovering the truth behindwhat actually happened in new jersey and it was clear that a minority ofamerican muslims celebrated the attack clintoncanbarelybring herself even to acknowledge radical islamic terror so it is no surprise she would persist in her denial but she has to lie in order to do so 11 just recently trump claimed president obama founded isis and then he repeated that nonsense over and over this complaint might be taken seriously were it not a response to clinton s lie that trump is the recruiting sergeant for isis trump s claim that obama and clinton founded isis by allowing a vacuum in iraq is an exaggeration of what happened but clinton s claim that americans are to blame for terror by criticizing islam actually does the terrorists work for them 12 it s another reason why donald trump is simply temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states this is a lie for the simple reason that it is what democrats say about nearly every republican presidential nominee regardless in 2008 obama constantly claimed that sen john mccain r az lacked the temperament to be president of the united states 13 and he d ban muslims around the world 1 5 billion men women and children from entering our country just because of their religion trump has since refined his policy to target immigrants and visitors from regions of the world predominantly musilm where terrorism is a problem but note that the reason for his policy is not because of religion itself but rather because extremist members of that religion have a horrifyingly frequent habit of terrorism against innocent people 14 hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage clinton singled out several breitbart news headlines among thousands to claim that the site is racist the irony of this particular headline which comes from a guest op ed is that clinton embracedthe confederate flag for decades not just as first lady of arkansas whose own state flag commemorates the confederate flag by her husband s decree but later on the campaign trail in 2008 15 trump the only presidential candidate ever to get into a public feud with the pope every catholic democratic presidential candidate who supports abortion is opposed to the pope in 2007 pope benedict xvi reiterated that politicians who support abortion should be denied communion pope francis has softened that rhetoric but theconflict remains 16 according to the southern poverty law center which tracks hate groups breitbart embraces ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right that is simply a lie as anyone who reads breitbart even occasionally would know and the southern poverty law center has no credibility left certainly since a would be mass shooter used the center s guide to hate groups to target the family research council merely for supporting traditional marriage 17 that one came shortly after the charleston massacre when democrats and republicans alike were doing everything they could to heal racial divides breitbart tried to enflame them further on the contrary as democrats like clinton were exploiting the charleston attack to inflame racial division and push gun control breitbart news focused on healing there are several examples includinglee stranahan s moving account of the makeshift memorial in charleston 18 just yesterday one of britain s most prominent right wing leaders nigel farage who stoked anti immigrant sentiments to win the referendum on leaving the european union campaigned with donald trump in mississippi here clinton repeats one of the most frequent and self defeating delusions of the anti brexit campaign farage has already responded the majority of british voters are not bigots they simply chose sovereignty over foreign bureaucracy 19 trump himself heaps praise on putin and embrace pro russian policies he talks casually of abandoning our nato allies recognizing russia s annexation of crimea and of giving the kremlin a free hand in eastern europe more generally how rich this is coming from a former secretary of state who championed the russian reset and ensured after a hefty donation to the clinton foundation that a russian firm controlled by putin owned 20 of american uranium 20 parents and teachers are already worried about what they re calling the trump effect bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools especially targeting students of color muslims and immigrants there is little evidence to support this claim butamericanshavebeen bullied by the obama administration which unleashed the irs on its political enemies and accused opponents of the iran deal of making common cause with the regime attacks that clinton supports joel b pollak is senior
