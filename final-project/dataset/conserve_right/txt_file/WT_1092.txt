republican said in a statement but it is quickly becoming clear that congress will need to provide more funding or this crucial program may run dry president trump said during a teleconference with bankers at the white house that the administration is seeking another 250 billion for the ppp the way it s going we re going to need that people are loving it mr trump said the president said the small business administration has processed more than 70 billion in guaranteed loans as of tuesday for more than 250 000 businesses bank of america said it s receiving several thousand applications per hour mr mnuchin said the white house is hopeful that the extra aid will be approved by the senate on thursday and the house on friday he urged business owners to be patient if you don t get the money this week there will be plenty of money for you next week he said house minority leader kevin mccarthy of california who had cautioned last week against moving too quickly to allocate more money to fight the coronavirus said tuesday he supports mr mnuchin s request for more money house speaker nancy pelosi said on cnn that she spoke with mr mnuchin on tuesday about the additional funds and she supports this interim bill to address immediate needs but it was unclear whether the house will vote on friday mrs pelosi there are some considerations democrats would like to add that would ensure minority business owners have equal access to the loans fellow california democrat rep pete aguilar whip of the new democrat coalition said his group of centrists democrats supports the extra funds but doubts it will clear the house this week for that reason the coalition is calling for automatic triggers that would immediately fund coronavirus related programs like the ppp if the programs start to run out of money it would also apply to the unemployment insurance program and direct payments to the american public mrs pelosi is still looking to tackle a broader package including infrastructure spending election security and more money to state and local governments in a phase four package but the speaker has indicated that bill won t be ready for a vote until after easter the government reported last friday that unemployment in march rose to 4 4 from 3 5 with more than 700 000 jobs lost due to the coronavirus pandemic the data didn t even include the second half of the

franchise owners who own more than one location but not for holding companies that own several small businesses the ppp was designed to help business make payroll payments for eight weeks the portion of the loans for salaries will be forgiven if companies keep their workers an sba email to some lenders obtained by the washington times on monday acknowledged that the agency s electronic system for processing loan applications called e tran wasn t coordinated with the ppp causing delays and frustration complaints and problems with the rollout of the program persisted on tuesday a business owner from greensboro north carolina described to the washington times his efforts to obtain a 10 000 economic injury disaster loan through the small business administration the man who didn t want to give his name said he applied on march 27 for aid for his 20 year old company after several attempts to navigate the agency s confusing website despite the sba s promise of action within three days the man said he still hadn t heard anything as of noon on tuesday 11 days later despite repeated calls and emails they screwed it all up whether it s computers whether it s personnel whether it s confusion he said nobody has the guts to get out in front of a expletive deleted microphone and tell everybody what the hell is going on they re misleading the public and it s shameful the small business and
