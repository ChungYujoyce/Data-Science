kamala harris under fire for suggesting private health care plans be abolished under her medicare for all plan want fox news halftime report in your inbox every day sign uphere on the roster harris fumbles on health insurance dems embrace left wing for trump rebuttal dems delay vote on attorney general biden s non campaign rolls on pittsburgh vs all yinz harris fumbles on health insurance imagine if the los angeles rams had to play the super bowl against the patriots and the nfc championship against the saints at the same time that s what running for president is like we think of the primaries and the general election as two different games but the truth is that whomever democrats nominate is already auditioning for the general electorate including loosely attached democrats independents and even some republicans as sen kamala harris d calif is finding out today the demands of the two games are often quite contradictory her glib facile answer to a serious question about health insurance is the political equivalent to a fumble on her own ten yard line being the frontrunner isn t all puff pieces and pep rallies in an interview with cnn harris was asked about the downstream consequences of her proposal to make medicare the entitlement program which provides health insurance for americans age 65 and older available to every citizen regardless of age the proposal is the key policy of one of her rivals sen bernie sanders i vt and has become a litmus test for liberal activists assessing the 2020 democratic contenders it would also blow the bottom out of the private employer based health insurance which provides coverage for about half of all americans employers generally hate having to be in the insurance business and many especially those with large workforces would be delighted to be able to shunt that responsibility over to medicare they chip in for extra coverage or otherwise defray costs and get to kiss goodbye one of the biggest hassles for companies in labor intensive businesses that reduced pool of customers would make insurance more expensive for those that remain in the private sector which would cause more employers to follow suit and so on and so on proponents and opponents of the proposal agree on where the road would end the demolition of the system as it has mostly existed since the 1960s they disagree about how quickly or chaotically that would happen and certainly are at odds about whether that is good or needful but agree that it would begin the end of health insurance as we know it asked about this consequence harris was dismissive to the point of blitheness the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care and you don apos t have to go through the process of going through an insurance company having them give you approval going through all the paperwork all of the delay that may require harris said who of all us have not had that situation where you have to wait for approval and the doctor says i don apos t know if your insurance company is going to cover this let s eliminate all of that she added let s move on now we want to be generous of spirit here and assume that harris was blowing off another part of the question and entirely ignoring the downstream consequences the elimination of the insurance that covers something like 160 million people isn t something even the most oblivious politician would do but that phrase let s eliminate all of that will now be stuck to her until she comes to the end of the trail john i actually did vote for the 87 billion before i voted against it kerryknows what we re talking about asthe excellent and useful pollingfrom the kaiser family foundation shows democrats enjoy a substantial advantage on the question of health insurance and health care that s traditionally a better issue for the blue team and the republicans 2017 obamacare debacle erased the considerable damage that the original passage and enacting of the law did to the democratic brand buuuuuuttttt here s kaiser net favorability towards a national medicare for all plan measured as the share in favor minus the share opposed ranges as high as 45 percentage points yet on the other side of the debate net favorability drops as low as 44 percentage points when people hear the argument that this would lead to delays in some people getting some medical tests and treatments net favorability is also negative if people hear it would threaten the current medicare program 28 percentage points require most americans to pay more in taxes 23 percentage points or eliminate private health insurance companies 21 percentage points everybody wants a unicorn nobody wants to have to clean all that glittery manure out of the stall republicans know this and will absolutely hammer harris or any democrat on the subject the scaremongering around obamacare will look like kids stuff compared to what is said about the big government health insurance program backed by a self described socialist senator from vermont it s a fact harris and other democrats have glommed on to sanders plan as a bumper sticker solution and given the fact that the number of uninsured americansis climbingand voters are increasingly anxious about the situation democrats certainly are right to want something the sounds generous simple and direct but asbarack obamalearned and thendonald trumpsaid nobody knew health care could be so complicated lolz voters don t like surprises and deeply mistrust any change that involves their policies or care democrats loved being able to run in 2018 on saving obamacare or protecting your insurance it will be less fun to say exactly what they want to do and that goes double with a plan that involves millions of americans potentially being dumped into government run health insurance and new pressures it will apply on doctors who already dislike the complexity and measly rates of medicare it tells us a lot about how harris background in california politics is insufficient preparation for the national version but it also tells us even more about the dangers ahead for democrats as sanders to continue to exact his revenge on the party that passed him over in 2016 if he succeeds in sticking his party with this one democrats will kiss off millions of votes from the very group they need so much suburban middle and upper middle class moms who are very skeptical about trump the lesson of obamacare is that american voters are compassionate and want to make sure everyone has access to care but the moment that plan affects those who already have coverage it gets chilly out there real quick the rulebook cha ching when the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market the consumer generally pays the duty but when the markets happen to be overstocked a great proportion falls upon the merchant and sometimes not only exhausts his profits but breaks in upon his capital i am apt to think that a division of the duty between the seller and the buyer more often happens than is commonly imagined alexander hamilton federalist no 35time out shooting hoops to movie shootsvariety nba star kyrie irving will star in

dispute over blocked votes she will address the nation in a prime time speech shortly after trump finishes his address to a joint session of congress next tuesday night she is just a great spokesperson she s an incredible leader she has led the charge for voting rights which is at the root of just about everything else i m very excited that she s agreed to be the respondent to the president schumer told reporters abrams s political future is the source of much speculation earlier this month she met in washington with schumer who is seeking candidates to run against sen david perdue r ga in 2020 republicans may block trump from another shutdown politico senate republicans can t stomach another shutdown after weathering 35 days of a partial government closure the senate gop is dreading the possibility another one will hit in less than three weeks a sentiment that could prevent president donald trump from closing the government again most gop lawmakers dutifully stuck with trump in public as the partial government shutdown dragged on but privately republican support began to crack as their polling and the economy both suffered after a half dozen gop senators defected last week trump dropped his demands for border wall money before a full scale revolt unfolded but while white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said monday that trump doesn t want to go through another shutdown she declined to rule it out if congress doesn t come up with a border security plan to trump s liking neither did house freedom caucus chairman mark meadows r n c a close trump confidant perdue says trump wants simple border wall deal wapo sen david perdue r ga who lunched privately with the president sunday at the white house also indicated that trump is prepared to act on his own should a new committee on capitol hill struggle to come up with an agreement on the wall that satisfies him trump is mulling the prospect of issuing a national emergency declaration to start wall construction without congressional approval a move that will almost certainly face an immediate challenge in the courts he wants as simple of a solution as we can get perdue said in an interview monday while the president would like a more sweeping immigration package at some point perdue said trump acknowledges that s just not realistic in three weeks pergram why democrats are unlikely to budge on next round of border security negotiations fox news does anyone really think we won t be back here in three weeks trying to avert another crisis and fund the government if the president agreed to re open the government after achieving nothing and republicans started taking the blame why does the president think the matrix changes in mid february democrats gave nothing they have very little to lose in the next round the key to the three week window is a conference committee a blend of bipartisan house and senate negotiators charged with forging a border security agreement before feb 15 otherwise we might be right back where we were there s a reason the government shut down in the fall of 1995 during an epic standoff between president bill clinton and house speaker newt gingrich re opened later and then shut down again the sides thought they were on a track to resolve their issues but they weren t dems delay vote on attorney generalwapo a planned senate judiciary committee vote on william p barr s nomination to serve as attorney general has been delayed for a week as democrats continue to raise concerns about whether he would allow special counsel robert s mueller iii to finish his probe and publicize the results unimpeded the delay is the latest reflection of the deep partisan tension surrounding barr s nomination most of which centers on democrats desire to protect mueller s probe from being unduly constrained the committee postponed its vote on barr as one of 46 nominations the panel was scheduled to vote on tuesday but decided to delay until its next meeting in both his public testimony and his written answers to senators questions barr has repeatedly refused to give senators any firm guarantee that he will release mueller s report to congress and the public free of redactions whittaker mueller report close to being completed wapo the head of the justice department said monday that special counsel robert s mueller iii s russia investigation is nearing an end the first official acknowledgment that the probe ensnaring president trump may soon reach a conclusion acting attorney general matthew g whitaker made the comment during a news conference to announce indictments against a chinese technology firm asked about his view of the mueller probe in light of critical comments he made while working as a television pundit in 2017 whitaker said those statements were offered while he was a private citizen i have been fully briefed on the investigation and i look forward to director mueller delivering the final report whitaker said i am comfortable that the decisions that were made are going to be reviewed right now you know the investigation is i think close to being completed dems get antsier waiting for end date of mueller probe politico before taking power house democrats vowed to give special counsel robert mueller the space needed to finish his work just four weeks in however sticking to that pledge is proving difficult the possible clashes will be on display tuesday morning when the new house democratic caucus meets for the first time to discuss mueller s investigation into president donald trump s ties to russia a probe with no clear end in sight and ever expanding subplots for speaker nancy pelosi and her committee chairs the uncertainty surrounding the special counsel s work presents a major challenge for keeping their liberal rabble rousing members in check for now the democrats say they are proceeding on two tracks letting mueller pursue criminal charges like the ones
