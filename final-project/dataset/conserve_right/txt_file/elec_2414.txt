said sunday that he doesn t believe reports that the cia secretly concluded russia interfered with the u s election to help him win calling it ridiculous and another excuse from defeated democrats the pushback against democrats using the stories in a bid to delegitimize the trump presidency however spurred new criticism that he is at odds with the u s intelligence community and coincided with bipartisan calls for a congressional probe into the russian hack scandal i think it s ridiculous i think it s just another excuse i don t believe it mr trump said in an interview on the fox news sunday program every week it s another excuse see also chuck schumer john mccain push for investigation into russian hacking reports he said the bottom line in the election was that he won by a massive landslide victory in the electoral college comfortably surpassing the 270 electoral college votes needed to win getting 306 the president elect questioned who was behind the news reports which cited anonymous sources in claiming that the cia confirmed russian president vladimir putin s regime hacked into democratic email accounts with the express purpose of helping mr trump i m not sure the cia put it out i think the democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country said mr trump i think they re putting it out it s ridiculous see also dni clapper we don t have good insight into alleged russian hacking president obama last week ordered intelligence agencies to do a review of russian hacking during the election and report back before he leaves office jan 20 mr trump who has made improving u s cybersecurity a priority for his administration stressed that he supported mr obama s effort i don t want anyone hacking us and i m not only talking about countries i m talking about anyone period he said but if you re going to do that investigation i think you should not just say russia you should say other countries also and maybe other individuals during the campaign hillary clinton s team charged that russia was trying to boost mr trump by hacking email accounts and turning the emails over to wikileaks including messages that showed the democratic national committee plotted to undermine primary rival sen bernard sanders mr trump also was criticized for praising the russian president s leadership style and suggesting he could help the u s battle islamist terrorism in the middle east prompting allegations that he would be mr putin s puppet in the oval office u s intelligence officials long have said russia was likely behind the hacks but the new reports purported to confirm that mr putin ordered it to put mr trump in the white house the washington post reported that the cia identified people with connections to the russian government who supplied the stolen emails to wikileaks the new york times reported that russia also hacked the republican national committee but didn t let the messages go public a claim rejected by rnc chairman reince priebus the incoming white house chief of staff the rnc was not hacked he said on nbc s meet the press program why would the press run with something that wasn t true he also defended mr trump s assessment as not a denigration of u s intelligence agencies of course he has confidence in america s intelligence but we don t have confidence in the new york times releasing a report of unnamed sources of some kind of study that itself and the washington post said was inconclusive he said referring to disagreements among various intelligence agencies questions persist about mr putin s motives or the scope of russian involvement as recently as nov 17 james r clapper the nation s top intelligence officer told congress his agencies don t have good insight into a direct link between wikileaks and the emails supposedly hacked by a russian operation from democrats and the hillary clinton campaign still the reports fueled concerns that mr trump and some of his potential cabinet picks especially exxonmobil ceo rex tillerson as a top candidate for secretary of state were too cozy with mr putin on capitol hill a proposed investigation into the russian hack attacks found bipartisan support recent reports of russian interference in our election should alarm every american four high profile senators said in a joint statement this cannot become a partisan issue it said in calling for a probe the stakes are too high for our country the statement was issued by incoming senate minority leader charles e schumer of new york and three members of the senate armed services committee chairman john mccain arizona republican jack reed of rhode island the panel s ranking democrat and lindsey graham south carolina republican and a former presidential primary rival of mr trump the statement was issued shortly before mr trump s interview aired both mr mccain and mr graham opposed mr trump during the campaign mr mccain withdrew his endorsement in october when an 11 year old videotape surfaced in which mr trump was caught on a hot mic using vulgar language about women mr mccain said sunday that the investigation was necessary to determine russia s motives but that russian involvement was not in question it s clear the russians interfered whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate i think that s a subject of investigation he said on face the nation on cbs but facts are stubborn things they did hack into this campaign sen benjamin l cardin of maryland the top democrat on the senate committee on foreign relations agreed that a congressional probe would help determine russia s motive but he said mr trump s comments indicate a lack of appreciation for the threat posed by mr putin russia is not our friend they are very much trying to undermine america they are a bully it is a corrupt regime we need to stand strong he said on cnn s state of the union we have the best intelligence network in the world it s critically important that the trump administration work with our intelligence community in the best interest of america he said we need to make sure that we work with the intelligence community and stop being naive russia is not our friend we know that look at their actions look at what they ve done in ukraine mr putin an elected autocrat is conducting information warfare against european states using hacking and propaganda to instill a lack of citizen confidence in the western democracies while at home preaching the rise of russia a month before the election mr clapper issued a statement saying the intelligence community was confident that the russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from u s persons and institutions including from u s political organizations he said the disclosures by wikileaks and two other sites are consistent with the methods and motivations of russian directed efforts but he told the house committee nov 17 that his agencies don t have good insight on whether russia directed people provided the actual emails to wikileaks it is possible new information has arisen the dni headquarters did not immediately comment mr putin s motivation for trying to interfere in the u s election might be the praise he has heard from mr trump who called him a strong leader i don t believe they interfered that became a laughing point not a talking point a laughing point any time i do something they say oh russia interfered mr trump told time magazine in an interview published wednesday it could be russia and it could be china and it could be some guy in his home in new jersey copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and
