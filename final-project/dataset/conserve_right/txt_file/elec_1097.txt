obamacare alternative reid s new plan to intensify koch use steyer starts 2016 attacks with rubio kimmy gets pixelated hillary looks rusty at her coming out party hillary clinton will appear tonight at her first official campaign event of this cycle and perhaps her first since 2008 and it s a doozy hillary will appear at the home of the most famous bitter ender from her failed 2008 bid uber rich lynn forester de rothschild who was a principle puma and notorious barack obama trash talker other wealthy satellites of planet hillary including barbaralee diamonstein spielvogel and jill iscol will also reportedly make the scene the beneficiary of the big event is former rep marjorie margolies d pa who lost her pennsylvania house seat in 1994 mostly a martyr for her defense of unpopular clinton polices she remained a clinton intimate thereafter including during the fraud conviction of her then husband former rep edward mezvinsky d iowa the couple s son marc a wall street banker would go on to marry the clintons only child chelsea the younger mezvinskys are expecting their first child this fall and hillary tonight will be raising money for her fellow expectant grandmother margolies but this isn t two nannas to be getting together to knit booties bubba hey we re no einsteins let s do what sensible people would do we had a problem we had to deal with albert einstein couldn t have done it perfectly the first time now let s set a long term repair process former president bill clinton at a debt reduction forum when asked what democrats ought to say about obamacare clinton though said some democratic candidates have to simply attack the law bye bye marjorie margolies has watched her bid to return to the house after 20 years go from shoo in to stumble including money and ethics woes the primary is on tuesday and margolies looks plenty shaky hillary and her husband are going all in to rescue margolies candidacy with echoes of hillary s own 2008 defeat voters have thrown over the once seemingly prohibitive frontrunner margolies in favor of a younger more dynamic populist candidate state rep brendan boyle he s taken heat for having supported abortion regulations in the wake of the discovery of a horrifying philadelphia abortion clinic the proprietor of which was later convicted of murder but boyle has big blue collar backing from unions and a geographic advantage margolies and the other candidates are from the socially liberal but elite lanes of montgomery county while boyle hails from the part of the district in philadelphia race watchers are calling tuesday s vote a jump ball first they said she faked her concussion and now they say she s auditioning for a part on apos the walking dead former president bill clinton chiding recent comments from karl rove questioning hillary clinton s health during an economic forum wednesday he said it took her six months to recover from the concussion out to sea family ties excuse a lot in politics especially for the loyalty prizing clintons but this event for this candidate doesn t seem like a smart choice for the 2016 democratic frontrunner her main weakness is her status as the preferred candidate of wall street in a party that is increasingly returning to its populist roots please check your pitchforks at the door if you stop by the rothschilds dears as is the case with concerns about hillary s health her part in the benghazi debacle her refusal to include islamist militia boko haram on the state department s terror list this kind of tin ear campaigning will be dismissed by democrats desperate to protect their frontrunner but tonight s event does not show the signs of a political operation that has supposedly learned its lessons from 2008 hillary appearing at the fifth avenue home of the most famous 2008 obama basher to buck rake from the richest of the rich on behalf of a candidate who is failing in her bid to return to power is no way to debut in 2014 maybe mike mccurry is right maybe hillary is going to drop out of the running but if all external signs are correct and she is already at sea with the bismarck of presidential campaigns hillary doesn t seem to have turned the rudder from the last voyage bubba revises on benghazi we did in my opinion hillary did what she should have done former president bill clinton defending his wife s handling of questions about the deadly attack on a diplomatic outpost in benghazi libya clinton also seemed to allege that the bush administration had kept secret the killings of top diplomatic officials he also claimed benghazi was now

more ambitious the details ap low income indiana residents would have more health insurance options including some with no cost under the two tiered plan pence s proposal appears to be an attempt to address some of the federal government s concerns about hip including a requirement that recipients under the poverty line contribute the first 1 100 of their care those briefed on pence s proposal
