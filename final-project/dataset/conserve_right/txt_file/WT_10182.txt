state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens in an apparent attempt to remedy the problem senior military leaders and white house and state department officials in recent days issued relatively tough warnings to beijing not to impose an air defense identification zone adiz over the contested south china sea china heightened tensions in the region late last year by imposing an adiz over the east china sea including waters off japan s senkaku islands that china claims as its territory japan south korea and the united states said they will ignore china s claims over the sea recently u s intelligence agencies warned that china appears to be readying another zone over the south china sea a move that is expected to set off further confrontations with southeast asian states including vietnam philippines and malaysia which use the waters for fishing and are eyeing undersea oil and gas deposits on monday air force gen herbert hawk carlisle commander of u s air forces in the pacific bluntly stated that china s imposition of a south china sea adiz would be a very provocative act the risk from miscalculation is high it s greater than it should be gen carlisle told bloomberg news in singapore the general s comments drew a harsh rebuke from chinese foreign ministry spokesman hua chunying who denounced what she termed irresponsible remarks however ms hua in a briefing for reporters in beijing did not deny plans are underway for a south china sea adiz she suggested that the current security environment did not warrant it setting up air defense identification zones is a legitimate right exercised by china as a sovereign state ms hua said on monday on tuesday in san diego navy adm harry harris commander of the u s pacific fleet voiced concerns about increasing chinese aggressiveness in the region adm harris criticized china s november imposition of the east china sea zone our criticism is less about its right to do so but rather how they did it in a unilateral attempt to change the status quo the four star admiral said at a conference i also have concerns about the aggressive growth of the chinese military and their lack of transparency adm harris said china s attempt to force the guided missile destroyer uss cowpens to stop in the south china sea weeks ago shows the danger of a miscalculation u s officials said a chinese amphibious ship sailed within 100 yards of the cowpens and stopped resulting in a near collision on dec 5 earlier evan medeiros a china policymaker on the national security council staff disclosed that the u s government recently asked china not to impose the new zone over the south china sea he said doing so would prompt the u s military to increase its forces in asia we oppose china s establishment of an adiz in other areas including the south china sea mr medeiros told japan s kyodo news agency jan 30 we have been very clear with the chinese that we would see that as a provocative and destabilizing development that would result in changes in our presence and military posture in the region an even milder rebuke was issued by daniel russel assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs mr russel told a congressional hearing last week that there are growing concerns over chinese maritime claims that he suggested are illegal under international law mr russel said china s pattern of behavior diplomatic code for aggressive maritime bullying appeared part of an incremental effort by beijing to assert control over international waters a u s official summed up the tensions in a comment to the nelson report s chris nelson what we need to think our way through is how china s salami slicing tactics and they will continue whether with an adiz in the south china sea or elsewhere will play against u s credibility if all we have are diplomatic response s when china is creating new facts on the ground in the sea air this will continue to erode u s credibility with allies and partners and if god forbid we fail to honor alliance commitments especially on the senkakus we soon will have no allies partners standing in the region iran threat on the

the destroyer sabalan would make the 15 500 mile trip across the atlantic in three months the deployment is meant to counter u s warships in the persian gulf iran said its ships had entered the
