on thethe heels of new reports indicating speaker paul ryan could likely emerge as the gop nominee should the nevertrump clique keepdonald trump from getting 1 237 delegates outright the american victims of illegal alien crime are now speaking out against the possibility of a president ryan paul ryan s position on immigration is treasonous said dan golvach whose 25 year old son spencer was murdered and shot in the head during a drive by shooting carried out by an illegal alien ahead of tuesday s wisconsin primary golvach explained that while ryan protects his own family behind aborder wall that surrounds his mansion in wisconsin ryan has allowed america s children to go unprotected and has pushed for donor approved mass migration policies that put americans at risk golvach said he needs to go pick out one of his own little darling children to sacrifice to the god of cheap labor instead of living behind security walls and allowing other people s kids to get chosen when it comes to doing what s right for the donor class and their cheap foreign labor pool paul ryan is willing to fight to the last drop of american s blood he is not a public servant he s a servant to the oligarch and nothing more most americans regardless of their politician leanings are aware of this paul ryan has a two decade long history of pushing for open borders immigration policies in 2013 ryan joined luis gutierrez who previously said i have only one loyalty and that s to the immigrant community in an effort to campaign for marco rubio s amnesty agenda as house speaker paul ryan championed a spending bill that would fully fund sanctuary cities which have resulted in the death and victimization of innocent americans in january 15 criminal illegal aliens were arrested in paul ryan s home state ofwisconsin their convictions include homicide by negligent use of a vehicle strangulation and suffocation battery burglary theft domestic abuse drug possession and drunk driving the group also included three previously deported illegal immigrants wrote fox6 in february governor scott walker who recently endorsed ted cruz for president said that he would be just fine with keeping wisconsin s sanctuary city policies in place the possibility of ryan emerging as the gop nominee is a scary thought for me said laura wilkerson whose 18 year old son josh was tortured to death by an illegal alien paul ryan is such an open borders man he pushes for this at every chance the fact that luis gutierrez is pushing open borders with ryan is even more disturbing wilkerson explained if paul ryan becomes the gop nominee in a brokered convention you can absolutely be a front row witness to the destruction of the republican party said mary ann mendoza whose 32 year old son sgt brandon mendoza was murdered by an intoxicated criminal illegal alien who was driving the wrong way down a freeway at the time of the accident the criminal alien had a blood alcohol level that was three times the legal limit and had been driving the wrong way for more than 35 miles on four different freeways this political power that big money has behind the scenes is the exact reason americans are sick of a corrupt washington d c who gives these people the right to defy american voters mendoza asked when did our democracy end up in the hands of big money and give them the right to dismiss our voices i m sick of being ignored and i truly believe there will be a huge protest if they try and pull this off americans are tired of the good old boys in d c wilkerson mendoza and golvach all said that ryan has never reached out to their families mendoza explained that ryan has ignored her despite her efforts to reach out to him i went to his office when i was in washington d c in october 2015 and left a letter and my business card for him to reach out to me my letter told of my son s story i have never heard from him mendoza said these families say they have become accustomed to being ignored by washington politicians for instance golvach a texas resident and cruz constituent says that cruz has not given his family the time of day frank underwood would have given the families victimized by illegal alien crime more time than cruz did govlach said of course now i get emails from heidi co nearly daily asking for money mendoza seemed to echo golvach ssentiment saying they reached out to me to do a commercial to endorse cruz but i said no i met him in washington and gave him my business card and never heard back from him it was at the kate steinle hearing i get emails too for donations but ignore them like he has all of us cruz is not interested in our stories at all although these americans have gone largely ignored by washington politicians paul ryan has said that washington lawmakers need to pay attention to the needs of foreign citizens in 2013 ryan said that it is the job of a u s lawmaker to put oneself in the shoes of foreign citizens residing in foreign countries and then work to improve their lives ryan said look put yourself in another person s shoes which if you re in elected office that s what you kind of have to do that almost every single day the job we have and what we do is we take different people s perspectives the gentleman from india who s waiting for his green card the dreamer who is waiting we take all these different perspectives we process it through our values and our morals and our principles and then we come up with the answer to try and solve this problem that s basically what we do in our jobs laura wilkerson s son was murdered by one of the so called dreamers whom ryan believes it is a u s lawmakers job to represent what about putting your fellow americans shoes on who have lost a loved one at the hands of illegals mendoza asked paul ryan needs to be forced to sit in a room with all of us and hear about the amazing americans who have lost their lives because of his way of thinking immigrationpoliticsdreamerskate steinlelaura
