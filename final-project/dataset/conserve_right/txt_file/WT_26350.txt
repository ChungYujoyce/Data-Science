tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn key house democrats said last week their investigation into president trump essentially has become an impeachment inquiry as they hope to persuade a federal court to approve their request to see secret grand jury information legal analysts say it s a stretch judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler on friday led democrats in filing a lawsuit to get a look at the grand jury information that was stripped out of the special counsel s report sent to capitol hill top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the justice department argues the information cannot be disclosed without a court order and even then the circumstances under which it can be shared are heavily restricted one exception is a judicial proceeding mr nadler says his ongoing series of hearings is just such a circumstance arguing it amounts to the preliminary stages of an impeachment proceeding which at least one court has found is a viable judicial proceeding the very purpose of such an investigation is to determine whether to recommend that the house vote to impeach the accused party resulting in a trial in the senate mr nadler s lawyers wrote in their filing mr nadler told reporters the committee s probe is in effect the same as an impeachment inquiry but some of his committee members were more direct from my personal standpoint i would say we re in an impeachment investigation said rep jamie raskin maryland democrat sam dewey a lawyer at mcdermott will emery who used to lead congressional investigations said that s probably not good enough they can t have one member stand at a press conference and say this is an impeachment inquiry mr dewey said i just don t see that they have to do something beyond that he said the trouble with mr nadler s argument is where to draw lines in theory anything is preliminary to a judicial proceeding how far removed from a potential trial must it be for their argument to make sense mr dewey said during watergate one federal judge approved disclosing grand jury information to the house judiciary committee as it targeted president richard nixon but a federal appeals court in washington d c earlier this year ruled that judges are severely restricted in their ability to release grand jury information andrew mccarthy a former federal prosecutor said he doesn t believe the house s ongoing investigations would succeed under either of those court precedents this is not a law enforcement investigation mr mccarthy said it is a congressional hearing mr dewey said democrats could argue to the courts that they have fundamental oversight powers that give them the right to see secret materials there is supreme court law that says the inherent investigation powers of congress are inalienable he said mr mccarthy said congress also could try to change the law to make the release of grand jury information to capitol hill legal the democrat controlled house would likely approve that bill but then it would have to pressure the republican led senate to go along and to get mr trump to sign it into law mr mccarthy said that s possible anyone opposing the measure could face allegations of participating in a coverup but he predicted democrats wouldn t push to change the law because their bid is political theater rather than a serious legal challenge they know they are going to court with a frivolous petition but they want to look their base in the eye and say they are fighting here he said this idea that they are doing impeachment but they are not doing impeachment and they want to pretend legally it is impeachment but continue to tell the public we are not seeking impeachment won t work and if i was a judge i d be angry about t
