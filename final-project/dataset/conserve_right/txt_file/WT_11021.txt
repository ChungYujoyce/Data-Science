features exploitation of perceived u s weakness and repudiation of an international system that recognizes the territorial integrity of nation states addressing these challenges must begin at home while president obama promised to fundamentally change america few realized his policies would fundamentally weaken it yet the administration s defense priorities and international retrenchment increasingly reflect a pre sept 11 2001 mindset moreover the administration has sought to erode america s national identity by dissolving our borders and nullifying immigration laws essential to u s sovereignty and security our founders pledged their lives fortunes and sacred honor to establish american citizenship for themselves and future generations we have a duty to protect and extend this heritage of liberty and equal opportunity to all u s citizens this is the citizenship our armed forces and intelligence community defend with valor and distinction this is the citizenship each
