apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump visited joseph r biden s birthplace in pennsylvania on thursday night for his first town hall meeting of the election year and criticized the democratic front runner for leaving the country in a mess under former president barack obama on everything from trade to military readiness speaking to a crowd in scranton that chanted four more years during commercial breaks mr trump said mr biden showed poor judgment in pushing for the nafta trade deal while he served in the senate and blamed the obama administration for failing either to engage with north korea as it developed nuclear weapons or to defeat the islamic state in the middle east the country was a mess mr trump said the country when i took it over was in very bad shape the

replied i really believe we re going to win this next election and when we do the other side s going to say that s it we have to get along it s going to come together and it s going to be sooner than

president said they made some decisions that were not good decisions we undid some of the regulations that were made the testing we did it as soon as we found out it was a problem some bad decisions
