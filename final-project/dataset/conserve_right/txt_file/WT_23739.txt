tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn democrats say their plan to stop migrant caravans overrunning the u s border is not to stiffen immigration laws here but rather to do some nation building in central america sen jon tester a montana democrat on the bipartisan committee working on a border security spending deal said the focus needs to be on making honduras el salvador and guatemala countries where people want to stay i think you have to solve the problem there to keep them there he said i think that would be the best use of money and the right thing to do top

greatest christian expositor of the 21st century democrats have not put a price tag on the plan but insist it s cheaper and less offensive to southern neighbors than mr trump s border wall the thousands of people marching in caravans to the u s have become a powerful symbol in the border security debate though each side has starkly different views of the migrants the latest caravan with some 2 000 people arrived on the border south of texas this week riding in buses provided by mexico president trump sees them as an invading army bringing crime and disorder the pentagon confirmed wednesday that troops have been moved to eagle pass texas to counter the threat posed by the caravan about 250 active duty troops were repositioned officials said they include military police medical personnel and engineers congressional democrats and their immigrant rights allies describe caravan members as refugees from violence drug gangs and government corruption in central america you can t stop them said sen dick durbin of illinois the senate s no 2 democrat leader what with military intervention he said u s law guarantees the immigrants the chance to request asylum and said the president s plans would trample that they have the right to do that now the system is so backed up and it is going to take a long time for any resolution of their status but they have the right under the law to present themselves mr durbin said sen debbie stabenow called it a complicated issue we need to focus on stopping violence in their country so they don t feel the need to come the michigan democrat said mr trump says the u s has given too much assistance which has been wasted to honduras el salvador and guatemala we re looking very seriously at taking away all funding he said it s a disgrace what s going on in those countries for years and years the united states has paid them hundreds of millions of dollars and they do nothing for us not only does he want to build border walls
