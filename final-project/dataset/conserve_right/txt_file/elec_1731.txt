night apos s presidential debate after appearing to side with president obama on the question of whether he called the libya strike a terror attack from the start conceded afterward that mitt romney was right on the broader point that the administration for days insisted it was a spontaneous act he was right in the main i just think he picked the wrong word candy crowley said of romney on cnn shortly after the debate ended crowley was referring to the tense exchange in the final half hour of the debate when romney questioned whether obama had called the attack an act of terror rather than spontaneous violence that grew out of a protest against an anti islam video crowley then intervened here apos s the exchange romney i think it apos s interesting the president just said something which which is that on the day after the attack he went into the rose garden and said that this was an act of terror obama that apos s what i said romney you said in the rose garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror it was not a spontaneous demonstration is that what you apos re saying obama please proceed governor romney i want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in benghazi an act of terror obama get the transcript crowley it it it he did in fact sir call it an act of terror click for the full debate transcript obama indicating he thought he had just gotten a boost from the moderator then chimed in can you say that a little louder candy however obama didn apos t explicitly label the benghazi strike terrorism in those sept 12 remarks what he did say is no acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation crowley during and following the debate pointed out that despite obama apos s sept 12 remarks his administration was peddling a different story to the public she said it took two weeks for officials to say more definitively that the attack was more than an out of control protest and she continued to clarify on cnn that romney was making a legitimate point right after that i did turn around and say apos but you are totally correct that they spent two weeks telling us that this was about a tape apos she said click for the full rose garden transcript four days after obama apos s rose garden remarks susan rice the u s ambassador to the u n went on five networks apos sunday shows and cast the attack as hardly a coordinated strike by terrorists we are obviously investigating this very closely the fbi has a lead in this investigation rice said sept 16 on fox news sunday the information the best information and the best assessment we have today is that in fact this was not a preplanned premeditated attack that what happened initially was that it was a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired in cairo as a consequence of the video people gathered outside the embassy and then it grew very violent and those with extremist ties joined the fray and came with heavy weapons which unfortunately are quite common in post revolutionary libya and that then spun out of control but we don apos t see at this point signs this was a coordinated plan premeditated attack obviously we will wait for the results of the investigation and we don apos t want to jump to conclusions before then but i do think it apos s important for the american people to know our best current assessment click for the full apos fox news sunday apos transcript and video state department spokeswoman victoria nuland white house press secretary jay carney and other administration officials did little to discredit that assessment until sept 19 when matt olsen director of the national counterterrorism center testified at a senate hearing yes they were killed in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy olsen said even so obama taped an interview on abc apos s the view on sept 24 nearly two weeks after the attack in which he declined to label the attack terrorism when asked instead he would only go as far as to say the attack wasn apos t just a mob action after the debate tuesday obama tried to clarify his remarks the man who posed the libya question kerry ladka told fox news that the president approached him after the debate to explain he delayed explicitly labeling the attack terror because he really wanted to take the time to be deliberate to make sure he had all the information there were several more factual slips during tuesday apos s debate at one point obama repeatedly said not true when romney claimed oil and gas leases and permits were down by half on federal property romney was exaggerating a bit but obama also dismissed an overall trend that is demonstrated by the numbers according to bureau of land management figures the number of new leases fell by roughly 42 percent in obama apos s first three years in office compared with the number in the last three years of the george w bush administration romney meanwhile tried to assert that the price of gas should be the barometer for whether an energy policy is succeeding the proof of whether an energy strategy is working or not is what the price is that you apos re paying at the pump if you apos re paying less than you paid a year or two ago why then the strategy is working but you apos re paying more romney said however global markets play a big role in setting the price of oil demand in the developing world likely would be a far bigger factor in determining that price than the u s president apos s domestic drilling platform obama also claimed romney said on 60 minutes that it was fair for somebody making 20 million a year to pay less in taxes than a nurse or bus driver romney apos s statement though in that interview was broader than that romney said when asked whether it apos s fair for investment income to be taxed less than the income of someone making 50 000 a year yeah i think that apos s the right way to encourage economic growth to get people to invest to start businesses to put people to work get all the stories you need to know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox subscribed you ve
