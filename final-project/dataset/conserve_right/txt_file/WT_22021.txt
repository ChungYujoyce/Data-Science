apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion another tax day is behind us but negative media coverage of president trump s signature tax cut legislation continues many reporters and pundits didn t even wait until the tax cut was signed into law in december 2017 to begin mischaracterizing it of course they called it a sop to the rich but they went one better than that old chestnut insisting it would shaft the middle class and the poor according to many it was designed to do exactly that never mind that the real world experience of most americans in the wake of these articles contradicted these gloom and doom predictions top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender almost immediately numerous employers including boeing at t fedex cvs and others began offering bonuses to their employees nearly 200 companies including walmart announced wage hikes due to the 2017 tax cut still others enjoyed higher contributions to their retirement plans the benefits soon went beyond that however the tax cut contributed to the strong economy we ve been enjoying leading many businesses to hire more and more workers the united states added more than 2 6 million new jobs in the year following the passage of the tax cut nearly a 25 percent increase from the previous year unemployment is way down with jobless claims at their lowest since 1969 thanks in large part to the tax cut there s something you don t hear on cnn and other media outlets the media have continued to claim the tax cut was entirely too narrow that it helped wealthy americans at the expense of others who are less well off so the heritage foundation used irs data to produce a special report last year that shows how widespread the tax benefits truly are they found that in 2018 taxpayers would save an average of 1 400 even better married couples with two children would save more than twice that 2 917 and the good news was truly nationwide their report showed that every u s congressional district would enjoy these tax benefits that s not to say that every last taxpayer would get a break a lot depends on an individual s circumstances his job deductions credits withholdings but the data plainly showed that most americans would be better off directly and obviously everyone benefits in some measure from the effects of a stronger economy so as tax season got underway a few weeks ago the media tried a different tack they highlighted how some taxpayers had been surprised to discover their refunds were lower than they were expecting worse some who had anticipated a refund wound up with a bill to pay all such reports did however was illustrate the fact that many americans don t understand how refunds work it s nice to get that refund check of course but it s not really a cause for celebration you re not getting extra money from the government you overpaid your taxes and they re returning the overage you essentially gave uncle sam an interest free loan and now he s paid it back the fact that your refund check is smaller doesn t mean you ve enjoyed no benefit from the 2017 tax cut if you re like many americans you got a bonus a raise and your employer started withholding less in taxes the fact that you wound up months later with a smaller refund check is unfortunate but it s simply not evidence that the tax cut didn t help you on the contrary you experienced those benefits even sooner which is a good thing what we should be concerned about instead is that the tax cut has an expiration date of 2025 unless congress extends them americans will be in for some serious sticker shock lawmakers should make it priority this year to make the 2017 tax cut which has already done so much good permanent there s no time to lose ed feulner is founder of the heritage foundation www her
