 sign in republicans must craft a winning grand strategy for 2016 manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion the only two certainties in life benjamin franklin once wrote are death and taxes after their big victories in 2008 and 2012 many democrats thought that they would never again face political death that their new winning coalition was a sure thing alas there is a third certainty in life sure things are anything but after the historic 2014 republican wave the gop is in a stronger position than it has been in nearly a decade top stories russian fighter jets intercept u s navy patrol aircraft over mediterranean postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud australian researchers see virus design manipulation republicans should savor the celebratory champagne now however because the real challenge is to come the democrats received collective punishment for collectivism they got their hats handed to them because their destructive policies have crippled the nation impotence abroad and negligence corruption incompetence and malfeasance at home drove voters to the gop a victory by default is still a victory but it s much like a sugar rush temporary and unsatisfying then the inevitable crash arrives being abd anybody but the democrats may have been enough to carry republicans across the finish line this time but it will not be enough to sustain them through the 2016 election they will quickly find that they must offer voters a clear positive compelling reason to vote for them rather than simply against the other party that is going to require discipline imagination and charismatic and energetic leadership it s a tall order but it can be done the first step is to show that the new gop is not an aimless mush of reactive folks but a focused party of principle of course president obama his administration and the democrats are an aimless mush of reactive folks but republicans are going to have to show they ve got more to offer after all hillary clinton and the rest of her party will have the full protection of the corrupt press going forward so they won t have to do much beyond spew platitudes republicans will have to work harder that means that the new republican controlled senate must move quickly to demonstrate the party s commitment to conservative ideas dismantling obamacare passing a fiscal 2015 16 budget resolution authorizing the keystone xl pipeline and other initiatives to achieve energy independence proposing meaningful tax reform halting mr obama s executive action on amnesty for illegal immigrants rebuilding the military and stopping a bad deal on iranian nuclear weapons that s just for starters the republican party must show itself to be a party of ideas optimism and an unapologetic commitment to the nation not to itself this is not a time for cowardice the next project for the republicans will be to unify around a coherent conservative message that will cast the distinction with the democrats in the boldest possible terms in 1994 republicans rallied around the contract with america a set of governing principles they pledged to enact if elected many americans didn t focus on the actual contract but they did see a party speaking with one voice advocating one central message they now have a real opportunity to direct the public s attention to the failures of mr obama s socialist agenda and at the same time to advance non statist solutions to the squeezing of the middle class health care reform and broader economic uncertainty this is why the specific senate agenda noted above will be so important absent a natural dynamic leader a la ronald reagan in the 1960s and 1970s the trek out of the political wilderness may end up being a self guided tour the race for the republican presidential nomination will generate a healthy but cacophonous competition it will also take awhile to produce a party leader the sooner the rest of the party self enforces discipline and unity the better third the gop is going to have to understand what it s up against the modern democratic party is not your father s or grandfather s democratic party the far left takeover of the party begun in 1968 has reached its zenith under mr obama the most radical leftist ever elected to the presidency the democrats are now fully an instrument of that radicalism as they seek to complete what mr obama called the fundamental transformation of the nation they willingly use whatever tactic necessary from pathological lies to racist smears to bogus identity politics wars to get and keep power if the gop runs a 20th century presidential candidate who will run a gentleman s campaign he will lose the radical new democrats play gutter politics and while it s not necessary to mirror their corrupt and unethical games it is necessary to understand them and fight back with full force like it or not we re in a war for america the forces to save her have just been given a new lease on life america s future depends on their success there s not a moment to lose monica crowley is
