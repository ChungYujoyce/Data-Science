believing in the force of his own personality accepting no personal responsibility the playbook donald trump has used as a real estate developer celebrity businessman and political candidate has for the most part proved effective through the first two plus years of his presidency he has shown an uncanny ability to wriggle out of jams that might have doomed just about any of his predecessors top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches that m o may finally be catching up to trump amid the house s impeachment inquiry the tactics that helped win the white house have jeopardized his hold on it ensnaring him in accusations that he enlisted a foreign government to investigate a political foe and so far leaving him flailing against a rapidly escalating investigation he s arrived at a very different place right now he s being held to account in a way that he never had before and is running into the limits of what he normally does said tim o brien a trump biographer and frequent critic the trump we re used to seeing is someone whose visceral feeling to survive is to plow through public criticism to just push forward his behavior hasn t changed his circumstance has it was trump s ability to get out of one predicament that led him into this one the investigation by special counsel robert mueller into russian election interference shadowed the white house for two years before ending with a whimper on july 24 when the former fbi director s faltering testimony seemed to close the book on the inquiry mueller told congress that he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice and trump told the world that he had been completely cleared trump s approval rating has never dipped below 32 or risen above 42 in associated press norc center for public affairs research polls since he took office his grasp on power and his hold over the republican party have been unshaken a day after mueller s congressional appearance an emboldened trump asked ukraine to investigate a leading democratic rival former vice president joe biden the speed of the story has stunned a capital already used to a relentless trumpian news cycle in barely two weeks time under an avalanche of disclosures in news stories and trump s damaging admissions house democrats called for an impeachment inquiry posing the gravest threat yet to his presidency to this point trump appears foundering in how he s reacted with no formal response team and with many in his party keeping quiet trump has turned into a one man war room he s raged at news conferences berated aides and directed epithets at critics he s being erratic and inflammatory said douglas brinkley presidential historian at rice university it s not a strategy designed to garner new voters who wants to buy into an act of a man screaming in chaotic fashion instead of trying to work his way out of the hole he s digging himself deeper in many ways trump has lived a life free of consequences his two divorces were marriages from which he wanted to escape he turned the separations into tabloid gold his early financial struggles were resolved by his father his bankruptcies mostly impacted his lenders he never apologizes moves to win that day s really that minute s news cycle and trusts that his supporters will believe and follow him he is facing the ramifications of his actions in a new way said o brien what is so striking about this ukraine story is that the anger that his closest allies would only see behind closed doors has burst into public view i think he s going to continue to lash out and burn things down around him he ll try to throw more people in his close circle under the bus if he needs to his upstart presidential campaign was riddled with gaffes and blunders that would have ended his candidacy each time he pushed forward and survived he broke norms at every turn he insulted republican stalwart john mccain a former prisoner of war for being captured he derided a beauty pageant queen for being overweight he accused an american born judge of mexican descent of being incapable of impartiality on immigration he had his fixer michael cohen pay off women with whom he had affairs every time he was wounded he would strike back and even harder the best example came at the most perilous moment of the campaign the october 2016 weekend after release of an access hollywood tape in which trump is heard boasting about sexually assaulting women after holing up in trump tower for 24 hours as rumors swirled that he might be replaced on the ticket by his running mate mike pence trump emerged on a saturday afternoon and plunged into a crowd of supporters gathered outside as if drawing strength from the unshakable loyalty of his base the next day in the hour before second general election debate with hillary clinton he held a surprise news conference in st louis with women who accused former president bill clinton of sexual impropriety it was a jaw dropping moment in a campaign full of them trump had changed the conversation and a month later he was elected the president and that is why some of the closest supporters believe he can escape this crisis too it s not planned strategy really it s just who he is said sam nunberg a former campaign adviser the president is trying to take control of the narrative releasing everything on the attack and what he has been able to successfully do as of now is control the republican party keep them in line his supporters and small donors and are still with him if this was any other president they d be one foot out the door said nunberg he ll survive this he always does editor s note jonathan lemire has covered politics and the white house for the associated press sin
