his top republican opponents rep bradley byrne and former auburn football coach tommy tuberville those two however have relied on local pockets for most of their money the jones campaign did not

than a third republican candidate secretary of state john merrill who reported 738 429 cash on hand in the third quarter more than one third of that consists of loans republicans said the contributions to mr jones reinforces the image alabamians already have of him as another liberal democrat in washington although mr jones supports the agenda of the trump administration more than most democrats in the senate according to tracking services he has sided with democratic majority leader charles e schumer and the party leadership on several key votes including trying to block the confirmation of supreme court justice brett m kavanaugh while doug jones is supported by san francisco socialists and east coast liberals coach tuberville has received the endorsement of the alabama farmers federation tuberville campaign manager paul shashy told the washington times we ll take alabama farmers over the crazies on the left any day mr jones managed to eke out a 22 000 vote victory in the 2017 special election in large part because of accusations that decades ago his republican opponent former state supreme court justice roy moore had sexually assaulted or propositioned teenage girls when he was a lawyer beginning his career the allegations against mr moore first reported by the washington post generated heavy national press coverage and prominent left wing activist groups such as democracy for america and the progressive change campaign committee backed mr jones those groups which showered mr jones with tens of thousands of dollars made it clear they expected him to vote with the democratic left wing whether similar interest and money will come mr jones way in 2020 absent a polarizing candidate such as mr moore who has declared his candidacy again but is receiving scant attention remains to be seen lately the lineup of liberal college faculty lawyers and software engineers in the top ranks of mr jones fundraising has prompted conservative alabamians to charge him with supporting the democratic leadership in washington and avoiding taking a position on the impeachment of president trump he is taking some real heat in alabama on this topic said republican state chairman terry lathan when most of your funds are from outside our state like new york and california that s not alabama he d be very comfortable in those s
