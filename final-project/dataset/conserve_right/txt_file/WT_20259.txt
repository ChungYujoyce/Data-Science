submitted his report to the justice department it has done surprisingly little to settle matters for congress and the american public after an initial bout with uncertainty democrats have ramped up their attacks on president trump and attorney general william p barr accusing them of a whitewash of mr mueller s work and suggesting that there s still criminal activity to be found for republicans

election and no prosecutable case against mr trump for obstruction of justice should have been enough to calm the anti trump hysteria that has gripped democrats for more than two years initially it seemed it would several democrats said it was time to move on from the probe and return to issues and legislating but by the middle of last week congressional democrats had found their war footing once again house speaker nancy pelosi accused mr barr of a whitewash and democrats said they wouldn t cool their criticism without seeing the entire mueller report and some said they want to see all his investigative files too democrats are convinced the evidence will show mr trump s actions were questionable at best the public at large seems to share democrats sentiment a marist npr pbs news

run against mr trump in 2020 refused mr paul s request saying she just wanted to see the mueller report after she refused his amendment mr paul then objected to her demand leaving the two sides in a stalemate still mr mueller s report will be coming in some form and the white house apparently isn t meddling in that either in his letter to congressional leaders last week mr barr said the president has the right to block some information in the report by claiming executive privilege but he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and accordingly there are no plans to submit the report
