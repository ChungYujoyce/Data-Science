apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic air force gen herbert j hawk carlisle commander of the pacific air forces recently outlined his service s role in the pentagon shift to asia known as both the pivot and air sea battle a concept to counter china s high tech weapons the four star general s candid comments to defense reporters prompted charges in chinese state run media that the pentagon is treating china as a cold war enemy china is aggressively seeking military control over disputed islands in the south china sea and pressuring japan over its control of the senkakus in the east china sea gen carlisle said during a breakfast july 29 top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds gen carlisle said chinese territorial claims increase the risk of military confrontation in addition to the senkakus china is asserting its claims over other disputed islands including the second thomas shoal and other islets in the spratly islands china also claims to control most of the south china sea through its declared nine dash line impinging on large areas of international waters china is being fairly aggressive and as a result runs itself the risk of creating the potential for miscalculation gen carlisle said the general said the maritime disputes involving china are all ripe for challenge and that s something we think about every day from u s pacific command commander adm samuel j locklear ii to every one of the components of what we can do to stabilize those situations additionally china s fairly assertive aggressive behavior has increased demands by states such as japan and the philippines for a greater u s military presence he said as part of the u s strategic shift to asia the first base for new f 35 jets will be at one of the nine air force bases in the pacific gen carlisle said the jets will not be based in hawaii where the air force s most advanced warplane the f 22 is based gen carlisle said the air force is not planning on building more bases in the asia pacific as part of the shift instead the service s buzz phrase is places not bases where air force power can be used in the region the general then compared the rotation of warplanes in and out of asia to the cold war policy of moving u s forces temporarily to europe to deal with the soviet union that comment prompted an unusual attack from state controlled chinese media beijing published more than a dozen reports criticizing the general chinese military commentators all known to represent the chinese government position accused gen carlisle of seeking to encircle china with advanced warplanes a retired chinese admiral yin zhuo was quoted in one report as saying gen carlisle s comments on asia military deployments carried a strong cold war flavor the chinese government s euphemism for anti communism that chinese propaganda theme was echoed in recent months in writings by pro chinese academics in the united states many of whom have written that the pivot to asia is a little more than a war plan against china gen carlisle said the navy and the air force are moving a majority of forces to the pacific the navy is deploying 60 percent of its warships to the region the air force is turning to that in the pacific he said noting the addition of 12 f 22s at japan s kadena air base and 24 f 16s in south korea to bolster jets already based there half of all u s f 22s which the pentagon has said would be the lead aircraft in any conflict with china are now deployed in the asia pacific in alaska and hawaii long range global hawk drones also are based in the region and b 2 and b 52 bombers are rotated regularly to guam another part of the u s military buildup in the pacific is the addition of special operations forces gen carlisle said the air force will deploy new tilt rotor v 22 osprey aircraft to transport special forces in the pacific in a lot of ways we ll increasingly move south and west with the rotational presence darwin tindal in australia changi east in singapore korat in thailand trivandrum in india gen carlisle said on air sea battle the goal is better war fighting integration he said that is what air sea battle is all about it is cross domain coordination it s cross domain capabilities gen carlisle said it s the ability to do it in a denied and contested environment war games by the navy and air force are working to flesh out the air sea battle concept it s done some great work in looking at kill chains and how to do cross domain ops he said but now we ve got to bring it into the air force and the fleet and the marines and the army and actually exercise it and start working it homeland missile defense after more than four years of focusing u s missile defenses in europe the obama administration appears to be shifting its missile defenses to defend the u s homeland one reason according to the director of the pentagon s missile defense agency is north korea s deployment of a road mobile intercontinental ballistic missile known as the kn 08 vice adm james d syring outlined the shift during a presentation to a missile defense conference in alabama on aug 14 according to slides of his talk among several changes in u s missile defenses is the emergence of north korean road mobile icbm s along with increased attention to homeland defense adm syring said iran may have the technical capability to flight test an icbm in two years to meet the threat the pentagon is deploying 14 additional long range missile defense interceptors at fort greely alaska and is considering an interceptor base on the east coast we are taking these steps to stay ahead of the challenge posed by iran and north korea s development of longer range ballistic missile capabilities adm syring stated in one slide army email embarrassment one reality of the digital age is the unpleasant experience of clicking the send button on a blast email message that you didn t intend to send that was what happened to army spokesman dov schwartz last week mr schwartz a spokesman at the pentagon mistakenly sent a mass email to news reporters that was an internal assessment revealing how the army

made by usa today army times and a book author that were assessed as positive or balanced however one entry was on the politically sensitive issue of gender neutral standards for physical training a hot topic considering the pentagon s new policy of putting women in front line ground combat units army times reporter lance bacon was said to be working on a piece on developing the new physical training test in its final notation the email contained this outlook positive deceive action was the army planning to deceive mr bacon asked about the email the reporter quipped can t wait to hear the explanation on this he said he was told later that it was a typing mistake mr schwartz agreed in an email to inside the ring he said there was no deception scheme the reference was the result of a typographical error deceive action should have been written as decisive action he said as contained in an earlier item in the email this was clearly a typo in the daily media relations report that was mistakenly sent to the press mr schwartz said i did not review the report as closely as i should h
