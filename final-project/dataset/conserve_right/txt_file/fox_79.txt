regime showing off advanced long range missiles and conducting a missile test that exploded on launch while president trump threatens to quote solve the problem in a few minutes we ll talk with k t mcfarland second in command of the national security council about north korea and other hot spots but we begin with team fox coverage kristin fisher traveling with the president in west palm beach but first senior affairs correspondent greg palkot live from pyongyang north korea greg greg palkot fox news senior affairs correspondent chris a celebration marking the anniversary of the birth date of the founder of this country ended with a dud this weekend sunday morning north korea time a missile grew up at launching this according to u s and south korean authorities now just a couple hours prior to that we watched dozens of missiles on parade here in pyongyang including a medium range solid fueled missile which could have been the type used in that lunch on the east coast of the country if successful it would have threatens the u s ally japan as well as some 35 000 u s service members there now there is some speculation that the missile was a victim of a u s cyber attack it has been done in the past but there are also failures now the regime of kim jong un has still had no comment regarding the launch or the failure one of the officials here admitted to me a short while ago however these kinds of mistakes can happen now a missile launch or a nuclear detonation was expected to mark that anniversary date but there was new speculation that this could have been timed ahead of the arrival in south korea today of vice president pence in south korea the launches are monitored at a flight control center we were at last week foreign ministry officials said today that the launch and the military parade were a threat to the whole world otherwise tensions remained high over the bad missile and nuclear program the trump administration demanding that north korea give them up officials we have been speaking with here show no signs of pulling back they brush off the threat of more sanctions and they say they would fight off any preemptive military strike as for young north korean leader kim jong un he has been in office for just over five years it looks like he is somewhat to be reckoned with chris wallace greg palkot reporting live from pyongyang greg thanks for that now let aposs bring in kristin fisher in west palm beach with reaction from the white house kristin kristin fisher fox news correspondent chris the reaction from the white house has been very restrained no tweets from the president the first response team from defense secretary jim mattis he put out a very short statement that reads quote the president and his military team are aware of north korea aposs most recent unsuccessful missile launch the president has no further comment now the vice president was in the air and on his way to south korea when that failed missile test took place he was briefed onboard air force two and landed in seoul about nine hours later when he told american and south korean troops that their courage and valor are needed now more than ever begin video clip mike pence vice president of the united states this morning aposs provocation from the north is just the latest reminder of the risks each one of you face every day in the defense of the freedom of the people of south korea and the defense of america in this part of the world end video clip fisher from south korea the vice president will travel to japan indonesia and australia to reassure north korea aposs nervous neighbors that the u s has their back to reinforce those diplomatic promises the pentagon is standing in some military muscle right now a nuclear powered aircraft strike group is steaming towards the korean peninsula the president calls it an armada it is a show of force just like it was a show of force to drop the mother of all bombs on isis fighters in afghanistan and to launch 59 tomahawk missiles at a single syrian air base the question now how does president trump handle a nuclear power led by a man that s even more unpredictable than he is chris wallace kristin thank you joining us now from west palm beach president trump aposs deputy national security advisor and a familiar figure to fox viewers kt mcfarland kt welcome back to fox news sunday kt mcfarland deputy national security advisor it aposs great to be back on fox news chris thank you wallace what is the president aposs reaction to the missile launch failed yes but still the willingness of north korea to launch that missile in open defiance of president trump aposs warnings mcfarland well look it aposs not a surprise even in the last year president kim of north korea launched over 30 missiles most of them have failed so it wasn t it shouldn apost come as a surprise to us we were expecting something particularly surrounding the birthday of his grandfather so it wasn apost a surprise i briefed president trump on it last night we saw it for what it was secretary mattis issued the statement and the president doesn apost have any further comment on this particular launch attempt wallace is he distressed or upset that they ve ignored his warnings mcfarland no and let me sort of preface this by saying at the beginning of the administration in january president trump asked the national security council asked me to chair a series of interagency meetings and that aposs my job as number two on the national security council i go to all of the agencies and departments the intelligence committee defense department state department the military and say what are the options here and that s what we did with north korea we did a big wide study and i and we directed the intelligence community and others come up with things you haven apost thought of before think outside the box and they came back with some really interesting suggestions sanctions diplomatic things we could do secondary sanctions we could do and obviously military options and we presented them to the president he was very pleased with it and that allowed him when he went to the when he went to mar a lago for the summit with the chinese president to talk in earnest about north korea and they spent a lot of times talking about north korea the chinese president has a lot of influence over north korea china provides some 85 percent of their food their transportation fuel their cooking fuel so they have a lot of economic influence as well as other influence over north korea and the two presidents talked about how china might help along with the other efforts america is taking with our allies wallace there s a lot there and i want to unpack it but i have to ask you another question first mcfarland ok wallace did the u s sabotage this missile mcfarland now chris you know we can apost talk about secret intelligence and things that might have been done covert operations that might have happened so i really have no comment on that and nor should i wallace but as greg palkot pointed out there have been cyberattacks in the past should the kim regime consider that a possibility mcfarland well the cyberattacks that occurred in the past are on the part of the kim regime when they hacked sony pictures so you know i do think we are entering a whole new era not just with north korea but with everybody with any country major country we are entering a cyber platform a cyber battlefield that is where a lot of the wars of the future are going to be fought but i don apost have any particular comment on what happened with the north korean missile but it was a fizzle wallace president trump ratcheted up pressure on north korea and the kim regime this week mcfarland yes wallace this was one of his tweets north korea is looking for trouble if china decides to help that would be great if not we will solve the problem without them usa and he said this begin video clip trump i don t know if this sends a message it doesn apost make any difference if it doesn apost north korea is a problem the problem will be taken care of end video clip wallace despite the tough talk and sending a carrier strike force to the area as we were showing pictures right now kt north korea showed up new long range and submarine launched missiles and conducted a test launch you talk about this long discussion of options mcfarland yes wallace what does the president do now mcfarland well i think in that parade there were a whole number of missiles that were shown and there were some canisters which may or may not have held missiles but they were canisters that could have held intercontinental ballistic missiles in other words missiles that could go from north korea and potentially reach the united states so the threat is upon us this is something president trump is going to deal with in the first year but i would also say that as a result of the mar a lago summit the two presidents were meant to have you know short conversations short one on one conversations what they ended up having were several hours of conversations wallace well let me talk to about china because the president has indicated after that that he had formed a good relationship with president xi and that he aposs hoping president xi will help with north korea there was talk this week about the fact that north that china is turning back coal shipments from north korea and threatening to cut off its oil supply north korea depends 90 percent of its oil comes from china on the other hand trade between the u s and north korea is up 37 percent so far this year over last year so my question is it did president trump get a specific commitment from president xi on north korea mcfarland well i think you didn apost mean trade between north korea and the united states wallace no if i said that no between the two mcfarland yes between china and united states wallace no no no trade between north korea and china is up 37 percent mcfarland ok yes it is and that aposs why china has a kind of leverage it does have and that s why the two presidents talk about could china use that kind of leverage which they have been willing to do in the past they ve been willing to do a little of it in the past but were they willing to a lot more of it and the chinese president gave an indication that he would be willing to work with president trump and with other allies to try to see what could be done we all understand the korean peninsula should be denuclearized we ve said it the chinese have said russia everybody said it the question is how do you do it and the chinese have always been concerned about instability in the korean peninsula and i think what the president president trump was able to convey to the chinese president is that north korea is no longer an asset north korea is a liability north korea is a liability to everybody and it aposs a threat not just to the united states not just to south korea not just to japan not just to russia but it aposs actually a threat to china as well and at this point we have to wait and see you know it s like your kids in the back of a car when you re on the long trip saying when are we going to get there well in this case i think we should give the chinese president some opportunity some sometime as well as pursuing the economic and diplomatic pressures that we have and our allies have that we can bring to bear on north korea wallace all right i ve got limited time i m going to remind you of your old job as a fox news contributor and ask you to give me specific answers here during the campaign mr trump talked a lot about getting along or trying to get along with vladimir putin and cracking down on china but this week he seemed to flip 180 degrees on both here are a couple of clips begin video clips trump right now we are not getting along with russia at all we may be at an all time low in terms of relationship with russia i have really gotten to like and respect as you know president xi he s a terrific person we spent a lot of time together in florida and he aposs a very special man end video clips wallace again i need a quick answer is that good for the president to shift so dramatically and so quickly on both china and russia mcfarland well first of all the president now president trump has now spent a lot of time with president xi he aposs gotten to know him he s gotten to understand what his priorities are he shared what our priorities are he is not yet met with vladimir putin and you know the president has said secretary tillerson has said that our relationship with russia really depends on russia we would like to have a good relationship with russia but russia has been doing some things of late whether it aposs in syria whether it aposs with american democracy that we really we take very seriously so the ball is in their court we d love a great relationship with them but it aposs up to them to take those first steps and to stop taking the steps that could potentially adversely affect us wallace this week the u s dropped the largest nonnuclear bomb in our arsenal the largest it aposs ever used in combat on a cave complex in afghanistan killing dozens of isis fighters here was president trump aposs explanation begin video clip trump what i do is i authorized my military we have the greatest military in the world and they ve done a job as usual so we have given them total authorization and that s what they re doing and frankly that aposs why they aposve been so successful lately end video clip wallace but kt while that apparently was a success there have been some tragic mistakes recently just this week 18 syrian allies who rebels who were allies of us were killed in a friendly fire incident by u s forces the question some people are asking is is the white house exercising enough oversight mcfarland well first of all what the president saw what we also when we came into office was the previous administration had a lot of decisions that should have been made by the battlefield commanders that were being made by the west wing of the white house and that wasn apost the right place the west wing of the white house doesn apost know the battlefield is like what the conditions are like or the immediacy of the threats that they are facing so president trump has taken a number of steps to delegate that authority back where it belongs back where it was in the reagan administration frankly to the battlefield and so what you are seeing now is exactly what s happened now sometimes mistakes are being made and we regret any loss of life especially to any of our allies but on the other hand it is a battlefield commanders decision to make and we do not have a president who is going to be sitting there picking out bombing targets he aposs left that up to the military so far with a few tragic exceptions but so far the military has been terrific i mean look at syria attacks on the airport that was used by the syrians to deliver those chemical weapons that was done completely successfully it was done quickly and it was done with enormous effect i think wallace kt i want to ask you one last question and we are less than a minute left and i want to talk about you general michael flynn brought you in as his number two national security advisor now there aposs a new head of the nsc that s general mcmaster he apparently wants is own team the reports you know are that you are out and you aposre moving to singapore to be the ambassador there what aposs happened and how do you feel about it mcfarland well first of all president trump hired me and he gave me a call on thanksgiving day to ask me to be the deputy national security advisor so i want to set that straight now general flynn has departed and general mcmaster has arrived i helped through that transition and the president and i have had a number of conversations over the last two months really about what my role would continue to be and where i could be best used for what his vision is in foreign policy so i can tell you we talked about it again last night and there are changes coming but i m not going to tell you what they are you got enough secrets out of me this day wallace all right but i won apost pack my bags to visit you in singapore quite yet kt thank you thanks for your time mcfarland hey one more thing chris wallace yes yes ma am mcfarland one more thing happy easter to you and everybody at fox news and your entire very large viewing audience wallace well thank you and we wish the same to you and to the president aposs party thank you especially for your time this holiday weekend and it aposs always good to talk with you kt mcfarland thanks chris wallace up next we ll ask the chair of the house armed services committee mac thornberry about north korea and president trump unleashing the u s military commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway at jerusalem as christians mark holy week in the old city the trump administration aposs launch of two military strikes in less than two weeks is a sharp contrast to barack obama who employed a more cautious approach to the use of force and promised to end america aposs wars joining me now here in washington the chair of the house armed services committee congressman mac thornberry mr chairman welcome to fox news sunday rep mac thornberry r texas chair armed services committee thanks for having me wallace what you make of the events in north korea this week first of all that display that impressive display of weapons some of which we hadn apost seen before and the launch yes failed but still the launch of a ballistic missile despite president trump aposs warnings thornberry well i think the message was we are strong and we can hurt you that aposs what wallace the message from north korea thornberry from north korea that aposs what they aposre trying to send especially to us but also japan south korea and maybe they aposre trying to send a message to china as well that they north korea are not as dependent on china as some of us think i think we are in a different place with north korea for years the father and the grandfather would talk tough maybe launch a missile but then negotiate for some increased aid of some sort i think that this guy is not interested in negotiation he wants to have an inter ballistic missile with nuclear warhead to threaten us and i think he aposs determined to get it even failed launches tell them something and improve their program wallace so there are a couple of questions i want to ask first evolve directly how close is north korea to developing a nuclear weapon that could hit the u s homeland thornberry well we know they have nuclear weapons because they have conducted nuclear tests the question is how close are they to an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach our homeland and the short answer is we don apost know there are various estimates among the intelligence community on how it would take but again i have no doubt that they are driving toward that and every test failure or success helps them wallace here was north korea aposs vice foreign minister this week firing back at president trump and his warnings take a look begin video clip han song ryol north korean vice foreign minister through translator we are taking into account the most aggressive and dangerous options that the u s might come up with and we also have our options our countermeasures ready in her hands which means we ll go to war if they choose end video clip wallace you talk about kim jong un the new young leader although he aposs been there five years of north korea and that he aposs determined to get a nuclear weapon and to become a nuclear power do you think that he is so unstable as some suggest that he might be willing to go to war with the u s to achieve that thornberry i don apost think he is suicidal but he is certainly erratic and so the most important thing we can do is increase our military presence especially our missile defense in that area because we cannot rely on his good judgment to prevent award we have to have the military capability there to deny him that ability wallace i want to talk about president trump aposs posture on this because i have to say there was a growing sense of tension if they don apost solve the problem china we will and sending the carrier strike force as we say kim ignored all of that had this big military parade had a launch yes it failed but they still have the launch and from kt mcfarland today what you got was more of the sense this is a process it s going to take a while let aposs wait and see with china does the u s have a clear strategy and frankly what are our options what can we actually do thornberry yes well i think when it comes to north korea we need to make sure we are tight with our allies and that aposs the reason it aposs very good vice president pence is there we need to keep the pressure on china to rein north korea in and their announcements about restricting coal shipments for example is a big step forward that aposs the biggest export north korea has is coal to china but the third is the most important thing is increase our military presence in the region and our military capability overall remember china does not want to have the new carrier battle group in their backyard they are not excited about the missile defense deployments in japan and korea well the answer for china is to get a hold of this guy and north korea and that will reduce the necessity of us increasing military presence wallace but chairman let aposs talk realistically about the military threat if we were to launch a preemptive strike and there aposs been some loose talk i think in the u s about that to take out north korea aposs missile program or nuclear program they have thousands i don t have to tell you of short range missiles that are on the border i ve been in that area the dmz and 30 mile to seoul that are aimed at seoul that s a metropolis of 20 million people not to mention the 24 000 u s troops if we were to hit them they would hit back in seoul and it would be a human catastrophe wallace yes number one i think it is important as the president says you don apost take options off the table one of the many mistakes made during the obama years was to talk about what you would never do and that just assist your enemy in their calculations but i also think if we can continue to encourage china to put pressure increase our missiles our military presence in that region what you may well see if some changes inside north korea without a conflict now we can apost know for sure but what we do have to know though is that we have to have the military capabilities strong enough to prevail if he does something erratic and unexpected wallace let me ask you a different part of this equation you mentioned in passing before how effective is the u s missile defense both to protect our allies in the region and to protect the u s homeland thornberry we can knock down missiles but we need to step on the accelerator to do more for missile defense it is it is remarkable going back to president reagan aposs speech in 1983 there has been political opposition in this country to doing more on missile defense and we aposve been scraping for more money both to deploy more of the systems we have and to put research into new systems we have been fighting that fight during obama years this is the time to step on the gas because it aposs not just north korea it aposs also the iranians as well as others were pushing for missiles we need to be able to knock those down wallace i want to take a bigger 30 000 foot look at this president trump has authorized the use of force several times in the last two weeks he ordered the cruise missile strikes 59 cruise missiles on syria dropping that huge bomb on isis fighters in afghanistan and sending a carrier strike force towards north korea question what message do you think he is sending to our allies and to our enemies thornberry well let aposs step back for a little context the obama years saw u s withdrawal from iraq reducing our presence in afghanistan drawing a red line in syria not following it up and cuts to the defense budget of more than 20 percent since 2010 and during that time we saw invasion of crimea the chinese building islands in the south china sea et cetera president trump is taking a different approach thank goodness he is sending a message that now the united states is going to stand up for our interests and make sure we have the military capability to prevail if we choose to use force wallace but here s my thornberry it aposs a different message that has been given before wallace but here s my question is there a strategy behind the force do you know as the chairman of the house armed services committee what our strategy is in syria in afghanistan in north korea thornberry well i don apost think anybody can step back and say ok i know these events will happen over the next year or two or five but i do think you are seeing a different approach to the world and it is one that says not only to adversaries but two friends who have had questions about us that we are willing to put the resources into defending ourselves and making the judgments from time to time when it aposs necessary to use those military resources that aposs different than the message that was sent out during the obama years wallace finally especially with this increase willingness to use force does president trump need to go back to congress to get authorization for the use of military force and all these arenas a lot that are far beyond the authorization back in 2001 and 02 after 9 11 thornberry well we administrations of both parties have used limited force to advance national interest whether it was president reagan bombing gadhafi in 86 or clinton trying to get bin laden in the desert and so forth those sorts of limited strikes do not require an action by congress i believe that we should however update the authorization to use military force against the terrorist networks and have been working to try to do that so if it aposs sustained if it involves u s boots on the ground and lives then it needs to come to congress if it aposs limited military action then not so much wallace chairman thornberry thank you thank you especially for coming in on this holiday weekend thornberry happy easter and happy passover wallace thank you same to you sir up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss the rising tension between the u s and north korea plus what would you like to ask the panel about how the president should handle provocations from kim jong un just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace president trump sharply escalating his rhetoric on russia s role in syria begin video clip trump if russia didn t go in and back this animal you wouldn apost have a problem right now end video clip wallace we ll ask our sunday panel about the new chill in relations with moscow next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip preset if you look at what s happened over the last eight weeks and compare that to really to what aposs happened over the last eight years you ll see there s a tremendous difference end video clip wallace president trump highlighting what he says is an end to the micromanaging of the military by president obama with what he believes are better results and it s time now for our sunday group michael needham head of the conservative think tank heritage action for america bob woodward from the washington post fox news national security correspondent jennifer griffin and former national security council staffer gillian turner well jennifer let me start with you what do your sources say over the last 24 hours about this impressive display of military hardware by the kim regime in pyongyang and also that launch yes failed but still a launch of a of a missile in defiance of president trump jennifer griffin fox news national security correspondent well i think what aposs notable chris is when i walked out of the pentagon on friday afternoon it was a pretty relaxed atmosphere over at the pentagon you didn apost see the president travel down to mar a lago with his war cabinet if you will he did not have his defense secretary within he did not have h r mcmaster with him his national security advisor they had plans in place to react they knew that they know that north korea has not tested an icbm an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the u s so they had different scenarios the bottom line is i think if you look at general mattis apos statement it was 22 words in length very short very terse to the point and he said the president would have no more comment and what they aposre pointing out is that that was a medium range missile it failed he fizzled they ve kind of been snickering about it as in terms of the parade we re not really sure what we saw in that parade i remember when i was a moscow correspondent that we learned decades after we saw those parades in moscow that many of those missiles that we believed at the time during the cold war were in fact fake so i think we don apost know what we saw at that parade wallace gillian as someone who worked in the bush 43 white house and the national security council and also the obama national security council we have a question from a viewer about how president trump should handle kim let aposs put it up on the screen george valetine tweeted this i believe he mr trump needs to come across very strong that we will not play games with north korea how do you answer george and and i have to say that i i m feeling a little whip sawed because this week it seemed that the administration was building up what s going to happen this week and how is the u s going to respond and president trump saying if they don apost stop it we will and now we re told well this is just part of the game gillian turner former white house national security council so i think that secretary mattis apos statement while frustrating to us as eager viewers of the administration at this point it aposs actually right on the money in terms of tone and tenor the the bigger context here despite the fact that this the tension with north korea has kind of reached this rhetorical and optics apex over the weekend is that this sort of covert i would i hesitate to call it a covert war but sort of a covert war between the united states and north korea has been simmering for the past three years we maybe only heard snippets of it during the second term of president obama because he didn apost want it to be a centerpiece of its foreign policy but it aposs been there all along and i think that i can apost speak for the trump administration obviously but i imagine that they re trying to while not normalize this type of behavior from the north koreans make people understand that every time they test the missile now it s not it doesn apost pose a sort of existential crisis for the united states and that aposs the kind of steadying hand we ve been hoping to see from the president all along so i think that we should actually welcome it wallace bob you interviewed candidate trump a year ago and at that time he said to you real power is fear do you think that unleashing the military the way he has in the last couple of weeks and and making a point to saying we re not micromanaging the pentagon the way obama did and i will say top pentagon officials i talked to complained about not micromanaging by the obama team do you think that sends the right message to both our allies and our enemies bob woodward the washington post it s it s a very different message and as you may recall president obama at his first inaugural he said american strength comes from our humility and restraint you aposre smiling because that aposs not the way the world is and it s it wallace it s also not the watch word of this administration woodward it it is not and i i think trump means that when he did a year ago say that real power is fear in north korea the reality is none of the options are very good president trump talked repeatedly he wants to win he likes to win the military likes to win the military options and north korea as you suggested you have some sort of preemptive strike engagement seoul korea gets devastated there is no win and so what you need to do is be tough try to deter and see if you can work something out but we get into a military engagement in north korea and that aposs going to be hell wallace there was a striking flip on russia this week in addition there aposs a lot of stuff going on every week in the administration after talking for months about getting along or trying to get along with the putin regime and the kremlin a dramatic change in tone from the president this week and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov fired back here that is begin video clip trump putin is backing a person that s truly an evil person and i think it aposs very bad for russia i think it aposs very bad for mankind sergey lavrov russian foreign minister through translator this fixation on trying to oust this or that dictator and authoritarian or totalitarian leader as well known to us and we know how it ends end video clip wallace michael what do you make of this dramatic shift this week away from putin and towards chinese president xi michael needham ceo heritage action for america i thought the most interesting contrast was between russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and actually rex tillerson who was over in russia he was cool he was calm he was firm and i think the trump administration is developing a very clear eyed view of what the russians are they re a strategic adversary of the united states vladimir putin is a former kgb thug who s trying to relive those glory days and because russia hasn t fully integrated into the global marketplace it is very much a zero sum relationship between the united states and russia that s different from china there are opportunities with china for us to form a strategic partnership we shouldn apost mistake that without also recognizing that china is also a competitor and as we look at china we look at things they can do with us in north korea we don apost have to be enemies with china but we also can apost be friends as long as they continue to steal our intellectual property as long as they continue to take advantage of our trade agreements and express real military aggression in the south china sea wallace but gillian and briefly that aposs a 180 degree turn from what this president was saying two weeks ago about china and russia turner it is it s 180 degrees and from my perspective it aposs a welcome turn i mean there s flip flopping and then there s flip flopping i think what we re seeing here is more of a sort of an evolution we re watching the president navigate the russian relationship in real time and i think he aposs learning very quickly on this very steep treacherous learning curve that dealing with vladimir putin as a potential sort of businessman is very different than dealing with him as a foreign head of state and that aposs what we re seeing wallace all right panel we have to take a breaker here when we come back the game of thrones inside the west wing continues and thousands of people march across the country demanding to see president trump aposs tax returns commercial break begin video clip wallace the president promised to drain the swamp but aren apost the six of you part of what aposs been called the wall street washington revolving door gary cohn national economic council director look chris i came to washington to make america great again and help the president with his vision and his mission and that aposs what i m doing end video clip wallace white house chief economic advisor gary cohn one of the leaders of the establishment wing that is said to be winning the battle inside the white house for president trump aposs ear and we re back now with the panel well let s look at president trump aposs policy changes at least some of them just this week after promising to label china a currency manipulate he now says they re not nato which was obsolete no longer is and the president also changed his mind on whether to close the export import bank michael is the president breaking faith with this populace base needham well i don apost know i don t think that was a particularly persuasive list of changes that show that he aposs flipping i mean i think even this morning he tweeted out that on the currency manipulation that s part of the ongoing negotiation over the north korea thing the only one there that really concerns me is the export import bank when you kind of look at washington d c and the swamp the export import bank is one of the ugliest alligators in that swamp if you don t believe that you should go visit its downtown gold headquarters the export import wallace but but but i mean speaking more broadly when you see the ascendancy apparently of jared kushner and gary cohen and some of the other wall streeters new yorkers democrats establishment as they re called does that concern you needham no it really doesn t because i don t know i m not on the inside who really is up who s really down or what any of these people actually believe i have no doubt that donald trump is the person who s making the calls on this and as a conservative i m looking at judge gorsuch justice gorsuch now on the supreme court i aposm looking at a white house that really has been the more responsible and conservative part of the negotiating side of the health care debate that played a very productive role and so other than you know a couple of these export import bank type things i think conservatives have a lot of reasons to be optimistic wallace the leader of the populace charge the drain the swamp charge of course is chief strategist steve bannon and here he was a couple of months ago when he was riding high begin video clip steve bannon white house chief strategist the third broadly line of work is what is deconstruction of the administrative state that s all going to be deconstructed and i think that that aposs way this regulatory thing is so important end video clip wallace now bob if you believe the reports of papers like your washington post he aposs down conceivably out what s going on woodward you you can believe that i mean that aposs true but you there is ascendancy and then there is crashing and you will see stories about so and so aposs winning and then two weeks later they re fired the question here is who is trump and trump is a pragmatist just like those policy changes we knew for a long time he was going to have a two track strategy on russia reach out to putin but also be tough on a number of things in terms of his staff as best i can tell he ll it aposs a menu for him i ll take this one i ll take that one and i m not going to have dessert i m not going to have bannon i m not going to have and so it s it s i would not reach any sweeping conclusions the real question is as an executive is this going to work for him because you re going to get stories like in my newspaper which is quite well done that there is a battle going on and the battle and the discussion should be about the policy not the personalities wallace but i don apost have to tell you personnel is policy woodward it is but but trump is clearly that you know we know from the campaign three campaign managers he aposs ruthless you come and you go and the people who are wise about him realize that they may be here now but maybe not tomorrow wallace there was another change this week by this president not a change in his policy but from the previous presidents he now says that this white house is no longer going to routinely release visitor logs showing who aposs coming to the white house who they re meeting with as president obama did and another interesting development this weekend there were massive marches across the country people protesting these were called tax marches people demanding that president trump releases his tax returns as presidents have routinely since jimmy carter and that was the subject of a tweet this morning from president trump let aposs put it up on the screen the president apparently not liking those marches he says i did what was an almost impossible thing to do for a republican easily won the electrical college now tax returns are brought up again gillian this president apparently thinks transparency is overrated turner well that aposs the message i m getting it loud and clear but on both fronts here with the visitor logs and with his tax returns if i were advising him i would say mr president bad news never gets better with age all of this information will eventually be known the white house visitor logs will be subject to foia requests in the future we will see who came in in and out of the white house regardless of whether there were national security implications that will be known i i imagine i can apost predict the future but i imagine that at some point we ll get full tax returns from the president of the last few years we aposve already had snippets of that courtesy of msnbc so i think the administration really needs to kind of buckle down on messaging here when it comes to what are you going to tell the american people when you re out of office and all of this information becomes known how are you going to deal with that then wallace but the counterargument would be jennifer yes people do apparently care about this in the polls by a margin of more than two to one they say they want to see the president releases his tax returns on the other hand lord knows this was a big issue during the campaign and he s president trump griffin well i think you have to see it through the light of what president trump wants to do next he wants to do tax reform next he s going to need democrats to do that and already we ve heard from senator schumer that they re going democrats are going to make an issue about his tax returns if he wants to do tax reform they want to see his returns i will point out that when msnbc received his tax returns from 2005 it did show that he had paid 38 million that year in federal income taxes that was a rate of about 25 percent it was higher than what bernie sanders paid that year so it aposs hard to understand what he is hiding and why he is not showing these tax returns needham the the american people really don apost care as he kind of said at the end about his tax returns that s why he won and what he does is he sets up with these fights a situation where the media goes crazy over something that the american people don t care about wallace but wait a minute michael that wasn t the media that was tens of thousands of your fellow americans taking to the street that and i ve got to say that was not something that the media even needham it was very well organized by liberal groups and and there was money behind it wallace but that was democracy when the tea party did it needham sure when when the americans when the american people rite large look at this and they say what aposs going on in north korea and are we going to have a lunatic with nuclear weapons who can hit us when they look at their health care premiums when they look at those inaudible wallace i aposm not saying it aposs the biggest issue in the world but it it it is needham and so i think this inaudible the white house actually ends up making themselves look like the victim of a media that is coming after them over things that look i agree if i were running the white house i d release the visitor logs if you re having an an untoward meeting you re probably going to do it off site anyway but they create a dynamic where what the media is going crazy about is not what the american people care about the american people care about the real policy issues wallace all right we have to end it there more to talk about i d love to hear what you have to say bob i will in commercial woodward the the power of no trump has just said no and unless you can get somebody to give them to you he wins wallace thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the people aposs diva gives me a singing lesson begin video clip renee fleming opera singer you re tenor are you a tenor wallace i don apost know what i am i used to sing in the bathroom end video clip commercial break wallace pope francis celebrating easter mass today at the vatican we want to give you a treat on this holiday one of the special people we ve profiled over the years and her joyful sound here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape renee fleming opera singer i haven apost really been able to transfer into that extraordinary otherworldly creature other than i hope on stage wallace voice over renee fleming has been called the people aposs diva it s a title she loves yes she is america s leading opera star who s played 54 different roles but she prides herself on being down to earth wallace on camera are you at all a diva are you difficult fleming am i a diva well you know there are people who have probably had their moments you know with me a lot of bad behavior in singers is caused by nerves but my philosophy is that the people around us are there doing as much work if not more work behind the scenes and they are the last people you would ever be unkind too so i hope i m not a diva offstage wallace voice over she aposs made a point of going beyond opera singing rock and jazz and in 2014 becoming the first classical artist to sing the national anthem at the super bowl fleming in those two minutes which had to be perfect or it will follow you for the rest of your career i can apost say i ve had another experience quite like it but it was thrilling wallace whatever the venue fleming is also known as the beautiful voice wallace on camera how is it that you re able to create this remarkable sound fleming my speaking voice is horrendous right wallace no fleming so it well but i mean it s it s sort of weak and it aposs not very resonant but then when i sing the sound is a totally different range color all of it it aposs all about the breath you take in a breath and you make a sound so for instance if you say hello renee try that wallace hello renee fleming so i would teach you how to enhance that how to increase the range hello renee wallace hello renee fleming you re a tenor are you a tenor wallace i don apost know what i am i used to sing in the bathroom fleming just try a siren ah ah ah ah ah wallace no i aposm not doing that wallace voice over master class aside fleming who is now 58 said she ll retire from opera by next year and just do recitals fleming my whole career i aposve played these girls sort of 18 23 inaudible so you know and we can suspend disbelief to a point and then you sort of think ok that aposs enough of that wallace but don apost worry the people aposs diva will continue to share her remarkable talents fleming it aposs just something incredibly moving that the human being a human being can make this
