of popular will on every major issue affecting this country the people are right and the governing elite are wrong wrote donald trump in an april op ed for the wall street journal that could be a textbook definition of populism two political scientists j eric oliver of the university of chicago and wendy m rahn of the university of minnesota define populist rhetoric as a style that pits a virtuous people against nefarious parasitic elites who seek to undermine the rightful sovereignty of the common folk they add a populist moment requires the right rhetoric spoken by the right person to the right audience at the right time and as we look to the data the 2016 election has all the hallmarks of a populist moment tuesday s vote proved them right consider a post election television interview of trump voters from central virginia where i live people want the people to be in control of the country not the politicians greene county resident chad aylor told wcav tv the report noted that for aylor voting trump was not against clinton or voting republican aylor said he considers himself voting as an american trump trounced clinton 62 to 31 percent in the mostly rural county so why is 2016 the right time for populism university of georgia political scientist cas mudde argues that populism is an illiberal democratic response to undemocratic liberalism populism he suggests criticizes the exclusion of important issues from the political agenda by the elites oliver and rahn agree proposing that populism arises when existing political parties are not responding to the desires of large sections of the electorate this opens up a representation gap that can be exploited by a would be populist leader oliver and rahn measure this gap with polling data people are asked whether they agree with such statements as public officials don t care much about what people like me think and people like me don t have any say about what the government does they found higher percentages of americans agreeing with such sentiments as the 21st century advanced they also compared those responses to the degree of partisan conflict in congress which they gauged by tracking the number of strict party line votes the idea is that the representation gap grows as the distance between the major parties core supporters and swing voters grows larger they find that such a gap opened in the early 1990s which saw the entrance of such populists as ross perot and pat buchanan the representation gap in 2016 was even larger to get a handle on the degree of populism represented by u s presidential candidates from both major parties oliver and rahn analyzed the announcement speeches of the top seven candidates including trump bernie sanders ted cruz marco rubio john kasich hillary clinton and ben carson they looked for anti establishment and blame language along with rhetoric signifying the creation of a unified people in addition they measured the simplicity and everydayness of the candidates language basically shorter sentences and shorter words trump and sanders used considerably more blame language with sanders focusing more on economic grievances and trump on political transgressions trump made more we they contrasts and pointed more often to international threats than the other candidates did trump and kasich used fewer words that were longer than 6 letters and trump s sentences averaged 10 words in length sentences from sanders and rubio were twice as long trump scores high in targeting political elites blame language invoking both foreign threats and collective notions of our and they and the simplicity and repetition of his language report oliver and rahn in contrast they find that sanders uses more complex locutions and fewer we they contrasts while sanders may be populist in a strictly economic sense his language is not nearly as of the people as either carson s or trump s they conclude what made trump best able to take on the mantle of the populist tribune oliver and rahn point to several traits common to populist leaders they invoke a sense of crisis and they claim to speak for a silent majority of ordinary people ignored and dominated by arrogant elites corrupt politicians and strident minorities oliver and rahn note that populists employ a distinctive style one that is simple direct emotional and frequently indelicate the populist disrupts normal dinner table conversation like a drunken guest with bad manners his followers treat this lack of decorum as evidence of authenticity members of the establishment by contrast perceive such pugnaciousness as demagoguery that encourages undemocratic sentiments in 2016 oliver and rahn report many americans were receptive to populist appeals in february and march they surveyed more than 1 000 voters to assess their degree of anti elitism mistrust of expertise and nativism they asked respondents to rate such statements as the system is stacked against people like me when it comes to really important questions scientific facts don t help very much and it would be unwise to trust the judgments of the american people for today s complicated political issues trump supporters scored highest on nativism and mistrust of expertise and second highest on anti elitism in contrast sanders supporters scored lowest on nativism and mistrust of expertise and highest on anti elitism other questions sought to determine attitudes toward ideology anger at the federal government anomie nativism conspiracism and fundamentalism ideology ranged from very liberal to very conservative respondents were asked if they were pleased satisfied indifferent frustrated or angry about federal government performance their degree of anomie was determined by asking if they believed most people are trustworthy or would take advantage of them if given the chance nativism was assessed by asking whether too many immigrants were criminals and if they were more of a burden than a benefit to america conspiracism was probed with questions about five conspiracy theories and fundamentalism was reckoned with queries about biblical inerrancy and endtimes prophesies in addition financial pessimism was evaluated by asking among other things if respondents thought that that their children s standard living would be better or worse than theirs trump voters scored highest on financial pessimism nativism anomie and conspiracism and second highest on anger cruz voters were angrier at the federal government clinton voters were nearly the exact opposite sanders voters were financially optimistic were not angry at the government and scored lowest of all on nativism but exhibited a slight penchant for anomie and conspiracism oliver and rahn concluded that donald trump stands out in particular as the populist par excellence in september hillary clinton cluelessly declared you know to just be grossly generalistic you could put half of trump s supporters into what i call the basket of deplorables right the racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamaphobic you name it and unfortunately there are people like that and he has lifted them up with the democratic party firmly in the hands of the coastal elites trump seized the republican party and rode the rising tide of populism in that sense the election of 2016 was the revolt of

facebook com movierolls an absolutely normal outcome of an expanding government when it s small and only intrudes a little it s easy to ignore because the targeted benefits are so few and seem so reasonable while the distributed costs are so puny as to hardly exist in most people s minds but that attitude of ignoring it only encourages further growth and as it intrudes more the benefits target more and more people which makes more and more people want their own piece of the action while the distributed costs rise and rise and make more and more people angry eventually things o crazy and i d say we reached that stage this century with the crazy prescription scam tarp and the other bailouts and the way out of line expansion of all the crazy epa army corps of engineers global warming food cars health care and all the other regulations i wouldn t be surprised if government regulations have doubled during obama s reign alone not to mention bush ii another aspect of growing bureaucracy is that they and their elected bosses become increasingly isolated from reality and the mood of the country they have staffers to keep them free from the affects of their laws they can t see the frustration build up they just keep piling on the regulations without any thought to how previous regulations have worked out and the backlash grows and grows until people like bernie and trump come along bernie and trump got the votes not rand or amash because everyone is so fed up that they think it impossible to shrink government and besides their frustrations make it seem inevitable that shrinking will be uneven and they think their chances are better at redistributing the stolen pie than shrinking it fairly i bet that iffff people were 100 assured that a 90 or 99 cut would be evenly distributed ifff it were as inevitable and guaranteed as the sun rising most people would go for shrinkage than redistribution but a life time of increasing pie and increasingly partisan redistribution has destroyed any such expectations s it seems that the number of final rules published in the federal register has grown from around 60 000 in 2008 to 94 000 as of 2015 imagine the world with only 92 000 you americans barely dodged the apocalypse in 2015 only to get trumped for shame damn that s a depressing link but if i were looking for bright sides i d say that at least something continues to grow and that the only excuse i can think of for the economy still functioning is an increased shadow economy until cash is outlawed see government can be efficient ron thanks for posting the link to final rules in the federal register this is an important point essentially the people writing all of these rules have a belief that they are able to manage an incredibly complex organic entity namely the economy this is exactly the top men and adults are now in charge sort of claims that the left loves to make when they have electoral success but it is followed by 2000 page bills which stipulate conditions on private contracts which neither the buyer nor the seller would agree to if able to freely contract a close reading of hayek should be mandatory for all bureaucrats i ve been meaning to read this what washington gets wrong each year unelected federal administrators write thousands of regulations possessing the force of law what do these civil servants know about the american people whom they ostensibly serve not much according to this enlightening and disturbing study http www penguinrandomhouse 633882492 don t forget that washington dc is one of the richest areas in the country working at nasa it used to be that contractors made more but civil servants had job security now civil servants make 20 at the same level and can never be fired can never be fired not entirely true though there s a lengthy process to go through aimed at reforming the employee s behaviour i just witnessed one getting escorted out of my workplace released for poor work performance his building access was revoked immediately and base access was to be revoked the next day that was the first firing i saw in 14 years of fedgov work meh i bet a lot of the people wouldn t go for shrinkage in some measure they blame a mysterious cabal of probably jewish fatcats for their problems left and right i once listened to a socialist law professor yo d think he d be halfway intelligent at least talk mystically about the hundreds of billions of dollars that disappeared because of the 2008 financial crisis where d it all go he asked i don t think he d want to believe it if i explained to him that it didn t disappear it never existed in the first place it would remove a central villain form his narrative and it s to protect us from villains like them and to punish them that we need donald trump many believe the central problem is that the benefits of reduced government are abstract and often distal or indirect less gov spending means lower interest rates in the credit market and therefore a more productive economy lower prices better jobs but that s opaque compared to the very specific job someone will lose if the government agency he works at loses funding what s more the damage incurred for each specific government job or government benefit are so thinly distributed across the population that you can t point to a specific person being thoroughly emiserated by a specific government action most of the time the way you can point to a disemployed auto worker losing his job because the gov won t bail out his company in politics people mostly reason emotively they will often choose to inflict a broadly spread out a tax on countless millions of nameless faceless abstract people amounting to enormous sums of money in order render even a slight service to a single unfortunate person with a name and a face no the only time money disappeared was when after 9 11 a money spigot was opened and it poured into this big black pit and nobody bothered to question what was at the bottom of the pit because the people who opened the pit said it was for national security scarecrow you have hit it right on the nose well put and i think absolutely correct in both of your comments above thanks trump forces black family from home http tinyurl com zn3kvbh 1 usa today front page story did anyone else see the usa today this morning it detailed the racist trump supporters who are acting out across the country since his election it would have been a good onion post front page picture https goo gl abwgef http www usatoday com story 93584210 the one thing about being perpetual political outsiders is that despite always being irritated with whoever wins we do gain some objectivity i do not believe that this is anything but progs trying to stir shit to retain their base hate is the only thing keeping their coalition together and if people were to realize that white people aren t their enemy their party would probably be doomed when the footage o keefe managed to get of operatives working to incite violence at trump rallies surfaced they lost all credibility and sympathy they could have reaped nobody is going to believe them now fuck them and their false flag operations one can only wonder how many false flags they use on libertarians to keep us down i don t think they have to use too many most people find it batshit crazy to think that one shouldn t vote against something just because one finds it personally objectionable i like candidate public s stance against drugs i think drugs are bad so they ought to be illegal zero sorry to say but there is no reason for anyone to expend time or effort on false flag ops against libertarians when they choose a prog as their vp nominee and he goes on to endorse the absolute worst candidate in the race from another party no less the libertarians do not need any help shooting themselves in the foot come on ffs are you that stupid ugh ignore my post i didn t notice the context too late you already hurt jwatts feelings now you re not invited to his birthday party don t know about the virtuous people part but the nefarious parasitic elites who seek to undermine the rightful sovereignty of the common folk is evident to all but the high iq idiots of the power worshiping chattering class and asskissing wannabes but even the thugish members of the political class understand the free rider problem they have as a collective parasites have difficulty game theory wise to coordinate in order to keep the host healthy enough there is an inherent instability to the equilibrium in the parasite game that occasionally shows itself rules and institutions have grown to channel and restrain the thug state practitioners in political markets there is a type of evolution and spontaneous order sure trumpism is a shake up but not close to the guillotine yet that s a threat always lurking and the political class knows it and they claim to speak for a silent majority of ordinary people ignored and dominated by arrogant elites corrupt politicians and strident minorities you do realize that trump s election is evidence that there was a silent majority who weren t speaking to the pollsters but did show up to vote jwatts i think they don t want to realize that yeh funny that whoda thunk that there were enough people sick and tired of the business as usual dc bs to actually vote for the candidate promising to stop the business as usual dc bs who was also the first candidate in the general to actually promise to stop the business as usual dc bs in at least the last 25 years before that i frankly didn t care enough to pay attention so maybe it was longer they were silent but they weren t a majority at least not nationwide looks to me like the silent majority stayed home in disgust i mean trump got 47 of small turnout this good point which means there s a silent majority of libertarians the moment it s here it s finally here this is not actually supported by the data it s much more accurate to say that the people who voted for obama didn t show up to vote for hillary which they weren t taking into account all those polls that were wrong something i m finding hilarious is the progtards railing against white women because they leaned towards trump by a few points their heads assplode when you respond with yeah those white women are treacherous alright thank goodness we narrowly avoided putting one in the oval office jcr another case of academia soothing the butthurt of top men after a righteous ass kicking from hoi polloi h they published their analysis two months ahead of the election just saying it was confirmation for them before it s soothing salve now to their credit the article seems to be fairly open minded about the true motivations of trump voters as opposed to they re racist sexist morons with severe oedipus complexes or something and somewhat critical of the progressive elite calling it undemocratic liberalism though i would call it undemocratic social democracy or maybe undemocratic anti social social democracy i ve always understood the word liberal when juxtaposed to illiberal to refer to classical liberalism rather than the political left in september hillary clinton cluelessly declared you know to just be grossly generalistic your first mistake was being a person who thinks like this how bizarre is it that michael moore has become the voice of reason for the democrats is he the only one that doesn t live in a big city http dailycaller com 2016 11 ist video moore for all his faults actually goes out and talk to the hoi polloi he could see how pissed most people were moore is part of an apparently dwindling breed of democrats along with sanders i d say who identify more with the working class in the supposed battle against the capitalists rather than with the whining well to do university educated professional victim groups they are therefore marginally more sympathetic to the frustrations of the working class people that put trump in office indeed most of the new breed of liberals find it easy to support things like unrestricted immigration and the taking in of possible security threats because they believe those virtue signalling policies won t affect them they live in gated communities and high rise lofts out of the unwashed masses whom they claim to support openly yet talk shit about them behind their backs they took hillary s advice about having a public and private position to heart he s not the voice of reason he s still a raging moron you can tell because no matter what supposed insight he has about trump winning his solutions always come back to the same thing oppose trump and conservatives to your dying breath and support democrats big government and labor unions well we can at least recognize that he s aware of the problem despite his obstinate refusal to imagine an actual solution jcr populist rhetoric as a style that pits a virtuous people against nefarious parasitic elites who seek to undermine the rightful sovereignty of the common folk i never thought of the truth as a style before the revolt of clinton s deplorables i love it revolt of the deplorables coming to a white house near you until i looked at the paycheck saying 4730 i did not believe that my brother woz like actualy bringing in money part time from there computar there friend brother started doing this for less than 7 months and resently paid for the morgage on there home and bought a new cadillac http www jobprofit9 com spammers are deplorable i hope some sjw splatters you with red paint jcr i find the plethora of how trump won type articles amusing considering that virtually none of the people writing them were wise enough to know trump would win on tuesday morning if i want a how trump won article i ll ask scott adams thanks very much he sure got it right very perceptive guy reason should feature a post election interview with adams the trumpire strikes back how does it get to be labeled a populous movement when trump didn t attract any more voters that romney did for every voter the republican candidate gained he must have lost one this with the backdrop of an overall population increase of 9 million since 2012 yeah given the fact that trump got a lower turnout than romney the progs really can t pretend that this was anything other than their own failure sooner or later the people won t eat the turd sandwich even if the alternative is a giant douche jcr well a significant percentage of that 9 million was latinos and latinos just don t care much about voting latinos did turn out more than ever before but they already live in blue states it made no difference at all turnout was down in the states not hotly contested but i think the data suggests turnout was high in the midwest states where trump pulled the upset i keep seeing this and ultimately it might actually be true but i think that formulation is probably a touch simplistic without knowing all the factors it s possible that it took a populist surge just to get trump up to the point where he only got a few fewer overall voters than romney did iow he could ve lost a ton of romney voters and then made that back with populist voters so he really is a billionaire not just a walking publicity stunt poor closing and juxtaposition of thoughts imputes the implicit prejudice trump seized the republican party and rode the rising tide of populism in that sense the election of 2016 was the revolt of clinton s deplorables which as you quoted clinton equals the racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamaphobic you name it wow i just never realized there were 60 million of that vermin throughout the u s hell that s 1 in 5 walking the streets cripe you still don t get it i have likened trump to the lich king from world of warcraft essentially if something should happen to him and pence becomes president a scourge will be unleashed a scourge of theocratic domination an assassination or impeachment of trump will doom us all lolol and kek both the analogy and the prediction are ludicrously overwrought theocratic domination you ve been drinking way too much of the leftist koolaid i m not a leftist i just oppose being told how to live on religious grounds on secular grounds or on any grounds really you don t have to be a leftist to be influenced by their propaganda the idea that pence would or could impose theocratic domination is utterly ludicrous i ve heard that i ve heard that pence has a wet noodle for a spine and that he ll fold when pushed still doesn t mean he can t surround himself with people that actually do have spines fine but you re using the plot of a world of warcraft expansion to predict possible outcomes of domestic politics this is shaky ground snopes actually says some of the reports about pence like the one that he favored electroshock as a gay conversion therapy are lies of course those statements weren t true he wanted to execute them progderp as a political science major who is now a web developer let me be the first to say that political science is great for having debates and discussions with people about neat stuff but it s pretty shit at predicting anything and its explanatory ability is about on par with anybody who has interacted with more than seven people in their lives as others said just remember that all of the experts conducting the post mortem on the 2016 election and applying various paradigms to the numerous statistical data are the same people who failed to predict trump s victory political science in the 1990s starting focusing too much on trying to make it a science which is absurd given you re dealing with you know fucken human nature you can t put them into a neat equation the art of understanding human nature macchiavelli style is a lost art the obsession with the imperfect polls interpreted by people who were not infallible showed this perfectly it s ok they are going to award hillary a blue ribbon and a trophy for participation until i looked at the paycheck saying 4730 i did not believe that my brother woz like actualy bringing in
