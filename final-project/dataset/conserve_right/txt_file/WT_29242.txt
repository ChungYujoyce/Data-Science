tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap let democrats have their way president donald trump suggested and the united states will become a country without border security airplanes or cows trump warned of a variety of dire consequences from the democratic playbook as he rallied monday night in the border city of el paso texas in a hall where banners proclaimed finish the wall even though he barely has a start on the one he promised both at the white house and in el paso he presented the border wall as a work in progress hailing the start of a big big portion with much more coming soon it was a hefty exaggeration from a president who has yet to see an extra mile of barrier completed since he took office top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director with another government shutdown looming a tentative agreement reached by lawmakers monday could avert it and illegal immigration still at the heart of the budget dispute trump is pulling out the stops to portray his proposed wall as an answer to crime and drugs as he s done repeatedly trump also defied the record in claiming that the wall that congress has refused to pay for is rapidly coming together anyway in the course of the evening he also took a swipe at the green new deal a sweeping plan put forward by a group of democrats last week to transform the u s economy to combat climate change and create thousands of jobs in renewable energy this is where gaseous cows come into it a look at his remarks trump on the effects of the green new deal you re not allowed to own cows anymore he added that the plan would shut down american energy and a little thing called air travel the facts the democratic plan would do none of those things trump chose to ignore the actual provisions of the plan which calls for a drastic drop in greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas but would not ban methane emitting cows or air travel instead trump took his cue from a fact sheet that was distributed by the office of democratic rep alexandria ocasio cortez of new york last week then clumsily disavowed by her and replaced with a more accurate summary of the plan the first version described measures beyond those contained in the plan such as build out high speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary and it made the impolitic statement we set a goal to get to net zero rather than zero emissions in 10 years because we aren t sure that we ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast corbin trent a spokesman for ocasio cortez said that was meant as an ironic quip trump on the effect of a border wall on crime in el paso when that wall went up it s a whole different ball game i don t care whether a mayor is a republican or a democrat they re full of crap when they say it hasn t made a big difference i heard the same thing from the fake news they said oh crime it actually stayed the same it didn t stay the same it went way down thanks to a powerful border wall in el paso texas it s one of america s safest cities now rally remarks the fact trump falsely suggests a dramatic drop in crime in el paso due to a border wall in fact the city s murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence it s true that the fbi s uniform crime report shows that el paso s annual number of reported violent crimes dropped from nearly 5 000 in 1995 to around 2 700 in 2016 but that corresponded with similar declines in violent crime nationwide and included periods when the city s crime rates increased year over year despite new fencing and walls before the wall project started el paso had been rated one of the three safest major u s cities going back to 1997 trump on his proposed wall we ve built a lot of it rally remarks trump we ve actually started a big big portion of the wall today at a very important location and it s going to go up pretty quickly over the next nine months that whole area will be finished it s fully funded and we re going to have a lot of wall being built over the next period of time white house remarks the facts there s less going on here than his words convey construction is getting started on merely 14 miles 23 kilometers of extended barrier approved by congress about a year ago in an appropriation that also authorized money to renovate and strengthen some existing fencing the extension will be in texas rio grande valley that s not a big big portion of the grand project he promised in his campaign and countless times since a wall that combined with existing fencing and natural barriers would seal the nearly 2 000 mile 3 200 kilomete border with mexico the recent fight with democrats in congress has been over his demand for a 5 7 billion down payment on the wall that money would pay for a little over 200 miles 320 kilometers of new barrier democrats have refused to approve anything close to that for extended barrier construction trump also promised in the campaign that he would make mexico pay for the wall which it refused to do he inherited over 650 miles 1 050 kilometers of border barrier from previous administrations trump on preparations for his rally we have a line that is very long already i mean you see what s going on and i understand our competitor s got a line too but it s a tiny little line at the white house the facts that s not true his comment came about four hours before his el paso rally and a competing one nearby led by beto o rourke a prospective democratic presidential contender the gathering for both events was small at the time people were standing around in a dusty wind not so much lined up trump addressing el paso rally he has 200 people 300 people not too good that may be the end of his presidential bid the facts that s not true either o rourke s march and rally drew thousands police did not give an estimate but his crowd filled up nearly all of a baseball field from the stage at the infield to the edge of outfield and was tightly packed trump drugs pouring through the border kills tens of thousands of innocent americans a year including heroin meth cocaine fentanyl so many others they come through the southern border we have a drug problem over the last 6 7 10 years like we have never had before we can have such a big cut in the numbers the percentages if we get the wall built rally remarks the facts his assertion that a wall would stop most drugs from pouring into the u s runs counter to his government s findings on how the illegal substances get in most of it is smuggled through official border crossings not remote stretches of the border the drug enforcement administration says only a small percentage of heroin seized by u s authorities comes across on territory between ports of entry the same is true of drugs generally with the exception of marijuana in a 2018 report the agency said the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s through entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing other smuggling methods that also would not be choked off by a border wall trump illegal immigration hurts all americans including millions of legal immigrants by driving down wages draining public resources and claiming countless innocent lives rally remarks the facts these assertions are unsupported by research which trump appeared to acknowledge obliquely by making a crack about phony stats the weight of research on wages suggests that immigrants have not suppressed them although it s not cut and dried what s clear is that macro forces that go beyond immigration are at work in the sluggishness of wage growth the decline in unionization an intensified push to maximize corporate profits growing health insurance costs that supplant wages and the rise of a lower wage global labor force that in an intertwined worldwide economy can hinder pay growth for americans on public resources the national academy of sciences concluded an immigrant and a native born person with similar characteristics will likely have the same fiscal impact the academy found that because state and local governments supply most of the money for public schools immigrants often receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes but education produces children who grow into adults who get jobs buy cars buy houses and pay taxes and thereby contribute to economic growth and succeeding generations of immigrant families become net contributors to government budgets according to the study on the loss of lives plenty of research challenges the assumption that people in the country illegally drive up violent crime in one such study sociologists michael light and ty miller reviewed crime in every state and the district of columbia from 1990 to 2014 they found that a rising number of immigrants in the country illegally corresponded with a drop not a rise in reported crime trump we re going to el paso we re going there to keep our country safe and we don t want murderers and drug dealers and gang members ms 13 and some of the worst people in the world coming into our country we need a wall remarks at white house the facts trump suggests that weak border enforcement is contributing to vicious crime committed by ms 13 a gang held responsible for murders in cities across the u s but sealing the border completely would not eliminate the gang it was founded in the u s in the 1980s by salvadoran immigrants and has sunk roots in the country some of its members are u s citizens and not subject to deportation or border enforcement the government has not said recently how many members it thinks are citizens and immigrants in notable raids on ms 13 in 2015 and 2016 most of the people caught were found to be u s citizens associated press writers will weissert in el paso texas elliot spagat in san diego and kevin freking michael balsamo and matthew daly in washington contributed to this report
