expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey beijing which is seeking western help in hunting its own economic fugitives did not cooperate with the investigation italian officials said once the money left italy it vanished behind china s great legal firewall despite the deep economic ties between china and the west inconsistent cooperation incompatible legal systems and china s secrecy laws have allowed criminals to globalize more effectively than law enforcement and made it harder for western companies and courts to put them out of business we did not have the possibility despite many attempts made to have an official contact with the judicial authorities and police of china said suchan who oversaw the investigation we have discovered 50 percent of the truth china s foreign ministry said in a faxed statement that chinese authorities knew nothing of the italian case china is always committed to deepening law enforcement cooperation with other countries jointly cracking down on transnational crimes and punishing criminals the ministry wrote the ap has traced some of italy s missing money to an import export company owned by the chinese government the company wenzhou cereals oils and foodstuffs foreign trade corporation has been accused of repeatedly shipping counterfeit goods some to the united states but it has also taken shelter behind the firewall refusing to respond to a u s lawsuit brought by converse inc which says the wenzhou company sent tens of thousands of fake sneakers to the u s and croatia that firewall has also helped counterfeiters use major state run chinese banks as financial shelters on a significant scale ap found in an article published last month the banks including the bank of china have processed credit card payments for online sales of fake goods and held accounts for counterfeiters western companies that have pursued chinese counterfeiters in the u s where many fakes are sold have been blocked by china s secrecy laws the banks say they are caught in a jurisdictional dispute between the u s and china which maintains that bank secrecy is a matter of national sovereignty the perils of non cooperation are becoming clearer as chinese businesses go global chinese companies have invested 46 billion in the u s since 2000 mostly in the last five

how much china will adhere to existing norms forged largely by western powers and how much it will try to reshape them on its own terms chinese financial institutions can effectively operate behind a firewall that keeps them largely immune from the jurisdiction of u s courts and regulatory agencies leaving u s partners competitors and investors vulnerable according to a report last month from the u s china economic and security review commission which advises congress judicial cooperation has become a top priority for china s communist party which is ramping up efforts to repatriate corrupt officials who have fled overseas in april china launched a new initiative skynet to trace fugitives and their overseas money and released a list of its 100 most wanted economic criminals forty of them
