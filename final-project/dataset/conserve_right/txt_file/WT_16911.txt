d be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion now that the presidential race is in full swing it s time for robust talking about issues and creating awareness about problems which only seem to come to light when the american public is focused choosing a new national leader we ve already heard some suggestions that are music to my ears like radical overhaul of the internal revenue service repealing common core and restoring america s position as a country that s secure at home and respected abroad there s one key issue though which both candidates and the press haven t paid nearly enough attention to and in my view could be the determining issue for who sits in the white house in january of 2017 restoring manufacturing jobs top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time during the past 20 years it s estimated that america has lost more than 6 million manufacturing jobs think about that these were real jobs with real wages these weren t jobs flipping burgers or stacking shelves at a department store these were jobs that allowed you to feed your kids save for retirement and maybe go out to dinner occasionally what happened we re told pretty often these days that with advances in technology the interdependence on global trade and the increasing move to a retail and service sector economy that these jobs are lost and gone for good i don t buy it we ve seen a real economy with well paying jobs replaced with an economy built on bubble after bubble without real wage growth this is unsustainable manufacturing jobs do several essential things they keep more money earned in a given community if you work in a factory or a textile mill you re much more likely to spend your paycheck at joe s diner no relation than the worker in china or malaysia who has replaced far too many hardworking americans because a manufacturing job is something you don t necessarily need a degree for i think you d see a reduction in the rate of tuition growth and the student debt that comes with it it s estimated that for every dollar spent in manufacturing an additional 1 37 is added to the economy think about that what are we doing by creating more manufacturing jobs we ll also create more taxpayers instead of people pushing unemployment to the max or shuffling between jobs with wages so low that they re forced to rely on subsidies what can we do about it the first thing the public needs to do is demand that every presidential candidate of every party puts forth a plan for the restoration of manufacturing jobs the sad fact is aside from former sen rick santorum i haven t heard many candidates talk about the need for bringing back manufacturing the next thing the public needs to do might be a bit difficult buy american i m thrilled at the initiatives from people such as john ratzenberger cliff from cheers to market made in the usa goods but when i drive the streets of jersey i see car after car made abroad when i perform around the country i see audiences wearing clothing made in vietnam and china why would we be supporting communist countries paying children 10 cents an hour instead of supporting our own people consumers should be willing to spend an extra dollar in order to save our country the next thing we need to do is lower the corporate tax rate we have the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world when we chase our businesses overseas with an onerous tax code is it any wonder that they leave another key component has to involve raising the minimum wage so low wage workers can actually afford some of the products made here hand in hand with an increase in the minimum wage though there should be tax breaks for small businesses so labor costs don t cripple the backbone of our economy this is a golden opportunity for the republicans start creating jobs and you ll start seeing union democrats and urban voters voting republican for the first time in a generation if they don t capitalize on this the democrats should if neither party does then the public should demand an independent alternative the bottom line is that we re getting to a situation where nothing is made here let s use the purchasing power of a strong dollar coupled with low oil prices to invest in manufacturing during world war ii all of our nation s factories worked overtime to build war materials if we re getting to a point where there are no more factories where would we build the weapons needed to protect our nation in the next war when candidates come to ask for your vote ask them how they ll restore manufacturing jobs does it bother anyone else that we re borrowing money from china in order to buy goods made in china it has to stop i know i m an unlikely spokesman for this while i ve worked my share of blue collar jobs i ve never worked in a factory and the closest i ve come to a steel mill is the steel colored hairpiece when i played mr sinatra on saturday night live but as a spokesman for the boys and girls clubs of america i ve seen the remnants of cities that have been destroyed by the exodus of manufacturers and i ve seen what it leaves behind crime poverty and struggle let s get back to basics made in usa products fair trade and buying american not only will our economy recover but so will our sense of patriotism joe piscopo is an
