on of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion at the august group of seven summit in france president trump suggested inviting russian president vladimir putin to the next such summit that the u s will be hosting in 2020 mr trump added that mr putin might decline the invitation psychologically since russia was kicked out of the group of eight in 2014 for the annexation of crimea indeed in june 2014 mr putin was expecting the other seven leaders in sochi for the g 8 summit but they decided not to go citing russia s annexation of crimea moscow calls this peninsula s return to the homeland and met in brussels without the russian leader present thus the g 8 turned into the g 7 by the way earlier in february of that year sochi was the venue of the spectacular winter olympic games that many in the u s also advocated boycotting at that time crimea was still a part of ukraine and the only pretext for a boycott was russia s allegedly poor treatment of its lgbtq community top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed so how realistic is mr trump s idea of reviving the g 8 i think it is not and moreover i believe the g 7 is no longer important for the management of global affairs first there is a more substantive g 20 group which lately became better equipped for this purpose at the same time when it comes to the world s security issues the more relevant entity would obviously be the g 5 before we go into its suggested structure i want to bring to the reader s attention a book by the retired australian diplomat tony kevin return to moscow mr kevin was posted to russia from 1969 to 1971 and was later australia s ambassador to poland and cambodia in his book mr kevin made a deep analysis of all the standard western accusations against russia and mr putin including over crimea ukraine syria the downing of mh17 the skripals and a few other alleged misdeeds which have been used as justification for russia s expulsion from the g 8 and for unloading an avalanche of sanctions intended to destroy russia s economy and eventually bring about regime change in moscow mr kevin meticulously studied each case and came to the conclusion that we are now in the thick of a ruthless but mostly covert anglo american alliance information war against russia there are quite a few western dissidents who share mr kevin s view but those who conduct this war may not realize that as sen sam nunn and many others keep warning it slowly pushes us into a nuclear catastrophe mr trump clearly understands such worries and therefore i think this was the major reason he came up with the idea of reviving the g 8 to start a serious dialogue before it is too late it turns out that at the same time french president emmanuel macron made a major move on strengthening european ties to russia and securing moscow s cooperation in international crises including thwarting iran s nuclear ambitions speaking to a gathering of french ambassadors he said pushing russia away from europe is a profound strategic error because we will push russia either into an isolation that increases tensions or into alliances with other great powers such as china the european continent will never be stable or secure if we don t pacify and clarify our relations with russia taking into account that german chancellor angela merkel is leaving the political arena soon it is mr macron who is quickly becoming a major spokesman for the european union s foreign policy if mr trump wins reelection in 2020 he and mr macron would make a strong team to speak for the west with the three major eastern players china russia and india so the real decision making is about the g 5 listed above and it could start planning its first summit in early 2021 after the u s elections unless mr trump decides that international stability is so shaky that the g 5 group should be convened as soon as possible finally the chances for mr putin s acceptance of an invitation to take part in the g 7 meeting in the u s next year are close to zero however if mr trump ideally jointly with mr macron issues an invitation to mr putin chinese president xi jinping and indian prime minister narendra modi for a g 5 meeting all of them would undoubtedly accept if this meeting takes place before the november 2020 elections it could bring mr trump additional political points i believe the g 5 is the group of world leaders that humanity urgently needs today edward lozansky is president of the american university
