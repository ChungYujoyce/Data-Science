and rallies took place at more than 2 000 college campuses 10 000 elementary and high schools and thousands of other places across the country forty two states adopted resolutions endorsing earth day and congress recessed so that legislators could participate in the activities in their districts it is sometimes described as up to that time the largest public demonstration in history the lectures and literature surrounding the event featured lots of dismal predictions about the future one such compendium of doom wasthe environmental handbook whose cover noted that it had been prepared for the first national environmental teach in commissioned by the group friends of the earth the book preached the perils of rising population and imminent depletion of nonrenewable resources many of its contributors let s call them the catastrophists warned that even such drastic actions as halving the number of human beings and stopping economic growth completely might not be enough to prevent the imminent ecological cataclysm a different group of researchers believed that while economic growth and technological progress had created some ecological problems these things also would be a source of solutions let s call these folks the prometheans the economist theodore schultz argued in thebulletin of the atomic scientistsin 1972 that the expansion of modern agriculture would free up more land for nature other proponents of this more sanguine outlook included the oceanographer cy adler the economist christopher freeman andnatureeditor emeritus john maddox author of the 1972 bookthe doomsday syndrome today the earth day network hopes a billion people across the world will participate in earth day 2020 where the 50th anniversary focus will be on man made climate change living as we do in the future that the catastrophists and the prometheans were forecasting now is a great time to look back at the claims made five decades ago which side had the abler prophets in his contribution tothe environmental handbook an essay called the limits of adaptability the biologist ren dubos claimed that the dangers posed by overpopulation are more grave and more immediate in the u s than in less industrialized countries this is due in part to the fact that each u s citizen uses more of the world s natural resources than any other human being and destroys them more rapidly thereby contributing massively to the pollution of his own surroundings and of the earth as a whole handbookeditor garrett de bell s essay claimed that overpopulation was the biggest reason for mankind s increasing use of pollution causing energy sources while population control will take time de bell argued we could get a start on a solution by ceasing to use power for trivial purposes specifically the prices for energy supplies should be so scaled as to discourage people from using such abundant luxuries as blenders can openers power saws mowers clothes dryers air conditioners hair dryers and cars of course if you wanted to design a transportation system to waste the earth s energy reserves and pollute the air as much as possible you couldn t do much better than our present system dominated by the automobile de bell also noted that burning fossil fuels was increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere scientists are becoming worried about increasing co2 levels because of the greenhouse effect with its possible repercussions on the world climate he wrote reducing energy use in the u s by 25 percent during the following decade could be a start toward preventing disastrous climatic changes in their contribution to thehandbook political scientist robert rienow and his wife author leona train rienow declared that a new yorker on the street took into his lungs the equivalent in toxic materials of 38 cigarettes a day although factories and residential heating contributed to urban smog automobiles were the biggest culprits while cars get faster and longer lives get slower and shorter while chrysler competes with buick for the getaway cancer competes with emphysema for the layaway this generation is indeed going to have to choose between humans and the automobile perhaps most families have too many of both the book s most urgent vision of imminent global environmental disaster was courtesy of the stanford biologist paul ehrlich he sketched a scenario in which devastating famines would kill tens of millions of people in asia africa and latin america by the end of the 1970s and smog disasters in los angeles and new york would kill 200 000 americans in 1973 warning that america s resource situation was bad and bound to get worse he dismissed cornucopian economists by imagining future congressional hearings in which a distinguished geologist from the university of california would urge that economists be legally required to learn at least the most elementary facts of geology ehrlich s essay was not a prediction for how the 1970s would literally unfold but it was obviously designed to scare people about the impending ecological apocalypse and it did conclude with an actual prediction most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born he added that by 1975 some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable proportions other experts more optimistic think the ultimate food population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make ehrlich confidently declared in the april 1970 issue ofmademoiselle the death rate will increase until at least 100 200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years harrison brown of the national academy of sciences published a chart in the september 1970 issue ofscientific americanprojecting that humanity would run out of copper shortly after 2000 lead zinc tin gold and silver would be gone before 1990 brown claimed that his estimates took into account the possibilities that new reserves will be discovered by exploration or created by innovation the february 2 1970 issue oftimequoted the ecologist kenneth watt by the year 2000 if present trends continue we will be using up crude oil at such a rate that there won t be any more crude oil and in january 1970 life magazine warned in a decade urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution people in developed countries have been assailed by prophecies of calamity maddox wrote inthe doomsday syndrome to some population growth is the most immediate threat others make more of pollution of various kinds the risk that the world will run out food or natural resources or even the possibility that economic growth and the prosperity it brings spell danger for the human race the trajectories maddox foresaw for population and food production differed dramatically from those predicted by the catastrophists technologically advanced rich countries he noted had undergone a demographic transition from the malthusian past of high fertility high mortality societies to a high fertility low mortality combination but this he argued was a temporary stage we were already entering a population stabilizing low fertility low mortality state although the demographic transition has only just begun in large parts of the developing world there is every reason to expect that it will produce demographic stability entirely comparable with that which now exists in western europe and elsewhere in the industrialized world he concluded the population explosion has all the signs of being a damp squib food production meanwhile was now increasing much faster than population during the 1960s maddox observed it grew at 2 7 percent annually handily outstripping the global population growth rate of 2 percent a year in india and southeast asia food production was increasing at 4 percent annually about double their population growth rates and further improvements were possible with regard to energy maddox cited estimates from 1970 that there are more but not much more than 300 000 million tons of petroleum about 2 1 trillion barrels still to be extracted from the ground at the then current rate of extraction of 15 billion barrels annually he calculated that supplies would last for 135 years and other natural resources techniques for exploration and extraction of metals seem to have kept ahead of scarcity he observed consequently supplies of metals are becoming economically more plentiful not more scarce maddox fully acknowledged that pollution was harming people and the natural world cutting air pollution in the u s by 50 percent he said would increase life expectancy by three to five years but he did not think pollution threatened the very existence of the human race it was he argued an open access commons problem that could be solved through technology and sensible public policy in 60 american cities he pointed out average levels of smokiness had already declined by 20 percent from 1957 to 1970 sulfur dioxide had fallen by a third from 1962 to 1969 noting that burning fossil fuels was increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere maddox calculated that co2 would increase by 15 percent by 2000 that is in fact what happened he also predicted that that rise would result in an increase of the temperature on the surface of the earth by something like one half degree centigrade that was also just about right finally if it turns out that the scale of industrial activity is so great that the accumulation of carbon dioxide threatens climate change maddox wrote the same ingenuity that was reducing other forms of pollution could be applied to regulate the concentration of the gas to be sure such an intervention would require expensive and historically important changes in industrial practices but calamity is avoidable the bottom line for maddox was that technology and prosperity are not the inherent nuisances of which environmentalists continually complain but rather the means by which a better environment could be created world population has increased since 1970 though at a lower rate than predicted by the catastrophists at the time of the first earth day there were 3 7 billion people on earth that has now risen to 7 6 billion on the other hand the global total fertility rate back then was 4 8 children per woman it has now plummeted to 2 4 in 83 countries including the united states fertility is below the replacement rate of 2 1 children per woman those 83 countries represent half the world s population wolfgang lutz a demographer at the international institute for applied systems analysis projects that world population will peak in this century and then begin to fall though our population doubled those globe spanning famines did not occur instead world food production more than tripled with average per capita calories supplied rising from around 2 400 to nearly 3 000 per day in the u s corn yields since 1970 have grown from about 60 bushels per acre to nearly 170 now modern agriculture is becoming so productive that the rockefeller university researcher jesse ausubel thinks humanity is at the cusp of peak farmland and that our total use of land for agriculture will soon begin to decline meanwhile maddox appears to have been too conservative not too optimistic in his beliefs about global petroleum resources in 2014 the u s energy information administration estimated the total amount of technically recoverable petroleum at about 3 4 trillion barrels just as the world did not run out of oil it did not run out of copper lead zinc tin gold or silver in 1974 the total world reserves of copper amounted to 417 million tons the u s geological survey reports that in 2019 world copper reserves stood at 830 million tons in 1974 world lead reserves were 132 million tons in 2019 they were 83 million tons zinc reserves went from 236 million tons to 230 million tons tin reserves moved from 10 million tons to 4 7 million tons gold reserves rose from 41 000 tons to 54 000 tons silver reserves moved up from 187 000 tons to 560 000 tons as you may have noticed city dwellers in developed countries are not wearing gas masks as they go about their daily lives as forecast by maddox urban air was cleared using technology and the vigorous application of social instruments laws and taxes from 1970 to 2018 the environmental protection agency reports america s combined emissions of six key air pollutants dropped by 74 percent even as the u s economy grew by 275 percent the united kingdom and the european union have likewise experienced steep declines in air pollution surface water pollution has also been reduced based on 14 6 million pollution readings at 265 000 monitoring sites between 1972 and 2014 the epa reports that in 1972 30 percent of tested surface waters in the united states did not meet the fishable standard thriving habitats for fish that are safe to eat only 15 percent failed that standard in 2014 both catastrophist de bell and promethean maddox worried about the possible climatic effects of rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon indeed the amount of co2 in the atmosphere has increased by 25 percent from 328 parts per million in april 1970 to 412 parts per million today since the first earth day the globe s average temperature has increased by about 1 degree celsius and recent research suggests that the world is on track to increase by another 2 degrees celsius by the end of this century de bell responded to climate change by recommending energy austerity while maddox argued that the same human ingenuity that was solving other air pollution problems could be brought to bear on greenhouse warming given how thoroughly economic growth and sci tech prowess have falsified the catastrophists other forecasts it s not implausible that those same forces will let us surmount the problems posed by climate change too in his 1967 bookthe sense of an ending the literary critic frank kermode argued that human beings try to give significance to our short lives in the long sweep of history by placing ourselves in the middle of a narrative arc that arc typically traces civilization s fall from a golden age through a current stage of decadence to an impending apocalypse one that may through the bold efforts of the current generation usher in a new age the great majority of interpretations of apocalypse assume that the end is pretty near observed kermode but since the end never arrives the historical allegory is always having to be revised and this is important apocalypse can be disconfirmed without being discredited this is part of its extraordinary resilience the dire prophecies of the first earth day have been mostly proven wrong but the prophets of an always impending environmental apocalypse have not thereby been discredited auguries of imminent catastrophe remain resilient even as the world of 2020 is in a much happier state than the catastrophists of 1970 ever expected advertisement next automated license plate readers the mosaic theory and the fourth amendment ronald baileyis science correspondent atreason show comments 56

much of the improvements were because of the free market oil is too plentiful there s plenty of food minerals ect birth rates have when down do to wealth creation and now with all this progress the top men and women are trying to push us into another depression remember having children is a terrible thing because it greatly increases your carbon footprint also we need more people to support the welfare system so open the borders of europe and the united states to africa and latin america respectively i m surprised environmentalist don t bring up the fact that moving from a low carbon footprint country to a high carbon footprint country allows a person s carbon footprint to rise too it seems much of the improvements were because of the free market oil there is no free market in oil just the past week trump the crown prince of ksa and putin were conniving to fix production quotas for oil it s about as far from a free market as you can get since all significant reserves are owned or controlled by a small number of governments oil it should be one of the easiest commodities to restrict via cartels and yet time and time again market forces have defeated these cartels it s the market that makes the pressure on individual countries to cheat irresistible since putin is at war with the west and sa and iran are at war with each other nothing will change they may temporarily agree to restrict production but because demand has fallen off the table that won t improve prices much and russia is simply genetically incapable of resisting the urge to cheat at anything i m not sure what you mean by cheating are the russians selling oil and cutting it with water as unscrupulous smack dealers do with baby powder or is participating in a cartel and conniviving with the likes of trump and his favorite prince to fix prices what you had in mind the jury came back the catastrophists were wrong very wrong you know some of the ideas the catastrophists are pushing have merit the problem is they want to use the heavy hand of government to do it and the solutions they propose are positively draconian to me aoc is the archetype of catastrophists mindless power grabber but she s a strong independent woman with an award from mit so her mit award is worth about as much as her degrees yes plural from boston college university exactly nothing ou know some of the ideas the catastrophists are pushing have merit cleaner air and water is an idea that has merit and it seems that this was accomplished due to government regulations draconian ones as you point out earth day think ira einhorn you beat me to it you mean the cia wasn t behind holly maddux s murder einhorn lived a life of luxury in europe for over 20 years before being extradited and jailed but he s dead now so fuck him and arlen specter was einhorn s lawyer bingo why was he allowed to live the life of a celebrated intellectual in europe for 20 years seriously like epstein you have to wonder ron somehow forget this piece of sht the cultural marxist and murderer he was the man who started earth day a rapist and murderer and because of his connections ethnicity escaped justice for 20 years they were lying then they are lying now all they want is total power over the earth never vote for a democrat and oh by the way we are wearing masks far left climate extremist greta thunberg unloaded on the world in an op ed published awhile back claiming that fossil fuels are literally killing mankind and that they are a threat to our very existence as she said that her climate crisis agenda is not just about the environment but about fighting the colonial racist and patriarchal systems of oppression for several years now the climate alarmists have at least been more and more honest about their goals and they have little to do with environmentalism or reversing climate change for many it s about a new world order based on economic justice aka socialism perhaps with some other sjw buzzwords ottmar edenhofer un ipcc official basically it s a big mistake to discuss climate policy separately from the major themes of globalization the climate summit in cancun at the end of the month is not a climate conference but one of the largest economic conferences since the second world war first of all developed countries have basically expropriated the atmosphere of the world community but one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world s wealth by climate policy obviously the owners of coal and oil will not be enthusiastic about this one has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy this has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole christiana figueres leader of the u n s framework convention on climate change this is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves which is to intentionally transform the economic development model for the first time in human history democratic new york rep alexandria ocasio cortez s chief of staff saikat chakrabarti the green new deal wasn t originally a climate thing at all we really think of it as a how do you change the entire economy thing emma brindal a climate justice campaigner coordinator for friends of the earth a climate change response must have at its heart a redistribution of wealth and resources daphne muller green progressive liberal writer for salon this moment requires we the people to rethink democracy as a global mechanism for enacting policy for and by the planet gus hall former leader of the communist party usa human society cannot basically stop the destruction of the environment under capitalism socialism is the only structure that makes it possible david brower a founder of the sierra club the goal now is a socialist redistributionist society which is nature s proper steward and society s only hope for some others it s about the money or power and they ll use the science real or imagined to that end but still tossing in a few swj buzzwords monika kopacz atmospheric scientist it is no secret that a lot of climate change research is subject to opinion that climate models sometimes disagree even on the signs of the future changes e g drier vs wetter future climate the problem is only sensational exaggeration makes the kind of story that will get politicians and readers attention so yes climate scientists might exaggerate but in today s world this is the only way to assure any political action and thus more federal financing to reduce the scientific uncertainty former u s senator timothy wirth d co then representing the clinton gore administration as u s undersecretary of state for global issues addressing the same rio climate summit audience agreed we have got to ride the global warming issue even if the theory of global warming is wrong we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy christine stewart former canadian environment minister no matter if the science is all phoney there are collateral environmental benefits climate change provides the greatest chance to bring about justice and equality in the world researcher robert phalen s 2010 testimony to the california air resources board it benefits us personally to have the public be afraid even if these risks are trivial someone needs to regulate greta s use of carbohydrates imo the world of 2020 is in a much happier state than the catastrophists of 1970 ever expected choose your model choose your mood r i p climate change models climate change models are very much alive it s difficult to imagine scientific prediction of climate without modelling it s difficult to imagine scientific prediction of predict the future of the climate without modelling now they re predicting covid 19 deaths well we may have actually hit peak oil in that there s so much we might be filling up pools to store it i think the libertarian solution is to temporarily store the excess oil in the lakes and ponds around cushing ok also never ever forget that vicious cold blooded murderer ira einhorn was one of the organizers and keynote speakers behind this event the world of 2020 is in a much happier state than the catastrophists of 1970 ever expected well it was until a few weeks ago anyway never bet on the end of the world if you are wrong you will lose a lot of money and look as foolish as the doom and gloom predictions mentioned if you are right it just doesn t matter everyone wants to live in the end times that makes their times and thus them important the idea that humanity muddled through without you for millennia before you got here and will muddle through without you after you re gone makes you too meaningless everyone wants to live in the end times isn t that a christian fetish also christianity s desert cousins buddhism hinduism and animistic traditions are about continuity and cycles most secularists live for the sake of their children and grandchildren that s what gives life meaning i can count on the reason commenters to be clingers that absolutly want to destroy the world clingers is that an insult and one cannot but agree with the destroyers part that guy beside you on the parkway in traffic in the good old days in the chevy tahoe with the save the whales sticker life long democrat and all he is the destroyer i am not i have never voted democrat many of its contributors let s call them the catastrophists warned that even such drastic actions as halving the number of human beings and stopping economic growth completely might not be enough to prevent the imminent ecological cataclysm looks like they may have finally gotten their wish at least on the second part stopping economic growth thanks covid 19 sarc yes climate change is real it s my theory that the right generally doesn t believe in climate change because of the catastrophists there s only so many times one can predict complete climate collapse within the decade unless we give more power to government before people just stop listening it s my theory that the right generally doesn t believe in climate change because of the catastrophists the right is conservative by definition resistant to change the right believe they are entitled to a certain standard of living and are threatened by any changes to that paradoxically even belt tightening and conservation catastrophists only people it s difficult to believe that the right would adopt a position just to spite them many on the right believe in climate change but do not believe the claimed cause and even if the claimed cause is the cause its not a bad thing and the world may even be better off for it this is also my take on it yes climate change is real there s also a very good chance that it s completely utterly irrelevant where does the economic impact come from what part of a world average daily temperature of 16 5 c rather than 15 2 c generates any consequences whatsoever i have some background in numerical modelling specifically in the context of large scale multi sector multi region dynamic economic models find me a leftist who isn t totally hostile to economic models economic modellers are the people who tell the left that their infatuations can t be got for free a whole chapter of my phd thesis was about the importance of what is now called uq uncertainty quantification i called it systematic sensitivity analysis this is because the lack of bijectivity even of linear models means that model cannot be relied upon the be mean or mode preserving if you give it the most likely values of the input variables and parameters it will not generally generate the most likely vector in the joint distribution of the output variables so point forecasts where the input parameter matrices are a single point in a hypercube have no statistical interpretability you have to bootstrap the distribution of the output variables by simulation nobody does that even when the model in question is a simple one i was staggered while reading the icl paper on covid19 that they didn t have any serious attempt at uq the seir model has 4 parameters so it s trivial to get some estimate of their joint distribution and run a million simulations each using a draw from the parameter space with an associated probability that way you get a manifold for infections deaths etc contrast that with my phd model which took a day to solve in 1997 and i needed to do 100 000 simulations which would be less than 10 complete today eventually i jerry rigged a multivariate gaussian quadrature which approximated the task once you start scratching that scab tho it becomes clear that you can get a complex model to do whatever you want by judiciously selecting parameters and paths for input variables without making statistically different changes to the parameter set as a whole this means that a given model can literally give any result you want that s when i decided i couldn t be a think tank economic modeller which is a key reason i took an offer from a startup rather than submit my dissertation climate modellers know how to do this which is why they can get whatever result is required for the press release and yet they still diligently report dishonest forecast intervals in out years they show the interval at year 100 say as if it s calculated given no uncertainty for year 99 however year 99 is an uncertain quantity so is year 98 97 etc the forecast bounds on year t calculated at year zero are o t wider than the bounds on the forecast for year 1 nice post i spent some time modeling nuclear fusion decades ago and once you get into the nonlinear world it usually becomes more trial and error in you model problem with climate is you can t test in controlled conditions so the models time line for measurement are years or decades what no shout out to julian simon this story is about the losers was anyone back in 1970 predicting that in 50 years the world would be producing more food than ever before and there would be more malnutrition than ever before is that a catastrophist or a promethitist such a prediction seems counter to both positions yet would have turned out to be closer to the truth than either do you ever do anything but blather there is not more malnutrition than ever before there is an interesting trend in malnutrition that is other than based on a lack of calories but that s not been at all attributable to market failures a lot of that malnutrition is being laid at the feet of the government regulators who keep issuing nutritional guidance that turns out to be not just wrong but actively harmful well that and maybe that foodstamps ebt cards can buy a lot of junk food and in some places even fast food like mcdonalds obesity and poverty tend to go quite hand in hand in the us those who measure such things tell us that about a billion people suffer from malnutrition that is probably close to the highest number it s ever been erlich predicted mass deaths but due to food shortages clearly he was on the wrong track as i ve noted food production has increased since then and has never been higher did anyone predict high malnution and high food production they would have been the ones who got it right malnutrition in india seems to be responsible for the greatest growth world wide since 50 years ago especially among children at the same time the country has been praised as the poster child of neo liberalism scrapping government regulations and budget cutting you and i debated this subject here before and when i challenged your incorrect assertion that global malnutrition has grown you moved the goalposts to india the one significant nation bucking the worldwide trend of decreasing hunger and malnutrition after that little detour i again asked you about the global situation and you gave a trite response which was essentially a dodge you re capable of better the dire prophecies of the first earth day have been mostly proven wrong but the prophets of an always impending environmental apocalypse have not thereby been discredited auguries of imminent catastrophe remain resilient even as the world of 2020 is in a much happier state than the catastrophists of 1970 ever expected this is called assuming the conclusion and you know it ron cmon at the time of that earth day the only things that had actually happened were the santa barbara oil spill highway protests in the late 60 s against the robert moses model of bulldozing neighborhoods in favor of highways the cuyahoga river fire the hippies dropping out and moving to communes the nepa which required federal agencies to produce environmental impact statements for their own activities and coase s problem of social cost and hardin s tragedy of commons articles none of that points to a market on the verge of solving a problem if the problems since then have been solved they ve been solved by post earth day institutions and practices and you can t simply ignore them as if the models scenarios themselves created the changes that occurred models scenarios are not nostradamus rather they are simply a tool used to guide decisions about institutions policies of whatever type public or private centralized or distributed and it is those institutions policies that create the changes stuff your panic flag up your ass stick first sit on it and spin the cuyahoga river regularly caught fire for decades before the one that finally made the news most other rivers in cities around the world did the same the cuyahoga river only made the news because the environment was already being cleaned up to the point that the new fire was unusual the river was not being cleaned up nor was lake erie what that particular fire proved was that any efforts to clean anything up couldn t occur locally in many places and not at the state level in others in ohio all of that permitting occurred at the state level munis were explicitly prohibited from doing anything about that and federal courts have always adhered to dillons rule the legal notion that munis do not have any independent authority apart from what a state legislature grants not the cooley doctrine the notion that munis derive their authority from their residents citizens aka home rule in cleveland s case the locals did want to clean it up and even funded a 100 million bond issue to do that before the fire but the governor had no interest in that at all and had his own way of dealing with protest 50 year anniversary of kent st is coming up too santa barbara oil spill was exactly the same sort of conflict between local v state v federal that sort of jurisdictional conflict doesn t just go away there are many ways this could have been addressed but there is a century long practice where the big jurisdiction shop and our constitution simply doesn t recognize anything below the state level and the lake erie issues are obviously traditional inter state so fifty years of wrongheaded bloviation and wasteful impositions foo i don t deny that there are genuine environmental concerns with how humans treat the world around them i just haven t ever seen a proposal out the the green movement that would actually help i based my life on the cat theories and they failed me just like every other religion so because i believed them and consumed vast quantities of mind altering substances worked all my life at 7 11 so that my consumption habits wouldn t be compromised i was lied to where is the re start button can i get a cold boot and try something else maddox fully acknowledged that pollution was harming people and the natural world cutting air pollution in the u s by 50 percent he said would increase life expectancy by three to five years but he did not think pollution threatened the very existence of the human race he pointed out average levels of smokiness had already declined by 20 percent from 1957 to 1970 sulfur dioxide had fallen by a third from 1962 to 1969 rebutting catastrophists of ehrlich and club of rome caliber was more than a two pipe problem it took two packs a day to propel the author of the doomsday syndrome through 25 years as nature editor and on to become sir john maddox frs who alas expired just 39 years and 550 000 cigarettes after earth day let us hope the castastrophists that still haunt the smoke free corridors of the un and the europarliament never discover player s navy cut the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed and hence clamorous to be led to safety by an endless series of hobgoblins most of them imaginary h l mencken in defense of women environmentalism has morphed from a desire to live in cleaner more pleasant surroundings to a plan to control and eliminate all the deplorable people who do not agree with the politicians in charge i remember being in 3rd grade for the first one of these bolshevik events my woke teacher explained the world was on the brink due to american greed she had us sing this land trying to turn us into good little instruments of the state and yes ira enhorn the jewish 60
