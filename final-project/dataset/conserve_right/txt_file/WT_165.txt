citizens to reconsider travel abroad due to the virus and associated quarantines and restrictions trump spoke after days of confusion in washington and in the face of mounting calls on the republican president to demonstrate greater leadership at times though his remarks contributed to the uncertainty while trump said all european travel would be cut off homeland security officials later clarified that the new travel restrictions would apply only to most foreign nationals who have been in the schengen area at any point for 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the united states the area

of trade and cargo but various other things but the official proclamation released after trump spoke made clear it applies to people not goods and cargo the oval office address represented an abrupt shift in tone from a president who has repeatedly sought to play down the severity of the virus outbreak many americans shared a similar mindset in recent weeks but the grueling events of wednesday

address defense secretary mark esper announced a series of moves including restrictions for 60 days on travel by servicemembers defense department civilians and their families to from and through the four counties currently designated by the centers for disease control as the highest risk covid 19 counties china iran south korea and italy in his remarks trump focused more on the threat of travel continuing to bring in illness when in fact in parts of the country there already is community spread meaning people who don t have a known travel exposure are becoming infected in an omission that democratic leaders called alarming trump left unaddressed the testing backlog that is hampering efforts to learn just how many americans already are infected and while he warned the elderly to avoid risky crowds advised nursing homes to suspend visitors and told sick people to stay home from work he didn t address one of the biggest concerns whether hospitals are equipped to handle the sick or

borders trump said he was also directing agencies to provide unspecified financial relief for for workers who are ill quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus and asked congress to take action to extend it white house aides declined to provide details on trump s announcement trump said the u s will defer tax payments for some individual and business filers for three months to lessen the impacts of the virus outbreak he said the small business administration will also make low interest loans available to businesses to help them weather the storm this is not a financial crisis he said this just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world trump also reiterated his call on congress to pass a cut to the federal payroll tax in order to stimulate the economy though that idea has been dismissed by many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle he remained silent on his previous calls to provide assistance to industries hard hit by the pandemic like airlines and cruise ships on capitol hill house democrats late wednesday introduced an economic assistance plan that would provide free coronavirus testing nationwide and emergency funding to reimburse lost paychecks for those in self quarantine missing work or losing jobs amid the outbreak the draft legislation contains a new temporary federal sick leave benefit for coronavirus victims and caregivers two thirds of an employee s monthly income for up to three months as well as a permanent mandate for employers to provide up to seven days of sick leave for their workers and 14 days leave in case of public health emergencies facing a likely surge in unemployment claims the package would also give states money for the newly jobless it would provide additional funding for food and nutrition benefits for pregnant women mothers and young children it also would increase money for meals on wheels and food for low income elderly people as well as additional medicaid funding for states facing a fiscal crunch treasury secretary steven mnuchin whom trump tapped to negotiate with house speaker nancy pelosi urged congress to pass legislation quickly but while the ambitious package should breeze through the house on thursday senate republicans are likely to seek changes the administration had floated several other strategies including the rare idea of declaring a national disaster that could potentially unlock funding streams according to a person unauthorized to discuss the planning and granted anonymity but trump ultimately opted against taking that step

distancing but that didn t stop him from calling on fellow citizens to help combat the virus spread for all americans it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus he said for most people the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough for some especially older adults and people with existing health problems it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia the vast majority of people recover from the new virus according to the world health organization people with mild illness recover in about two weeks while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover congress attending physician told staff there could be 70 million to 100 million
