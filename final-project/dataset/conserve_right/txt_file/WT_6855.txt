policy professional to succeed john bolton as national security adviser marks a significant turning point in the white house s national security strategy to confront and prevail against robust adversaries especially china and iran in an increasingly complex and dangerous international landscape the u s china trade dispute transcends soybean purchases and trade deficits it constitutes the beginning of a grand geopolitical economic military and technological realignment of global power between washington and beijing that will play out for decades especially in asia and europe china

military presence that reassures japan south korea taiwan and southeast asian partners that free and open shipping lanes in international waters will remain a bastion of western pacific commerce china is rapidly expanding its military forces with fivefold budget increases since its wto entry in 2001 to deter and compel u s military forces back to guam and eventually restricted to hawaii so that china can achieve military supremacy over the western pacific region and the asian continent the european union america s largest trading partner watches passively as china s massive investment in major european ports and the creation of a 17 country european trading bloc portend greater long term financial and economic dependency on beijing china seeks to dominate the worldwide 5g technology network to be activated in the next decade accruing significant zero sum economic financial and military advantages the white house states that china annually steals hundreds of billions in u s intellectual property the reversal of which is a major driver of washington trade stance the strategic decoupling of the u s and chinese economies will also mean that global supply chains will continue to transition elsewhere in asia latin america and even the united states the likelihood they will return to china diminishes as the trade dispute is prolonged the trump administration sees not only a powerful economic and military peer competitor across the negotiating table but also a chinese communist party that demands leninist style absolute control over all aspects of china s politics society and economy including all trade arrangements the white house has concluded that this is the singular moment to extract maximum concessions from china and that any delay only strengthens beijing s ability to withstand deterrent american tariffs and sanctions that strategy has earned the support of many democratic leaders even within the nation s otherwise venomous political polarization in russia vladimir putin faces an increasingly poorer and more restive society even as he ramps up massive military spending for new nuclear weapons the militarization of the vast arctic coastline and the active destabilization of nato and the eu even as moscow eyes the potential riches of arctic development especially significant oil and natural gas reserves as well as shorter shipping routes between asia and europe beijing has announced it plans for an active arctic role so chinese ships can speed to europe s leading ports as well as across north america s arctic region to east coast ports in the united states it s why china sought in 2016 to purchase an old u s naval base in greenland and in 2018 to build three airports there it s why the white house

support u s and canadian ballistic missile defenses and space missions is more critical than ever that mission includes monitoring of north korea which is proceeding with missile and rocket testing while japan america s singular economic and military partner in northeast asia and south korea resurrect historic grievances to decouple their intelligence sharing and impose reciprocal trade sanctions fraying the region s security and commercial ties in the middle east iran s audacious attacks on saudi oilfields temporarily shocked global oil markets and revealed its increasingly desperate attempts to collapse u s backed sunni alliances and to compel european business partners to further urge washington s sanctions withdrawals and further concessions to teheran to prevent war and ease regional tensions this would open the gateway to iran s nuclear weapons developments and consolidation of regional hegemony at the expense of arab neighbors and israel the attacks will ultimately fail but tehran s hegemonic agenda continues to advance in syria where tens of thousands of shia militiamen undermine regional stabilizations plans in lebanon with hezbollah precision guided rockets being readied to attack israel and in yemen where tehran backed rebels who staged the 2014 coup undermine peace threaten shipping lanes and terrorize millions of starving yemenis tehran
