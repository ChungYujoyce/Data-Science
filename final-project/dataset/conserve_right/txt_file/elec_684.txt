republican vice presidential candidate paul ryan gave a powerful speech wednesday that repeatedly brought conventioneers at the republican national convention in tampa to their feet i am going to give him high marks for his speech s delivery ryan in typical fashion seriously and analytically ripped apart the obama economy what has been called obamanomics he ripped it to pieces and it needed to be done but most especially he ripped apart obamacare ryan also did his level best to defend the republicans against the usual attacks on medicare reform that is what the democrats call mediscare however i was disappointed that his economic growth solutions were somewhat muddled and unclear at one point in the speech rather than speak about mitt romney s own tax rate proposals ryan used the term tax fairness a democratic term frequently used by president obama and other liberal democrats this was surprising to me ryan cited jack kemp and the reagan tax reform and i am of course part of that gang googletag cmd push function googletag display div gpt 300x250 4 googletag pubads refresh gptadslot div gpt 300x250 4 cartoons close to home view cartoon but the reality is ryan never mentioned tax cuts during his speech not the 20 percent across the board supply side reduction in marginal tax rates nor the 25 percent corporate tax rate down from 35 percent these pro growth measures have been proposed by mitt romney but it is a mystery to me why ryan did not mention them he dwelled on debt to an extreme point i don t think discussing debt connects with people who are unemployed or marginally employed i think they want a good paying job and debt is almost an academic abstraction when republicans run on debt and deficits they almost always lose when republicans run on growth limited government lower spending lower tax rates and de regulation they win ryan s speech was confusing on the growth issue and that was disappointing i don t want to be confused and the american people shouldn t be confused it will be left to mitt romney on thursday night to clarify his own growth policies i want growth growth growth wednesday night i didn t get growth growth growth i heard debt debt debt alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhallfinance com makes available to the viewer a variety of independent sources that offer trading and investment advice and related services and products copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
