continuing development of nuclear weapons as well as working on miniaturization of weapons for missile warheads according to a senior bush administration official since the february nuclear accord reached in beijing north korea has continued work on weapons said a senior bush administration official involved in north korean affairs there are no indications that they are not pursuing a nuclear weapons capability to include the weaponization and miniaturization the official said u s intelligence officials think north korea which received equipment through the covert pakistani nuclear supplier network headed by abdul qadeer khan obtained chinese documents on designing a small warhead the key to developing a nuclear weapon small enough for missile warheads the chinese language warhead design documents were first uncovered in libya which gave up its nuclear program in 2003 three recent missile tests in north korea over the past several weeks were anti ship cruise missiles
