l the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox sign up here in april records from 9 11 mastermind usama bin laden s compound were disclosed detailing his plans to assassinate then president barack obama bin laden s rationale for his horrific plot was telling biden is totally unprepared for that post which will lead the u s into a crisis now a decade since u s special forces killed bin laden in pakistan it s my guess that president xi jinping of china our greatest geopolitical foe today also wants former vice president joe biden to be the next president of the united states this makes perfect sense when you consider thatxi wants what s best for china joe biden has been wrong on u s policy toward china virtually his entire career in fact biden and other establishment politicians in washington have been instrumental in china s meteoric rise from a developing nation into a communist power with global ambitions sen thom tillis coronavirus and china us recovery includes holding beijing accountable for decades china has executed a foreign policy focused on replacing the united states as the world s leading economy during his time as lead democrat on the senate foreign relations committee biden gave a floor speech in september 2000 in support of permanent normal trade relations pntr with china he said finally i would like to point out that my support for permanent normal trade relations with china is based not just on an assessment of the economic benefits to the u s not just on the prospects for political reform in china but also on the impact on our national security twenty years later on each of the three prongs he laid out to justify his support for the legislation it s clear that biden was dead wrong statistics show that 3 7 million american jobs have been lost to china since 2001 due to our horrendous anti u s worker policies furthermore china has imprisoned upwards of one million muslim uighurs and other minorities in re education camps it also according to reports jailed more than 48 journalists in 2019 alone just for seeking the truth and today we face a global pandemic with more than 80 000 americans dying from

vice president biden doubled down on his cozy rhetoric toward china in anop edhe wrote for the new york times biden shamelessly reiterated his unwise support for the chinese government stating i remain convinced that a successful china can make our country more prosperous not less he added i am convinced from nearly a dozen hours spent with vice president xi jinping that china s leadership agrees biden is choosing to ignore the fact that president trump singlehandedly changed the debate and rallied america around his get tough on beijing policy biden who first visited china in 1979 couldn t see that the communist leadership there was playing him for a fool he closed the editorial by saying some may warn of america s demise but i m not among them and let me reassure you based on my time in china neither are the chinese let biden s naivety sink in and juxtapose it with president trump s actions on china which show he s been right from the beginning you would think that biden

the debate and rallied america around his get tough on beijing policy exactly one year ago at a may campaign rally biden boasted china is going to eat our lunch come on man they can t figure out how they re going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system i mean you know they re not bad folks folks but guess what they re not they re not competition for us in our current reality this statement personifies how wrongheaded biden remains on china a typical liberal like sleepy joe in the white house would return to failed globalist policies and china would pass the united states
