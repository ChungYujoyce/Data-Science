economic information and technologies particularly in cyberspace speaking at a forum at the national press club robert bryant the national counterintelligence executive said the u s is finally making the charges public because china and russia are stealing sensitive u s technology data if russia and china build their economies on stolen u s data that s not right bryant said we want to basically point out what the issue is we want to be worried and we want to be careful but we also want there to be an awareness and frankly drive that toward solutions where we work together to bring this under control the report is part of an increased effort by u s officials to highlight the risks of cyberattacks in a growing high tech society people businesses and governments are storing an increasing amount of valuable and sensitive information online or accessing data through mobile devices that may not be as secure as some computers the obama administration has urged individuals and the corporate world to better protect their data thursday s report is a clarion call cybersecurity experts said we should have done this years ago said james lewis cybersecurity expert and senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies we ve pretended it hasn t been happening but that s not the case i hope this is the first in a series of documents that lays out the huge problem the u s is facing the u s points fingers at russian and chinese intelligence services and corporations based in those countries or tied to the governments the intelligence report however did not say how many of the cyberattacks are government sponsored and would not name other countries that pose similar but lesser threats it suggested that u s allies may be using their access to american institutions to acquire economic and technology information china had no immediate response to the report which was issued after normal business hours thursday in beijing china has consistently denied engaging in cyberspying and at a regularly scheduled news briefing wednesday foreign ministry spokesman hong lei reiterated beijing s insistence that it also has been attacked china is a major victim of hacking hong said china is ready to build together with other countries a peaceful secure and open cyberspace order he added as for the remarks from certain quarters i would point out that hacking attacks have no boundaries and are anonymous speculating on the origin of the attacks without investigation is neither professional nor responsible china has been linked to a number of high profile breaches google inc operator of the internet s most popular search engine disclosed two sophisticated attacks against its systems that it believes were launched from china the disclosures touched a nerve for technologists government officials and human rights advocates alike because of the unique roles google and the chinese government have in shaping what is seen and not seen on the internet by citizens of the world s most populous country in one attack some of google s intellectual property was stolen in a computer attack that also targeted at least 20 other large companies and earlier this year mountain view calif based google said it believes hackers in china broke into the gmail accounts of several hundred people including senior u s government officials military personnel and political activists the report also noted other incidents linked to china last year computer security firm mandiant reported that data was stolen from a fortune 500 manufacturing company during business negotiations when the company was trying to buy a chinese company earlier this year mcafee traced an intrusion to an internet protocol address in china and said intruders took data from global oil energy and petrochemical companies while officials could not pin down an exact economic cost to the u s government and businesses they said the losses are extremely significant china s continued theft of sensitive economic information is a threat to our national security hurts american businesses and workers and causes incalculable harm to global economy said the chairman of the house intelligence committee rep mike rogers r mich this once again underscores the need for america s allies across asia and europe to join forces to pressure beijing to end this illegal behavior the escalating rhetoric carries its own political risks particularly as the u s has tried to improve relations with china and russia china is a key lender and trading partner and the u s has relied on beijing to put pressure on its longtime ally north korea to negotiate over its nuclear program russia meanwhile is a key vote in the u n security council particularly on issues involving iran sanctions and nuclear arms reduction both were cold war enemies whose motives and government workings are often purposely opaque to american partners or competitors we have to start being more confrontational said lewis adding that the u s needs to have a more muscular trade policy and make sure that world trade organization rules are observed the report said foreign intelligence services have used independent hackers as proxies thereby giving the agencies plausible deniability and it also accused the chinese of being the world s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage attacks from russia are a distant second to those from china according to the report but it said moscow s intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from u s targets the report said some of the most desired data includes communications and military technologies clean energy health care pharmaceuticals and information about scarce natural resources of particular note the report said is interest in unmanned aircraft and other aerospace technology u s officials have called for greater communication about cyberthreats among the government intelligence agencies and the private sector the pentagon has begun a pilot program that is working with a group of defense contractors to help detect and block cyberattacks the
