aimed at halting pyongyang s nuclear and missile activities the top u s diplomat for east asia said friday beijing s action reflects a growing awareness about the urgent need for china to pressure north korea into halting its testing of missiles and nuclear bombs acting assistant secretary of state susan thornton told reporters in beijing president donald trump s administration has made a renewed push to enlist beijing s help in those efforts following a meeting between trump and chinese president xi jinping last month touching on other areas of the relationship thornton said the new

inspections beefed up sort of the policing function on the border stepped up customs inspections she said beijing has also done a number of other things on companies that have dealings with north korea thornton said without giving details the u s has been talking to beijing about taking action against specific firms and is waiting to see what sort of action china will take she said china has signed on to u n sanctions and suspended coal imports from north korea through the rest of the year but has been generally reticent about what other steps it may be taking to use its leverage as pyongyang s most important trading and diplomatic partner asked about thornton s remarks chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said china remained committed to strictly implementing u n sanctions but offered no details or what other measures it might be taking lu also reiterated china s call for a renewal of six nation denuclearization talks that have been on ice since 2009 saying the parties
