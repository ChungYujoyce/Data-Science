youtube has been removing videos of a press briefing in which two doctors criticize the sweeping shelter at home edicts that governments have imposed throughout the world in response to the covid 19 outbreak one of the videos had over 5 million views before it was taken down the original videos were posted by an abc news affiliate in bakersfield california when the affiliate reached out to youtube about the removal a company spokesperson issued a statement that offered the following justification we quickly remove flagged content that violate sic our community guidelines including content that explicitly disputes the efficacy of local health authority recommended guidance on social distancing that may lead others to act against that guidance from the very beginning of the pandemic we ve had clear policies against covid 19 misinformation and are committed to continue providing timely and helpful information at this critical time the claims of the physicians dr daniel w erickson and dr artin massihi owners of accelerated urgent care in bakersfield have been the subject of furious debate many health experts and organizations have denounced their remarks as unscientific and reckless even fellow critics of shelter in place who agree with much of the rest of their analysis have questioned some of their statistical inferences whatever the veracity of the doctors claims youtube s censorship of unorthodox ideas in the name of protecting the public from misinformation is misguided and counter productive sheltering the public from ideas even bad ones only makes society more susceptible to dangerous error one of the censored doctors critiques of shelter at home provides an apt metaphor for the folly of censorship dr erickson said i d like to go over some basic things about how the immune system functions so people have a good understanding the immune system is built by exposure to antigens viruses bacteria when you re a little child crawling on the ground putting stuff in your mouth viruses and bacteria come in you form an antigen antibody complex you form igg igm this is how your immune system is built you don t take a small child put them in bubble wrap in a room and say go have a healthy immune system this is immunology microbiology 101 this is the basis of what we ve known for years when you take human beings and you say go into your house clean all your counters lysol them down you re gonna kill 99 of viruses and bacteria wear a mask don t go outside what does it do to our immune system our immune system is used to touching we share bacteria staphylococcus streptococcal bacteria viruses sheltering in place decreases your immune system and then as we all come out of shelter in place with a lower immune system and start trading viruses bacteria what do you think is going to happen disease is going to spike and then you ve got diseases spike amongst a hospital system with furloughed doctors and nurses this is not the combination we want to set up for a healthy society it doesn t make any sense just as local health authorities are ostensibly trying to protect the public from covid 19 through shelter at home policies youtube is seeking to shelter the public from misinformation the following characterizes the perspective of youtube and the health authorities that youtube is serving in a metaphorical nutshell this is in keeping with the policy that youtube ceo susan wojcicki announced days ago that youtube would remove any content that contradicts the world health organization on covid 19 even assuming all the doctors ideas are indeed bad such a policy doesn t work and only makes things worse just as human immune systems are built up through exposure to viruses and other pathogens as dr erickson explained above our intellectual defenses against error are strengthened through exposure to bad ideas when you encounter a bad idea what can conceivably happen you can in the case of 1 there is no problem next let s consider 4 since that is the outcome that censors are most trying to avoid what happens when you adopt and implement a bad idea in your life in the worst case scenario it could destroy you but that is far less common in life than scaremongers would have us believe more often we suffer but do not die and that is a very memorable way to learn that the idea implemented was indeed bad we learn from experience from failure from the school of hard knocks that is one of the reasons why what does not kill you makes you stronger as the saying goes but not everybody needs to suffer to benefit from the lessons of suffering that brings us to 2 we can investigate the idea through investigation we can discover the accounts whether first or second hand of experiments with the bad idea and their bad results ideally these would be rigorously scientific experiments whenever possible finally we have 3 which is adopting the bad idea without implementing it what would be the point of doing that well it could mean adopting it just enough to advocate it and arguing for an idea is one of the most efficient ways to investigate it making 3 really a subset of 2 that is because argument elicits counter argument and true effective counter arguments are by definition antithetical to bad ideas even if the apologist of the bad idea holds fast to his belief the counter arguments that emerge can arm debate spectators against error in all of the above cases exposure to bad ideas strengthens our defenses against bad ideas we come away equipped with truths facts information and counter arguments drawn ultimately from experience whether our own or that of others these good counter ideas are like antibodies that we develop through exposure to bad ideas bad ideas are not just pathogens but antigens we thus develop immunity not only to those specific bad ideas but to similar ones because we learn to recognize the basic logical fallacies that they share the mind like our immune system and our muscles is antifragile to use the term coined by nassim nicholas taleb it grows stronger through exposure to adversity the flipside of that is also true just as sheltering from antigens can lead to immunodeficiency sheltering from bad ideas ultimately makes us more susceptible to them when paternalistic censors seal us up in a sterile bubble of ideas for our own protection they deprive us of the chance to develop through experience our own ability to identify and grapple with bad ideas as soon as a bad idea penetrates our bubble we have no defences against it our lack of experience with the responsibilities of intellectual independence has left us naive credulous and gullible the more that self appointed gatekeepers like youtube and its allied health authorities protect us from ideas they disapprove of the more susceptible we will be to falsehood and error including falsehoods foisted on us by our protectors themselves this vulnerability will in turn be used to justify still more such protection such is the vicious cycle of sheltering ironically many secular leftists who support public health influence sheltering probably fully understand the dangers of that practice in another instance the classic critique of a sheltered upbringing is that it deprives the child of experience grappling with potentially bad influences and so ultimately leaves her more vulnerable to them the stereotypical example of this is a child raised in an exclusively religious and traditional environment without exposure to non traditionalist peers popular movies and music and tempting situations once this naif inevitably leaves home perhaps to go off to college or the big city she has no defenses against the wave of bad influences that she must then face all at once with little support and so the wave engulfs her the same principle applies generally sheltering backfires whether the bad influences are cultural or medical this is one reason why open discourse is so important and censorship is so debilitating and disrespectful we need to be allowed the responsibility and practice of identifying and guarding against falsehood to be any good at it now all of the above takes for granted for the sake of argument that the purported bad ideas are in fact bad and that the censors are in possession of good ideas however that is often not the case heresies often turn out to be right and orthodoxies often turn out to be wrong and this includes scientific paradigms that wound up in the ash heap of history our protectors may be sheltering us from the truth and forcing falsehood upon us wrong orthodoxies are far more dangerous than wrong heresies simply as a matter of the scale of the error s impact that is yet another reason why open discourse is so vital for the sake of human welfare orthodox falsehoods need to be overthrown and heretical truths need to spread the remarks of the bakersfield doctors are probably a mix of good ideas and bad truths and falsehoods taking down the video does us a disservice regarding both sides of the coin to the extent that they are wrong their errors should be aired out and refuted any mistake the doctors made will probably be made again since the human mind tends to fall prey to the same basic fallacies by developing and disseminating counter arguments mental antibodies to them we develop our immunity to these and similar errors by taking down the videos youtube has limited the extent to which that social learning can happen and insulated the error from debunking if anything youtube s censorship has lent additional credence to whatever mistakes they made by feeding into the narrative that the powers that be fear its truth the debunking is being drowned out by outrage over the censorship and the streisand effect how censorship can boost something s publicity is causing it to spread even more moreover even if the physicians are wrong in some ways like in their statistical claims they may be right in other important ways whether or not sheltering bodies is a wise policy for the spread of covid 19 sheltering minds is surely a bad policy for the spread of ideas dan sanchez is the director
