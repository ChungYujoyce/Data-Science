apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic a navy officer has spent eight months in the brig as a captive of u s counterintelligence agents but to hear officials tell the spy tale they know few details about what he provided to china s communist regime or taiwan s government to be sure lt cmdr edward chieh liang lin knows a lot about the navy s spying on china he was a naval flight officer for long distance patrol aircraft that suck up communications as well as track and take reconnaissance photographs and video of beijing s aggressive military operations in the south china sea and elsewhere someone like cmdr lin would have detailed knowledge of not only the technical capabilities of the aircraft but how the aircraft is employed to accomplish its mission and what the u s knows about the signatures of submarines and ships used by other countries said dakota wood a former marine corps officer and war planner who is now at the heritage foundation photos top 10 handguns in the u s if such information was passed to such a country like china it would enable them to alter their methods and equipment in ways to defeat u s surveillance techniques and capabilities thus making their own operations more effective and gaining an advantage in time of war mr wood said cmdr lin a taiwan born naturalized u s citizen quickly rose from enlisted sailor to commissioned officer three years after enlisting by 2004 he was assigned to patrol aircraft at fleet air reconnaissance squadron 1 at whidbey island washington working aboard ep 3e aries ii aircraft its electronics specialize in reaching deep inside a targeted country to intercept what is called signals intelligence in other words enemy chatter the planes also jam air defense radars and can attack submarines at the time of his arrest as he tried to board a flight for mainland china cmdr lin was assigned to the special projects patrol squadron at kaneohe hawaii the unit flies p 3 orion and the new p 8 poseidon aircraft they differ from the ep 3 family in that they specialize in reconnaissance such as tracking china s militaristic island building and the movements of its fleet above and below the water s surface photos top 10 u s fighter jets the special projects moniker is recognition that the squadron is tasked with delivering intelligence to washington all the way up to president obama the planes also feed imagery to u s pacific command whose main task in the administration s pivot to asia is to keep china from dominating the asian theater but exactly what cmdr lin told his taiwanese middleman is unclear according to one u s official who answered no when asked whether the officer is providing details to fbi and navy investigators the source said authorities are certain that cmdr lin conveyed information classified as secret by way of verbal briefings as opposed to downloaded documents he gave the information to someone in taiwan the official said did it make it anywhere that s what we re in the process of trying to figure out that s what we re going to have to prove if it goes to trial cmdr lin went through a pretrial hearing in norfolk virginia on april 8 eight months after he was first secretly incarcerated in the naval consolidated brig in chesapeake virginia his fate now rests with a recommendation from a military hearing officer to adm phil davidson a career surface ship officer and commander of u s fleet forces who will make the final decision secret capabilities as a 10 year flight officer cmdr lin knows specifically what the u s targets in china and how he also knows the planes technology suite both its capabilities and its limits said mr wood simply put you don t want a competitor to know what you know about him and you don t want him to know details about your own capabilities a u s official told the washington times that the military s big worry is that cmdr lin in a series of debriefings described what exactly the p 3 and ep 3e can do how far inside a country can its sensors reach what communication nodes can it penetrate that p 3 aircraft has a sophisticated reconnaissance and photographic equipment and they provide information that goes to the national level to help make decisions and then thereafter to help with operations the u s official said certainly the missions are sensitive and he understands the capability of the aircraft and could possibly have shared those with someone else naval air systems command in patuxent river maryland describes the ep 3e aries ii the ep 3 aircraft in the navy s inventory provide fleet and theater commanders worldwide with near real time tactical sigint intercepts and full motion video intelligence with sensitive receivers and high gain dish antennas the ep 3e exploits a wide range of electronic emissions from deep within targeted territory the crew fuses the collected intelligence along with off board data and disseminates the collaborated information for direct threat warning indications and warnings information dominance battle space situational awareness suppression of enemy air defenses destruction of enemy air defense anti air warfare and anti submarine warfare applications the ep 3 is so intrusive that china s communist government would be motivated to find out all it can about how it hunts submarines and eavesdrops in april 2001 beijing s annoyance resulted in a collision between a j 8 intercepting jet fighter and an ep 3e about 100 miles from a chinese military base the j 8 crashed into the sea the navy crew members managed to steer and land their damaged plane on hainan island before cmdr lin s alleged spying it is the last known time that chinese officials had some type of access to ep 3e crew members who had worked furiously to destroy their equipment before being forced off the plane at gunpoint any of our potential competitors don t like it whether it s the chinese or whether it s the russians said the u s official it fills a need and capability for us a number of charges the heritage foundation s mr wood said that as china s military and economic powers grow beijing views the south china sea as its launching point to sea lanes in the indian ocean persian gulf and mediterranean sea the u s sees its role as ensuring those international lanes remain open to free commerce china has been aggressive in expanding its naval activities in that area and p 3s have made it possible for the u s to monitor what the chinese have been doing said mr wood a former planner at u s central command the navy filed a list of charges against cmdr lin he faces four charges of committing espionage by communicating secret information relating to national defense to a representative of a foreign government that representative is said to be a taiwanese official he also stands accused of three charges of providing false statements by lying about his whereabouts while on leave rather than the actual foreign destination the officer faces five charges of communicating defense information to a person not entitled to receive said information that person is said to be taiwanese taiwan s government last week denied any knowledge of cmdr lin the official charging document does not say exactly what information was compromised the navy released no details on the april 8 hearing because the information discussed is classified the navy initially did not release cmdr lin s identity which was first reported by u s naval institute news newsweek reported that cmdr lin collected a wide range of endorsers on his linkedin page including people in u s intelligence and residents of china and taiwan cmdr lin 39 immigrated to the u s as a teenager he enlisted in 1999 says a copy of his personnel chronology obtained by the times
