toll surpassed 1 000 and its caseload lunged to the worst in the world exceeding that of china or italy at more than 82 000 in a letter to governors mr trump said onerous restrictions should be tailored he said increased testing and sophisticated disease tracking models will help governors label counties as high low or medium risk for transmission of the new coronavirus as they tweak policies that have brought normal life to a standstill the president said some places should maintain or even tighten restrictions based on the data but he has made it clear that he wants to get people back to work as the pandemic ravages the economy in an election year indicating a desire to loosen restrictions we have to go back this is the united states of america they don t want to sit

services into youtube streams and closed many stores leaving only necessities such as gas stations pharmacies and grocery stores many governors have taken action on their own so it s not clear whether changes to white house guidelines will mean much in hard hit states where the disruption from the coronavirus could last months let me be clear the decision to reopen school districts rests with me we

sacrifices to help slow the spread of this disease now is not the time to retreat and let those efforts go to waste said sen patty murray washington democrat mr trump said he is not being reckless when counties reopen they should still be cautious he said u s reports of more than 82 000 cases of covid 19 and nearly 1 200 deaths put the death rate at 1 4 it is not clear how many cases have gone

in the state 5 327 surged by 40 compared with the figure mr cuomo reported a day earlier when he had cited projections showing the rate of hospitalization increases was slowing i don t want to sugarcoat the situation mr cuomo said at his daily briefing on the outbreak he said the state has enough personal protective equipment in the immediate future but the state hospital system will be overwhelmed under almost any scenario mr trump said the usns comfort ship will be dispatched to new york harbor on saturday to aid the city and free up space for hospitals reeling from the pandemic it s going to be leaving on saturday rather than three weeks from now mr trump said they did the maintenance quickly mr trump said he will go to virginia to kiss it goodbye and noted the media will be

bed space in early april if the pace of coronavirus infection does not slow in a statewide address he said louisiana is now tied with new jersey in the number of cases per capita but insisted his orders to shelter in place will work despite the dire circumstances we face i do remain hopeful said mr edwards noting that he does not see light at the end of the tunnel people just exercising good common sense with that we are going to start flattening the curve he said the coronavirus was discovered in wuhan china in december it killed thousands in china before the epicenter shifted to south korea and then europe and the americas more than half a million people have been infected worldwide china on thursday announced it is barring the entry of foreign nationals holding visas or residence permits as of midnight saturday as part of its efforts to prevent a flare up the communist government says it has the outbreak under control and is worried about a rebounding effect as cases soar elsewhere the suspension is a temporary measure that china is compelled to take in light of the outbreak situation and the practices of other countries the chinese foreign ministry said china will stay in close touch with all sides and properly handle personnel exchanges with the rest of the world under the special circumstances mr trump says his late january decision to ban foreign nationals who had been in china during the previous 14 days prevented a far worse problem in the u s now it s china that is setting up barriers saying it doesn t want to import cases and squander the fruits of its draconian measures earlier in the year mr trump said he planned to speak to chinese president xi jinping late thursday he predicted a good call even as he blames china for its delayed response to the outbreak former vice president joseph r biden who likely will face mr trump in the presidential election in november said mr trump was too soft on mr xi and china in the early days of the outbreak he continued to criticize mr trump s tactics thursday in media appearances and virtual addresses from his home in delaware the president is not responsible for the coronavirus but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response that has exacerbated both the public health and economic impact on our country mr biden said the harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don t have jobs because our president didn t do his job when it mattered mr trump said the record number of people filing jobless claims are nobody s fault given the unexpected pathogen they are fully expected numbers he said treasury secretary steven t mnuchin meanwhile told cnbc that the figures are not relevant in the short term and cited the president s efforts to help those people the senate late wednesday night approved a 2 2 trillion economic rescue package that includes 250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits and increased eligibility it would cover the self employed and

show i would expect economic activity to resume and move back up in the second half of the year he said there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the u s economy the economy performed very well right through february he said this is a situation where people are being asked to step back from economic activity close their businesses stay home from work the sooner we get through this period and get
