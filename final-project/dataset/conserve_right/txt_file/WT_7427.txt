president donald trump says he believes a vaccine for covid 19 will be available by the end of the year trump also says the u s government is putting its full power and might behind remdesivir a drug that has shown early promise as a treatment for the disease caused by the new coronavirus trump commented sunday night during a televised town hall sponsored by fox news channel trump sat inside the lincoln memorial and fielded questions from two fox hosts as well as from people who submitted questions over fox s social media platforms trump responded to a nebraska man who recovered from covid 19 by saying we think we are going to have a vaccine by the end of this year he also said his administration was pushing hard for remdesivir u s public health officials have said a vaccine is probably a year to 18 months away but dr anthony fauci said in late april that it s conceivable if a vaccine is developed soon it could be in wide distribution as soon as january new york after working with neighboring states on coronavirus related closing and reopening plans gov andrew cuomo said sunday that new york will join with states from massachusetts to delaware to create a regional supply chain for masks gowns ventilators testing supplies and other equipment vital to fighting the disease the states are joining together after months of dealing separately with what cuomo said was a totally inefficient and ineffective purchasing process that pitted all 50 states against each other as well as the federal government and other entities driving up prices as supplies dried up new york buys about 2 billion worth of medical equipment supplies per year cuomo said the other states joining the consortium together spend about 5 billion per year working together they ll have stronger purchasing power and improve their clout with global suppliers cuomo said it will make us more competitive in the international marketplace and i believe it will save taxpayers money cuomo said i also believe it will actually help us get the equipment because we have trouble still getting the equipment the other states in the consortium are connecticut rhode island new jersey and pennsylvania one goal the states governors said is to find suppliers within the region instead of relying on swamped manufacturers in china and other faraway places washington michigan s governor says gun carrying protesters who demonstrated inside her state s capitol depicted some of the worst racism and awful parts of u s history democrat gretchen whitmer tells cnn that the protests featured confederate flags and nooses as well as swastikas members of the michigan liberty militia protested the state s stay at home orders this week some with weapons and tactical gear and their faces partially covered they went inside the capitol where being armed is allowed then demanded access to the house floor which is prohibited some went to the senate gallery where a senator said armed men shouted at her michigan s republican controlled legislature has questioned whitmer s authority to extend stay at home orders amid the coronavirus pandemic but the governor used an executive order to extend a state of emergency declaration and has directed most businesses statewide to remain closed mentioned as a possible running mate for presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden whitmer said sunday this isn t something we just negotiate ourselves out of and it s a political matter this is a public health crisis she said washington secretary of state mike pompeo says china has been responsible for the spread of disease in the past and must be held accountable for the coronavirus pandemic that originated in the country in comments likely to spark protests from beijing and elsewhere pompeo said china has a history of infecting the world he cited poor safety and security at epidemiological laboratories including in the city of wuhan where the virus was first reported he stressed that he had no reason to believe the virus was deliberately spread but he ramped up already harsh u s criticism of the chinese for their response to the outbreak remember china has a history of infecting the world and they have a history of running substandard laboratories pompeo said sunday on abc s this week program these are not the first times that we ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a chinese lab and so while the intelligence community continues to do its work they should continue to do that and verify so that we are certain i can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in wuhan pompeo appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses like sars which started in china but his remark may be seen as offensive in china given the history of u s discrimination against the chinese and people of chinese origin dating to the 19th century rome on the eve of the start in italy of partially eased restriction on citizens movements during covid 19 lockdown the nation received some encouraging news after weeks of grim daily tallies of caseload and deaths health ministry figures put the number of

nation has seen in two months italy s number of known covid 19 infections total is 210 717 although authorities say the number is likely higher as many infections in people with no or almost no symptoms are believed to have gone undetected italy s death toll stands at 28 884 but that number too could be much higher since many elderly persons in recent weeks died in nursing homes but weren t tested to see if they had coronavirus infection olympia wash more than 100 state parks trails and boating sites across washington state will re open tuesday as some coronavirus restrictions are eased
