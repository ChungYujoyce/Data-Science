news sunday end videotape maccallum and hello again from fox news in washington this weekend white nationalists will use the white house as their backdrop as they take to the streets once again what began last summer as a gathering to defend the statue of robert e lee devolved into something much darker the protesters and counter protesters flooded the streets and then a car driven by a suspected neo nazi plowed into the crowd in charlottesville killing 33 year old heather heyer and injuring 19 others today the statue remains behind a barricade meanwhile more violence in the city of chicago where they also have seen protests of their own now against the killings in their streets twenty people were shot this weekend two of them fatally three children were wounded including a 12 year old girl as the city adds 600 officers to patrol the streets after last weekend aposs brutal violence of 74 shootings that left 12 people dead all of this as the president speaks out for unity and faces new criticism for some of his latest tweets going after nfl players who are once again protesting during our national anthem here to speak about all of this kellyanne conway counselor to the president in just a moment but first to peter doocy who is live in lafayette park the site of today aposs rally peter peter doocy fox news correspondent good morning martha there aposs a white civil rights rally planned for lafayette park this afternoon white nationalist participants plan to meet in northern virginia 15 miles or 10 metro stops away from here to then ride the rails into the district we don apost know how many people plan to show up but the permit requested room for as many as 400 protesters there are also though planned counterprotests nearby that could draw thousands today aposs event is called unite the right 2 speakers include a former kkk leader david duke and it aposs happening here in d c because its organizer jason kessler was denied a permit to rally again in charlottesville tensions in charlottesville remain high this weekend for the anniversary of last year aposs unite the right rally where a demonstration against the removal of a robert e lee statue devolved into deadly chaos violence that president trump was initially criticized for characterizing like this begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i think there aposs blame at both sites you look at if you look at both sides i think there aposs blame on both sides and i have no doubt about it end video clip doocy the president is not going to be anywhere close to the white house today he will remain in bedminster new jersey last night he hosted a bikers for trump event and the biggest headline there was that he called omarosa a former white house staffer who wrote a book alleging that the president is a racist a quote lowlife the president has tweeted this weekend to broadly condemn racism and violence but he has not specifically addressed today aposs event martha maccallum peter thank you very much peter reporting steps from the white house this morning joining me now from fox news headquarters in new york kellyanne conway counselor to the president kellyanne welcome back to fox news sunday good to have you here this morning kellyanne conway counser to the president thank you martha maccallum so kellyanne the president tweeted this weekend the riots in charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division we must come together as a nation i condemn all types of racism and acts of violence peace to all americans he wrote but in a new poll 57 percent say that race relations are actually worse under president trump since he became president so does he need more than tweets to be convincing on this issue kellyanne conway two things i aposd say about that and first is you even saw when our first african american president barack obama left office it was very mixed polling and very missed assessment of race relations eight years after he was in office so this is not unique to president trump in terms of people wanting to improve relations i think we should all agree that we always want the nations to improve among people of different backgrounds and different races secondly i think you aposve got to look at president trump aposs record with respect to men and women of color the record low unemployment rate among african americans hispanic americans asian americans and others is remarkable and it aposs owing to his policies his bold leadership that there are so many more people of color who are able to access these new jobs in manufacturing and professional industries as well in mining as well carpentry is way up and yet this president also is for school choice and charters he is trying to give those who are trapped in conventional school systems that are failing these students another choice the prison reform initiative that jared kushner and president trump have put forth is meant to help all people of all races but we know disproportionately many of our prisons those are african americans were languishing in prisons those who have paid their debt to society martha and can reenter to have the skilled education the opportunities and indeed make themselves available for the 6 6 million jobs that are out there this is a president who aposs doing all of that and even my former colleagues in the west wing omarosa agreed with much of that when she was there maccallum well i want to talk about that in the moment but you know when you look at the disparity in the numbers when president obama left office 37 percent that he had made race relations worst and as i pointed out just a moment ago the number for the president right now is a 57 percent of those believe that he has made relations worst so given the fact that as you point out the unemployment numbers are better for minorities and all of the efforts that the president has made which you just mentioned that are trying to lift all boats there still seems to be that feeling as his critics say that he doesn apost want to make america great again he wants to make america white again can he be more articulate more outspoken on this issue and you know it goes to one of the other things that we talked about this week the tweets about the nfl players some people say he aposs tougher on nfl players and athletes than he is on the movements that we are about to see this afternoon in washington conway well that aposs just a terrible thing to say this president last august 14th said the following it doesn apost get much coverage so i aposm going to read it quote racism is evil and those who call violence and its aims are criminals and thugs including the kkk neo nazis white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as americans that quote doesn apost get much inaudible that was the president of the united states president trump last august 14th denouncing of specifically kkk neo nazis white supremacists after already and before that and after that denouncing racism bigotry hatred and violence as he did again yesterday as for the national anthem the president made very clear that he believes it aposs not a big ask to have people stand for the flag and the national anthem at football games and elsewhere and that separately martha if these professional athletes want to go back into their communities or anywhere they want where they have considerable platforms and in most cases very big popularity that they should go ahead and make their voices known there on the field when people go to play for a football game it sounds like the nfl aposs new policy actually agreed with this they said if you aposre going to be on the field you can apost be kneeling you can stay in the locker room crosstalk conway well there you go maccallum let me go back to omarosa manigault because she aposs speaking out as you well know she was in charge of african american outreach for the white house she has said that she was fired because she knew too much about a tape on which the president used the n word she also has said she heard him call your husband derogatory names as well did the president do either of those things kellyanne conway no he did not i aposve never heard the president of the united states use a racial slur about anyone i simply haven apost heard it martha today is two years to the day he asked me to be his campaign manager i aposve worked alongside of him for over two straight years now without interruption i have never once heard him say that about anyone and i never heard omarosa complained that she had heard the president say it about anyone either when she was there she has contradicted her own account she told abc news the day after she was fired that she had resigned she is now saying she was fired she told abc news the day after she was fired that she that quote donald trump no he aposs not a racist that she wouldn apost have been there she also had a very glowing appraisal of donald trump the businessman the leader of the apprentice the candidate and indeed the president specifically in trying to reach out to african americans helping the hbcus historically black colleges and universities through executive orders through workforce development through prison reform omarosa crosstalk conway omarosa criticized the congressional black caucus for not meeting with him maccallum you heard what the president said at bedminster yesterday he called her a lowlife which raises an obvious question why was she ever hired in the first place if the president thinks she aposs a lowlife conway no he thinks i think he believes it aposs a low blow to write a book riddled with lies and accusations and insinuations whether 30 pieces of silver or a seven figure book for you your publicists your ghostwriters all that aposs changed was this book deal and her being fired so i think he probably feels very betrayed and i feel very disappointed because i always had a very good working relationship with omarosa and i and the fact is in the west wing i never heard or a single time not on the campaign the west wing ever even after that say that she heard such things my husband very strongly said this is absurd all the way around that the president would not use these words about him my husband is half filipino and i just never heard that and i think that matters also i think omarosa missed a great opportunity here martha to take credit for all of the wonderful gains the president has made for people of color whether it aposs the hbcus the workforce development the historically low unemployment numbers the accessibility of more jobs the prison reform the drug reform that i worked on firsthand on behalf of the president she should have said i aposm very glad that all of our labors are bearing fruit but instead she is trying to sell books and settle scores and you aposve got to be anti trump for those to be successful it aposs very disappointing maccallum let me ask you one more question before i let you go on a new topic on august 16th the boston globe has asked newspapers across the country to put out editorials essentially attacking the president for his dirty war this is their quote against the free press how do you respond to that conway that aposs what they do every single day every single day the mainstream media which now has anywhere from 17 to a 20 percent approval rating that i aposve have seen is virulently anti trump and they aposre not just being skeptical they aposre being cynical and they make everything about them even at these rallies martha the press covers the part that aposs about the press the people hear the policies that are about the people and i think that the press many of them are trying to get the president instead of get the story many of them as you well know are trying to become the story it increases their speaking fees they get to go on late night tv and make fun of the president and everybody around him that is not journalism and i don apost know how people can feel that modern reporting and journalism industry includes people like this new inaudible along that was hired by the new york times because she wonders how quickly white people can burn cancel white people make fun of white men you aposve got marc caputo from politico last week in tampa saying calling that trump supporters quote garbage people and saying if you line them all up next to each other they aposd have a full set of teeth that aposs a modern state of journalism i aposm sure you as a responsible and respected reporter would object to that so look they are they are not trying they are trying to erase this presidency so a democrat is elected president a very successful at that but many of them are in a dying industry that unlike the trump corporation is not very profitable maccallum all right conway and they should try to go out and learn what they keep getting wrong about trump and his supporters and his policies and stop just being so reflexively invectively virulently anti trump maccallum all right kellyanne thank you very much good to see you conway thank you martha maccallum thanks for joining us coming up next we bring in our sunday group to discuss the racial divide that is in this country and why plus do democrats have a pelosi problem begin video clip unidentified male will you vote for nancy pelosi unidentified female probably not unidentified male probably not unidentified female that aposs my answer no probably not unidentified male will you do that unidentified male i will support whoever the democratic party supports unidentified male thank you unidentified male honestly no i think we need new leadership end video clip commercial break begin video clip chanting end video clip maccallum students protesting last night on the university of virginia campus on the anniversary weekend of the unite the right rally that led to violence last year in charlottesville time now for our sunday group former press secretary to vice president pence marc lotter columnist for the hill juan williams lisa lerer who covers politics for the associated press and charles hurt opinion editor for the washington times thanks to all of you for being today juan let me start with you on this you have a new book called what the hell do you have to lose juan williams author what the hell do you have to lose right maccallum which hearkens back to something president trump said on the campaign trail exhorting african americans to give them a chance essentially he got about 8 percent of the african american vote which is not allowed but a little bit more than romney and mccain got when they ran so how do you think the president is doing on this issue williams well i think martha it aposs pretty clear that a year after charlottesville the president continues to talk about blacks about latinos to his white base as a group that is i mean he aposd say black and latinos are dumb violent and less patriotic than white americans i think that aposs racist kind of language but he uses that he placed to that tribalism and in a way it aposs to his political advantage he seems to think it encourages or stirs up his base of voters to support him but i think it also stirs up and emboldens the white nationalists the kkk the neo nazis in this world that aposs why you see him pulling i think quinnipiac has a poll it says more than half 55 percent of americans see president trump as acting in a way that aposs emboldening maccallum give me an example though of how he aposs called african americans dumb williams oh well i mean this week with lebron james maccallum why is that because of the color of lebron james apos skin williams well because what he does is he plays to this racial stereotype about blacks as less intelligent not only with that remember he maccallum he called a lot of people dumb williams no he has here a sort of purposeful intentional lack of attention to exactly the racial stereotype of shut up and dribble you know you were just a basketball player you don apost have the right to be critical of your president in the way that nfl players now are viewed as unpatriotic by trump even though they are simply talking about police brutality and exercising strong constitutional rights and you see this behavior by trump by the way a year later after charlottesville being mimicked now by republican candidates corey stewart in virginia you have in illinois california congressional candidates who were holocaust deniers this whole thing maccallum those people are candidates williams yes that aposs what i aposm saying maccallum we aposll see if they aposre able to get elected charlie respond to what juan is saying here charlie hurt opinion editor the washington times well you know i think it aposs an incredibly unfair assessment of president trump i don apost i don apost think that he is playing to those things and when he calls lebron james dumb or whoever he recalls dumb he aposs not drawing any nexus between his race and being dumb and i think that people that do try to draw some nexus i think they aposre the ones that are dragging race into it i think that you know politics in america over the past 20 years in the democratic party has been by far the worst of it in the past couple of decades has used race religion and gender to divide people and they make this the whole problem so much worse and i think that i don apost think you could possibly deny that democrats have used racial politics at least as much as conservatives may have you know decades ago but it is and it is tearing us apart a year ago today was a tragic event one innocent person died two innocent virginia state troopers were killed but let aposs put it into perspective when you compare and you noted at the top of the show martha that you know number of people shot and killed in chicago a basic weekend but the media focuses on this stuff politicians focus on it because they want to get these divisions in a very damaging way but i think if we step back and put it into perspective a race relations in this country are a whole lot better than i think you would get the impression from reading the media or listening to politicians who were trying to make politics out about all of it and i think that i think we should everybody should calm down a little bit and put this into perspective maccallum a couple of interesting voices on that and i want to get thoughts from lisa and marc on this this is la shawn ford who aposs a democrat in chicago a democrat lawmaker in chicago he says as a democrat i come here today calling on the president he said he wanted to help people in chicago and i accept that help that is number one we want to receive help from the president of the united states and then another voice kanye west talking to jimmy kimmel had this to say when jimmy kimmel pushed back on his support of president trump watch begin video clip kanye west rapper liberals can apost bully me news can apost bully me the hip hop immunity they can apost bully me because at that point if i aposm afraid to be me i aposm no longer ye that aposs what makes ye end video clip maccallum that aposs what makes ye so lisa let me go to you to this on the politics of all of this because when it comes to election time how how will this impact the president with moderates with independent voters lisa lerer associated press well what aposs been so striking about all these sort of incidents with the president is that normally you know when you have this kind of racial unrest presidents step in and try to calm the situation down that is not clearly what this president does he seems to thrive on this kind of tension and divisiveness but you know it really hasn apost caused them a year after charlottesville republicans are more unified around him he is still hotly desired most places a lot of places on the campaign trail he hasn apost really paid a price for you know what he said in his back and forth about the charlottesville incident a year ago so i think the takeaway for a lot of people for the president and for a lot of people around the president about that is that there is no single incident that is going to tank him or going to you know certainly tank him of his supporters but maybe with you know hurt him more with independents either they aposre not really holding their breath for a katrina moment that aposs not really going to happen with this president maccallum inaudible kamala harris talking about identity politics let aposs watch begin video clip sen kamala harris d california i have a problem guys with that phrase identity politics because let aposs be clear when people say that it aposs a pejorative that phrase is used to divide and it is used to distract its purpose is to minimize and marginalize issues that impact all of us it is used to try and shut us up end video clip maccallum this is the debate that we aposre talking about here marc your thoughts marc lotter former vp pence press secretary well i think to charlie aposs point earlier i mean democrats have been engaging in identity politics for decades now and it aposs not something that is likely to change anytime soon in fact i think because of people like kanye west and others were coming out and saying i aposm going to give this president a chance for the ones who actually took the president up and said what do you have to lose as more and more people are coming over and saying you know i look at the unemployment rate that president trump talks about i look at our increased wages i see him engaging on the things that he was going to do i aposll give him a chance the more and more the democrats are going to have to try to strike fear to try to keep those people into their political fold and it aposs just not something i think is going to work in the long term and when you look at the president aposs approval ratings among african americans right now it aposs doubled according to some recent polls about 20 percent so it shows that the results do matter and people are starting to think critically for themselves maccallum we aposre going to talk about more of the midterm politics with regard to this and the bigger pictures as well panel thank you we aposre going to take a quick break we aposll see you in a bit less than a month after the helsinki summit the work towards common ground is now in the middle of something called economic warfare so where are the u s and russia in terms of our relations really heading we aposre going to talk to two key u s senators on this coming up next commercial break maccallum coming up the trump administration imposes more economic sanctions on russia iran and turkey begin video clip heather nauert state department spokesperson sanctions is a way that we can try to encourage better behavior on the part of government end video clip maccallum we aposll discuss the effectiveness of this foreign policy tool with senators lindsey graham and jack reed next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip recep tayyip erdogan president of turkey through translator we denounce the order that threatens the whole world with the trade war in order to shake them down end video clip maccallum turkish president erdogan lashing out at the united states over sanctions and tariffs that sent that nation aposs currency tumbling this week and strained relations between the two nato allies senator lindsey graham and senator jack reed both members of the armed services committee joined us now and we begin with senator graham senator welcome back to fox news sunday good to have you with us here today sen lindsey graham r sc armed services committee thank you maccallum in a new york times editorial erdogan went on to say that the united states starts respect until the united states starts respecting turkey sovereignty and proves that it understands the dangers that our nation faces our partnership could be in jeopardy which leads to the question i mean is this still a working relationship at all with turkey graham well we have an airbase in turkey they aposre a nato ally it needs to be a working relationship we need turkey to help us in syria we need turkey to help us in iraq they are our nato ally but they have not just pastor brunson in jail five or six other americans who worked for the excuse me turkish citizens who work for the american embassy we aposre not going to have a normal relationship with turkey until they let the pastor brunson out the chargers against him are complete shams it aposs a bogus event regarding pastor brunson and others who work for the american embassy they had nothing to do with trying to topple the government maccallum you know i think in terms of the pastor brunson question and you know this back and forth between turkey and the united states over graham yes maccallum operation to overthrow the government in turkey which is what erdogan is so angry about graham yes maccallum it aposs interesting to see that relationship that these are pinned on a return of these individuals graham yes mccallum which is a way that we haven apost really seen presidents work in the past do you think this is going to be successful is brunson going to come back and is there a possibility to repair this relationship we also know that turkey wants to buy defense weaponry from russia that aposs also something we don apost want them to do graham yes this relationship needs to be repaired ph it aposs in turkey aposs interest to have a good relationship with the united states and its and in our interest to have a good relationship with turkey i aposd like to one day do a free trade agreement with turkey i aposd like to get them out of russia aposs orbit pull them away from iran and back in back into our sphere of influence where they should be but they aposll never be a normal relationship until pastor brunson is out of jail he pastored a church of 50 people in izmir turkey he had nothing to do with the uprising in 2016 the employees at the american embassy have are not golonas ph trying to overthrow the turkish government in 2016 the military turned on the turkish president i can understand his concerns but the s 400 being bought from turkey excuse me from russia the russia aposs premiere missile defense system you can apost have the f 35 and the s 400 both so we need to reset this relationship and the best way to do it is let pastor brunson come home and start over maccallum all right when the president left for helsinki he talked about all of the meetings that were ahead of him and at that point he said putin might be the easiest of all of them graham yes mccallum that he wanted to find some common ground with the leader of russia now we aposve got a situation where there are sanctions due to the poisoning that happened in the u k and medvedev is saying that he thinks that they aposre in economic warfare at this point so is it fair to say that the president has put the goal of finding common ground with russia to the back burner at this point graham yes i think russian behavior has dominated the relationship here i don apost mind trying to have a better relationship with russia they just need to act better to achieve that goal they did they aposre directly involved in killing the british citizen the poison that was used in britain to kill this former soviet spy soviet member who became a spy came from russia they are meddling in the 2018 election i aposm 100 percent certain that they are continuing to meddle in our election they intend to disrupt the 2018 election so i aposve introduced hard hitting sanctions i applaud the administration for hitting russia based on what they did in britain so you aposll never have a better relationship with putin as long as he behaves the way he does and i appreciate the president pushing back maccallum all right i want to ask you before i let you go a non foreign policy question with regards to bruce ohr who is a department of justice official graham yes mccallum who worked under sally yates and just a few offices down from the head of the justice department he aposs becoming a much more central figure in what looks to be the initiation of this russia investigation what do you know about that graham well he was the number four guy at the department of justice his wife worked for fusion gps the firm hired by the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign to get to find dirt on trump they hired christopher steele a former british agent who went to russia to gather a dossier that i think is a bunch of political garbage here aposs what i would tell the american people both campaigns were investigated by the fbi and the department of justice in 2016 when it came to the clinton campaign she got a pass the criminal investigation of the clinton campaign was a joke when it came to the trump campaign it was corrupt it was biased and i think unethical mr ohr should not have had any role in investigating the trump campaign because his wife worked at fusion gps the two the fbi agent in charge of the clinton campaign hated trump liked clinton and also started the counterintelligence investigation against trump when it came to dianne feinstein they went to her and said hey there aposs a chinese person working on your staff that we think may be tied to the chinese government when it came time to they never did the same for trump so these investigations against trump were corrupt at the core they gave clinton a pass bruce ohr was at least unethical we need a special counsel to look at all things department of justice and fbi when it came to the trump investigation particularly the counterintelligence investigation maccallum and we aposre going to talk more about that in a moment i aposve got one more minute with you so i aposm going to circle back to north korea for a moment because the white house has really never explained the discrepancy between the president aposs tweet which says that there is no longer a nuclear threat from north korea graham right mccallum and john bolton aposs assessment that the singapore agreement really has not yielded any progress at all you said at one point that the president could potentially receive a nobel prize for what he was doing in north korea so what do you say now graham well i think we need to be patient north korea is going to do the going to respond appropriately or they aposll go back to the same old way of doing business and i can tell you this president trump has no place to kick the can when it comes to north korea if he had to as a last resort he would use military force to stop their missile programs their nuclear program and to the iranians watch what aposs going on with iran do you want to be next i appreciate the president withdrawing from the nuclear agreement with iran and trying to break the ayatollah aposs back economically this is a religious theocracy this dismembering the mideast to north korea if you don apost think trump will turn on you if you try to play him watch what aposs going on in north korea maccallum senator lindsay graham always good to talk to sir thank you very much graham excuse me iran thank you maccallum so joining me now from rhode island senator jack reed the top democrat on the armed services committee senator thank you very much for being with us sen jack reed d rhode island thanks martha maccallum as we look around the world you know what we see is sort of a very broad spectrum of tariffs of sanctions that have been leveled against as we were just discussing against turkey against iran against russia also china you said that you felt that the tariffs against china were the right move when president trump put them in place now china is pushing back with punitive tariffs against the united states as well which some people are concerned could down the road put a dent in the positive gdp growth that we aposve seen here aposs the president talking about what aposs going on with china at bedminster this week begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we are in a little bit of a fight with china right now we want them to do well but we want them to treat us fairly they have not treated us fairly for many decades end video clip maccallum where do you think this is heading senator reed well i think the president aposs approach has been dis coordinated he has imposed sanctions on a range of countries i don apost think he has a strategic plan i think he aposs essentially just lashing out and when he doesn apost get his way he will invoke more sanctions he aposs got sanctions against some of our closest allies like the canadians that doesn apost make a lot of sense to me i think if he had a more focused approach to china if he indicated what he wanted changed specifically rather than just generically we aposre going to punish you until you stop doing everything you aposre doing i think again he has to be much more focused maccallum but you you did say that it was a good idea for him to put those sanctions in place and i think a lot of people who look at the trade imbalance have a similar reaction you know that he aposs not wrong about how the united states has been mistreated in these deals so doesn apost that require a bit of patience at the table reed well it requires patience but it also requires a consistent plan and it also requires cooperation with our trading partners rather than going in with a concerted effort unified effort he has created issues among all our major trading partners and as a result china is able to sort of in a way isolate us and diminish the effect of our sanctions the effect of our policies and the tariffs i think are less critical in terms of chinese tariffs and our tariffs i think the real issue at stake here is the way that the chinese do not allow our companies to participate fairly in china to own companies to protect their intellectual property a more focused approach by president trump on those efforts i think would be helpful maccallum but i mean that aposs clearly what the president is going for here he aposs talked about it quite a bit in terms of intellectual property so again you know doesn apost it require patience in the in the midst of the deal making to sort of wait out the tough part of this because that aposs a negotiation and do you think ultimately that it will draw them to the table reed well i think it requires patience obviously but i think it will also require sort of a more systematic and calculated and calibrated approach it aposs been sort of a wild ride with the president in terms of sanctions he aposs imposed and again it aposs not just with respect to china think he aposd be in a much stronger position if he had a unified trading block the western ph trading block working with him against china he doesn apost have that and then again the question is in terms of patience who has the patience i think the chinese are seem to be indicating that they are not going to quickly succumb to these tariffs or these protectionist measures that the united states is imposing it could a long long process and they might have the ability to wait us out again this is going to show effects in our economy eventually and those effects i think will take away from the growth we aposre seeing maccallum so let me switch to iran right now obviously the snapback sanctions are now in place the deal is not something that the united states is participating in anymore and as a result of that we saw some fairly aggressive moving up of the timetable for iran to carry out its military exercises that it does in the strait of hormuz over the course of this week your reaction to that and where you think that situation goes next reed well first you aposre right exactly they aposve moved up their annual exercises they aposve conducted a ballistic missile exercise in conjunction with those exercises the one thing they haven apost done which i think is appropriate and i think we cannot ever allow is they have not been interfering with the passenger ships through the strait of hormuz that has to be something that is absolutely nonnegotiable i think a problem we have is after withdrawing from the jcpoa we aposve lost the support of our european allies particularly in fact the europeans are going to lengths to try to cushion the blow to the iranians and then again you aposre into a situation where what aposs going to happen within tehran i think there is a strong feeling that the hardliners will take more and more power that they will begin to marginalize those people and i think using the term moderate in iran is not particularly accurate maccallum yes reed but those who much more sensitive to world opinion will be marginalized and the hardliners will take over and the iranians have the ability to through proxies particularly to interrupt interfere and in fact indeed cause us harm in iraq and syria and throughout the region so i again i think the biggest problem here is that we do not once again have a concerted ph world standing with us against the iranians and they will try to divide and conquer separate the europeans from us and continue to do that maccallum all right before i let you go i want to ask you about the space force which got a lot of attention even some ribbing this week but it aposs a serious proposal on the part of the president that he wants to start this sixth branch of the military mark kelly the former astronaut told me the other night that he thinks it aposs a bad idea that it aposs a waste of money and that it aposs redundant buzz aldrin also weighed in and said that he thought it was a huge giant leap for mankind he aposs very in favor of it how about you senator reed reed i think we have to reorganize our space forces because our threats are now in multiple dimensions but i think creating a separate service with all of the infrastructure and the bureaucracy is not the way to go we in the national defense authorization act authorized a sub unified command for space that i think would begin to pull together these different strands every service has some sort of connection to space if you aposre a and i was a paratrooper for several years if you aposre on the ground you need gps to give you directions and guidance that aposs a space asset if you aposre at sea you need space assets so this is not a one service dimension and i think creating a separate service would just add bureaucracy without effect what we have to do is unify our current efforts one of the good models for this is a joint special operations command which is multiple services seals rangers green berets air force special operators they operate very unified but there aposs no new service with all the paraphernalia and bureaucracy of a new service that aposs the direction we should head maccallum all right senator jack reed thank you sir good to see you today thanks for joining us reed thank you very much martha maccallum so coming up we will bring back the panel undiscussed why bruce ohr who worked for sally yates is now becoming a more central figure in how the russia investigation got its legs in the first place and rudy giuliani speaks out commercial break begin video clip rudy giuliani president trump aposs attorney the reality is he doesn apost need to ask a single question on obstruction he has all the answers they aposre not going to change the president aposs not going to change his testimony so stop the nonsense you are trying to trap him into perjury because you don apost have a case end video clip maccallum rudy giuliani on the back and forth over special counsel robert mueller aposs request for an interview with the president in his investigation into russia aposs meddling in the 2016 election and we are back now with the panel good to have all of you here marc let me start with you your thoughts on rudy giuliani aposs tactics here and is he trying to convince the president not to sit down with robert mueller do you think marc lotter former vp pence press secretary probably to a certain extent i mean the president has obviously said on multiple occasions that he aposd be open to the idea and his lawyers have pretty much unanimously said they aposre not and so this is i think a message in both directions one for the special counsel to prepare himself that it aposs probably not going to happen and secondly to the president reiterating that they don apost think it aposs a good idea maccallum lisa what aposs the impact if he sits down or if he does not lisa lerer associated press well i think part of this is more of a pr strategy than a legal strategy i feel sometimes like i aposm having breakfast with rudy giuliani he aposs on my television so much but it aposs that may be the right way to go in the end this could go to congress whatever report comes out if democrats take the house this could be impeachment so this will be a political fight and i think the president aposs team is setting it up that way we know the president aposs lawyers don apost want him to testify but they also don apost or to do the interview but they also don apost want it to look like he doesn apost want to do the interview because that might look like he aposs hiding something so this whole back and forth is a way to stretch out the argument make it look that whether the president is or is not willing to do it he make it look like he is and draw out this whole back and forth for as long as possible maccallum yes i mean i wish we had a crystal ball so we could see how this story ends jay sekulow his other attorney also came out this week he said you know basically we didn apost accept the offer from a special counsel that they presented in terms of the parameters for those questions you know which leads to the question once again when you hear all of this as lisa says lots from rudy giuliani and from jay sekulow and and you do have to wonder if their message as we have seen them do sort of in a circular way before is at the president charles hurt the washington times yes no kidding but also you know i what more is donald trump going to say about i mean he aposs answered all of the questions that he maccallum so you agree with rudy giuliani aposs point there hurt yes i do because i think the biggest problem for the president right now is that he walks in says something unintentionally or unintentionally that aposs not true on some completely unrelated matter and it winds up being a perjury trap but but you know the president has it aposs not like he aposs been quiet about this stuff he has opined about every aspect of the of the investigation the details the people involved in the investigation if mueller would just be satisfied with an interrogation via twitter then he aposd have all of his answers maccallum i think we may have already had that juan juan williams fox news political analyst well i mean the fact is he the president keeps changing his stories on the trump tower meeting for example so we don apost know exactly we can apost say that we know exactly what he thinks but we do know this that this week he tweeted that jeff sessions the attorney general should get active an end this so called witch hunt in the president aposs terms so i think what this is about is picking up on lisa aposs language it aposs a campaign a public relations campaign by giuliani and sekulow to say to people you can apost trust the fbi you can apost trust the robert mueller special prosecutor investigation and as a result listen to me this is what the president had said explicitly don apost listen to the press that aposs fake news listen to what i say that aposs what aposs going on and i think he aposs speaking to his base in that regard and a lot of this then really in my mind blows down to a diversionary tactic if we aposre thinking in terms of war strategy maccallum all right let aposs take a look at the bruce ohr part of the story because he aposs been sort of a back player in all of this but according to some new investigative reporting it appears that he may have been a lot more central to the investigation in the beginning the origins of a russia investigation then we may have realized let aposs take a look at this quote from the hill it says a close review of these new documents shows just how closely associate deputy attorney general bruce ohr who reported to obama era deputy attorney general sally yates maintained contact with fusion and in particular it aposs a primary source former british spy christopher steele before during and after the election so i want to pull up some of these communications between christopher steele and bruce ohr at least this is who they are perceived to be between this is july 1st so this is just before operation crossfire gets underway just as steele wanted to give ohr urgent info on our i aposm sorry so you aposre looking at january 31st but just let me tell you one thing first before that happened they communicated on our favorite business tycoon ok so we don apost knows necessarily who that is but you can surmise perhaps who that might be based on this so that was on july the 1st that he had urgent information that he wanted to give to bruce ohr on our favorite business tycoon then flash forward to july 31st so at this point bruce ohr is talking to christopher steele according to these reports and he is talking about checking to see if he is ok let aposs put the january 31st one back up on the screen now now the reason he wants to know if bruce ohr is ok is because sally yates has just been fired that day so he aposs trying to figure out if his connection and this is after the fbi has fire christopher steele christopher steele now no longer works for the federal government so they say steele says to ohr just want to check with you that you aposre ok still in situ and able to locally help locally as discussed along with your bureau colleagues he says ohr says according to these reports i aposm still here and able to help as discussed i will let you know if that changes then move forward to this cryptic message if you end up out though meaning bruce ohr if he were to lose his job as sally yates did i really need another bureau contact point number who is briefed we can apost allow our guy to be forced to go back home that would be disastrous now they aposre trying to investigate who our guy and where back home might be in all of this but charlie let me start with you your thoughts here hurt so christopher steele he aposs like cujo you can apost like you can apost kill him he keeps coming back and what these things these messages reveal is that he was coming back even after president trump had been sworn in and then and he aposs worried about bruce ohr being removed and where will he you know who will be his contact person at that point it just you know it undermines the credibility of the fbi and the doj obviously but it feeds all of the questions that we aposve had all along about the about how both the launch of the investigation originally into trump collusion alleged collusion with russia but also whether or not there was sort of a vendetta or something i mean all at all levels of the of the department a vendetta some effort to try to thwart the president and it aposs it should alarm everybody whether you aposre a democrat or a republican it should be very alarming maccallum yes i mean that is the question whether or not there was some sort of concerted effort between the doj and the fbi and christopher steele who was hired by the hillary clinton campaign to keep this fire burning to figure out what they could dig up perhaps on president trump who became president trump williams let me offer you a different point of view maccallum nellie ohr i just want to point out bruce ohr aposs wife williams right maccallum works for fusion gps which we didn apost mention before williams correct but let me just offer a different point of view maccallum tell us williams which is that you have christopher steele as a dogged former spy well respected spy across the globe who has had thought he had information remember the fbi did not disclose that they had an ongoing investigation of donald trump before the election here comes steele and he says oh my they aposre getting they aposre getting rid of obama era justice department officials who can i talk to in the government if i discover added solid information so i think there aposs not much here to this story except to say that it feeds donald trump aposs effort to discredit the fbi to discredit the justice department and justice department officials and to suggest that somehow there aposs a grand effort against him but there aposs no there there this is a nothing burger maccallum all right we will see i aposve got a minute left and i want to ask you guys quickly about the midterm outcomes this week some close races what do you think marc are the indications for republicans and democrats and what we saw this week lotter i never put a lot of stock into special elections in the middle of summer right before people are going back to school they aposre usually low turnout and it aposs great that we are it looks like we aposre winning that race and we aposll continue to do so i think the bigger message though is to republican officeholders and candidates get out there do your job raise money knock on doors do not count on the fact that the president vice president and rnc can come in at the last minute and help you because we may have to be in a lot of different places you don apost want to be on the outside looking in maccallum inaudible if you can a lot of energy against nancy pelosi your reaction to that lerer i mean i think republicans see that as a way to get republican voters who may not be crazy about the president you know independents they can get them against pelosi maccallum all right we aposll be back with a final word thanks to the panel maccallum a live look at
