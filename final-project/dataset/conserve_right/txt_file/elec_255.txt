what the heck did happen power play can franken get the last laugh no se puede your winner by default cantor s defeat mythbuster editiona lavish mythology has already arisen around the shocking defeat of house majority leader eric cantor who despite a 28 to 1 cash advantage a late game media blitz and 13 years of incumbency lost to an economics professor at a small college in the district to know what happened we first ought to know what didn t happen myth cantor was upended in a low turnout election by a small number of tea party radicals reality the results in cantor s defeat the first ever primary loss by a sitting house majority leader saw a marked rise in turnout from 2012 a 28 percent turnout increase from the presidential election year you may feel free to lament the poor levels of american civic involvement generally but this is not a case of low turnout electoral distortion myth a wave of immigration outrage among downscale voters in lower income rural and far suburban precincts overwhelmed cantor s complacent electoral base in upper income precincts in and near richmond reality immigration seems to be the chief animating issue here but this was not blue collar versus white collar voters turnout was up fairly uniformly across the district including the affluent sections of cantor s home county of henrico which the majority leader lost too from precincts with median incomes near the poverty line in places like rural louisa county to those nibbling strictly upper crust in the west end of richmond the electorate was energized and not digging the incumbent myth democrats crossed over in virginia s non partisan primary to do mischief and sabotage the stronger republican candidate to improve their chances in the fall reality there is no evidence of any chaos operations here while turnout was up in every part of the district the increase lagged in the most democratic neighborhoods with the city of richmond up 22 percent compared to republican strongholds like goochland county which jumped 28 percent plus democrats have slim hopes of winning the district which leans heavily republican this fall cantor is all but certain to abide by voters wishes and the state party has already blessed brat s candidacy the incentive for mischief was low and with a 10 point margin of victory any disingenuous democrats would be strictly background noise myth the race was another battle in the national civil war between the tea party and the republican establishment reality new nominee dave brat got a big boost from talk radio heavy hitters like mark levin but this was a very local election while tea party groups are stampeding to richmond to lay claim to brat s success they re late in coming brat had zero backing from any of the national groups that are forever raising money for their fight against the gop old guard brat is certainly more conservative than cantor but he hardly fits the preferred national narrative it wasn t a contest between the tea party and the republicans and all this although i had tremendous tea party support and just wonderful people in the tea party grass roots helping me out and they re clearly responsible for the win but i ran on the republican principles dave brat on hannity watch full interview here so what the heck did happen eric cantor has an impressive national organization deep pockets and has successfully helped shift the national gop s thinking on a host of issues other than immigration but if the folks at home are fed up with business as usual look out this race has already been over interpreted and that will only get worse but just remember what dave brat s key pitch was he ran as cantor s term limit americans of all stripes are deeply fed up with the status quo in washington and while cantor s flip floppery on immigration certainly provided rocket fuel for the effort to oust him his role as the face of the gop establishment in general was a huge hindrance veering sneering cantor made several mistakes ignoring the challenge then turning bitterly negative in the closing weeks it was a sour message compared to those of sweetly successful incumbents like sen lindsey graham of south carolina who emphasized the commonalities he shared with his rivals and asked for mercy on disagreements graham won easily last night as an avowed moderate in a very conservative state cantor wasn t a straight shooter he attended a retreat for an anti tea party group led by former rep steve latourette this spring and was clearly part of an effort to beat back the conservative insurgency but as his own race appeared to grow more competitive cantor suddenly shifted he deep sixed immigration and vowed no action this year but then after his pollsters erroneously declared him safe cantor flipped back the other way with approving words for legalizations for limited groups of illegal immigrants veering and insincere sounding cantor wrongly believed that his clout incumbency and money would be enough how about a refund a poll from mclaughlin associates poll claimed cantor had a 28 point lead over brat at the end of may nobody loves you when you re down and out another oft overlooked piece in all this the political consequences of a federal debt of more than 17 trillion when congressional leaders could pour pork on their districts grouchy constituents could be mollified with new roads and other treats but there are no ribbon cutting ceremonies for sequestrations without earmarks cantor couldn t make the folks at home listen leadership without extra spending perks is no prize meet dave brateconomics professor dave brat will head to class with a new title republican house nominee the 49 year old teaches at randolph macon college a small liberal arts school north of richmond throughout the campaign brat attacked rep eric cantor as part of the problem in washington who has lost touch with virginians wants from ending obamacare to reducing debt a native of detroit brat received his doctorate of economics at american university he and his wife laura live with their two children in henrico county award winning staff cantor s staff is a large orchestration with 23 paid employees david brat seems to have taken it down a notch with only a couple of paid staffers washington examiner s betsy woodruff interviews brat s 23 year old campaign manager zachary werrell who interviewed for a job at panera bread company and has been crashing on the couch of his mentor going to be awkward at faculty meetings virginia s 7th district house race had a randolph macon sweep brat will face fellow randolph macon college assistant professor jack trammell 50 to succeed cantor in the november election in a heavily republican district trammell didn t stand a chance against cantor since brat outshined cantor trammell sees a glimmer of hope heading into the fall before tuesday s primary trammell had a haphazardly designed website now it seems that democrats have thrown support behind the candidate launching a new website and social media outreach if the november election was based on the quality of the professor trammell would have brat beat students voted trammell overall quality a 4 3 out of 5 versus brat s 3 4 rating but students rate brat to be very easy on the eyes gop leadership up in the airmajority leader eric cantor has a decision to make whether he ll relinquish his role as house majority leader republican leaders are meeting to wrestle with that issue this morning sources tell fox news first that cantor is expected to at least offer to step aside but whether or not that s what the conference wants is unclear but as the daily beast reports one thing is clear the shuffle to replace cantor has already begun while kevin mccarthy r ca the house majority whip and next in line behind cantor is sure to run for the upcoming vacancy his election is not a foregone conclusion at this point look toformer republican study committee chairman jim jordan r oh conservative darling jeb hensarling r tx and pete sessions r tx as potential candidates to mount strong challenges giving them the business wapo the country apos s most powerful business lobbying groups already knew they had a problem with the gop when tea party lawmakers nearly forced the country into a massive default of its debt last year but with eric cantor apos s shocking defeat tuesday night things for the u s chamber of commerce and the business roundtable just got a whole lot worse for one they lost a major defender of their favored policies from the beneficial tax treatment of private equity income to immigration reforms favored by the country apos s biggest tech companies it apos s true that cantor enjoyed a strong relationship with business especially with wall street the industry that gave him the most campaign contributions was the securities and investment sector individuals from the private equity firm blackstone were his biggest financial supporters cantor went to bat for the industry repeatedly over politically unpopular issues including the taxation of income at private equity firms at the lower capital gains rate no se puedewsj the defeat tuesday of house majority leader eric cantor to an underfunded challenger who ran as an immigration opponent is likely to further weaken already shaky prospects the house will consider immigration legislation this summer for months republicans have worried an immigration debate could make incumbents vulnerable to primary challenges from the right and have put off any house action at least until after primary season tuesday s primaries were the last hurdle before what was expected to be a final push by immigration advocates for action mr cantor s defeat is likely to be seen as confirmation immigration politics are too dicey for this election year and may spook rank and file members who advocates have been pressing for support but obama can this is the end of the discussion about what apos s going to happen on any kind of immigration anything in this congress it apos s a dead letter it apos s not coming back because eric cantor apos s defeat has sealed that the president has been threatening this all along which if the republicans didn apos t give what he wanted he would carry through on executive action chris stirewalt on the kelly file other challengers hope to get

vulnerable incumbent republican senators in this year apos s cycle needed at least 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff against one of his six opponents all of whom had criticized him for not

to secure senate state in minnesota and michigan sen al franken d minn heads into november with no clear gop challenger yet but will he be able to hold on the his seat in the land of10 000 lakes watch chris s prediction here your winner by defaultthere were eight democrats on the ballot vying to face gov brian sandoval r nev in november and state economic development commissioner robert goodman should be fine with 25 percent right yes but goodman and the rest of the field were bested when the tally showed that nevadans had turned up their noses and awarded the victory to none of these candidates with a 30 percent of the vote nevada allows its voters to select the none of these candidates in elections for president and statewide offices of course none can t actually run although some in the state think the law ought to be changed on that front so goodman gets the nod but really when 20 000 voters in your state are motivated to pull the lever for none beating you by 3 600 votes it has to take some of the sweetness out of your victory lap bolstered by tuesday s results the democrat will take on sandoval nevada apos s first hispanic governor who rolled to victory over four challengers with 90 percent of the vote and is expected to easily defeat goodman to win a second term and now a word from charles the problem with hillary clinton that you see in this is her sort of intrinsic insincerity she s continually crafting what she says crafting what her position is going to be crafting her conduct to meet a certain perception and when you do that day in and day out either on a book tour or on a campaign trail or anywhere in public office you trip up because you can t remember the last confection the last creation of yourself that you put together charles
