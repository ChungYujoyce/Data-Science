apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap top republicans eager for a united gop front will be eyeing retiring lawmakers for signs of cracking as democrats impeachment inquiry of president donald trump heats up so far there s no indication that the retirees are about to crack party leaders got a positive signal this week from departing sen lamar alexander r tenn who s respected by both parties as an old school defender of senate prerogatives and is considered a gauge of moderate gop sentiment alexander 79 said that while it was inappropriate for trump to have
