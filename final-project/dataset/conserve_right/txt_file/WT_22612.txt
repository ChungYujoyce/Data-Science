apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion steve moore one of the oracles of free market economics is president donald trump s choice for the federal reserve board and the long knives are out for him yet i am told by conservatives everywhere not to worry he is a shoo in it all reminds me of july 1 1987 when president ronald reagan nominated judge robert bork for an opening on the u s supreme court he had it made in the shade said my complacent conservative friends the result was brutal but we do not have to look back 32 years to see how unruly the left wing mob can be recall the recent fate of judge brett kavanaugh only his courage and unscotchable determinate saved him the simple fact is that the conservatives are often slow on the draw against the american left only the wall street journal and the intrepid new york sun have come out swinging for mr moore it is time for the conservatives to rally around him he can probably win with the president on his side he apparently has the votes yet the coming battle would be a lot less bloody if the conservative movement were to take the field on mr moore s behalf and make it clear that from now on they are going to wage war for the president s nominees top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning defending mr moore on economic grounds ought not to be that difficult the trump administration is presiding over an economic boom that mr moore has been calling for for years with the president s tax cuts and deregulation two of mr moore s favorite panaceas for an anemic economy we have historically low unemployment certainly for blacks and for latinos growth is now robust it has actually outpaced predictions most economists predicted 2 5 percent growth for the first quarter friday we learned that the economy grew at 3 2 percent that is the first time since 2015 that the first quarter gdp topped 3 percent most economists were wrong mr moore and those like him were right on track as jeremy j siegel said in monday s wall street journal somehow though unemployment is at a 50 year low inflation is still below the fed s 2 target he is the rare economist for mr moore ahh but his critics say mr moore is no economist he lacks a ph d he is a writer at times a clever writer at other times a strenuously serious writer on economics and politics well i have a long memory he writes with authority on economics and politics much as henry hazlitt wrote on economics and politics for some 60 years from the early 1920s until the late 1980s hazlitt had no ph d either in fact he had no college degree at all hazlitt would have been an excellent choice throughout his long life to stir up the fed now we have a president in place to stir up the fed so let us get on with it yet the new york times the washington post and cnn are opposed to mr moore of course they are also opposed to mr trump when mr trump came into office they predicted a worldwide recession of great severity allow me to quote one of mainstream media s economic gurus a certified economist a winner of the nobel prize for economics paul krugman ph d on nov 9 2016 he greeted mr trump s election with this dirge under any circumstances putting an irresponsible ignorant man who takes his advice from all the wrong people moore in charge of the nation with the world s most important economy would be very bad news and he persisted what makes it especially bad right now however is the fundamentally fragile state much of the world is still in finally he concluded so we are very probably looking at a global recession with no end in sight clearly having made hysterical pronunciations such as the above guru krugman could not see friday s growth rate of 3 2 percent so now the long knives cannot share professor doktor krugman s contempt for the trump economy how are they going to defame steve moore they are going to get personal they are going to brett kavanaugh him as i have said he is a clever writer and has been writing for more than 35 years because he is a lively fellow he has naturally indulged in a little jocosity from time to time some 15 years ago women athletes were a target for his wit and also women bartenders now because of the crime of joking about woman leaping in the air and standing behind a bar he is to be denied a role at the fed the assassins boast well i say to fellow conservatives leap to mr moore s defense and remember the example of congressgirl alexandria ocasio cortez she too was a bartender before the mainstream media made her the lioness of the house of representatives sen joni ernst and sen lindsey graham do the decent thing and stand by our man r emmett tyrrell jr is founder and editor in chief of the american spectator he is the author most recently of the death of liberalism published by thomas n
