of weeks we look forward to being one of the first centers in the country that will be doing antibody testing thomas said during a telephone news conference thursday which basically will allow us to test without someone necessarily having symptoms we ll be able to tell whether they have or have had covid 19 that s going to be a huge benefit hart said it s going to tell us if someone has had the disease in the past and already has immunity to the disease hart said it s of major importance given that some never suffer symptoms after being infected we re having everyone take precautions right now and there is a subset of people who already had the disease that do not have to be worried about contracting the disease again said hart although he added the length of time such immunity would last is uncertain such testing will help ease the minds of any ochsner employees found to have already had the disease as they continue to work with patients hart said we ve been told it may be the middle of the month a couple of weeks before we have that available hart added later that s going to help us certainly as we think about our population and the social distancing to begin to do other

generation and the raison d tre of the reason for the united nations itself other threats to global peace cited by guterres were the erosion of trust in public institutions economic instability

america there s precedent with other infections like influenza that when the virus gets warmer that the virus goes down in its ability to replicate to spread but fauci added having said that one should not assume that we are going to be rescued by a change in the weather you must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing if we get some help from the weather so be it fine but i don t think we need to assume that he was asked about the new york times story that research indicates the coronavirus that began circulating in new york in mid february came mainly from europe not asia i think that s probably correct fauci said he notes that europe became the epicenter pretty quickly after china really exploded with their cases follow ap news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at
