townhome with senator kirsten gillibrand on fox news channel we came to the masterpiece on the mississippi as it aposs called here to get a sense of where the democratic race stands here in iowa site of the first in the nation caucuses in just nine months but president trump continues to dominate the news this week with his surprise plan to use tariffs to pressure mexico to stop the flood of migrants to the u s border in a moment we aposll speak with white house chief of staff mick mulvaney but first kevin corke aposs live in london ahead of the president aposs state visit to the u k tomorrow kevin kevin corke correspondent chris the president aposs latest visit here to the u k comes at a time of political change here as you know theresa may the british prime minister will very soon be stepping down from her post but it also comes amid growing political headwinds back home as there are now some republicans that are panning the president aposs latest tariff threat begin videotape corke president trump aposs visit to the united kingdom couldn apost offer a more stark contrast as he prepares to meet both britain aposs longest serving monarch and its soon to be departing prime minister but before arriving mr trump made headlines here in the u k by throwing his support behind mp boris johnson a favorite to replace the outgoing may saying he aposd make an excellent prime minister the president also suggested that the u k make a hard break with e u and no deal brexit with no 50 billion fee adding the u s could quickly make a deal with the u k to help soften the blow back in the states tariff talk dominated the week with the president threatening to hit mexico with escalating tariffs if the country didn apost end its quote passive cooperation with the mass migration from central america through mexico to the u s southern border the tariffs would go into effect june 10th climbing monthly in 5 percent increments all the way up to 25 percent by october 1st sanders we are asking mexico to enforce their own laws to help stop the people coming in from central america corke but the president aposs approach linking mass migration with drug trafficking and now trade policy is drawing sharp criticism from members of his own party iowa senate republican chuck grassley called it a misuse of presidential tariff authority fellow iowa senator joni ernst said the livelihoods of iowa farmers and producers are at stake end videotape corke all with usmca hanging in the balance on wednesday chris we expect the foreign minister of mexico to be in washington for a meeting with his counterpart secretary of state mike pompeo as the two sides try to tamp down that tariff threat chris wallace kevin corke reporting from london kevin thank you and joining me now from washington white house chief of staff mick mulvaney mick how seriously should we take the president aposs threat to raise these tariffs is this basically a negotiating ploy to get mexico aposs attention or does he really mean it that if mexico doesn apost stop the flow of migrants across our southern border that he will start imposing these tariffs on june 10th mick mulvaney white house chief of staff chris good morning and thank you for starting with such an easy question he aposs absolutely deadly serious in fact i fully expect these tariffs to go onto at least the five percent level on june 10th the president is deadly serious about fixing the situation at the southern border this is not the first time i aposm on your program talking about what aposs happening on the mexican u s border we aposve been talking about it for months six months ago we told everybody it was an emergency situation very few people believed us in fact i aposve talked with you about how the democrats even refused to believe the facts six months ago so it aposs real we had a group of 1 000 people not in different times one group of 1 000 people walk across the border just in the last couple of days 2 500 people are coming over every single day as opposed to 700 just two years ago so the numbers are huge the situation is real and the president is deadly serious about fixing the problem wallace all right the president says in his words that this problem must be quote remedied and the question is what does that mean what specifically do the mexicans have to do and how will he judge whether or not they aposve met his goal mulvaney a couple it aposs a couple different things they can do and in fact bob lighthizer is meeting with mexicans this week mike pompeo is meeting with the mexican representatives this week along with mr kushner i believe and we are talking to them about specific things they can do and they know these things they can secure their southern border their southern border with guatemala and most of the people who are coming in through mexico now are not mexico not mexicans they are from guatemala and el salvador other countries south of mexico that border is only a quarter as long as the border with the united states they could secure that border they could go after their domestic terrorist organizations their criminal organizations who are in the business moving people across mexico keep in mind at any one time there aposs 100 000 migrants in mexico making their way up to the united states and lastly they could make mexico a safe place for these people to claim asylum ordinarily when you leave a country like el salvador and you claim asylum you do that in the first safe country in which you arrive mexico is safe the people should be able to stay there if they aposre really seeking asylum so the specific things that the mexicans can do regarding the measure we intentionally left the declaration sort of ad hoc so that we could work with the mexicans to make sure that things did get better so there aposs no specific target there aposs no specific percentage but things have to get better they have to get dramatically better and they have to get better quickly wallace all right let aposs talk about the possible downsides that a lot of people are raising the u s imported last year 350 billion in mexican goods everything from cars to avocados now if the president ends up imposing it aposs going to start as a five percent tariff by october if things haven apost been remedied that aposs a 25 percent tariff that would amount to a 87 billion tax increase on american companies and consumers mulvaney two different answers to that first of all that aposs sort of yes i get that that aposs the economic orthodoxy that when tariffs go up consumer prices go up but the proof is in the pudding there is no inflation prices have not gone up we aposve put put tariffs on china we aposre putting tariffs on mexico and inflation is still under control that aposs because that old fashioned economic orthodoxy doesn apost work when it aposs relatively easy to substitute other goods prices from china have gone up american consumers have gone to products that are made in the united states for example that don apost carry those tariffs we think the same thing will happen here and american consumers will not pay for the burden of these of these tariffs secondly the second part to my answer is this is this which is which is there aposs already a price associated with illegal immigration american taxpayers are paying hundreds of billions of dollars for illegal immigrants they aposre paying hundreds of billions of dollars for the drugs that come across the southern border so there aposs already a cost associated with this that we are trying to get off of the backs of ordinary americans wallace all right let me go to the next concern that people have which is that this is going to blow up other trade deals congressional leaders of both parties including republicans say that this could end up killing congressional passage of the usmca the the re write of nafta and they point a country like china for instance why make a deal with the u s if the president will then turn around and raise tariffs anyway because of some other issue mulvaney let aposs deal with the mexican situation before we talk about china but the answer to that is this is that we aposve been very specific from the minute that this proclamation went out that this was an immigration matter it is not a trade matter so the usmca is a trade discussion that aposs ongoing that aposs why bob lighthizer is meeting with his mexican counterparts this week this is an immigration matter and the two are separate we can solve one we hope we solve both but the two are not interreactive ph we do excuse me interrelated we believe that the usmca is a great deal to the united states of america we think it aposs also a good deal for our mexican and canadian partners and we hope that congress would pass it in fact we believe very firmly that if nancy pelosi would simply give it a vote it would pass because it aposs a good deal so we aposve put that in one category the immigration the situation on the southern border is a different issue it aposs a national security issue and we aposll deal with it separately than the usmca wallace but you talk about immigration a lot of people said because the president even today has been tweeting saying look what aposll happen here if this goes on is that companies in mexico will decide they don apost want to pay the tariffs they aposll move back to the u s creating more jobs here the flipside of that is then a lot of mexicans lose their job and the concern is that a lot of them come over the border to the u s and that the whole end result of this is it creates more illegal immigration not less mulvaney no but it aposs what you aposve just described is a great reason for the mexican government to engage to help fix the problem in fact you aposve seen in the last 24 hours mexican president obrador has already reached out and said that he thinks they can do better he thinks they will do better and they aposre sending up a delegation for the first part of this week so what you aposve just laid out is factually probably not inaccurate but that is the exact reason we did this to put pressure on mexico to help us solve this situation we think they can do that they aposve got tremendously strong immigration laws much stronger than ours they have the ability to do things that we cannot congress will not help us fix our laws so we aposre turning to mexico to help us fix the situation on the border and we think what you aposve just described is the exact reasons that they will help us wallace all right let aposs turn to a few other issues in the time we have left let aposs start with special counsel robert mueller here was the president aposs reaction today to his comments mueller aposs comments begin video clip trump i think he aposs totally conflicted because as you know he wanted to be the fbi director and i said no as you know i had a business dispute with him after he left the fbi we had a business dispute not a nice one he wasn apost he wasn apost happy with what i did end video clip wallace but mick the mueller report says that that aposs not true it quotes steve bannon as saying that that mueller yes he met with the president but he didn apost want to return to being the fbi director and it also quotes bannon as saying on this question of a conflict which was about an initiation fee at a golf club a trump golf club bannon said any idea that that was a real conflict was ridiculous mulvaney yes i aposm not familiar with that i wasn apost really that heavily involved in the transition in fact i was coming in as the director of the office of management and budget when those discussions were coming on and i aposm not sure that steve bannon is the most reliable source for information about what was happening in the white house during that time but wallace he was testifying under oath mulvaney that aposs fine my statement stands i aposm not sure steve bannon is the best source for information we aposll look at it this way the mueller report is finished it aposs over he closed down the shop this week you aposve heard you aposve heard what we aposve had to say about this many times it was clear no collusion no obstruction the case is closed it aposs over democrats want to keep going and that aposs fine but issues like this we think are behind us now wallace all right i want to squeeze two more things in president trump talks about his close relationship with north korean leader kim jong un here aposs just one example begin video clip trump we go back and forth and then we fell in love ok laughter no really he wrote me beautiful letters and they aposre great letters we fell in love end video clip wallace but there are now reports that after the failed trump kim summit in hanoi that you attended that kim had some of the key members of his negotiating team for that failed summit some of them were executed and others were sent to prison camps first of all from the intelligence you have is that true and secondly given all of that does the president still feel he aposs in love with chairman kim mulvaney first thing aposs first i don apost believe we aposve confirmed that yet and i aposm not going to speak about classified information that we may or may not have on that issue here so let aposs just assume for sake of this discussion that those reports are true there aposs still having a relationship with a person and you heard the president aposs language and for those of us who know the president and we do that aposs that aposs his manner that aposs how he speaks and to have a good working relationship with somebody with anybody how is that ever a bad thing how is having the ability to pick up the phone or write a letter as the president referenced and talk to another world leader regardless of what they might be doing domestically or internationally how is that a bad thing we think that it helps the dialogue going forward but writ large wallace even if he aposs even is he aposs a brutal dictator even if he kills members of his regime let alone the people in his country mulvaney chris what aposs the central issue right now of north korea why are we engaged north korea because we aposre concerned about them having nuclear weapons we do not want that to happen we do not want people who might even be accused of doing what kim jong un is accused of doing to have nuclear weapons that aposs why the president is doing this keep in mind it aposs going slower than we expected but foreign policy is not about short term political gains it aposs about global and national us security that aposs how we aposre addressing this having a good working relationship with somebody is never a bad thing wallace finally during the president aposs trip to or actually before he went to japan the white house military office sent this e mail to the navy and i want to read it uss john mccain needs to be out of sight once the story became public here was the president aposs reaction begin video clip trump no somebody did it because they thought i didn apost like him ok and they were well meaning i will say i didn apost know anything about it i would never have done that end video clip wallace two questions and i got about 30 seconds for you what does the president mean it was well meaning and second have you as white house chief of staff determined how it was that somebody in the military office in the white house decided it would be a good idea to hide the ship of that is in honor of an american war hero mulvaney all right in the 15 seconds you left me out of your 30 the president didn apost know about it i didn apost know about it look literally hundreds of people are involved in moving the president overseas the president aposs feelings about the former senator are well known the fact that a low level person might have asked a question shouldn apost surprise anybody we think it aposs much ado about nothing wallace will somebody in the white house be disciplined mulvaney for what for asking an innocuous question about that no if someone gets disciplined it aposs fox news for saying that so and so doesn apost want to sit next to so and so at a meeting no again this is a minor issue that we think media aposs trying to make into a larger matter wallace well let me just say to pursue it that the pentagon chief shanahan had his chief of staff call the white house to say that the pentagon must not be politicized so apparently patrick shanahan doesn apost think it aposs a minor idea mulvaney but again nothing happened because of it someone asked a question during the preparation for a trip again if you understood how many people were involved with this you understand the number of folks who could have asked this question and if a 23 or 24 year old person says look is it really a good idea for this ship to be in the background that is not an unreasonable question to have and it aposs certainly not something that takes up two minutes of national television on sunday wallace well all right thank you mick thank you for time always good to talk with you sir please come back mulvaney thanks chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the policy and politics of the president aposs tariff threat as fox news sunday reports from the university of dubuque in iowa commercial break begin video clip sanders anybody in this country or frankly in the world that says they are surprised by this has been living under a rock and not paying attention the president has been crystal clear end video clip wallace white house press secretary sarah sanders defending the president aposs threat to impose tariffs on all mexican goods unless that country stops the flow of migrants to our southern border and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove former democratic congresswoman donna edwards former republican congressman jason chaffetz and columnist for the hill juan williams congressman chaffetz let me start with you what do you think of this threat from the president of across the board tariffs on all goods imported from mexico as you well know a number of republican senators think it aposs a bad and perhaps illegal idea jason chaffetz contributor no the two senators from iowa don apost think it aposs a good idea but i do like the idea that the president is using every tool in his arsenal to fight back the hundreds of thousands of people that are flowing north on this across our borders the president promised to do this i think it aposs going to get the attention of the mexican government and as long as they do something then these tariffs don apost need to come into play and i hope that aposs what we ultimately get to wallace i apos m going to get to that point in a moment but congresswoman edwards let me talk about the situation on the border that has the president so concerned because there clearly is a crisis on the border more than 100 000 people apprehended crossing the border in april according to officials the number is going to be even higher in may and just this week take a look at this video on wednesday more than a thousand migrants apprehended crossing the border near el paso more than a thousand it aposs the largest single group ever encountered in the history of the border patrol congresswoman can you understand what the president is fed up and wants mexico to crack down donna edwards former congresswoman d md what i do understand is that the president and this administration aposs policy around asylum and the inability to press asylum seekers a way that allows for their orderly movement across the border at entry points has exacerbated the problem so in some ways i think the president has brought this on himself and i think it aposs appropriate for democrats and republicans to work together on an informed border policy and separate that from a trade policy i mean ultimately the american people if there are tariffs imposed are going to pay the price as consumers and conflating trade and immigration i think is entirely the wrong direction to go wallace karl let me pick up on this with you and go back to what the congressman was talking about the idea clearly as you make a tough threat mexico toughens up in the tariffs never go into effect but that doesn apost always work and in the fact in the case of china where the president made demands of them and they pushed back they are a sovereign country now we are in a trade war with china so if you least have to consider the possibility this doesn apost end with mexico knuckling under it ends with the tariffs back and forth across the border karl rove former bush white house adviser and i think that aposs right and because of it i think there aposs actually going to be some movement we are seeing that look if there aposs going to be economic and political impacts if these tariffs go into effect we are going to have a problem with the border economies you look at my home state of texas and arizona and new mexico southern california our economies are tied to mexico mexico gets sick we get sick too so there aposs going to be a problem there our auto industry nearly 30 percent of what goes into an american automobile comes from a mexican plant and if you start raising prices there auto sales are already shaky in part because of the aluminum and steel tariffs if they get shakier than the auto states like places of michigan and ohio and indiana get really sick then you have the egg states and as jason pointed out two senators from iowa they aposve already been hammered by china having said that i think that aposs why things are going to get done if you take a look at what president lopez obrador said for example in the last 24 hours they want to try and get something done they are sending a high level delegation her next week the foreign minister is meeting with pompeo i think the mexicans are going to say we want to get this done because they don apost want a bad economic impact and they also understand that their own rule of law all of these people are coming up through their country there is a price both in respect for the rule of law and economically for them to have that many people coming up from guatemala honduras and nicaragua wallace juan do you share his optimism that mexico faced with all of this is going to end up making the deal and cracking down on the people and it isn apost mexicans coming across the border its people from central america by a huge majority coming from the southern border usually taking about three weeks and then getting to the u s border juan williams political analyst by the way that aposs a very important point just to pick up on something that congresswoman edwards said you have different asylum rules for people who will be coming from mexico anyway and so they can apost make the appeal so it aposs a different set of incentives i think the key thing here and to pick up on what karl was saying it aposs going to have an impact on the american economy if you think of this in terms of campaign promises the president promised a crackdown on immigration but he also promised that he would seek some equity in terms of trade deals improve our trade deals well what aposs happened with nafta we aposve gotten a new deal hmm what aposs happening with china wallace no no they have negotiated williams yes but they don apost have it passed by congress and with china obviously you see a stalemate did he promise higher prices home depot walmart everybody said their prices are going up did he promise to slow down manufacturing for a lot of the so called forgotten men and women that he was talking to on the campaign trail we see a slow down in terms of sales of papers textiles chemicals did he promise for the farmers that he would have to give them essentially welfare payments at the same time that we see a decline in exports of farm goods and it aposs crushing their markets now a lot of these countries that were buying soybeans from iowa that were buying corn are now going to brazil and other countries they are establishing new markets wallace congressman chaffetz but you aposre ignoring the fact there aposs a huge price to be paid for illegal immigration it aposs overwhelming our systems our schools our medical facilities it cost us billions and billions and billions of dollars to have this flow of illegal immigration come across our borders not to mention the drug trade the human trafficking all that gets left out of the equation from the democrats the usmca is ready to go congress nancy pelosi crosstalk williams let me speak to the immigration point congressman when you look at who aposs coming it aposs not an invasion which is what the president was saying there is no military threat this is not about drugs or what you were just saying this is about families running away seeking to come to our country because of violence lack of economic opportunity in our country and that aposs a way to deal with it not too great a campaign issue that polarizes it edwards well in years past the way that asylum seekers have handled this through a much more orderly process they come through points of entry they are processed through the system wallace if i may in years past you never had this kind of an inflow you didn apost have 100 000 people this is the highest number since 2007 edwards well part of the reason for that is that it aposs being driven because of the clampdown in the united states around the process and people in central america are seeing that and they are bringing their families thinking well maybe this is my last shot this flow has been driven by the bad policies of this administration rove no absolutely not absolutely not the same policies were in place under bush under obama under clinton are still in place today it is being driven by two factors one is drugs because the drug cartels have figured out that they can charge people to bring them up from central america and enhance their cash flow and second of all it aposs broken by the fact that the volume is so much from central america in 2007 the last year we had this many people coming across the border the vast preponderance of the more mexicans and we have the authority under our laws and under our agreements with mexico to turn them around and them within 24 hours they call them otms in the immigration language other than mexicans we don apost have those same authorities these laws were broken under clinton there were broken under bush they were broken under obama the problem is the flow today is crushing the system because of four and five times as many people coming from central america as they used to come wallace all right great conversation and my guess is we will get to continue it in the future this isn apost going to get settled in the next week we have to take a break here we aposll see you all a little later panel up next robert mueller says his report does not clear president trump setting of new calls for impeachment from democrats a top republican on the house judiciary committee joins us next as fox news sunday reports from the university of dubuque in iowa commercial break wallace coming up robert mueller finally speaks and spurs talks of impeachment in washington begin video clip rep jerry nadler d n y with respect to the impeachment questions at this point all options are on the table trump to me it aposs a dirty word the word impeach end video clip wallace we aposll ask the top republican on the house judiciary committee if congress will begin formal proceedings next commercial break wallace welcome back to dubuque iowa where we aposll be holding a town hall tonight with democratic presidential candidate senator kirsten gillibrand many democrats interpreted robert mueller aposs remarks this week about president trump as an impeachment referral to congress joining us now from georgia congressman doug collins the top republican on the house judiciary committee where formal proceedings would begin congressman both attorney general barr and special counsel former special counsel robert mueller spoke this week and there were some contradictions here they are on whether president obama ph committed obstruction of justice begin video clip william barr attorney general april 18 2019 there is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by his sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency propelled by his political opponents and fueled by illegal leaks robert mueller former special counsel may 29 2019 if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so end video clip wallace you side with the attorney general and you say that the mueller report shows that there was no obstruction but when you listen to robert mueller there that aposs not what he says rep doug collins r ga well chris good morning and it aposs interesting for robert mueller that he starts from the premise that aposs so interestingly the wrong narrative for america is that your he aposs trying to take and say we aposre proving innocence here and that you aposre guilty until we prove you innocent it aposs really an interesting correlation here i think what happened is is that report is now out we see the report you had stated earlier that this was the call for the democrats to start impeachment they aposve been wanting to impeach this president since november of 2016 they aposve never liked him they use any excuse to begin the impeachment process but what we found was is no collusion there was no charge of obstruction remember bob attorney general barr and rod rosenstein who was appointed under obama both came to the conclusion taking under no pretense of any legal opinion and said that there was no charges to be had when they made their final report after getting it from bob mueller so i think what he said this week was frankly it was sort of frustrating for he wanted to just basically memorialize what he had already written down and again to cause more questions for many of us that instead of finding answers we still find more questions wallace all right then there aposs the issue of whether or not mueller felt bound by the office of legal counsel a part of the department of justice by the olc aposs ruling that a sitting president cannot be indicted for a crime here again are barr and mueller begin video clip william barr attorney general may 1 2019 he reiterated several times in a in a group meeting that the he was not saying that but for the olc opinion he would have found obstruction robert mueller former special counsel may 29 2019 under long standing department policy a present ph president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office that is unconstitutional end video clip wallace again barr says that the department guidelines was not the issue and bob mueller indicates that it was a central concern collins what bob mueller stated this is nothing new this is again has been out for now a while it was actually written on the report i mean a lot of folks people are saying that this was some kind of a new revelation from bob mueller this week no it was actually written into the report we talked about it then but bill barr also made it very clear that when he when when wallace but but but it does in fairness sir it does it does contradict what it does contradict what barr was saying the attorney general when he said that mueller said that that wasn apost an issue and mueller says it was an issue so it at least was setting the record straight with regard to what attorney general barr has been saying collins well and that aposs mr mueller aposs you know decision he made to you know to do his press conference this week or his discussion about it but also it was very clear that bill barr and rod rosenstein basically both said that they did not take that into account when they took the information from bob mueller who by the way punted on a prosecutorial decision he sent it back and said we aposre not going to make a decision based on the evidence that they had found when we look at this again the frustration point is is the report has been out mr mueller decided he wanted to end his time and resign and go back into private life he did so by going up and restating points that he picked from the report that he wanted to do on wednesday look i respect him he needs to go back to public life that aposs what he wants to do that aposs fine but when we look at this report there aposs also many things that were left unanswered on where it started how they got the information why they only pick and choose a little bit of the dossier to actually disprove but yet not talk about the other issues around us you know like when did they stop and find that no collusion actually existed when did they continue on with this continuation of looking into the president this is a continuation of a discussion that happened wednesday that should have ended with the report he now should be ended and now actually i believe bill barr is right in saying how did we get to this point to start with this is the critical point because we aposve had two years of basically turmoil caused by a cabal that started at the fbi that we aposre now actually getting a chance to look into wallace all right i promise i aposm going to get to that in a moment but you have just raised a lot of questions that robert mueller could answer in the past you have said that you would like them to testify before the committee he made it clear this week he has no interest in doing so would you support a vote by democrats on your committee the house judiciary committee to subpoena robert mueller so they can ask their questions and you can ask your questions collins well that would be an interesting question for chairman nadler because chairman nadler this year has shown that he is willing to subpoena anything that moves and it aposs amazingly he aposs not talked about that with robert mueller i don apost believe he really wants to talk to robert mueller because it aposs better for him to continue a narrative that robert mueller said things or implied things that he aposs trying to imply to the american people as impeachment i was one of the first republicans that said publicly along with john ratcliffe and others that said we would like to talk to robert mueller because we do have questions i believe it aposs a twofold process i believe chairman nadler likes to continue the innuendo and and doubts that has been placed and then also at the same point robert mueller doesn apost want to testify before congress because he aposs going to get real questions about how the investigation was done where it started how it became and why they sort of picked and choosed ph it seems in the report how this actually got going so i think it aposs a it aposs a two way street here we will see what chairman nadler does he aposs got a he aposs he aposs been obsessed with subpoena since he became chairman let aposs see what he does now wallace ok let aposs get to the question you were raising attorney general barr has indicated that he has now launched an investigation into the origins of the russia probe what is the single biggest question that you have that you would hope that this investigation would answer collins mine is taking into account the what we have already seen as a pattern that seemed to be developed by what i aposve call the corrupt cabal with with strzok with page with comey with baker with mccabe that seemed to be at the picture in the center of everything going on from the mid year investigation the clinton e mail investigation that moved into the russia investigation the information that was given to the fisa court the information of a dossier that was if mr comey later said was a salacious and unverified but yet he verified that it was accurate going before this court these are the kinds of things that you look at and should concern every american not just a republicans not just a democrat or independent this should consume ph every american that you had a group at the department of justice and fbi not the whole block ph but a cabal that was saying we don apost like donald trump we don apost want to see him president they even said in a text message we aposll have an insurance policy they were going at seemingly a roundabout way to say we aposre going to take it into our own hands they should concern everybody when you use a court such as the fisa court which is a secret court which is one in which they have seemingly wallace ok collins not used all the evidence that they could have done in that wallace i i aposve got i aposve got let congressman excuse me i aposve got less than a minute left i want to ask you one last question collins yes wallace and this goes to the origins of the investigation james comey says look they had information by july of 2016 that the russians were hacking democratic e mails and we know that george papadopoulos an advisor of some sort to the trump campaign was talking about that comey said they would have been derelict in their duty if they hadn apost pursued that do you agree collins jim comey right now is trying to rewrite history i believe his 15 minutes are up he knows it he aposs going everywhere talking about the things that he did or should have done and i think the interesting thing is here he doesn apost want i believe the light of investigations shined on what they were actually doing i don apost believe strzok or page or mccabe or baker any others wanted as well so they aposre remaking themselves now when they go back and look at this when you look at the information they had which was essentially disproven and many times even through his own words were salacious and unverified how do you take that with a straight face to the court mr comey your time aposs up it aposs time to wallace right collins for us to find out how this started and go from there wallace congressman collins thank you thanks for joining us today please come back sir collins we will chris thank you wallace up next nancy pelosi faces new pressure from the left wing of her party to start impeachment proceedings against the president how long can she hold out against those demands and watch what happens when a 2020 candidate for president speaking at california aposs democratic party convention pushes back on socialism all of that when our sunday group returns here in dubuque iowa commercial break begin video clip robert mueller former special counsel the opinion says that the constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing rep nancy pelosi d calif house speaker maybe it aposs 38 of them out of 238 have said that they wanted to be outspoken on impeachment and many of them are reflecting their views as well as those of their constituents end video clip wallace robert mueller appearing to hand the trump investigation and the possibility of impeachment over to congress but house speaker nancy pelosi is saying not so fast and we aposre back now with the panel well karl speaker pelosi got her numbers slightly wrong we aposre going to put them up on the screen it aposs actually 50 house democrats out of 235 still 20 percent who have called for starting the formal impeachment inquiry but that aposs still a a very distinct minority is pelosi right in deciding trying to hold this off and how long do you think she can hold off the push for impeachment among her democratic caucus karl rove contributor well i don apost know how long she can hold it off but i think she aposs right to be concerned about this an interesting thing to me is that since the mueller report came out two things have happened the president aposs approval rating has stabilized and the percentage of people who oppose impeachment has risen harvard harris poll 65 percent oppose the house democrats beginning impeachment proceedings nancy pelosi is smart and tough and she knows that first of all this and talk of impeachment is obscuring everything the democrats are trying to do in the house nobody knows what these bills are that they aposre passing she also understands that given the fact that she is in the speakership because 31 democrats flipped republican seats in districts that donald trump won those people are at risk she loses two two out of every three of those democrats who today hold republican seats she aposs no longer speaker she loses less than that it gets more difficult to govern the house given the fact that she aposs got this hard left faction that aposs giving her such problems and she also understands with regards to 2020 the election is all about this group of independent swing voters who today are strongly opposed to impeachment wallace special counsel robert mueller now the former special counsel made it very clear in his press conference this week he does not want to testify before congress take a look begin video clip robert mueller former special counsel may 29 2019 we chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself and the report is my testimony i would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before congress end video clip wallace but congresswoman edwards you have a column in the washington post this weekend where you say that that the house judiciary committee needs to get robert mueller to testify one way or the other why edwards i think they do and one because i think it aposs important for him to put his report into some context to the american people i mean let aposs face it most people haven apost read 448 pages i know all of us have but most people haven apost and they need to be able to tell a story to the american public the other thing is that i think that attorney general barr aposs interviews over the last couple of days have actually raised more questions because the attorney general challenged the legal analysis of bob mueller and so i think it now it becomes imperative for him to testify about his legal analysis given that it was it aposs been challenged and overruled frankly by the attorney general wallace just really quickly because before we turn to another subject you also want a made for tv spectacle don apost you edwards no i would not i did wallace i mean honestly edwards well no i haven apost described it as a spectacle but i do think that television is powerful and live television is and i think to focus the american public on the whole story it aposs really important from the russian interference in the election to the president aposs ten obstructive acts and i don apost think that you get that by spreading it over six committees by multiple subpoenas and court proceedings wallace ok all right let aposs turn to the another really interesting subject something interesting happened at the california state democratic party convention in san francisco yesterday former governor john hickenlooper of colorado one of the two dozen democrats running for president was addressing the convention when he said this begin video clip john hickenlooper d presidential candidate if we want to beat donald trump and achieve big progressive goals socialism is not the answer i was re elected end video clip wallace congressman chaffetz it went on from there here aposs john hickenlooper a centrist governor of colorado when he was there who governed and quite successfully with republicans who controlled the state legislature at least for the first part of his term gets booed when he said socialism isn apost the answer chaffetz well this is the problem the democrats have is they have been moving towards socialism you have bernie sanders right near the top of the poll who is not a registered democrat who is more of a in that socialist camp and believe me republicans are going to go out and remind people what socialism is and what the policy and platform is of the democrats hickenlooper i think made a calculated move in that audience but that aposs a radical group of of socialist in part that was there in california wallace well i know you must be wanting to respond to that but i mean the fact is we keep hearing oh look democrats what they care about i aposm talking about voters now what they care about most is beating donald trump care about that more than ideological purity and then you get to a convention and here aposs john hickenlooper and he says socialism isn apost the answer and he gets booed williams well first of all where was he he aposs at the california state democratic convention so it aposs a very liberal group in san francisco so it aposs a very liberal group of people i would say more than liberal i aposd say far left but the big point to me is that republicans want to paint democrats as socialist and what hickenlooper went on to say is we can apost let republicans paint us into a corner it would put us at a disadvantage in states like wisconsin and michigan working people who would say hey what aposs this socialism about but the reality is and this is what hickenlooper also said chris that we need to achieve democrats need to achieve progressive goals because the american people not only do they like the idea of dealing with income inequality specifically high levels of student debt problems with the health care system and of course we have things like medicare and social security that aposs not socialism those are means of moderating the excesses of capitalism and democrats in this era of income inequality want to deal with those issues so hickenlooper aposs right it aposs just that when you start using the term socialism i think you are caving to the caricature that republicans are painting of democrats in this moment wallace i was going to say though i mean brother williams may be right on every point he made but you know that aposs a clip and it aposs going to play out and does don apost democrats make it easier for the republicans to make the case when they boo hickenlooper saying socialism isn apost the answer rove oh yes they do yes yes yes they do and they also make it easier for republicans when they put people like aoc forward and representative omar and representative tlaib and senator warren and when they embrace all of these nutty ideas and there is a wealth of ammunition that they aposre providing the key decision for the democrats is going to be one that that juan alluded to are they going to pick somebody who is a more traditional democrat who says the answer is we need to strengthen and and and protect the affordable care act or somebody who says by god we want single payer we want the government to be in charge of all your health care decisions and this is going to be a critical decision for the democrats if they end up picking somebody who aposs in the latter camp it is a big juicy target for republicans because williams but don apost call them nutty karl they aposre not nutty inaudible rove well you know what they they are cooky ph and nutty edwards and and first of all i mean we can apost choose any more traditional candidate than the republicans have a traditional candidate williams well yes that aposs true edwards but look the point is wallace you aposve got ten seconds edwards i think that the booing on socialism was because voters democrats don apost want to be painted that way and don apost want to fall into the caricature and so we don apost need candidates that wallace well that backfired on him all right thank you panel see you next sunday back in washington up next some good advice for the class of 2019 from our power players of the week commercial break wallace it aposs become an annual tradition here to sample the wise words college graduates are hearing at their commencement this year the speakers include a pair of media moguls and a chart topping singer and they aposre all our power players of the week begin videotape oprah winfrey when i was 28 it wasn apost working out for me on the news because i was too emotional i aposd go to cover stories and cry because people lost their houses or lost their children i was told that i was going to be taken off the evening news and put on a talk show that was a demotion for me at the time that actually worked out for me michael bloomberg former new york city mayor people have the tendency to assume the worst about those on the other side of the aisle and when it comes to those on your side they tend to see no evil hear no evil and speak no evil trump that is what your time at this great academy has been all about preparing you to do whatever it takes to learn to adapt and to win win win you know win so much you aposre going to get so tired of winning but not really tara westover author educated sometimes i think that when we deny what is worst about ourselves we also deny what is best we repress our ignorance and thus we deny our
