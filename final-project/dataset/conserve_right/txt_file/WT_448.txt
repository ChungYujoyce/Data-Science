gantz edging ahead blue and white officials are warning mr netanyahu not to endanger the u s backed peace process by using it for his own political purposes nobody expects israel or the palestinians to take the plan at face value the way it is and just make sure it happens yair lapid widely tapped to be foreign minister in a blue and white coalition government told reporters this week mr netanyahu s call for an immediate unilateral annexation of west bank land claimed by the palestinians is a political ploy that will backfire mr lapid said as reported by the associated press this is too serious to become a stunt in the campaign he said mr netanyahu has hailed mr trump as the most pro israel president in history but even u s officials are warning the jewish state against moving too quickly to implement the peace deal a cabinet vote on annexation announced by mr netanyahu has been postponed indefinitely u s ambassador to israel david m friedman said in a twitter post this week that any annexation should be delayed until a joint u s israeli mapping committee is able to complete its work any unilateral action in advance of the completion of the committee process endangers the plan and american recognition the ambassador said palestinian violence as israeli officials try to forge a path forward they are dealing with renewed violence from palestinians who have broadly rejected the u s blueprint palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas traveled to new york on tuesday to make a personal plea to the u n security council to reject the u s sponsored peace plan the trump plan spearheaded by white house adviser and presidential son in law jared kushner would make jerusalem the undivided capital of israel and clear the way for annexation of lands in the west bank and jordan valley occupied by jewish settlers palestinians would be given control of linked enclaves in the west bank and gaza strip with a new capital on the outskirts of east jerusalem and the promise of an independent state after major internal reforms are completed the plan also envisions a 50 billion redevelopment fund to build infrastructure and expand economic opportunities for palestinians israeli forces came under sniper fire in the palestinian city of jenin in the west bank a week after the plan was announced israel is preparing for increased escalation from hamas in the gaza strip by beefing up forces in gaza and the west bank and by carrying out airstrikes this week in response to rocket fire from gaza since the jan 28 announcement of the peace deal the often feuding palestinian factions hamas the islamic jihad and fatah have united in condemnation of the plan and israel s calls for annexation of parts of the west bank rockets and mortars have been fired almost daily from gaza and balloons with explosives attached have been launched a palestinian hurled a molotov cocktail at israeli forces feb 4 in hebron in the west bank in one of the most serious incidents a palestinian drove his car into a dozen soldiers in jerusalem last week severely injuring one soldier in jenin israeli forces executing an order to demolish a terrorist s home were caught in a sophisticated ambush improvised explosives detonated near their vehicles and sniper fire targeted at them resulted in a lengthy gunbattle the challenge for israel is that palestinian groups including hamas are trying to leverage the peace plan to their benefit by seeking popular opposition hamas wants to be relevant after being isolated in gaza for a decade and a half the palestinian authority s aging leadership under mr abbas is also isolated because they have lost much of their support from regional states the u s and israel are looking to the march 2 elections in hopes that they will provide clarity and an israeli government that can act u s officials are clearly wary that the netanyahu government may try to accelerate a delicate process for political gain president trump put out a plan for the next hundred years not the next 30 days mr friedman said over the weekend but mr netanyahu who faces criticism from the israeli left for moving too fast and criticism from settler groups and his conservative political base for not moving fast enough is urging all sides to stand down for now we have been waiting for this since 1967 he told a rally of supporters saturday
