indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion this week the trump administration is moving forward with its plan to reduce american involvement in afghanistan the odds of success are not high at this moment however the plan probably is the least bad option initially the taliban has agreed only to limit violence for seven days beginning at the stroke of midnight last saturday if relative quiet ensues direct talks between the taliban and the afghan government will begin the goal secretary of state mike pompeo said is to reach a political settlement to end the war in afghanistan reduce united states and allied forces presence and ensure that no terrorist group ever uses afghan soil to threaten the united states or our allies top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century as a next step u s forces will be downsized from the current level about 13 000 to 8 600 that figure is not enough for serious war fighting in 2010 president obama deployed 100 000 troops in afghanistan but u s commanders consider it minimally sufficient for an advise and assist mission one that checks the taliban s grander ambitions while protecting hard won gains more on those in a minute would mr trump prefer to bring all americans home before july 4th no doubt why isn t he i suspect his advisers have painted a picture of what could happen were he to cut and run a historic taliban victory and u s defeat helicopters evacuating diplomats from the u s embassy pro american afghans having their heads chopped off with videos going viral america s enemies around the world redoubling their efforts to hasten what would be seen as america s imminent decline and fall not the results mr trump wants to produce least of all in an election year historians are unlikely to conclude that the conflict in afghanistan has been pursued consistently or coherently following the attacks of 2001 american forces toppled the taliban in retaliation for its support for and protection of al qaeda president bush said the mission was to disrupt the use of afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations and to attack the military capability of the taliban regime though the first of those goals was achieved the taliban transformed into a resilient insurgency before long mr bush seemed to lose interest turning his attention to iraq he toppled saddam hussein but a well conceived plan to turn combat success into political success did not follow a bold counterinsurgency surge was required to get iraq back on track progress halted when president obama abruptly withdrew all u s forces from iraq this could be one of the great achievements of this administration said vice president joe biden you re going to see a stable government in iraq that is actually moving toward a representative government instead we saw a power vacuum filled by islamic state fighters and shia militias commanded by the islamic republic of iran mr obama focused on afghanistan which he called the right war the war that should be prioritized but he prosecuted it in a puzzling manner for example by surging additional troops while reassuring the taliban that those forces wouldn t tarry long earlier this month retired gen jack keane chairman of the institute for the study of war testified before the senate committee on armed services his central point afghanistan remains a vital national security interest specifically the security of the homeland and the security of the american people he added i share the frustration of every member here with the length of the engagement but this war with radical islam came to us and it is a generational war at a minimum with no easy or quick solution to avoid losing requires deploying small numbers of troops which along with u s air power can make our partners effective in their battles against common enemies this is a model that is working gen keane told the senators he noted that in syria less than a thousand u s troops support 70 000 kurdish and arab troops who are battling the islamic state while also keeping both iranian and russian forces at bay as for hard won gains in afghanistan s frederick starr chairman of the central asia caucasus institute silk road studies program is this week issuing a briefing paper arguing that there has been more progress in afghanistan than media reports would suggest such positive developments are gaining ground over the long term these in turn demand and justify revisions in strategic thinking in washington and other nato capitals mr starr documents more than 30 indices of progress i have space to mention just four the taliban controls neither the capital of kabul nor any of the country s 34 provincial capitals most of the territory the taliban controls is in the unpopulated desert south and not in areas of significant economic activity afghanistan s gdp has grown from 2 42 billion in 2001 to 20 82 billion in 2020 meanwhile its national debt has been cut by half in a decade basic literacy among afghan men 15 24 is now close to 80 percent among afghan women it has risen from under 10 percent to over 50 percent over the past five years over 2 000 generals and other senior military personnel were retired to be replaced by younger and better trained officers mr starr is not arguing that afghanistan will soon resemble costa rica he and gen keane are arguing that a modest and sustainable u s presence in afghanistan provides a significant return on investment for america s national security while also improving the lot of the long suffering afghan people america first president trump has said does not mean america alone nor need it mean america only clifford d may is founder and president of the
