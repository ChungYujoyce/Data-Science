apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the outlook may be improving for america s farmers whose famous resilience has been tested by president trump s trade policies as well as by lower prices driven by several years of bountiful harvests the retaliatory tariffs many countries have placed on u s agricultural products have twisted america s farm landscape but rising prices and the trump administration s program to subsidize farmers hit by the tariffs mean the plight isn t as dire as some have said according to farmers and government reports as i stand here today i m about as optimistic as i was on this day last year said brandon whitt manager of batey farms in murfreesboro tennessee top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed mr whitt tempered his mood with some foreboding however but overall i m less optimistic mr whitt said it s not easy to hear someone gambling with your livelihood and at this point history doesn t give me confidence that the people in charge are going to get it all fixed the agriculture department predicts a 10 percent uptick from last year in farm profit to 69 4 billion according to the agency s first forecast for 2019 released last month that would make up for some of the 16 percent decline in 2018 but would leave farmers below their historical averages from 2000 to 2017 the higher net farm income projection comes despite continued retaliatory tariffs on u s agricultural products but largely reflects expectations for trend yields and slightly higher prices for some commodities said john newton chief economist for the american farm bureau federation batey farm grows soybeans and corn which appear poised for another bumper harvest but face considerable headwinds in international markets in response to tariffs that the trump administration has imposed on goods to combat market dumping intellectual copyright theft and other issues the european union and china have slapped tariffs on u s farm exports that smacks america s farmers and consumers disproportionately say supporters of free markets and economists who criticize the administration s policies the combination of mr trump s trade policies and several years of big harvests driving down prices have produced a double whammy for america s farmers the farm bureau federation says we don t really know what part of price drops is attributable to the tariffs and what part to the laws of supply and demand said will rodger the farm bureau s director of communications for glenn brunkow 48 a kansas farmer of soybeans and corn as well as some livestock the tariffs have hit us very hard with soybean prices being significantly lower and that has dropped my income by a great deal mr brunkow said farmers can t endure without long term optimism given the cyclical nature of agriculture but u s policies have now warped that rotation of up and down years bumper harvests and thin harvests recently it has not necessarily followed those patterns and that makes it harder to see the upside he said farmers suffered their biggest drop in incomes long before mr trump was president incomes plummeted from a record high in 2013 and have been volatile since 2016 we had a lot of goals to really grow our operation said kelly whiteman snipes who runs a 300 acre farm with her husband in indiana but these last five years we ve just been in maintenance mode our goal the last five years has really been to break even farmers are very resilient snipes farm specializes in oleic soybeans a sort of niche product that has found a market with a fast food industry looking for a lower fat cooking oil ms whiteman snipes 33 and her husband hold down other jobs and as minor farmers have not availed themselves of the usda s market facilitation program for the administration s subsidies she said the program though is helping many other farmers survive lean times thank god for sonny perdue as the secretary of agriculture mr whitt said the mfp payments we received have made an incredible difference it s allowed people to hold on and given a glimmer of hope that we can ride this thing out the program s first round announced in september distributed some 8 billion in federal grants to more than 860 000 farmers feeling the tariffs pinch according to the usda mr trump authorized the second round of payments in december grants were made available to almond corn cotton dairy hog sorghum soybean fresh sweet cherry and wheat producers it s not clear how much money will be handed out in the current round farmers usually have crop insurance on three fourths of their estimated harvest but those prices were locked in last month prices stand at about 9 50 for a bushel for soybeans mr whitt said which is below its historical highs and does not cover the cost of production the usda program helps mitigate that hit farmers are very resilient and these payments are helping agricultural producers meet some of the cost of disrupted markets in 2018 usda undersecretary bill northey said in announcing the latest distributions given a choice between the market facilitation program and the market however some farmers said they much prefer the latter we got mfp grants and they helped but we would much rather have free trade and higher commodity prices mr brunkow said i don t know of any farmer who wants to depend on government payments although prices are creeping up and bankruptcies have not swept across america s rural landscape the trade situation is casting a long shadow over the spring season because the global market has become as significant to the farming business as rainfall while these projections suggest 2019 could be better than 2018 for many farmers much is up in the air mr newton wrote retaliatory tariffs are still in place and recently both mexico and the european union threatened additional tariffs if national security tariffs on steel and aluminum are not removed or if auto tariffs are put in place any trade deal reached this year would improve the outlook for a variety of exports but farmers then would need to repair business relationships at the end of the day it s not really the u s and china making a deal it s people throughout the chain making deals and using the business relationships they ve built up over the years mr rodger said with brazil russia and other producers swooping in to meet demand u s farmers may have to fight to regain their long held market dominance the world demand is still high but where is the world going to get it from mr whitt said we ve got to play in a global market and i m afraid we might have lost a prett
