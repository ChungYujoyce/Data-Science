special counsel robert mueller aposs ability to be impartial donald trump president of the united states he s very very good friends with comey which is very bothersome hume we ll ask our sunday panel if mueller needs to recuse himself from this investigation all right now on fox news sunday end videotape hume and hello again from fox news in washington republicans have continued making headway on their pledge to overhaul the nation s health care system as an obamacare replacement was unveiled in the senate this week and as majority leader mitch mcconnell pushes to bring the bill to the floor for a vote several of his fellow republicans have come out in opposition to it this hour we ll look at the battle ahead in the senate with democrat dick durbin and republican barrasso but first joining us to discuss the bill health and human services secretary tom price mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday tom price health and human services secretary good morning thanks brit wonderful to be with you hume thank you sir glad to have you what is what is in this bill for an average family worried about the cost of health care and wondering if they re going to be able to get or keep their coverage why should they care about this bill why should they want this bill price yes i think the important thing to appreciate is that where we re headed right now is in the wrong direction we ve got premiums increasing deductibles increasing where folks can t afford the deductibles so they can t get care you heard just this past week more insurers announcing that they re not going to be able to provide coverage in 2018 so this bill would provide market stability making it so that insurance companies can come back into the market and provide offer coverage for individuals it would make it so that there are insurance reforms so that individuals have more choices it does away with the mandate so you aren apost forced to buy something that the government wants you to purchase or says you got to purchase you get the choice as individuals across this land to be able to purchase the kind of coverage that s right for you and your family and then in the medicaid system what we do is to say to states you need the flexibility to be able to provide the coverage that you think is most appropriate for your constituents for your population instead of a top down washington knows best model so it aposs significant reform it s a move in a much better direction because it is patients centered move for patients and families and doctors will be making decisions not washington d c hume let me ask you a question that was sent to us by a viewer chris bustin is his name and he writes does the senate bill address those americans who fall within the quote coverage gap between medicaid and obamacare what about that mr secretary price yes precisely in fact it does a much better job remember right now brit there are 28 million americans who are uninsured twenty eight million americans who don t have insurance 6 5 million of them have said have been forced to pay 3 billion in taxes and penalties for the privilege for the right of not purchasing what the government says they ve got to buy so what the senate bill does is say every single individual between zero between up to 350 percent of the poverty level ought to be able to have some type of tax credit that will allow them to purchase the kind of coverage that they want and it s a tax credit or refundable tax credit or advanceable so that nobody will fall through the cracks nobody will have the rug pulled out from under them we want a seamless transition for those that are moving from either medicaid to the individual market or medicaid to the employer sponsored market so that individuals are able to maintain the kind of coverage that they want for themselves hume the senate bill which is similar in many respects to the house bill it was scored by the cbo as leaving you now 20 some million more uninsured over a period of time than present law would foresee what is your response to that criticism that it just leaves too many people out price yes two major points to this one is that the congressional budget office does a pretty good job usually of saying what something is going to cost they aposve been woefully inadequate and being able to predict what kind of coverage for example the congressional budget office said that right now obamacare would cover about 23 or 24 million people in fact it aposs about 10 million people so they are off by a significant factor and we believe that they are off by a huge factor here as well because they don apost get any credit for individuals purchasing some type of insurance that the cbo says it isn t incredible insurance second point is that in terms of the entire plan the bill isn t the entire plan the kinds of things that we re doing at the department of health and human services to make certain that individuals across this land have the opportunity again to purchase the kind of coverage that they want for themselves not that the government forces them to buy to bring market stability so prices come down to make it so that deductibles aren t so high that you have health insurance card but you don t have care so in its entirety we believe that we will get more individuals covered that are covered right now hume it will be interesting to see what the cbo says about that but let me ask you this question what do you say to senator heller of nevada who came out this week and said he can support the bill in its present form because over time the medicaid changes you are making will mean fewer people are able to afford coverage that are now getting it or would be getting it through medicaid what do you say to him price yes i say that medicaid isn apost the only vehicle to be able to purchase coverage or be able to have coverage the goal of the senate plan the goal of the president s plan and he s adamant about this he wants to make certain that every single american has access to the kind of coverage that they want but the plan is to make it so that if individuals aren t eligible for medicaid then again there aposs that seamless transition to the individual market and that that market is more robust because of the kinds of changes within the senate bill and other kinds of things that we re doing at the department to provide greater choices at a lower cost within that individual and small group market so our goal is if you re not eligible for medicaid in this new construct that you are eligible for the kind of coverage and had the kind of subsidy the kind of assistance financial assistance to be able to purchase that coverage hume let me come at from a somewhat different angle the angle where rand paul is coming from and he is not alone in this there are members of the house who feel the same way and perhaps others in the senate as well his point is you don apost repeal and replace obamacare here you leave most of its key elements in place you know the coverage for pre existing conditions people young people can stay on their parents apos insurance plan until age 26 the subsidies which are a key part of obamacare are all left largely intact here that this doesn apost in fact do the job of repealing and replacing obamacare what do you say price yes what i tell him is look the penalties go away right now the government is forcing people to buy coverage in fact again there are 6 5 million folks who are paying the 3 billion for the privilege of not purchasing that coverage those go away so that s not obamacare medicaid actually becomes much more flexible for states so that they can design a program that works for their citizens as opposed to washington telling the states what they want that s not obamacare the taxes that are in place solely to build a huge government run health care system those go away so that aposs not obamacare so what we are trying to do here admittedly is to thread a needle in make it so that the president says every single american has access to that kind of coverage that they want ensuring that pre existing elements are covered ensuring there are no lifetime caps ensuring that individuals again have the kind of choices that are necessary so that the system is responsive to people to patients not responsive to government hume mr secretary you mentioned that the penalties for not having the tax penalty for not having insurance goes away which suggests that people with pre existing conditions are covered anybody who wants to simply wait until they are sick to buy coverage and then be covered that obviously is an issue since you need healthy people in the program price sure hume to pay for the coverage for people who are ill what do you what is the incentive in this bill if any to get people to go ahead and purchase coverage when they are young and they seem they feel healthy and it aposs a rational choice not to have it price well it aposs a great question and the question really is how do you get young healthy people to purchase coverage so that that pool includes them and the answer is you provide the insurance companies the opportunity to sell something to young healthy people that they want to buy not that they say the 6 5 million folks out there say we ll write a check so that we don apost have to buy what washington tells us to buy you provide the kind of choices the array of choices before individuals were able to purchase the kind of coverage that was actually responsive to them fit their system fit their lifestyle fit their situation and life that aposs the way to get folks to buy coverage and that s providing coverage that they want to purchase as opposed to what the government dictates to them they ve got to buy hume secretary let me turn to the question obviously that everybody is going to be thinking about this week and which we ll take up presently with senators durbin and barrasso which is this since the plan was brought forward this week five republican senators have announced their misgivings there may be four or so others who share those misgivings for various reasons so you re going to be you can only afford to lose two you are down five and maybe more how do you get from where you are now to the 50 votes you need price yes if you listen to what those five said and we talked with every one of them and i know that the senate leadership has as well and the president is talking with folks if you talk to them what they will tell you and they i think it was part of your clips before is that we want to be able to support this bill we simply believe that it can be made better in a certain way hume can it price and so those conversations are ongoing that s the that s the nature of the legislative process and that aposs what we aposve been working through this week hume well i mean but you ve got they are coming at you from both sides you ve got you know ted cruz and rand paul who are worried about it for one set of reasons and then you ve got you know the other senators who come out with and shown their misgivings about it for another set of reasons aren apost you in danger if you please one group of losing others and so on i mean aren apost you got a pretty little delicate structure here that you risk upsetting when you start adjusting it to pick up votes price well you ve identified the challenge there is no doubt about it it s a thin needle to thread sadly as the president has talked about it it would be wonderful to have some democrats come along and recognize that there are nearly 40 percent of our counties across this nation that will only have one issuer insurance company providing coverage there are going to be counties across this country that won apost have any insurance company providing coverage you ve got premiums going up deductibles going up folks have that insurance card but no care what do they what our friends on the other side of the aisle from a republican democratic perspective say to those challenges why aren t they coming to the table to help out that s what the president wants to know ph crosstalk hume mr secretary we have one of their leaders coming up next and i ll ask that very question sir thank you very much for being with us hume thank you thanks so much up next senators dick durbin and john barrasso on where things stand in the battle over healthcare reform in the senate stay with us commercial break hume the pressure is now on senate republicans who took a big step this week in their effort to repeal and replace obamacare but does that health care plan has the votes to pass joining us to discuss it from springville illinois the senate s number two democrat dick durbin and here in washington wyoming senator dr john barrasso who helped craft the plan first to you senator durbin let me pick up where secretary price left off is there a single democratic senator that you can identify who might vote for this plan sen dick durbin d ill minority whip no not as written i will tell you two things that were omitted from your interview with secretary price i asked him ten days ago in a hearing before a committee have you seen the republican plan are you part of the discussion he said no i haven t seen it at all this is a man responsible for implementing it so we are going to vote this week on changing the health care system in america without any public hearings without the publication of the bill without any discussion and debate and then we have this expedited amendment process it is really disgraceful to think that senate has reached this point crosstalk hume senator i understand your procedural objections to the bill but let aposs talk a little bit about what aposs in the measure and the plan as it was announced this week to the tune of what 142 pages or something what would it take in your judgment to get some democrats to come over and vote for this plan durbin take repeal off the table and the other thing that wasn apost mentioned in the earlier interview what aposs driving this is not health care reform what aposs driving this is a tax cut a tax cut the republicans insist on of about 700 billion for the wealthiest people in america and pharmaceutical companies that is what the republicans had to put in the plan to make it work for republicans and then they took the money out of health care out of medicaid and that aposs why we see 23 million americans losing their health insurance so those at the highest income categories can get a tax break take that off the table let aposs talk about repairing affordable care act as it exists hume senator barrasso let me bring you in here what do you say to senator durbin s objections that this is basically not really health care reform or obamacare repeal and replace that is a this is a big tax cut for rich people sen john barrasso r wyo chair republican policy committee it s absolutely wrong the crisis is getting worse obamacare is collapsing every day i was at a hospital yesterday in casper wyoming talking to doctors nurses and patients there aposs an urgency to act we are down to one company providing insurance in wyoming the crisis has skyrocketed that aposs why we have to do something and we need to do what the people are asking for which is stabilize the insurance markets senator durbin doesn apost want to talk about the fact that in illinois they are way down the number of people even selling insurance and prices are way up that we want to eliminate the mandates that you have to buy a government approved product get rid of all of the taxes but focus on the fact that this is health care for people many people and wyoming lost it under obamacare they had insurance they like and they could afford the democrats said not good enough for us it was good enough for them and they could afford it hume well let me press you a little bit on senator durbin aposs point which is that you repeal all the taxes that are in here the tax cuts naturally benefit tend to graduate to the people who pay more taxes which is of course the more wealthy people and that on the other side of this over time medicaid funding will diminish and therefore the argument is made this is this is repealing and replacing obamacare on the backs of the poor what do you say to that argument barrasso obamacare raise taxes on every american who uses health care in america they put it on over the counter medicines prescription medicines medical devices that are so often used for the disabled population the most so it s been very cruel taxing on obamacare but that aposs what he wants to talk about we want to eliminate all they put the taxes on people that buy health insurance so anybody using the health insurance the cost of that has actually gone up by the taxes under obamacare with regard to medicaid i m a doctor who took care of every medicaid patient that there was a came to me in casper wyoming as a state legislator i always believed we could do a much better job if we could just have control of that money and actually help more people with the same amount of money without all the washington hume you mean local control barrasso local control which is what i saw in the wyoming state senate but the amount of dollars going to medicaid from today on out continues to go up year after year after year so when senator durbin refers to a cut only in washington is giving more each year something you can see ph of a cut if it doesn apost go up as fast as he would like it to go up it goes up every year hume let me turn it back to you senator durbin there is a question about the growth in medicaid aposs spending and the fact that our budget problem has attributed to huge parts by the kind of entitlement program that medicaid represents and with its exponential growth are we in a situation where something has to be done to curb the growth of medicaid and perhaps other entitlement programs durbin brit let me tell you my friend john barrasso and he is my friend spends a lot of time we talk about wyoming over the weekend the head of the wyoming hospital association came out against senator barrasso aposs bill and the ceo of the wyoming medical center said it s going to hurt everybody in wyoming now that aposs what s being said in his home state crosstalk barrasso she also said she didn apost read the bill she also said she didn t read the bill so she could read it first durbin well it aposs impossible to find you couldn apost find the bill until the very last week barrasso only 150 pages durbin most of it are tax cuts crosstalk hume let me get back to my point durbin if i could respond on medicaid hume yes go ahead durbin may i please hume sure durbin and i might say that the republican governor of wyoming would like to expand medicaid but the legislature won apost let him and the reason we need to expand it is to make sure that people who are currently working hard in low paying jobs and have no medical benefits have an opportunity through medicaid to have insurance for their families why do we have this increase this dramatic increase in people on medicaid because so many people are working hard every single day and don apost have health insurance medicaid is their ticket to health insurance and the republicans have decided to put a cap on the amount of money that s going to be given to states and republican governors like the governor of nevada the governor of ohio the governor of illinois have said this is a disaster for our states if you do it hume senator nowhere though in your answer do i i mean in your comments do i hear an answer to the question of is not medicaid expanding at an unsustainable rate and does not something have to be done for budgetary reasons long term and short to curb the growth of this program and others like it durbin brit let me tell you what is expanding at an unsustainable rate and that is the notion that people would not have health insurance under this republican approach let aposs face the reality even if you don apost have medicaid even if the republicans are successful with coming back on it people get sick and go to the hospital in a state like kentucky one of the largest expansions of medicaid if they eliminate the medicaid funding it will be 165 percent increase in kentucky in uncompensated care there s going to be medical care given to these people the working poor and those who are struggling and others will have to pay for it hume got it durbin the republicans won apost face that reality hume senator barrasso barrasso well medicaid was set up for poor women for children and for people with disability obamacare used medicaid as a dumping ground for able bodied working aged individuals there are ways to modify medicaid mike pence vice president when he was governor of indiana did a wonderful job of that with the local control that we are asking for all across the country the growth will continue for medicaid we need to do it in a responsible way but to just talk about these things as being cuts it aposs just not the case and when they put dump all of these additional people onto medicaid it made it that much harder for the poor women children and people with disabilities to get the treatment they need because now more and more doctors are saying actually a third of doctors saying i just can apost see any new medicaid patients so obamacare actually made it worse for patients who were originally designed to be helped by medicaid hume senators durbin durbin i can tell you that this approach the republican approach will devastate medicaid and you know who will be hurt rural hospitals in wyoming and in illinois ask your hospital association senator my hospital association over the weekend here in illinois and said this is devastating we are going to lose jobs in rural hospitals in illinois that s the trump constituency that s going to be hurt by this approach on the republican side and secondly we re going to see premiums go up dramatically particularly those crosstalk hume but they re going up dramatically now aren t they senator aren t they going up dramatically now durbin they re going up they are going up now but i can tell you it is a finite group of individual insurance market placed people 5 percent to 6 percent of the overall market that aposs what we need to sit down and fix democrats and republicans should work together to make the affordable care act work for them not devastate medicaid not raise premiums hume senator barrasso barrasso senator durbin has no interest in working with the republicans on this but he should have seen the headline in a chicago newspaper that said obamacare obamacare rates rate shock another obamacare rate shock that aposs what aposs happened all across the country people are hurt by these incredible increases this is a program that is collapsing hume senator durbin let me just cite a couple of examples and let you respond to them we i think we have something put up on the screen on some of these premium increases in the state of maryland bluecross blueshield up 52 percent in 2018 you can see in new york 49 percent bluecross blueshield cigna in n virginia 45 percent anthem in connecticut 34 percent delaware highmark blue cross blue shield up 34 percent those are pretty sharp increases and those are just a sample senator it seems to me that to complain that the premiums may go up under this plan it seems to me they re going up pretty seriously under the present situation are they not durbin the congressional brit the congressional budget office when they analyze the house approach which is similar to the senate approach as we have seen it has said that this is a stable insurance market and need there s need obviously for us to work in individual insurance marketplace with 5 or 6 percent of americans who go there but in the meantime when you go to the insurance company executive and say why are you pulling out of markets why are you raising premiums they say the uncertainty in washington since the arrival of president trump who from his first executive order has been undermining health insurance and the affordable care act cutting out the individual marketplace which would expand insurance pools and bring premiums down cutting off the assistance for those who need help in paying for premiums these are the things that are sabotaging and undermining the affordable care act hume ok durbin you can apost have it both ways you can t claim a death spiral why you re choking assistance to death hume what about it senator barrasso what about barrasso obamacare has sabotaged the insurance market in the country to the point where now in half of the counties around the country people are down to either zero one or two choices you have over 40 counties where no one is selling obamacare insurance crosstalk hume senator you made that case pretty effectively that obamacare is in trouble i think i think you know even senator durbin would not disagree that something needs to be done the question now is of course whether you barrasso yes hume and your team of bill designers ph can find a way to bring over the senators you are going to need you are down five you can only afford to lose two there may be others barrasso we work with all of them every one of them is committed to a fundamental change away from obamacare and a central government control and into local control and patients making decisions we re going to continue to work with each of them through the process every one of them has very good points that they are making i want to work with all of them hume yes but do you have the flexibility within the framework of the bill to fix it so that they ll go with you barrasso i believe we do i believe we ll get it passed and that aposs the only way we can fundamentally change away from obamacare get rid of all of the hated mandates and the taxes and put medicaid on a sustainable course long term hume got it barrasso to cut down the costs of care and insurance hume senator barrasso senator durbin a very good debate thanks to both of you up next we ll bring in durbin thanks brit hume we ll bring in our sunday group to get their take on whether the senate health care bill will even make it to a vote stay with us please commercial break hume coming up the president admits he did not tape his conversations with former fbi director james comey begin video clip trump you never know what aposs out there but i didn t tape and i don t have any tape and i didn t tape end video clip hume we ll ask our sunday panel how that revelation affects the special counsel s investigation coming up on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip sen dean heller r nevada this bill this bill that s currently in front of the united states senate not the answer it simply is not the answer and i aposm announcing today that in this form i will not support it trump it s a very complicated situation from the standpoint you do something that aposs good for one group but bad for another it aposs a very very narrow path but i think we re going to get there end video clip hume well you heard now nevada republican senator dean heller there announcing he is not supporting this in its current form at least this senate health care plan and president trump of course is saying optimistically that they ll get the votes but will they now it aposs time for our sunday group the head of heritage action for america michael needham bob woodward of the washington post fox news national security correspondent jennifer griffin and josh holmes mitch mcconnell s former chief of staff and a republican strategist let aposs start with his question they re down five they can apost afford to lose more than two there may be others waiting in the wings who who who may oppose this measure what are the chances michael michael needham ceo heritage action for america well it s going to be very tight as you mentioned there s five probably more like seven or nine senators who have concerns i aposm optimistic because i think those different camps are looking at different parts of the bill the conservatives are looking at what aposs going on with the regulations the ability to bring down premiums some of the moderates are looking at the medicaid expansion in a negotiating situation when people want different things changed there is pareto optimal there is an outcome where people can as the president said this morning maybe not love the bill but like it and i think i aposm optimistic that they ll get there hume jen jennifer griffin fox news correspondent i thought it was notable that the president reached out to senator joe manchin of west virginia a democrat it s clearly that they re very concerned about the five and they don apost believe that they can change senator rand paul aposs mind or senator mike lee aposs mind that s two they can apost also they can only afford to lose two so they are looking at democrats that they can sway but senator manchin has said that he will vote against the bill hume well josh you aposve been in the leadership operation over there on the republican side do you there s a hope in hades that any democrat will come over senator durbin said he couldn t identify one to vote for this bill josh holmes founder cavalry no i i think this democratic party is not your grandfather aposs democratic party i think they re going to oppose donald trump at every possible corner no matter what and and basically no matter what the policy outcome is but i i share michael s optimism i think they re going to get there next week i really do if you look at the statements that the senators have made they aposve had every every opportunity to draw a hard line and and say no and they re leaving themselves some some wiggle room and i think they re having conversations over the weekend that hopefully will send that in the right direction hume bob your thoughts bob woodward the washington post i i think it aposs kind of a fantasy based debate on all sides here and i don apost see how you put it together i mean people talk abstractly about medicaid that is the health insurance program for the poor hume right woodward or the people who can apost afford health insurance and you now have a system where they re at least a proposal in the senate of saying hey let s we ll take them off medicaid and then they can buy insurance but they don apost have the money to do it there s an absurdity in this needham it s kind of incredible both in senator durbin s comments and bobs if the democrat party wants to become the party of medicaid i don t think it s going to have a lot of success in the 21st century medicaid was a program designed in the middle of the last century where health outcomes between people on medicaid and be completely uninsured are exactly the same actually on some procedures you aposre more likely to die if you re on medicaid than if you re uninsured what s happened was that medicaid was originally a very targeted program for certain vulnerable populations people like the disabled that barack obama then poured millions of able bodied poor people onto the problem the able bodied what will happen at the end of this process if you compare where was this country eight years ago to where would this country be if this bill passed is we ll be more compassionate we ll be spending more money on venerable populations while not propping up a failing program from the middle of the last century that aposs what a modern 21st century policy agenda looks like if bob and the democrats want to be the party of medicaid let s let s take it inaudible woodward now wait wait a minute i mean that aposs unfair i m i m saying i m looking there s a critique of medicaid that can be made and you made it but to fix it this way when you ve got you know tens of millions of people on it and say let s oh now you can buy health insurance well that doesn t but it doesn t needham inaudible hume but isn t it well wait a minute hold on let me let me interject isn t this the age old story with entitlement programs which is to say that once you put an entitlement program in place people then turn to it and become dependent on it in a way they might not otherwise have done and then you end up in the situation you aposre always in where you ve got this exploding costs and people worried about losing it and and the and the result is you have the national debt through the roof and you can never seem to take it away holmes that s that aposs absolutely right i mean if you look at the way that health care has developed over the last 50 years in this country and has taken a significant lurch to the left and the reason it has is exactly what you just outlined is that democrats have an incremental way of getting to their ultimate goal which is socialized nationalized single payer system so you create an entitlement program for the elderly an entitlement program for the young an entitlement program for the poor and then ever expand eligibility for all three and that aposs what we ve got here today hume jen griffin look at the numbers there are 11 million more people on medicaid since obamacare was introduced it aposs been a 30 percent rise in terms of those on medicaid if you look at the cost last year the federal government spent 389 billion on medicaid in the next ten years that will go up to 650 billion these numbers are staggering hume beyond sustainable perhaps griffin the the it s perhaps unsustainable but look at where the greatest pushback in terms of the senate bill is coming from and it aposs coming from republican senators or governors who are up for re election this year or next because they know that they have hundreds of thousands of new medicaid voters on the roles who are going to lose that coverage and they are very scared of that population hume but that all right that raises this question michael let s address the politics of this let s assume for the sake of argument that they cobble together a bill along the lines of some somewhere between the house and senate bills that do these things both both do similar things with medicaid what are the political consequences in the 2018 midterms needham well i think that it depends on what the party is capable of making the compassionate case for what aposs going on i mean when you look at this there was a cruel element of barack obama aposs medicaid expansion that said the federal government is going to give more money to states for the able bodied populations that they pass ph versus the populations that are more vulnerable which cause many states to start ignoring or shifting their programs to to care more about the abled bodied than the venerable that s not compassionate that s cruel and i think that needs to be pulled back hume i understand so what you re basically saying though is if they can make the right argument they can avoid the political damage is that it needham i think they can i mean i think the biggest threat that they have is that this is not a repeal bill hume right needham and so they ve spent eight years telling people that they re going to repeal obamacare it doesn apost and they re going to have problems on their right flank about that hume so so they re going to if i have this right you got people on the right who think it doesn apost do enough to repeal and replace obamacare and and centrist republicans who have centrist constituencies who think it s going to hurt too many people how do you deal with that bob politically woodward in but the resolution here is senator mcconnell who can be the magician when it comes to putting something together to make a picture where the pieces in the puzzle don apost fit so maybe he aposs going to make it work hume josh your thoughts on that holmes no i think that aposs right i mean this this is a delicate balance it is an extremely delicate balance to get the right and the left of the party on the same page with no margin of error but i think we re i think that this bill is there and the alternative just so we re clear the alternative to 51 votes is obamacare hume yes i get that now so so what would be the consequences so we so we ve discussed the consequences of the bill passing which looked like looked difficult right politically what about the what about the consequences of not passing a bill griffin well if they don apost pass it they re going to have to go back to their constituents in 2018 and explain the republicans are going to have to explain why they didn apost do what they said they were going to do repeal and replace but i would point out that the senate bill is rather clever because the medicaid cuts come in 2021 that aposs after not only 2018 elections but also the 2020 hume so they won t kick in inaudible ok let s let s let s let aposs boil this down to a simple question which is that just in raw political terms not i mean you know without getting into the substance what s in political terms which is worse passing the bill politically or not passing it michael needham i think that politically and from a policy standpoint the world is a better place if this bill passes than if it doesn t hume jen needham there s still to be a lot of work to be done griffin i think that the republicans will be better off if it doesn apost pass than they can say that obstruction the democrats were obstructionists and washington doesn t work and they tried hume josh holmes they re going to have to pass it i mean this is a core campaign promise that has been made for the last seven years i think every republican senator ought to look hard at that and inaudible passed hume bob woodward yes but again this fantasy there is a house bill that s passed that is different and you ve got to put hume it s not that different though woodward yes well but it aposs enough that it aposs something that has to be reconciled and that s not hume ok let s assume they get that done woodward you know the there s not a magic wand that fix hume so they better pass something or not woodward well i mean who know the future we re a detective hume yes but what you re knowing at woodward inaudible hume inaudible a courageous member of our panel who is willing to admit what we journalists hate to admit is that we don t know we ve got to take a break here but when we come back the president questions whether robert mueller can be impartial in his role as special counsel plus what would you like to ask the panel about the white house decision to hold some press briefings off camera just to go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your questions on the air commercial break begin video clip trump he s very very good friends with comey which is very bothersome but he aposs also we re going to have to see robert mueller s an honorable man and hopefully he ll come up with an honorable solution end video clip hume that s president trump of course on the relationship between robert mueller and and the former fbi chief james comey which has sparked some new questions about whether mueller aposs job is on the nine we re back now with our panel bob let me get your thoughts on this it is an interesting question whether whether mueller with a at least an association with comey whom i think they regard each other as allies can fairly judge a matter that has to do with the credibility of comey s testimony versus that of the presidents your thoughts woodward and and well that s part of it but remember mueller headed the fbi for what 12 years hume yes woodward i mean it s a in the end it aposs effect driven institution and hopefully he he ll stick to the facts on this i think the problem is a practical one how many years is it going to last hume yes josh holmes you know it would be hard pressed to find somebody who s capable of doing the job here they didn apost have some kind of a relationship with jim comey over the last decade so i m less concerned with that as i am with some of the hires that is that have been made on this investigation and yes hume yes let s let s just to be to explained that he aposs hired several lawyers who have made contributions to the democratic party and would appear at least on the surface to be democrats and perhaps democrat democratic partisans holmes right yes and i the key to any good investigation is to avoid the appearance of impropriety at all cost and of course this gives critics all they need to sort of allege that this investigation is somehow off the rails now i think that remains to be true but but really if you look at it i mean nancy pelosi could be leading this investigation for all the facts that they have against donald trump and and his campaign at this point they ve got nothing and so hume you mean on terms of collusion holmes in terms of the collusion hume but what about the and jennifer what about this issue that has arisen recently about the possibility that by acting as he has trump has effectively obstructed justice in by firing comey apparently in part because of the way comey was handling this whole matter griffin well i think it s very clear from the choice of the 13 prosecutors that mueller has hired so far that he is looking at that very seriously these are people who prosecute that kind of case their between the tweets remember the special prosecutor special counsel was put into place by rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general after a tweet in which president trump said that he had tapes of the meeting with comey and so every time he tweets there aposs a reason hume is that what trigged it inaudible griffin in fact in fact there there s a reason that they say you have the right to remain silent every time he tweets and every time he gives an interview he gives ammunition to the to mueller and his team needham yes and i think the president needs to be careful that his justified frustration kind of stemming from the same exhaustion that the american people have of an investigation that just seems to be about the investigation itself doesn t create a a crime and the cover up you know there hume yes it s worth noting i i think that this investigation has never been officially described as anything other than a counterintelligence investigation which is to say that his purpose was to find out the extent of the russian aposs attempts to interfere in the election and to influence the election and it was not therefore a criminal investigation it s never been described as a criminal investigation do we all now believe that it has now become a criminal investigation woodward well we as reported in the washington post that it it is and and these investigations as you well know they mushroom they grow hume well they can woodward of well they almost inevitably do particularly hume so the so the woodward the special counsel which has a blank hume but what s the woodward it has a blank check in terms of time hume all right we ll have heard the griffin and the grand jury in alexandria that has been called so they are looking into criminal hume but what but what crime needham right hume can anybody identify the crime needham i think that s the point right hume collusion while it would obviously be alarming and highly inappropriate for the trump campaign to of which there s no evidence by the way collude with the russians it aposs not a crime so are we talking here about the president aposs firing of comey being an obstruction of justice and they ve got a grand jury on that is that what this is about griffin i think it s needham i think the question is what s the core even in whitewater which people felt eventually got over its heals there were 15 criminal conditions that came later out of whitewater including bill clinton s successor as governor i think the core question is what was the original crime that led to the investigation and any possible kind of and nobody knows what that is hume but but it wasn t it wasn t this investigation was not triggered by a crime needham exactly griffin i think a lot of the prosecutors who have been brought in specialize in corruption and money laundering and i think that some of the the some of the cases that are there what they re looking into in terms of mike flynn and paul manafort is were they taking money did they disclose that money were they acting as a foreign agent did some of the disclosures and lying to the fbi those are some of the hume so what so what it comes down to is we re talking about former participants in the trump campaign and in the case of flynn briefly in the administration being under investigation for improprieties that don apost touch the president is that woodward yes but yes and i and i think it aposs not known in their their the absence of the underlying crime is a big deal but once you get an independent counsel spun up he will feel an obligation to look at everything from his tax returns quite likely the the mystery may be solved there someday you know months or years down the road so we now i mean the it was the late justice scalia who said in one of his famous opinions for the supreme court he said imagine having an independent counsel look at your life no time limit no money limit hume right woodward it you know never hume yes nobody nobody can survive that frisk i m sure i couldn t let me just get to another question here that that that touches on this that bob and i have have talked about which is this we have had an extravaganza of coverage of this investigation not the counterintelligence piece of it but of what we imagine to be the criminal piece of it the collusion piece of it although there s not sure what ph and are we looking at a at a style and form of news coverage regarding this president that is very different from what we in journalism who came into this business came to expect jennifer your thoughts griffin well i think we re seeing very opinionated journalist and i think what s happening is the part of a country that voted for donald trump they are not buying it they are not believing it because there are too many unnamed sources what we saw this week though which with the washington post story which was a blockbuster in terms of what the obama administration knew and what they did we re seeing more and more former obama administration senior national security types come forward with their names on the record and that changed when jeh johnson testified on tuesday woodward well i i think the the whole question here is tone and well you and i going back to the 70s when we reported hume shh woodward the idea well yes i that was the calvin coolidge era wasn t it no it was the nixon era and the idea was get the facts right we had an editor a great editor at the washington post ben bradley ph who would run around at say no gloating and stay off television holmes yes i mean the opposites into trump sparked kind of a rebirth of the mainstream media in a lot of ways and feeding that beast has become a full time job and you can see i mean based on the jim comey testimony he himself pointed out four or five articles that are on the front page of major newspapers that had no basis in fact hume mike i m going to give you the last word here we ve only got about 30 seconds needham yes pete hamby ph was for a long time a reporter on the presidential campaign beat for cnn spent a year at harvard and wrote a great research paper that all journal should read called how twitter killed boys on the bus the boys on the bus being the classic book about the 1972 campaign twitter has created and the media environment has created a a kind of monster that constantly needs to be fed with scandal even if the scandal is just the president tweeting out the word covfefe ph everyone should read it hume yes yes inaudible of the independent panel thanks we ll see you next sunday up next our power play of the week a symbol of our of our nation gets a makeover watch this stay tuned commercial break hume it is a symbol of unity but for years it was slowly decaying and as we told you in november the capitol dome is like new again a very much need makeover here s chris wallace with our power player of the week begin videotape chris wallace fox anchor what kind of shape was the dome in stephen ayers the dome was in terrible shape it s a bucket of rust wallace voice over stephen ayers is the architect of the capitol and in 2014 he faced a big problem the capitol dome symbol of american democracy was falling apart the cast iron structure was built during the civil war but the project lincoln pursued to show the strength of our union was in trouble ayers there were 1 300 cracks in the dome each of them representing a water leak wallace so ayers led a 97 million restoration that took two and a half years they put up 25 levels of scaffolding around the dome one million pounds with what amounted to 52 miles of pipe ayers and we re about to enter the interstitial space the space between the inner dome and the outer dome wallace ayers took us behind the scenes to see the remarkable work his team of 1 000 did first taking off all the paint going back to the 1860s ayers on the outside of the dome there were 13 layers of lead based paint wallace then they remove the pieces that had rusted away they close those hundreds of cracks using something called a lock and stitch technique not unlike a surgeon stitching up a wound and while all that was going on they set up a half million pound scaffold to repair the separate cast iron rotunda ayers took us to the very top inside ayers from this level all the way to the ground was completely scaffolded and we took all of the paint off of the rotunda repaired all of the cast iron cracks that were in here and repainted it and took that scaffolding work down wallace finally after climbing through that space between the inner and outer domes we reach the top ayers so here we are outside wallace on camera wow ayers and this is the national mall wallace this is a view you don apost see any place else in this city wallace voice over but the decay of the dome started at the top ayers this spaces was in the worst shape in fact this balustrade was completely rusted out was completely rebuilt and shipped back wallace from up here we could see ayers new project building the platform for the january inauguration in september donald trump questioned whether they would get the dome restoration finish on time whether the scaffolding would be gone trump i told them i said why don apost you just move faster work faster wallace on camera when trump said that did you take that as a kind of challenge ayers i aposll pass wallace voice over and standing at the top of the newly restored capitol dome that sort of controversy disappears ayers n
