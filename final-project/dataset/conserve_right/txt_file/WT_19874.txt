of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the other day president trump took it into his head to buy greenland that stirred outrage and anger thankfully said danish prime minister mette frederiksen the time where you buy and sell other countries and populations is over yes we ve moved onto a more enlightened era take hong kong which is what the chinese communist party intends to do back in the last century the british did not sell that colony and its population instead they gave both away to the regime that by force of arms had conquered mainland china in the aftermath of world war ii there was a quid pro quo the people s republic of china prc promised that for 50 years the people of hong kong would retain the freedoms to which they had grown accustomed this was called a principle and it was given a name one country two systems top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds president xi jinping is now reneging on that promise hong kongers have responded with massive and prolonged protests taking to the streets by the millions risking everything in an effort to defend their distinct dynamic and endangered culture and way of life thankfully the time where free peoples are subjugated by totalitarians is over ms frederiksen didn t say in response other leaders of what we used to call the free world have been similarly silent or have uttered diplomatic mush a joint statement from the european union and canada was typical it is crucial that restraint be exercised violence rejected and urgent steps taken to de escalate the situation engagement in a process of broad based and inclusive dialogue involving all key stakeholders is essential a question to which i ve never received an adequate answer before agreeing to turn hong kong over to the chinese communists in 1997 why didn t great britain backed by its democratic allies make a serious attempt to hold a plebiscite to give the people of hong kong an opportunity to decide their future for themselves china s rulers might have been reminded that when they were admitted to the united nations they undertook certain obligations in particular the 1960 declaration on colonial independence declares all peoples have the right of self determination it adds that by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic social and cultural development the bosses in beijing would not have been pleased but they were weaker and poorer then not until 2001 was the prc admitted to the world trade organization wto with special privileges as a developing nation trade with america and europe has enriched them since foreign policy scholars were confident that increasing commerce and wealth would lead to liberalization it was a nice theory while it lasted at this point wouldn t it be inspiring if u n secretary general antonio guterres were to propose a free and fair vote so that hong kongers could exercise their acknowledged human right to self determination britain and france and other democratic members of the u n denmark perhaps could back him up what about the united states though president trump should be clear in his support for the people of hong kong it would be best if the international community were to take the lead here one reason the united states should never call for outcomes it does not seriously intend to achieve the u n by contrast does little else what s more the chinese american relationship has become complicated mr trump unlike his predecessors has been attempting to address beijing s violations of the wto its chronic theft of american intellectual property its continuing military buildup its encroachments on freedom of the seas and its abuses of the most fundamental freedoms mr trump has not consistently hit the right notes either on china or hong kong but he was correct to recently warn that a trade deal with the rulers on the mainland would be very hard to achieve if they do violence if it s another tiananmen square i think it s a very hard thing to do if there s violence not for a minute do i kid myself that mr xi will actually decide to respect the rights of the people of hong kong but if a proposal for a plebiscite were to become part of the debate he would save face by merely strategically retreating to the one country two systems pledge hong kongers would then have a few more decades to try to work out a better deal than the one they ve been saddled with the converse also is true if the west meekly accepts the prc s subjugation of hong kong as we have meekly accepted chinese communist subjugation of xinjiang where about a million uighurs have been incarcerated in concentration camps and tibet which beijing is in the process of colonizing mr xi may be encouraged to next seize not buy the free and democratic nation of taiwan that would have enormously negative ramifications in asia and beyond one last thought greenland became a danish colonial possession in the 18th century in the 20th century denmark decided to call the island an autonomous constituent country a prettier term geographically however greenland is part of north america and most greenlanders are inuit closely related to inuit of canada and alaska the people of hong kong have never had an opportunity to voice their preferences about their future at the ballot box prime minister frederiksen might consider doing better by the people of greenland clifford d may is founder and president of the foundation for defense
