tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap in the nation s capital it can be hard for protesters to stand out fifty people or even 500 holding signs and shouting hardly merit a second glance in this city of protests that s why washington activists have to get creative there s an ethos of performative prankster style protest wired into the district of columbia s history dating back decades this confrontational street theater school is flourishing with the trump administration as its nemesis each month brings new acts of political theater some confrontational some deliberately absurdist top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender it can take a serious issue into more of a playful place said robin bell who regularly projects disparaging messages onto the outside of the trump international hotel oftentimes we visualize the absurdity of the situation in january a group of activists associated with political pranksters the yes men passed out dozens of fake washington posts with detailed articles depicting president donald trump resigning and fleeing the white house for about a month last fall a robert mueller investigation themed ice cream truck roamed washington passing out free scoops with names like indictmint chip and rocky rod rosenstein while some protests are designed to get attention others hide in plain sight like easter eggs for the observant within sight of the white house a realistic looking street sign declares the street khashoggi way after jamal khashoggi the dissident saudi journalist killed inside the saudi consulate in istanbul about 10 of these signs have been scattered around washington activist claude taylor said he planted his first sign in front of the saudi embassy where it lasted 24 hours before being removed but he s pleased the sign outside the white house has lasted so long more than a month since his protest is against both khashoggi s murder and what he considers trump s soft response taylor also drives around town carrying an inflatable effigy depicting the president as a giant rat it s got to be art it s got to be creative that s what gets people hooked said adam eidinger perhaps washington s most high profile political provocateur eidinger is one of the district s public faces for marijuana legalization and is known for disruptive protests in 2017 his group passed out 1 000 joints on capitol hill but only to id carrying congressional staffers he says he still owns a small jail cell on wheels for use in political stunts eidinger lists the advantages to this sort of theatrical approach it s more enjoyable and inspiring for the participants more likely to garner media attention and go viral equally important it s more likely to annoy opponents one of the goals is to have a psychological impact to get into their heads he said he says he s been arrested 23 times although he emphasizes that usually isn t the point just getting arrested is not creative you should be willing to get arrested doing something else transgressive he said the trump administration is not the only target for these sorts of protests on thursday two female activists disrobed inside the national gallery of art to protest what they say is a lack of diversity in the artists being featured one led security on a brief chase before being subdued the national gallery of art did not respond to a request for comment a day earlier activists targeted the philippine embassy with a protest that was deliberately obscure around 7 a m several people strung swaths of red jute fabric on every tree sign and lamp post surrounding the embassy including the nearby statue of daniel webster last month this group wrapped an enormous stretch of jute around the entire embassy fence blocking both driveways it s an elaborate protest against philippine president rodrigo duterte s war on drugs in which human rights groups estimate more than 10 000 people have been killed by police and militias but there were no signs indicating that in fact given the date most passers by probably assumed it was related to valentine s day there s a deliberate mystery to what we re doing said an organizer speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid prosecution our audience is the embassy hopefully the guy at the embassy is going to be like i don t know what this is about but i better tell my boss an embassy spokesman said local authorities had been contacted but that all forms of peaceful freedom of expression are all welcome the godmother of this local protest ethos is nadine bloch a resident of the historically liberal hotspot of takoma park maryland located just over the washington line bloch s activism goes back to captaining a ship for greenpeace in the 1990s seeking to disrupt french nuclear tests both eidinger and bell credit her with helping form their own sensibilities as part of the washington action group nadine gathered all these people in the late 90s and now they re out there on their own doing it eidinger said bloch speaks of the artist activist and trains activists in a school of creative revolution known as beautiful trouble she said simple public weirdness is not enough and counsels activists to think through their goals their message and their audience a lot of people are in love with their clever tactics bloch said but if you don t know what your goal is then good luck if your message actually delivers in the institutional memory of washington s activists december 1987 stands as an iconic moment that s when posters suddenly appeared across town with a brutal assessment of president ronald reagan s attorney general edwin meese experts agree meese is a pig their origin was a local mystery at first eventually revealed to be the work of jeff nelson drummer for the washington based political hardcore band minor threat nelson said his posters weren t particularly clever or constructive but more like a vulgar scream of frustration i was just looking for some sort of megaphone to shout back said nelson now 56 and living in toledo ohio basically i did what i knew how to do which was silkscreen posters but nelson s legacy lingers when bell the
