first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds even the location of the fall meeting an annual affair that is usually under the radar ended up being controversial the nra originally planned to hold the gathering which is not open to the public or to most rank and file nra members in alaska that far flung location drew criticism among some nra members for being an unnecessary expense and a way to avoid scrutiny then just weeks ago at a cost of about 100 000 it was switched to metro washington as the nra said it was critical to be close to congress where gun restrictions are gaining some momentum marion hammer a former nra president and one of its most prominent board members acknowledged that the metro washington location will make it easier to gain access to leaders
