voters are giving sen marco rubio a second look after his surprisingly strong third place finish in iowa this week but the first term u s senator is still struggling to overcome his past support for granting illegal immigrants a path to citizenship voters searching for an alternative to sen ted cruz and businessman donald trump the top two finishers in iowa see mr rubio as a viable option confirming what pollsters have long found that mr rubio is a popular second choice that could be bad news for former florida gov jeb bush and govs john kasich of ohio and chris christie of new jersey the so called establishment candidates who were hoping to emerge as the top anti trump and anti cruz picks see also marco rubio jumps into second place in new hampshire this morning if you had asked me or yesterday i probably would have said chris christie or carly fiorina said grace freije a 63 year old teacher from manchester new hampshire now that we see the top tier are we going to vote for marco so he will go over the top of trump and cruz yes brad morrow 61 of bow said he had been eyeing mr bush but is now leaning toward mr rubio as you can tell by the early stages and the percentages in this race i certainly don t want to waste my vote on bush mr morrow said i went to bush s event here in the state and i like him said peter weeman 72 of concord i think he s great but he doesn t have the traction that rubio is gaining he said what happened in iowa says hey everybody take a look at this guy there was some good news for mr bush he placed second in a harper polling survey behind mr trump by a 31 to 14 percent margin followed by mr kasich 12 percent and mr rubio 10 percent and mr cruz 9 percent mr christie came in at 6 percent wednesday marked the first full day of campaigning for mr rubio since iowa and he made the case that he gives republicans the best chance to unify conservatives expand the party and defeat former secretary of state hillary clinton or sen bernard sanders of vermont in the general election we cannot win if we are divided mr rubio said if we are still fighting with each other in august and in september and in october nothing would make the democrats happier we must nominate someone who can unify this party quickly if we have any chance of winning the other candidates took aim at mr rubio the bush camp ran a full page ad in the state s largest newspaper touting how florida legislative leaders backed mr bush over mr rubio as former and current speakers of the house of representatives in florida a position senator rubio once held we are urging you to vote for governor jeb bush the ad said while senator rubio is a tremendous political talent he is not the best choice to serve as commander in chief we like and admire marco but as individuals who have personally witnessed the leadership of both candidates we are unequivocal in our belief that governor bush is the best choice to be our next president it remains to be seen whether the ad will slow mr rubio s momentum since iowa he has won the endorsement of sen tim scott of south carolina and raised 2 million in the hours immediately after the caucuses a campaign aide said mr rubio also received an endorsement from former sen rick santorum of pennsylvania who pulled the plug on his campaign wednesday night it is time to coalesce around the strongest candidate who will stand up for conservative values be a statesman on the world stage and has the ability to win a general election he said that is marco rubio but mr rubio continues to be dogged by his support of the 2013 gang of eight immigration bill that would have granted citizenship rights to most illegal immigrants mr rubio stumbled in the last debate as he tried to square his authorship of the bill with a 2010 campaign promise to oppose amnesty speaking at a town hall meeting in bow mr rubio said threats from the islamic state in recent months have reshaped his views on immigration the nation must enforce the laws on the books and secure the border with the help of 20 000 new border agents and finishing a fence along the u s mexico border he said after that we are not going to have amnesty mr rubio said but at a campaign stop in laconia vince merola 77 of wolfborough pressed mr rubio on how he could explain his 2013 bill given his 2010 anti amnesty promise mr rubio responded that his 2010 promise was to oppose a blanket amnesty which he said meant an effort that had previously existed to literally just hand out citizenship cards with very little impediment i did not support that then and i do not support that now mr rubio said afterward mr merola said mr rubio s answer didn t assuage him he says all the right things like they all do but i check their records and i see what he has done and what he has supported and what he hasn t supported and that bothers me mr merola told the washington times the biggest problem i have with him is that the republican party wants him and i can t stand the republican party they have given democrats and obama everything he has wanted because it is all about power and money other voters though said they saw a good general election candidate in mr rubio i just think he is the guy that can rally the republicans the conservatives said steve mcmahon of manchester he can bring people together just like he says he is not divisive like cruz is and i think he has an incredible grasp of all the issues mr mcmahon 65 said he settled on mr rubio after bouncing back and forth between him and mr christie he said at least one of his friends has done the same i think a lot of people are going to do that say why waste my vote if those guys really can t in the end get elected where he could he said copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here
