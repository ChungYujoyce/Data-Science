say mr parnas is only another questionable trump critic whom democrats are promoting ms maddow and mr schiff have been loyal supporters of the democratic party financed anti trump dossier sourced to anonymous kremlin figures the dossier made a dozen felony charges against mr trump and several of his allies two government reports last year by special counsel robert mueller and justice department inspector general michael e horowitz essentially discredited the claims sen david perdue georgia republican dismissed efforts sunday by democrats to inject the ukrainian american businessman into the impeachment proceedings as a distraction based on second hand information this is a distraction this is a person that s been indicted right now he said on nbc s meet the press he s out on bail he s been meeting with the house intel committee if the house felt this information was pertinent i would think they would have included him and his testimony in this he added that mr parnas also has personal motivations to cooperate with congressional democrats seeking to impeach president trump does mr parnas have material evidence that s the deal he s trying to make to get his sentence reduced mr perdue said i m not sure he does at all personally a favorite parnas target is rep devin nunes of california as the ranking republican on the intelligence committee mr nunes has been locked in a number of battles with mr schiff over mr trump mr nunes has termed mr schiff s ukraine centered impeachment investigation a hoax just like the trump russia conspiracy dossier at hearings he notes that mr schiff tried to obtain naked pictures of mr trump from the kremlin via a person he thought was a ukrainian politician the person on the call turned out to be a russian prankster who released a recording mr schiff subpoenaed 3 500 pages of at t phone records and released data in december that showed mr nunes spoke briefly with mr parnas the parnas document release last week showed that nunes aide derek harvey had communicated with mr parnas mr harvey inquired into whether ukrainian officials intervened in the 2016 presidential election on behalf of democratic candidate hillary clinton congressional staffers said there was nothing wrong with mr nunes committee aides interviewing potential witnesses because ukraine was suspected of election interference a house impeachment witness said ukrainian officials backed mrs clinton in 2016 before his document release and tv appearance last week mr parnas said mr nunes made a secret trip to vienna in 2018 to meet with former ukrainian prosecutor viktor shokin mr nunes branded the story as fiction he said he made no such stop during his trip to libya and malta and filed a defamation lawsuit in federal court against cnn which reported the allegation mr parnas also claimed to have had an extensive meeting with mr trump during a white house hanukkah party to plot strategy against mr biden mr giuliani who invited mr parnas to the party said they spent two minutes with mr trump at a photo op but otherwise had no meeting the parnas transition from trump supporter to accuser began with his association with mr giuliani in his role as mr trump s personal attorney mr giuliani started investigating corruption in ukraine and any role of the bidens hunter biden won a lucrative appointment to burisma holdings an oligarch owned natural gas firm in kyiv soon after his father became the obama white house s point man for directing aid to ukraine mr giuliani has readily acknowledged that he used mr parnas a florida businessman as an intermediary to meet and interview ukrainian figures the two were photographed together at various public political events mr parnas messages and notes show that he and mr guiliani were working to oust u s ambassador to ukraine marie yovanovitch whom mr trump eventually fired mr giuliani who as u s attorney in manhattan brought indictments against mobsters and stock swindlers has compiled affidavits and documents that he says show biden corruption house democrats voted to impeach mr trump on a charge that he abused his power by withholding military aid to ukraine as he pushed for an investigation into the former vice president who is now running for the democratic presidential nomination after mr schiff released the parnas file the former friend of mr giuliani appeared on ms maddow s show he provided some sensational new allegations vice president mike pence mr parnas said the vice president was aware mr trump wanted newly elected ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to announce an investigation into the bidens when mr zelensky failed to follow through on the promise mr pence canceled his plans to attend the ukrainian presidential inauguration ms maddow so you believe that mr pence s trip to the inauguration was canceled because they didn t agree mr parnas oh i know 100 i mean i know he went to poland also to discuss this on trump s behalf so he couldn t have not known absolutely mr pence told reporters traveling with him thursday in tampa florida that mr parnas claim that he was aware of outreach to mr zelensky for an investigation of the bidens was completely false the pool report said attorney general william p barr attorney general barr was basically on the team said mr parnas referring to mr giuliani and two other attorneys joe digenova and victoria toensing also on the agenda mr parnas said was reaching out to ukrainian businessman dmytro firtash who is fighting extradition to the u s the aim was to get the justice department to drop its case filed in chicago i personally did not speak to mr barr but i was involved in lots of conversations that joe digenova had with him in front of me rudy had with him in front of me and setting up meetings with dmytro firtash s team i was involved in that mr parnas said mr barr had to have known everything i mean it s impossible he said not only rudy giuliani i mean victoria and joe they were all best friends i mean barr barr was attorney general barr was basically on the team kerri kupec chief justice department spokesperson categorically denied mr parnas narrative the maddow show messaged a synopsis of mr parnas claims and ms kupec responded 100 false ms kupec tweeted a statement from september after the white house released a transcript of mr trump s july 25 phone call with mr zelensky the president has not spoken with the attorney general about having ukraine investigate anything relating to former vice president biden or his son the president has not asked the attorney general to contact ukraine on this or any other subject nor has the attorney general discussed this matter or anything relating to ukraine with rudy giuliani joe digenova and victoria toensing mr parnas said the legal couple talked with mr barr about the bidens last night on maddow show levparnas absolutely lied ms toensing tweeted joe and i never ever discussed ukraine corruption with ag barr not ever any discussion with ag was about our own client never about anything rudygiuliani was doing their own client is mr firtash the ukrainian oligarch who is fighting u s extradition on bribery charges after his 2014 arrest in vienna he hired the duo last year ms toensing said of ms maddow also not smart enough to know when inconsistent mr parnas said mr firtash was at the center of an effort by mr digenova and ms toensing to somehow discredit the mueller investigation which ended in march the washington post reported that mr digenova met with his old friend mr barr who declined to intervene in the firtash case rep devin nunes we don t have too much of a relationship mr parnas said we met several times at the trump hotel but our relationship started getting basically where it expanded was when i was introduced to his aide derek harvey mr nunes office declined to comment but after mr schiff released some of mr parnas phone calls which purportedly showed two missed calls and one eight minute call with mr nunes the congressman said in december on fox news i ve never met parnas you can t trust anything this guy says mr nunes said of mr schiff we embarrassed them with the russia hoax the last time mr parnas made an allegation against mr nunes the congressman filed a libel lawsuit against cnn mr nunes as chairman of the house intelligence committee discovered during a 2017 2018 investigation that democrats had funded the anti trump dossier he issued a report clearing the trump campaign of russia collusion he said false media stories have smeared him an msnbc analyst has accused mr nunes of being a traitor beholden to the kremlin mr nunes now is threatening legal action against rep ted lieu california democrat who on friday tweeted parts of a letter sent to him by virginia lawyer steven s biss mr biss has brought a number of nunes defamation cases including against cnn twitter and the mcclatchy newspaper chain mr lieu has accused mr nunes of conspiring with mr parnas mr biss demanded a retraction i welcome any lawsuit from your client and look forward to taking discovery of congressman nunes mr lieu said in a return jan 16 letter or you can take your letter and shove it mr lieu like his colleague mr schiff has been a prominent supporter of the discredited anti trump dossier we know that with the foreign intelligence surveillance act application the relevant parts of christopher steele s dossier were corroborated mr lieu said on cnn in august 2018 that was in the democratic memo about the fisa application we also know that as time goes on more and more parts of the steele dossier get corroborated the historical record rebuts this mr horowitz the justice department inspector general said in his dec 9 report that none of the fbi s dossier sections used to obtain a fisa wiretap was corroborated the inspector general said dossier writer christopher steele relied on a kremlin contact who later told investigators that he was simply repeating gossip to mr steele the mueller report said the fbi didn t find a trump russia election conspiracy as the dossier claimed mr parnas a soviet born u s citizen and a colleague igor fruman were arrested oct 9 by fbi agents as they were about to board a flight to europe on one way tickets they are accused of illegally funneling foreign funds into a republican political action committee and campaigns the indictment said the motive was to increase their profiles among republican political and business leaders valerie richardso
