apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion there is no amount of hyperventilating hyperbole and flat out lying that can paper over the disastrous case that house democrats have asked the senate to try in their effort to impeach president trump rep adam schiff california democrat and one of the chief architects of the fatally flawed case did his best standing in the well of the senate he condemned the senate for not issuing subpoenas he and his house colleagues refused to issue he lectured senators for not calling witnesses he himself had refused to call top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed then mr schiff harangued the senate for proceeding without regard for fairness and due process the very same fairness and due process he himself had shredded in his captain ahab like pursuit of mr trump s impeachment impeachment at any price of course mr schiff did not even try to explain how he and his fellow house democrats spent months racing for impeachment only to stall and sit on the flimsy articles for 33 days before handing them over to the senate for trial abuse of power and obstruction of congress those are not even crimes which we are reminded of every time house speaker nancy pelosi says nobody is above the law ok which law please cite the law ma am abuse obstruction mr schiff offered a new one in kicking off the senate trial a trifecta of constitutional misconduct he said mr trump s phone call with the president of ukraine contained the most serious charges ever leveled against a president he said mr trump has become a monarch something about invoking the very executive privilege that every president since george washington has invoked the only silver lining for mr schiff s oily performance was the favorable angle of the c span camera capturing his big moment in the national spotlight it was straightaway and high up in the balcony facing the senate dais since mr schiff was standing on the floor the camera failed to pick up mr schiff s prominent long and skinny neck for the entirety of his harangue of hypocrisy pencil neck concealed his pencil neck and the only times his eyes went full bug out was when he would unfortunately strain his face upward to look directly in the camera as if speaking directly to the american people viewing from home in those moments he was bug eyed but not pencil necked so a win for mr schiff in the appearance department unfortunately for him and his wife when he goes home he will still be pencil necked and bug eyed then mr schiff complained that the dry transcripts i e the actual words used to commit supposed abuse of power and obstruction of congress would not be sexy enough to win a conviction in the senate this is always the problem with courtrooms and judges and justice if the facts don t prove your case you lose totally fair technically but often feels unfair when you lose lucky for adam schiff he is incapable of embarrassment otherwise he would have been utterly humiliated by the wire brush that white house counsel pat cipollone took to him afterward by the way how funny is it that house democrats are charging mr trump with obstruction of congress i mean in these hyperpartisan times it is near impossible for any president to nose above 48 approval that seems pretty unpopular until you look at the approval numbers of congress it is worth remembering in these times that president trump is still nearly twice as popular as congress even when the camera hides mr schiff s pencil neck charles hurt can be reached at emailprotected and on twitter on ch
