 sign in long fought battle within gop ends in small victory for his loyalists manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong one way to measure rep ron paul s ascendance as a political player is to compare the cold shoulder he got from rival republican presidential candidate john mccain in 2008 with the cozier embrace he has received from 2012 presumptive nominee mitt romney when mr romney announced monday that he supports auditing the federal reserve it underscored the odd but powerful influence of the maverick congressman from texas whose years long push for a fed audit will now appear in the party platform from overseas adventurism to deficit spending to a distrust of government institutions the gospel of paul has revived long simmering debates that were muffled during the eight year tenure of president george w bush and at least on some of those issues mr paul s side appears to have gained the upper hand top stories cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens indeed with mr paul and his ardent supporters set to play a visible role in the republican national convention next week in tampa fla it s arguable that mr paul in his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns has done more to shape the party s ideology than either mr mccain or mr romney more than anything else what ron paul with these past two presidential runs has done is used the republican party presidential process as a platform to proselytize to an audience that otherwise wouldn t hear it said mark p jones chairman of the political science department at rice university in houston just north of mr paul s southeast texas congressional district final bow this weekend mr paul will walk onto then off of the political stage literally and figuratively his campaign has scheduled what it is billing as the we are the future rally to be held sunday at the university of south florida s 10 000 seat sun dome mr paul in an email to supporters this month promised his address would be the speech the republican national convention doesn t want the rest of america to hear he is retiring from congress and despite the fervent arguments of his supporters he is unlikely to win the republican party s nomination next week so what happens next most analysts are looking to mr paul s son freshman sen rand paul of kentucky who campaigned heavily for his father during the presidential primary season but the younger mr paul endorsed mr romney once it became clear that his father couldn t win a move that angered some of his father s supporters the son has been given a prime time speaking slot at the convention monday that observers said was a way of giving a nod to ron paul without having him officially speak meanwhile gary e johnson the former new mexico governor who left the gop to become the libertarian party s presidential nominee this year has pleaded with paul supporters to give him a look see just like the republican establishment who tried to silence congressman ron paul the powers that be are determined to keep the american people from hearing seeing or even having a chance to vote for gov gary johnson ron nielson mr johnson s senior campaign adviser said in an email this week to rally support they re afraid they know millions of americans if given a chance will reject the big government candidates and join the liberty movement for republicans the question of what mr paul s followers do is more pressing without their backing mr romney could have a tougher time carrying key swing states such as new hampshire and colorado those followers aren t in the best of moods many think mr romney played dirty by trying to deny mr paul more delegates and a speaking slot at the convention and paul oriented message boards have been burning up with debate about how to respond no more deals with devils one commenter wrote on dailypaul com but another shot back leaving now and giving up the voting positions you have in the gop and everything else you have gained these few years is quitting and very foolish the prophet given that level of debate within the paul movement it s amazing that someone was able to keep them all on the same page for so long that has been mr paul s chief accomplishment though the physician and 12 term lawmaker was not particularly effective in winning voters during the republican primaries he used the party s own rules to build a cadre of dedicated delegates whose influence will reverberate within the gop for years many of those followers say they weren t politically active until they came across mr paul and his message particularly his thoughts on monetary policy youtube clips of his confrontations with fed chairman ben s bernanke have drawn hundreds of thousands of views for many he is their political prophet in the same way that somebody steps into a church and makes a decision of faith and that s the preacher they were converted under they re going to stay under him until some disillusion sets in or maybe they ll widen their intellectual background or they grow up in the faith and they learn from themselves said mark edward taylor author of the book branding obamessiah which dissects barack obama s winning 2008 campaign visually mr paul does not cut the image of a political movement leader but then given who his supporters are that probably works in his favor his persona is the anti politician that was his look said mr taylor the suits were baggy the laugh was goofy his voice quivered but he was kind of the grandfatherly type you could trust he was ronald reagan with some sharp teeth he was really kind of more saintly than a slick politician and that really i think carried the trust of his true believers those fans are if nothing else loyal to a fault cafepress com an online merchandiser that sells just about every piece of political paraphernalia imaginable said paul items dominated the republican field in the early going even as other gop candidates rose and fell in fact in january mr paul s gear outsold mr romney s by better than 3 to 1 and was within striking distance of sales of obama merchandise it wasn t until june well after the gop contest was essentially over that mr paul fell back to earth ron paul has a very different effect on sales and ultimately votes than we ve seen said marc cowlin director of marketing at cafepress it s interesting to watch the people who are interested in ron paul tend to consistently come back want to hear what he has to say and consistently buy merchandise maybe just as impressive in a polarized political world is mr paul s ability to draw from all sides of the spectrum walter e block a professor at loyola university in new orleans and one of the speakers at sunday s rally said that was evident from online discussion boards where liberal blogs that usually treat republicans ideas with disdain gave mr paul a hearing that played out when looking at who supported mr paul during the gop primaries as well ron doesn t do that well among republican voters he lost to the other guys although he came in second here and there but among the uncommitted he did better than the others and among democrats he did way better mr block said moneybomb pioneer analysts said mr paul also has reshaped the way campaigns are run his moneybomb fundraisers invented by his supporters and readily adopted by the campaign have been copied by other candidates his use of gop rules to maximize delegates won at state level contests has republican party officials rethinking the way they set up the nominating primaries he has signaled to the republican party leadership the peril of having caucuses versus primaries said mr jones if ron paul has had an effect he s raised awareness within republican party circles of the liability associated with caucuses that they re much more difficult for the party elite to control beyond the people and the tactics there are his stances that once seemed fringe views but now approach party orthodoxy four years after mr paul called for shutting down entire cabinet branches in the 2012 primary season his fellow candidates competed to out slash him though in the end his pledge to cull five entire departments still bested the field in congress meanwhile where mr paul earned the monicker of dr no for his repeated votes against spending bills and much of the other annual legislation that props up the government he has been joined by an entire corps of lawmakers willing to take those stands one of those is rep paul
