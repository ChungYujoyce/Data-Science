tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion last week s state of the union widely predicted to be a boring laundry list better mailed to congress than recited with pomp and circumstance in the grand chamber of the house of representatives turned out to be quite the blockbuster for president trump it may have been a personal best he seemed preternaturally calm comfortable and confident in tweets and impromptu remarks he too often asserts and insists that changes few minds in this sotu he built arguments that open minded americans not a large cohort i realize might actually find persuasive strategic communications is a term press secretaries and public relations practitioners enjoy pronouncing but seldom understand well enough to implement this speech however was a textbook example top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens most people perceive reality through stories mr trump told one after another about patriotism about what americans have achieved about overcoming enemies about resisting the siren song of socialism about why a sovereign nation must defend its borders about welcoming those who want to come to america asking only that they not arrive as outlaws heroes personifying these tales were in the room black white hispanic jewish old young male and female ready to rise cry laugh and salute on cue for the cameras was some of it corny sure but corny can be moving and that indicates emotional impact in an era when so many people feel rather than think that s a mission politicians need to accomplish usually when it comes to tugging at heartstrings the left is more skilled than the right but what were those color coordinated progressive women attempting to communicate to the folks out there in tv land puzzling over that question i happened upon an obscure treatise containing this passage the vestal virgin has forever been an image of a woman draped in white priestly garments carrying herself with an air of purity and near divinity ok time now to turn to president trump s one slip into obamanian thinking great nations do not fight endless wars he declared but of course they do because great powers have enemies always have always will as mr trump knows the enemies who currently want to diminish or defeat america include an ascendant china a declining russia a jihadist islamic republic of iran and any number of non state terrorist groups if we stop fighting them will they stop fighting us no they will march forward probing with their bayonets so long as they feel mush they will proceed only if they hit steel will they halt a great nation that lacks the will and endurance of its enemies soon ceases to be a great nation the most obvious example following world war i an exhausted british empire adamantly sought to avoid further conflicts so british leaders turned a blind eye as nazi germany not exhausted by the great war re armed and achieved military superiority british leaders told themselves that hitler was a reasonable man that he could be appeased that he would compromise that he preferred peace to war endless or not winston churchill knew that was bunk he spoke out forcefully and he was reviled as a war monger the avoidable war was what he would later call world war ii adding if the allies had resisted hitler strongly in the early stages he would have been forced to recoil i was not alone in being troubled by president trump s unsupported theory about great nations and endless wars the wall street journal pointed out that withdrawing u s forces can invite war that s the lesson of barack obama s 2011 withdrawal of troops from iraq while claiming the tide of war is receding jihadists used the reprieve to form islamic state and by 2014 mr obama was re sending thousands of troops to the same theater staying would have been far less costly marc thiessen a columnist for the washington post wrote america s enemies have a very clear definition of victory for them victory comes when we give up the fight before they do we know this because they have told us so the 9 11 mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed told his cia interrogator americans don t realize we do not need to defeat you militarily we only need to fight long enough for you to defeat yourself by quitting no one is arguing that americans need to fight all the time and everywhere a strategic approach to war fighting requires choosing one s battles if enemies can be deterred they may not need to be defeated but as president reagan understood and president trump sometimes seems to understand peace through strength means making sure and making clear that we are much stronger than our enemies and that we don t lack stamina that doesn t necessarily imply remaining in syria where a small contingent of highly skilled troops has been demolishing the islamic state and helping contain the islamic republic of iran or afghanistan where for years u s forces have expanded and contracted while goals and strategies remained nebulous it does imply however that mr trump erred by signaling how eager he is to withdraw from afghanistan while ambassador zalmay khalilzad was in talks with the taliban whether it is wise to negotiate with such jihadist groups is a question we ll leave for another day when great britain tired of being great when global leadership became too burdensome it passed the torch to america more than half a century later why shouldn t america pass the torch again because today sadly there is no good nation that is strong enough and no strong nation that is good enough clifford d may is president of the foundation for defense of democracies and a columnist for the washing
