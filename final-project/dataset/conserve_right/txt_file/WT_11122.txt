ted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion establishment republican candidates for president backed by fox news the wall street journal and former vice president richard cheney want to restore the bush administration s foreign policy raising the pentagon budget and adopting a more aggressive stance around the world regardless of who is president tough talk military spending and more americans in harm s way cannot stop china from overawing the western pacific russia from bending eastern europe to its will or islamists from beheading americans to secure our peace requires following theodore roosevelt s recipe speak softly and carry a big stick use it sparingly but so fashion your stick and use it so that those whom you hit can cause you no further trouble by contrast establishment republicans promise to double down on our bipartisan foreign policy of loud words unrealistic ends and incompetent means a combination that has convinced the world that america is ripe for the taking sen marco rubio for example speaks of support ing the spread of economic and political freedom by reinforcing our alliances resisting efforts by large powers to subjugate their smaller neighbors and advanc ing the rights of the vulnerable he sees such things as the human face of america s influence in the world that is the definition of speaking loudly mr rubio wants to be tougher against the islamists as well as against the chinese and russians while increasing military spending but he seems not to realize that no one has ever been impressed much less killed by percentages of gross domestic product like george w bush his recipe for stopping the islamists seems to be sending americans endlessly to drive around the middle east s replenished minefields nor can mere military spending convince the chinese that they cannot treat the south china sea as sovereign territory doing that and avoiding war with china would take u s military equipment and plans designed to win such a war there is no evidence that mr rubio any more than the bushies or obama ites thinks about what it would take to do what top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots the wall street journal rightly worrying that china s de facto seizure of the world s busiest shipping lanes portends the greatest trouble for america and noting that china has ballistic missiles that can target ships advocates building a bigger u s navy to send into the area to challenge china s claim fine but the journal s editorial board seems not to notice that we americans have zero means of protecting ships or bases and above all the united states itself from missiles fired from china we do not have serious missile defense because republicans from henry kissinger to george w bush have quietly agreed with the democrats historic demands that we not build strategic defenses against china or russia challenging china s looming land based dominance of the western pacific while we are unable to protect against china s ballistic missiles courts disaster nevertheless the journal toes the establishment line on missile defense mr cheney wants to send a signal to vladimir putin by putting token american troops in eastern europe but russia s hierarchy leaves no doubt that it backs its moves with nuclear weapons while mr cheney as secretary of defense and vice president decided to leave america naked to russian missiles if russia moved against these americans they would have to surrender some signal america s adversaries know they have nothing to fear from establishment republicans by contrast tea party republicans are heirs to a legacy of foreign policy that stretches from washington and adams to lincoln and theodore roosevelt intellectually several notches above the establishment ben carson ted cruz and rand paul are also rooted in the american people s common sense commitment to squaring ends with means reach with grasp just as prudent americans do in private life tea party presidents would make commitments only after having planned and equipped for whatever it would take to fulfill them if a tea party president had committed to destroying the islamic state it would long since have ceased to exist whereas recent foreign policy has consisted of big commitments to the interests of others pursued with insufficient force tea party presidents would commit to defend america s own interests with whatever force might be required to succeed quickly they would react to china s military preparations to exclude us from the western pacific by tailoring a military force to secure that access a serious missile defense for america would top the list today s confrontations between tougher and softer interventionism and isolationism between moralism and realism are sterile tired of pretense americans yearn for foreign policy as defined by george washington choose peace or war as our interest
