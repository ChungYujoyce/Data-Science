the trade agreement between the united states and china that was announced saturday at the g20 conference in buenos aires the main outcome of the deal between presidents donald trump and xi jinping is that the united states won t escalate the trade war on january 1 the date when tariffs on billions of dollars of chinese imports were set to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent instead those tariffs will remain in place but at the current lower rate that s surely good news and it s the first indication since the u s china trade war began in july that the two countries both want to reach a truce still describing this as an agreement or even indeed as a truce is probably giving it too much credit trump and xi have agreed to avoid further escalation but there is nothing in the read outs provided by each nation that indicates a move towards reducing the current tariffs that have caused significant economic pain by raising prices for american manufacturers and by reducing american markets for chinese exporters take for example what the white house is holding up as a major part of the deal that china will agree to purchase a not yet agreed upon but very substantial amount of agricultural energy industrial and other product s from the united states to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries that s vague and rather unenforceable language it also shows that trump continues to be fixed on the so called trade deficit which has increased since his chinese tariffs were imposed in july and sits at a record 300 billion over the first nine months of the year it s unlikely that a one time boost in purchasing american exports will change that and it s not at all clear that china will be able to pressure domestic businesses into making those purchases while the tariffs it erected against american farm products are still in place for a look at what else the two sides have agreed to check out this handy side by side from bloomberg reporter peter martin confused about what exactly xi and trump promised each other yesterday here s a side by side comparison of the readouts from both sides the u s on the left china on the righthttps t co 5n7aisedew lucilleliu jdmayger jeffrey black pic twitter com kvvcb8wiqi peter martin petermartin pcm december 2 2018 the lack of specificity is not limited to the promise that china will purchase more agricultural goods throughout the entire agreement about the only quantifiable detail is the promise that america will go ahead and increase tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent in 90 days if a better deal is not reached but as trade lawyer and cato institute scholar scott lincicome points out with no joint statement and list of actual concrete deliverables how will both sides and the public measure success or failure in 90 days the white house wants this agreement to be seen as a first step towards a real trade deal and as evidence that its tariffs are bringing china to the negotiating table but the details here suggest that saturday s deal is a strategic retreat by the trump administration trump gets a small political win and china gets to delay further escalation of the trade war by making vague promises about trying to buy more american farm goods that s exactly what china wants because time is on its side as the costs of the trade war continue to pile up for american businesses and if the recent stock market wobbles turn into something worse xi will be in a stronger bargaining position relative to trump who will face mounting political pressure to abandon the tariffs if there aren t solid results to show for them delaying those 25 percent tariffs on chinese imports will help american businesses and consumers but it s too soon to determine if that delay brings us closer to the end of the trade war or if we re merely entering a temporary lull in hostilities next sec goes after cryptocurrency influencers starting with dj khaled and floyd mayweather

wash my hand after eating from that jar of honey huh when you re in a hole the first thing to do is stop digging no no dig up stupid trump wins thanks to aggressive trade negotiations canada and mexico cracked the eu cracked finally the last major holdout china cracked i am sure that reason staff will continue to say that trade negotiation tactics tariffs cannot successfully be used to lower trade restrictions overall i oppose trump on his trade policy the enormous benefit of cheap goods flowing into the u s from china is too much to risk for pretty much any reason other than self defense during wartime i oppose playing risky games with trade policy even if trump gambled and won if we stupidly bet our life savings on a single hand of blackjack that doesn t suddenly become a smart thing to do in retrospect because we won on the other hand because betting the farm on a single hand of blackjack is stupid that doesn t mean i hope we lose either it is possible to win and on behalf of myself my fellow americans and the red white and blue i hope we do win over my objections and after we win i hope no american president ever does such a stupid thing again but just because i don t like what president trump did doesn t mean i hope he loses rather i hope i m wrong just like i wanted to be wrong about the iraq war i hope president trump is wildly successful and proves me wrong if the trump gamble pays off good enough no us president would ever have to do again i doubt we will get to free trade since that was rejected by our trading partners after trump offered it it would be a mistake for our trading partners and potential trading partners to think that the usa would never try a renegotiate a batter trade deal that s like businesses never renegotiating contracts to get better terms when the contract comes up for renewal business is not run like that if the trump gamble pays off good enough no us president would ever have to do again what one president does another can and will undo the senate ratifies treaties dum dum did you read your own writing if the trump gambit and us president you think no other president can do the same as trump how much of the constitution have you actually read poor trolls they spend so much time on their comments just to be ignored ask hihn how upset that makes him being ignored by you responding poor trolls don t even know when they are being talked over and not responded to its a tell of their poor grasp of american english it requires one more step than a pen and cell phone this the conventional wisdom from everyone seems to be that at least with respect to china trump is serious about protectionism he believes in its economic premises he believes that the business of the federal government should be to actively promote american business in its policies and he believes that china is an economic enemy that is being unfair and should rightly be punished and crushed in a show of the economic flag of course all of that is exactly what you want everyone to believe if you are playing the trade war game with china crazy bastard he really believes it all so far it is flawless in terms of making everyone think that he is serious whether or not he is he certainly wants everyone to think he is the press the public all of industry etc you sound like a 15 d underwater chess foil hat if you conjecture otherwise and i d agree with that one very significant disadvantage of course of making everyone think you re nuts is that you don t inspire confidence from industry in future business conditions and you re going to see that in the economy i think trump figures he has enough time to take that hit he s probably right trump will never get credit for using the media tds hysteria to help him without them wanting to help him the weakest part of trump s strategy was convincing china that trump was unstoppable in his trade policy mission the media clearly has convinced chinese leaders that trump does not give a fuck and they should cave before hitler makes it worse for the chinese goes to show what information sources many countries use to form policy they clearly use propaganda from the us media what could go wrong with making the us dependent on emperor for life xi the usmca is worse than nafta and it s hardly true free trade by your definition by your definition usmca is a trade war because it still contains tariffs it s a trade deal not free trade you should be freaking out and demanding punishing tariffs against canada and mexico instead of praising your lord and savior in the white house try some intellectual consistency for once do you need me to link the rules of nafta and uscma so you can compare and contrast the worseness for us no we ve already done that usmca is worse more content controls higher tariffs intrusive minimum wage and environmental controls why don t you show us where usmca is better your link fell off propaganda does not work here troll what you don t even know what s in usmca someone has to point it out to you yes i do need you to follow through and link the rules of nafta and uscma so you can compare and contrast the worseness for us please do so show us the error of our ways citation promised now deliver figures troll you wont do work to support your position loveconstitution1789 12 3 18 10 20am do you need me to link the rules of nafta and uscma so you can compare and contrast the worseness for us if you had a handy link to a chart comparing them i would also appreciate seeing it thanks switch back to your other sock and discuss both policies i am not doing your work for you you asked if we wanted you to provide links carry on maga it s been discussed ad nauseum nafta was better according to everyone except trump sycophants like you and the usmca is not true free trade tariffs still exist that makes it a trade war according to you why are you praising a deal that is a trade war i thought you settled for nothing less than true free trade justify that or admit you re a dishonest troll no it has not liar reason cherry picks you have never compared and contrasted nafta vs uscma ever you re even worse than usual just go back to begging your liver to give you more time it s not true free trade you said many many times that you only support true free trade you mocked trade agreements and not being true free trade yet you can t praise the usmca enough why becuase trump trump trump and because you re a liar and a troll and an intellectually dishonest loser misquotes lies ignorance of trade policy and strategies sarcasmic at your service follow through on providing linkage nope that s lc1789 for ya so you re not going to justify your insistence that the existence of any tariffs at all equal trade war your mockery of trade agreements as not being free trade that you will only accept zero tariffs on both sides because that is true free trade and that you heart usmca even though it is unacceptable and worthy of mockery by your own definitions instead you re going to insist that i dig out comments where you said those exact things and then you ll deny or call me names i expected nothing less got sarcasmic collecting too much spittle in the corner of his mouth he needs his lunch break to wipe the foam off and rally his sockpuppets he still wont compare and contrast nafta and uscma though he still wont compare and contrast nafta and uscma though umm pretty sure it was you who promised to do that let me check yep you were supposed to provide the link that compared them stupid little ruskie troll doesn t even know how to do his job not everyone s objective was freer trade trump s nafta gambit is about gaming the system to favor u s labor at the expense of workers in canada and mexico and at the expense of u s consumers to the extent that i favor trump s revisions it s only because i fear that the alternative is the total destruction of nafta with no replacement at all not everyone is as sanguine on free trade as my fellow libertarians and unfortunately they vote too expecting to get a libertarian free trade from non libertarians is like expecting i dunno an immaculate conception that we got nafta in the first place certainly seems like a miracle just for the record trump gave notice that he was withdrawing from nafta the other day it s unclear whether he can do that without congress approval but it s just a way to pressure congress to pass his revisions the alternative to revising nafta is not nafta as trump would have it the alternative to nafta is nothing nafta codified us law it would appear that nafta is codified into us law so trump can possibly give notice of withdrawing from nafta as per nafta rules but congress would likely have to repeal the applicable us laws a democrat congress would likely fight trump and this and we would end up with nafta sitting on the books but not enforced since a new trade treaty would be in effect while i agree with you about trump s probably end game he did offer free trade that was rejected by our trading partners he probably did know that they would reject the offer anyway so he gained the upper hand by being able to offer it without having to actually get the senate to ratify it i think trump s negotiations taking less than 6 months to crack the eu mexico canada and china clearly shows that getting nafta was not a miracle the usa is such an awesome market that countries quickly cave to demands for lowering trade restrictions when they have a tougher time reaching that market nafta could have been better as evidenced by all the rules that it does have maybe nafta was the best the usa could get at the time who knows we do know that trump is able to get china canada mexico and the eu to go from refusing to negotiate at all to giving trump and the usa quite a few concessions but to some people trump s results are 100 random not well planned strategies that partially worked trump could drop tariffs unilaterally to zero as easily as he could boost them that he doesn t shows he and you and the other trumpistas would rather abridge individual liberty to showcase his power than actually drop tariffs to zero that you and trumpistas in general pretend this is in support of theoretical zero tariffs in a theoretical far future shows your economic illiteracy he could drop our tariffs to zero not those of our trading partners he said he was for reciprocal zero tariffs not unilateral zero tariffs maga dum dum constitution strikes again the usmca is a worse trade deal than nafta the fact that you continue to deny it is just another indication of your economic illiteracy and trump infatuation your citation fell off also your comparing and contrasting comment fell off too convince us you wont even try you re the one who asked if we wanted your linkage go ahead and deliver but you won t any more than trump will because you re an always trumper while you re at it show how trump s managed trade is better for my individual liberty than simply unilaterally reducing tariffs to zero and leave the liberty restrictions to foreigners maga maga ah yes the mating call of trumpus dickus suckus they are annoying little animals that are known extreme stupidity and bright red plumage on the tops of their heads poor trolls like sarcasmic they hate hate hate that trump cracked china mexico canada and the eu in less than 6 months note too that trumpus dickus suckus are shameless liars that lie without shame no citation sarcasmic trolling again you re the trumpista who asked if we wanted linkage several of us said yes you haven t done so yet you are as full of empty promises as trump maga maga dittos after tony you re the biggest tard on this site live long and prosper my friend your idiocy is a never ending source of hilarity for us the assiduous followers of reason who don t bother commenting usually that s probably the best takeaway from the trade agreement between the united states and china that was announced saturday at the g20 conference in buenos aires there was no trade agreement announced on saturday at the g20 trump promised to delay the implementation of tariffs on another 200 billion in chinese goods pending the outcome of further negotiations apparently with a trump imposed time limit of 60 days that isn t a trade agreement that s an agreement to negotiate a trade agreement still describing this as an agreement or even indeed as a truce is probably giving it too much credit some people might even describe it as a straw man still describing this as an agreement or even indeed as a truce is probably giving it too much credit ya his most faithful lemmings just need a turd for him to polish and plant a flag in signalling he hasn t completely shit the bed but that he just peed a lot and left some skid marks in it they ll call it a great victory if he so much as sits down with xi and the word trade is uttered regardless of the result the rest of the rational people out there are waiting for a real agreement if you want to take a cheap shot at trump for this why not go after this unfortunate misuse of terms my meeting in argentina with president xi of china was an extraordinary one relations with china have taken a big leap forward president trump http twitter com realdonaldt 5199482881 i guess that means relations with china are starving to death has trump ever used the phrase leap forward let alone a big one before not to my knowledge methinks it was intentional if so the question is why i think it s likely he wasn t clear on the meaning of the term though he d heard it before and he was speaking from the hip one other curious observation about trump s tweets in regards to china today president xi and i have a very strong and personal relationship he and i are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great nations a solution for north korea is a great thing for china and all president trump http twitter com realdonaldt 4180324352 when this trade war started people in the trump administration were saying that it was in no small part about pressuring china to use their influence with north korea to put a halt to its nuclear weapons program the fat kid was summoned to beijing ahead of his talks with trump and seemed to use whatever influence they had to at least make north korea say all the right things on camera for the north korean summit once again here s to hoping trump is wildly successful in this trump deserves to be chastised for his reckless and wrongheaded trade policies and negotiation strategies even if he s successful everybody who hopes he fails however should be ashamed of themselves and we all know you re out there hell that probably describes more than half of the white house press corp never trumpers will never admit that trump was even slightly successful in his strategies relating to trade and nk they certainly will never acknowledge that trump and his advisors did it not only without them but while they were actively trying to undermine the negotiations when will any always trumper admit that trump is trashing other people s individual rights not a one ever has they all are glad he s doing it they prattle on and on about the end goal but won t admit that the means is trampling individual rights trolls trolls everywhere trolls loveconstitution1789 12 3 18 10 20am do you need me to link the rules of nafta and uscma so you can compare and contrast the worseness for us maga this agreement will not be given any play this week as a trump victory because the media is too busy slavering over the memory of america s greatest one term president trump deserves to be chastised for his reckless and wrongheaded trade policies and negotiation strategies even if he s successful i e even if trump is successful exactly as predicted by his supporters i will dogmatically cling to my theories that predicted otherwise more to the point trade deficit is a meaningless statistic dreamed up to scare people you may as well discuss and ponder my trade deficit with the grocery store and car dealer and my employer s trade deficit with me if you have a trade deficit with everyone you ve got a problem reason thinks there can be no downside to sending dollars to emperor xi because all he can do with them is invest in america what he can do is purchase america ownership is control i do not wish america to become a company town of emperor xi maga fira fuck individual rights always trolls trolls everywhere trolls where s that linkage you promised guess you keep your promises as well as butt plug trolls rack up website traffic but they dont donate shit to reason it s fascinating how all these trumpistas promise better results later while bragging about his liberty restrictions now as if that is their trade off to make on everyone else s behalf the end justifies the means and all that i have not heard a single trumpista ever admit that they enjoy restricting my liberty but of course all of them whined when obama and others did it as opposed to just whining all the time so productive it s unlikely that a one time boost in purchasing american exports will change that and it s not at all clear that china will be able to pressure domestic businesses into making those purchases while the tariffs it erected against american farm products are still in place maybe boehm isn t clear on how the chinese economy works it fits with his
