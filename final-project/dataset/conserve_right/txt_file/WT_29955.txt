people dead by the time bremner signed on again on monday morning another man with a gun had stormed an entertainment district in dayton ohio killing nine though his motive remains unknown bremner s show carries just one current of the heated national debate on race that has been fanned by trump s unrepentant use of white identity politics and inflamed by white supremacist violence like the shooting in el paso in interviews with the associated press across a half dozen states voters see a country riven by racial animus better than a generation ago but worse than before trump s presidency with little choice but to confront the long struggle anew months ago bremner who considers himself a moderate tried to establish whether his listeners could agree on a fundamental question what is racism the answer he realized is no they don t even agree on that racial and ethnic polarization has been a hallmark of trump s political career he s warned of an invasion at the southern border and attacked democratic rep elijah cummings largely black district as a rat and rodent infested mess trump needs to maximize support from white voters in places like erie county which chose president barack obama twice then flipped for trump and helped narrowly deliver him the key state of pennsylvania jim noland who lives in a rural town near erie cheers trump on through nolan s lens trump s messages aren t racist they re truth before you just wouldn t disagree with democrats because you were afraid of being called a racist he said and now you disagree with them because their ideas are bad and that s enough when they call you a racist back you can laugh he dismissed any link between trump s rhetoric and the el paso shooting suspect s manifesto lucinda rodriguez the daughter of a

she s increasingly fearful amid an environment where people spew hate with ease but myles sees no way to understand his motives away from the visceral responses of el paso and dayton the response has largely cleaved along politically polarized lines talina massey in new bern north carolina has little problem steering responsibility to the oval office and an occupant she sees as deliberately

young white man d j smith wandered into a democratic political meeting in erie and said he was sorry he voted for trump because he d always been republican hadn t paid much attention to politics and never thought much about race but then suddenly he did it occurred to him that he had not needed to pay heed before because he was white and male and the country generally worked in his favor i had an am i the bad guy moment i realized that i was and i started to open up my eyes the 29 year old said he probably made racist jokes in the past he thought and said insensitive things he was consumed by remorse for voting for a man who exploits americans ugliest impulses for political gain smith quit his job he could not conceive of going on as normal as the nation convulses he said and started
